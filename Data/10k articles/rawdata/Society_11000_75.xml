      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3554">'''Al-Mansur Ali I''' (1738 – 25 October 1809) was an [[Imam]] of [[Yemen]] who ruled in 1775–1809. He belonged to the [[Qasimid]] family, descended from the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]], which dominated the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[imamate]] in 1597–1962.

==Early reign==

Ali bin Abbas was one of about 20 sons of Imam [[al-Mahdi Abbas]] (d. 1775). During the reign of his father he was governor of [[San'a]]. He led a number of successful military expeditions against warring tribes. After his father's death he successfully claimed the imamate, taking the name al-Mansur Ali. His first twenty years in power were marked by periodical petty wars with unruly tribesmen. In particular a [[Sayyid]] called Ibn Ishaq (d. 1805) raised the standard of rebellion and claimed the imamate from 1781 to 1785, assisted by Arhab tribesmen. Al-Mansur Ali I managed to deal with these crises.&lt;ref&gt;Husain ibn Abdullah al-Amri, ''The Yemen in the 18th and 19th Centuries; A Political and Intellectual History''. London 1985, pp. 35-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Wahhabi movement==

Events in other parts of [[Arabia]] led to severe losses for the Zaidi state after 1800. The religious [[Wahhabi]] movement expanded rapidly in the [[Hijaz]]. The semi-independent ruler of Abu Arish in the [[Tihamah]], Sharif Hamud (d. 1818), was attacked in 1803 by the pro-Wahhabi chief of Upper [[Asir]], Abu Nuqta. Defeated in battle, Sharif Hamud submitted to the Wahhabis. As a vassall of the latter, he committed himself to break off relations with al-Mansur Ali I. During the next three years he conquered the Tihamah from the imam, while Abu Nuqta performed raids into the territory still loyal to the Zaidi state. Al-Mansur Ali I prepared an expedition to Tihamah in 1806, but it never got underway; the event indicates the weakness of the Zaidi imamate at this time. Sharif Hamud, however, fell out with the Wahhabi regime in 1808, and in the next year he killed Abu Nuqta in an assault.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 127-9; Husain ibn Abdullah al-Amri, pp. 50-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The end of the reign==

The character of al-Mansur Ali I is debated among the chroniclers. The well-known religious scholar [[Muhammad ash-Shawkani]], who was his grand [[qadi]], wrote favourably of him, while other texts assert that he left governance to his ministers and kept busy with building activities and womanizing. On the other hand, he was considered brave, generous and hospitable. By the early 19th century his faculties began to fail, and intrigues arose at court while chaos reigned in the land. The [[Vizier|wazir]] Hasan al-Ulufi who kept the real powers in San'a was arrested by the old imam's son Ahmad, who took over the administration in 1808. He managed to appease the dissatisfied tribesmen who had performed raids around San'a. When al-Mansur Ali I died in the next year, his son became ruler in name, as [[al-Mutawakkil Ahmad]].&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjean &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Allied Media Conference began in 1999 in [[Bowling Green, Ohio]] as the Midwest Zine Conference, hosted by [[Clamor (magazine)|Clamor Magazine]], with a focus on [[do-it-yourself]] media strategies that can be used for social change&lt;ref&gt;Christina Dunbar-Hester. “‘Being a Consistent Pain in the Ass’: Politics and Epistemics in Media Democracy Work.” ''Journal of Information Policy'', vol. 4, 2014, pp. 547–569. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.4.2014.0547.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://michronicleonline.com/2018/06/01/detroit-institute-of-arts-hosts-media-conference-opening-ceremony-with-metoo-founder-tarana-burke/|title=DIA hosts media conference opening ceremony with #MeToo founder|last=Michigan Chronicle Staff|date=|work=Michigan Chronicle|access-date=3 Dec 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The name was later changed to the Underground Publishing Conference, and in 2002 was formally incorporated as an organization and renamed as the Allied Media Conference. In 2006, Clamor Magazine ceased publication and a five-person collective moved the conference and the organization to Detroit, where it continues to be based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Allied Media Conference |url=http://www.zinewiki.com/Allied_Media_Conference |website=Zine Wiki: The Independent Media Wiki |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Allied Media Conference to be held in Detroit was in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hartman |first1=Kat |title=Allied Media Projects and the global relevance of Detroit's grassroots tech scene |url=http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/16yrsofAMP061714.aspx |website=modelD |accessdate=2 December 2018 |date=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the participants and staff of Allied Media, including its director Jeanette Lee, came to Detroit originally as part of [[Detroit Summer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uixdetroit.com/people/jennylee.aspx|title=Jenny Lee|last1=Lewan|first1=Amanda|website=Detroit Urban Innovation Exchange|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move to Detroit led to more young people, queer people, people of color and low-income communities participating in the conference. In 2016, 65% of participants identified as a [[person of color]], 50% as [[LGBTQ]], and 26% as under 25 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Background |url=https://www.alliedmedia.org/amc/background |website=Allied Media Projects |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2018, after it's 20th year, the conference leadership decided to take a one year hiatus, dubbed a "[[Chrysalis]] Year."

== Impact ==
Allied Media Conference The FemTechNet Collective, a group of [[Feminism|feminist]] scholars focused on critical study of science and technology, has held network gatherings in conjunction with the Allied Media Conference, amplifying the reach of this group.&lt;ref&gt;Collective, FemTechNet.

''Project MUSE'', muse.jhu.edu/article/690808.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual Allied Media Conference has served as a space for women organizing around [[Prison abolition movement|prison abolition]] to meet, organize, and strategize how their institutions can contribute to prison abolition.&lt;ref&gt;Lawston, Jodie M. &amp; Meiners, Erica R."Ending Our Expertise: Feminists, Scholarship, and Prison Abolition."

{{As of|2016|8}}, neither the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] nor the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] has yet officially approved the term as a recognized subdivision of [[Geologic time scale|geological time]],&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Subcomission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, ICS » Working Groups |url = http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/ |website = quaternary.stratigraphy.org |accessdate = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gixmodo001" /&gt; although the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)]], voted to proceed towards a formal [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|golden spike (GSSP)]] proposal to define the Anthropocene epoch in the [[Geologic time scale|Geologic Time Scale]] and presented the recommendation to the [[International Geological Congress]] on 29 August 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth |title= The Anthropocene epoch: scientists declare dawn of human-influenced age|first= Damian |last= Carrington|date= 29 August 2016|work= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= August 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various different start dates for the Anthropocene have been proposed, ranging from the beginning of the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] 12,000–15,000 years ago, to as recent as the [[Trinity test]] in 1945. {{As of|2018|02}}, the ratification process continues and thus a date remains to be decided definitively, but the latter date has been more favored than others.

The most recent period of the Anthropocene has been referred to by several authors as the [[Great Acceleration]] during which the socioeconomic and earth system trends are increasing dramatically, especially after the [[Second World War]]. For instance, the [[Geological Society]] termed the year 1945 as ''The Great Acceleration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/anthropocene|title=The Anthropocene|publisher=The Geological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
An early concept for the Anthropocene was the [[Noosphere]] by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], who in 1938 wrote of "scientific thought as a geological force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.larouchepac.com/_the_anthropocene|title='The Anthropocene' viewed from Vernadsky's Noosphere|date=29 February 2016|publisher=Larouche Pac}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in the [[Soviet Union]] appear to have used the term "anthropocene" as early as the 1960s to refer to the [[Quaternary]], the most recent [[Period (geology)|geological period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Akademii͡a nauk SSSR|title= Doklady: Biological sciences sections, Volumes 132-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=URL?

In 2008, the Stratigraphy Commission of the [[Geological Society of London]] considered a proposal to  make the Anthropocene a formal unit of geological epoch divisions.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz08"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Zalasiewicz |first= Jan |title = Are we now living in the Anthropocene? |journal = [[GSA Today]] |volume = 18 |issue = 2 |pages= 4–8 |year = 2008 |url = http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/18/2/pdf/i1052-5173-18-2-4.pdf |doi = 10.1130/GSAT01802A.1|display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the commission decided the proposal had merit and should be examined further.

[[File:Trinity Test Fireball 16ms.jpg|thumb|The [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] in 1945 has been proposed as the start of the Anthropocene.]]
In January 2015, 26 of the 38 members of the International Anthropocene Working Group published a paper suggesting the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945 as the starting point of the proposed new epoch.&lt;ref name=trinity&gt;"[http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2015/01/16/was-first-nuclear-test-dawn-of-new-human-dominated-epoch-the-anthropocene/ Was first nuclear test the start of new human-dominated epoch, the Anthropocene?]" [[University of California, Berkeley]] News Centre, 16 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, a significant minority supports one of several alternative dates.&lt;ref name=trinity /&gt; A March 2015 report suggested either 1610 or 1964 as the beginning of Anthropocene.&lt;ref name="Lewis &amp; Maslin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lewis |first1= Simon L. |last2= Maslin |first2= Mark A. |title= Defining the Anthropocene |journal= Nature |volume= 519 |date= March 2015 |pages= 171–180 |url= http://www.realtechsupport.org/UB/MCC/Lewis_DefiningAnthropocene_2015.pdf |doi= 10.1038/nature14258 |bibcode= 2015Natur.519..171L |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151224052554/http://www.realtechsupport.org/UB/MCC/Lewis_DefiningAnthropocene_2015.pdf |archivedate= 2015-12-24 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars point to the [[diachronous]] character of the physical strata of the Anthropocene, arguing that onset and impact are spread out over time, not reducible to a single instant or date of start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Diachronous beginnings of the Anthropocene: The lower bounding surface of anthropogenic deposits |url= http://anr.sagepub.com/content/2/1/33 |journal= The Anthropocene Review |date=1 April 2015 |issn= 2053-0196 |pages= 33–58 |volume= 2 |issue= 1 |doi = 10.1177/2053019614565394 |first1= Matt |last1= Edgeworth |first2= Dan deB |last2= Richter |first3= Colin |last3= Waters |first4= Peter |last4= Haff |first5= Cath |last5= Neal |first6= Simon James |last6= Price}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2016 report on the climatic, biological, and geochemical signatures of human activity in sediments and ice cores suggested the era since the mid-20th century should be recognised as a distinct geological epoch from the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The Anthropocene is functionally and stratigraphically distinct from the Holocene |url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6269/aad2622 |journal = Science |date = 8 January 2016 |issn = 0036-8075 |pmid = 26744408 |pages = aad2622 |volume = 351 |issue = 6269 |doi = 10.1126/science.aad2622 |first = Colin N. |last = Waters |first2 = Jan |last2 = Zalasiewicz |first3 = Colin |last3 = Summerhayes |first4 = Anthony D. |last4 = Barnosky |first5 = Clément |last5 = Poirier |first6 = Agnieszka |last6 = Gałuszka |first7 = Alejandro |last7 = Cearreta |first8 = Matt |last8 = Edgeworth |first9 = Erle C. |last9 = Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anthropocene Working Group met in Oslo in April 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument for the Anthropocene as a true geologic epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/|title= Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy – Working Group on the 'Anthropocene'|publisher= [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]|accessdate= 28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence was evaluated and the group voted to recommend "Anthropocene" as the new geological age in August 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Should the International Commission on Stratigraphy approve the recommendation, the proposal to adopt the term will have to be ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences before its formal adoption as part of the [[geologic time scale]].&lt;ref name="Gixmodo001"&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Human timeline}}{{Life timeline}}
The name ''Anthropocene'' is a combination of ''[[wikt:anthropo-#English|anthropo-]]'' from ''anthropos'' ({{lang-grc|ἄνθρωπος}}) meaning "human" and ''[[wikt:-cene#English|-cene]]'' from ''kainos'' ({{lang-grc|καινός}}) meaning "new" or "recent."&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/nqrwpos|ἄνθρωπος}}, {{LSJ|kaino/s|καινός|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|-cene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1873, the Italian geologist [[Antonio Stoppani]] acknowledged the increasing power and effect of humanity on the Earth's systems and referred to an 'anthropozoic era'.&lt;ref name="Crutzen02"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crutzen | first=P. J. | title=Geology of mankind | journal=Nature | volume=415 | date=2002 | page=23 | url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038%2F415023a | doi=10.1038/415023a | pmid=11780095 | issue=6867|bibcode = 2002Natur.415...23C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the biologist [[Eugene Stoermer]] is often credited with coining the term "anthropocene", it was in informal use in the mid-1970s. [[Paul Crutzen]] is credited with independently re-inventing and popularizing it. Stoermer wrote, "I began using the term 'anthropocene' in the 1980's, but never formalized it until Paul contacted me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steffen |first=Will |last2=Grinevald |first2=Jacques |last3=Crutzen |first3=Paul |last4=McNeill |first4=John |date=2011 |title=The Anthropocene: conceptual and historical perspectives |url=ftp://ftp.iluci.org/Evan/GEOG415/Reading_Assignments/Anthropocene.pdf |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A |volume=369 |page=843 |accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crutzen has explained, "I was at a conference where someone said something about the [[Holocene]]. I suddenly thought this was wrong. The world has changed too much. So I said: 'No, we are in the Anthropocene.' I just made up the word on the spur of the moment. Everyone was shocked. But it seems to have stuck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pearce |first=Fred |author-link=Fred Pearce |title=With Speed and Violence: Why Scientists fear tipping points in Climate Change |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston, Massachusetts |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-8070-8576-9 |url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/wsav.pdf |access-date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} In 2008, Zalasiewicz suggested in ''[[GSA Today]]'' that an anthropocene [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] is now appropriate.&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz08"/&gt;

===Homogenocene===
'''Homogenocene''' (from old Greek: [[wikt:Homo-#English|homo-]], ''same'' [[wikt:geno-#English|geno-]], ''kind'', '''kainos-''', ''new'' and [[wikt:-cene#English|-cene]], ''period'') is a more specific term used to define our current [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], in which [[#Biodiversity|biodiversity]] is diminishing and [[#Biogeography|biogeography]] and [[ecosystems]] around the globe seem more and more similar to one another mainly due to [[invasive species]] that have been introduced around the globe either on purpose (crops, livestock) or inadvertently.

The term Homogenocene was first used by Michael Samways in his editorial article in the ''Journal of Insect Conservation'' from 1999 titled "Translocating fauna to foreign lands: here comes the Homogenocene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Climate===
{{main|Anthropogenic climate change}}
{{main|Anthropocene extinction}}
One geological symptom resulting from human activity is increasing [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO{{sub|2}}) content. During the [[ice age|glacial–interglacial]] cycles of the past million years, natural processes have varied CO{{sub|2}} by approximately 100 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (from 180 ppm to 280 ppm). {{As of|2013}}, anthropogenic net emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased atmospheric concentration by a comparable amount from 280 ppm (Holocene or pre-industrial "equilibrium") to approximately 400 ppm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/global.html|title=ESRL Global Monitoring Division - Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network|author=ESRL Web Team|work=noaa.gov|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 2015&amp;ndash;16 monthly monitoring data of CO{{sub|2}} displaying a rising trend above 400 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/|title=NASA Global Climate Change - Vital Signs of the Planet - Facts - Carbon Dioxide|date=7 November 2016|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This signal in the Earth's climate system is especially significant because it is occurring much faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5314592.stm|date=4 September 2006|title=Deep ice tells long climate story|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a greater extent, than previous, similar changes. Most of this increase is due to the [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], [[Petroleum|oil]], and [[Natural gas|gas]], although smaller fractions are the result of [[cement]] production and land-use changes (e.g. [[deforestation]]).

===Geomorphology===
Changes in drainage patterns traceable to human activity will persist over geologic time in large parts of the continents where the geologic regime is erosional.  This includes the paths of roads and highways defined by their grading and drainage control. Direct changes to the form of the Earth's surface by human activities (e.g., quarrying, landscaping) also record human impacts.

It has been suggested the deposition of [[calthemite]] formations are one example of a natural process which has not previously occurred prior to the human modification of the Earth's surface, and therefore represents a unique process of the Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Simon J|last2=Viles|first2=Heather A|last3=Garrett|first3=Bradley L|title=Ozymandias in the Anthropocene: the city as an emerging landform|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/area.12358/abstract|date=21 June 2017|journal=Area|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/area.12358|issn=1475-4762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calthemite is a secondary deposit, derived from [[concrete]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or other calcareous material ''outside the [[cave]] environment''.&lt;ref name=SmithGK2016&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=G.

===Stratigraphy===

====Sedimentological record====
Human activities like deforestation and road construction are believed to have elevated average total sediment fluxes across the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt; However, construction of dams on many rivers around the world means the rates of sediment deposition in any given place do not always appear to increase in the Anthropocene. For instance, many [[river delta]]s around the world are actually currently starved of sediment by such dams, and are subsiding and failing to keep up with sea level rise, rather than growing.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giosan|first1=L.|last2=Syvitski|first2=J. P. M.|last3=Constantinescu|first3=S.|last4=Day|first4=J.|date=3 December 2014|title=Climate change: Protect the world's deltas|work=Nature|volume=516|pages=31–33|doi=10.1038/516031a|bibcode=2014Natur.516...31G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fossil record====
Increases in erosion due to farming and other operations will be reflected by changes in sediment composition and increases in deposition rates elsewhere. In land areas with a depositional regime, engineered structures will tend to be buried and preserved, along with litter and debris. Litter and debris thrown from boats or carried by rivers and creeks will accumulate in the marine environment, particularly in coastal areas. Such manmade artifacts preserved in stratigraphy are known as "technofossils."&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=H.V.|last1=Cabadas-Báez|first2=S.|last2=Sedov|first3=S|last3=Jiménez-Álvarez|first4=D|last4=Leonard|first5=B.|last5=Lailson-Tinoco|first6=R.|last6=García-Moll|first7=I.|last7=Ancona-Aragón|first8=L.|last8=Hernández|date=2017|title=Soils as a source of raw materials for ancient ceramic production in the Maya region of Mexico: Micromorphological insight|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%282%29Cabadas.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|volume=70|issue=1|pages=21–48|doi=10.18268/BSGM2018v70n1a2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in biodiversity will also be reflected in the fossil record, as will species introductions.  An example cited is the domestic chicken, originally the [[red junglefowl]] ''Gallus gallus'', native to south-east Asia but has since become the world's most common bird through human breeding and consumption, with over 60 billion consumed a year and whose bones would become fossilized in landfill sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/domestic-chicken-anthropocene-humanity-influenced-epoch |title=How the domestic chicken rose to define the Anthropocene |first=Damian |last=Carrington|date= 31 August 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trace elements====
In terms of trace elements, there are distinct signatures left by modern societies. For example, in the [[Upper Fremont Glacier]] in Wyoming, there is a layer of [[chlorine]] present in ice cores from 1960's atomic weapon testing programs, as well as a layer of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] associated with [[coal]] plants in the 1980s. From 1945 to 1951, [[nuclear fallout]] is found locally around atomic device test sites, whereas from 1952 to 1980, tests of [[thermonuclear]] devices have left a clear, global signal of excess {{SimpleNuclide2|carbon|14}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|plutonium|239}}, and other artificial [[radionuclide]]s. The highest global concentration of radionuclides was in 1965, one of the dates which has been proposed as a possible benchmark for the start of the formally defined Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global peak in atmospheric radiocarbon provides a potential definition for the onset of the Anthropocene Epoch in 1965|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20970-5|website=[[Scientific Reports]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human burning of [[fossil fuel]]s has also left distinctly elevated concentrations of black carbon, inorganic ash, and spherical carbonaceous particles in recent sediments across the world. Concentrations of these components increases markedly and almost simultaneously around the world beginning around 1950.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;

== Temporal limit ==
The Anthropocene Working Group voted on the "Base/beginning of the Anthropocene", and most members favored some time around 1950.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2016/august/media-note-anthropocene-working-group-awg|title=Media note: Anthropocene Working Group (AWG)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=University of Leicester|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This time period has also been referred to as the [[Great Acceleration]].

==="Early anthropocene" model ===
{{Main|Early anthropocene}}
While much of the environmental change occurring on Earth is suspected to be a direct consequence of the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[William Ruddiman]] has argued that the proposed Anthropocene began approximately 8,000 years ago with the development of farming and sedentary cultures. At this point, humans were dispersed across all of the continents (except [[Antarctica]]), and the [[Neolithic Revolution]] was ongoing. During this period, humans developed [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] to supplement or replace [[hunter-gatherer]] subsistence. Such innovations were followed by a wave of [[extinction]]s, beginning with large [[mammal]]s and land [[bird]]s. This wave was driven by both the direct activity of humans (e.g. hunting) and the indirect consequences of land-use change for agriculture.

At this time, the [[Roman Empire]] encompassed large portions of [[Europe]], the Middle East, and North Africa. In [[China]] the [[Han Dynasty|classical dynasties]] were flowering.

Today there are more humans alive than at any previous point in Earth's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castree|first=Noel|year=2015|title=The anthropocene: a primer for geographers|url=https://2017.moodle.maynoothuniversity.ie/pluginfile.php/487483/mod_resource/content/1/Castree%20The%20Anthropocene.pdf|journal=geography|volume= 100|pages=66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
Crutzen proposed the [[Industrial Revolution]] as the start of Anthropocene.&lt;ref name="Crutzen02" /&gt; Lovelock proposes that the Anthropocene began with the first application of the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine]] in 1712. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] takes the pre-industrial era (chosen as the year 1750) as the baseline related to changes in long-lived, well mixed greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html|title=NOAA/ESRL Global Monitoring Division - THE NOAA ANNUAL GREENHOUSE GAS INDEX (AGGI)|last=Laboratory|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, Earth System Research|website=www.esrl.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is apparent that the Industrial Revolution ushered in an unprecedented global human impact on the planet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Industry, environment and health through 200 years in Manchester |author= Douglas, I. |author2= Hodgson, R. |author3= Lawson, N. |last-author-amp= yes |year= 2002 |doi= 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00029-0 |journal= Ecological Economics |volume= 41 |issue= 2 |pages= 235–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of Earth's landscape already had been profoundly modified by human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Holocene record |author= Kirch, P.

=== Anthropocene marker ===
A marker that accounts for a substantial global impact of humans on the total environment, comparable in scale to those associated with significant perturbations of the geological past, is needed in place of minor changes in atmosphere composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Response to 'The Anthropocene forces us to reconsider adaptationist models of human-environment interactions' |author= Zalasiewicz, J. |author2= Williams, M. |author3= Steffen, W. |author4= Crutzen, P. J. |last-author-amp= yes |year= 2010 |doi= 10.1021/es102062w |journal= Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume= 44 |issue= 16 |page= 6008|bibcode = 2010EnST...44.6008Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Stratigraphy of the Anthropocene |author= Zalasiewicz, J. |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1098/rsta.2010.0315 |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A |volume= 369 |issue= 1938 |pages= 1036–1055|bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369.1036Z |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A useful candidate for this purpose is the [[pedosphere]], which can retain information of its climatic and geochemical history with features lasting for centuries or millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Humanity's transformation of Earth's soil: pedology's new frontier |author= Richter, D. deB. |year= 2007 |doi= 10.1097/ss.0b013e3181586bb7 |journal= Soil Science |volume= 172 |issue= 12 |pages= 957–967|bibcode= 2007SoilS.172..957R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activity is now firmly established as the sixth factor of soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The place of humans in the state factor theory of ecosystems and their soils |author= Amundson, R. |author2= Jenny, H. |last-author-amp= yes |date= 1991 |journal= Soil Science |volume= 151 |issue= 1 |pages= 99–109 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199101000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affects pedogenesis either directly, by, for example, land levelling, trenching and embankment building for various purposes, organic matter enrichment from additions of manure or other waste, organic matter impoverishment due to continued cultivation, compaction from overgrazing or, indirectly, by drift of eroded materials or pollutants. Anthropogenic soils are those markedly affected by human activities, such as repeated ploughing, the addition of fertilizers, contamination, sealing, or enrichment with artefacts (in the [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] they are classified as [[Anthrosols]] and [[Technosols]]). They are recalcitrant repositories of artefacts and properties that testify to the dominance of the human impact, and hence appear to be reliable markers for the Anthropocene. Some anthropogenic soils may be viewed as the 'golden spikes' of geologists ([[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]]), which are locations where there are strata successions with clear evidences of a worldwide event, including the appearance of distinctive fossils.&lt;ref name="Certini01" /&gt; Drilling for fossil fuels has also created holes and tubes which are expected to be detectable for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofideas.wbur.org/2015/03/29/mcneill|title=The Advent of the Anthropocene: Was That the Big Story of the 20th Century?|work=worldofideas|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
The concept of the Anthropocene has also been approached via humanities such as philosophy, literature and art. In the scholarly world, it has been the subject of increasing attention through special journal issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 34| issue = 2| editor = Timothy Clark| title = Special Issue: Deconstruction in the Anthropocene| journal = Oxford Literary Review| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 1 December 2012| url = http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/olr.2012.0039| doi=10.3366/olr.2012.0039| pages=v–vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| author = Humanities Research Centre, Australian National University| title = Anthropocene Humanities: The 2012 Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes| location = Canberra, Australia| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 13 June 2012| url = http://chcinetwork.org/anthropocene-humanities/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140831221523/http://chcinetwork.org/anthropocene-humanities/| archivedate = 31 August 2014| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| author = Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society at LMU-Munich| last2 = Alexander von Humboldt Transatlantic Network in the Environmental Humanities| title = Culture and the Anthropocene| location = Munich, Germany| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 14 June 2013| url = http://www.carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de/events_conf_seminars/event_history/2013/2013_conf_ws_sem/130614_cult_anthrop/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disciplinary reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = American Comparative Literature Association| last = Wenzel| first = Jennifer| title = State of the Discipline Report: Ideas of the Decade| chapter = Climate Change| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 13 March 2014| chapterurl = http://stateofthediscipline.acla.org/entry/climate-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anthropocene, its attendant timescale, and ecological implications prompts questions about death and the ends of civilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Scranton| first = Roy| title = Learning How to Die in the Anthropocene| work = New York Times: Opinionator| accessdate = 17 July 2014| date = 10 November 2013| url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/}}&lt;/ref&gt; memory and archives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Colebrook| first = Claire| title = The Anthropocene and the Archive| work = The Memory Network: Exchanges| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 27 January 2014| url = http://thememorynetwork.net/the-anthropocene-and-the-archive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scope and methods of humanistic inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Nowviskie| first = Bethany| title = digital humanities in the anthropocene| work = nowviskie.org| accessdate = 10 July 2014| date = 10 July 2014| url = http://nowviskie.org/2014/anthropocene/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional responses to the "end of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ronda| first = Margaret| title = Mourning and Melancholia in the Anthropocene| journal = Post45| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 10 June 2013| url = http://post45.research.yale.edu/2013/06/mourning-and-melancholia-in-the-anthropocene/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also criticized as an ideological construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Andreas|last=Malm|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/anthropocene-capitalism-climate-change/|title=The Anthropocene Myth|magazine=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some environmentalists on the political left suggest that "Capitalocene" is a more historically appropriate term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anthropocene or Capitalocene?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6964">'''BROG''' is the acronym for [https://web.archive.org/web/20060823210815/http://www.blogninja.com/ (We)blog Research on Genre], a project based in the [http://www.slis.indiana.edu/ School of Library and Information Science at Indiana University, Bloomington].

The BROG project is an informal research collaboration dedicated to the conduct of empirical, social science research on weblogs. Founded and directed by [http://www.slis.indiana.edu/faculty/herring/ [[Susan Herring]]], a professor of Information Science at Indiana University and established researcher of [[computer-mediated communication]], its past and present members include faculty, graduate students, and visiting scholars at Indiana University.

BROG is best known for an article published in January 2004 entitled, "Bridging the gap: A genre analysis of weblogs", which applied content analysis methods to a random sample of 203 blogs and characterized blogs as an emergent genre of computer-mediated communication. This article received the [http://incsub.org/awards/index.php?p=18 2004 "Best Blogged Paper" Edublog award] and is often cited in scholarship about blogs. A [https://scholar.google.com/ Google Scholar] search indicates that it had been cited 677 times as of March 3, 2012.
Brog is also a family name derived from the Scandinavian word which translates in English as "flag."
About the year 1500 there was a famine in Sweden and an entire village migrated from Sweden to the Berner Oberland in Switzerland. During the early part of the twentieth century, family members emigrated to southern Wisconsin; from there one branch to Wyoming/Utah/Idaho and another branch remained in southwest Wisconsin. Brog families originated in other parts of Europe, perhaps with longer names that were diminished to the shorter form. The author of this segment visited Canton Bern in 2014 and there were no known Brogs still residing in Switzerland at that time. The author's great grandson is the sixth generation of only sons.

BROG was founded in February 2003 for the purpose of conducting a genre analysis of blogs at a time when very little research on blogs was available. The project's findings were first presented at the [http://www.aoir.org/ Association of Internet Researchers] conference in Toronto in October 2003. Since then BROG has expanded its focus to include research on gender, visual design, audience, and interconnectivity of weblogs. Since 2004, the project has made extensive use of [[Social Network Analysis]] methods and network visualizations.

==Controversy==
The presentation of BROG's research at the 2003 AoIR conference generated controversy among some bloggers who were present at the conference and others who were not about whether people who were "not bloggers" (two of the four original BROG members kept blogs at the time) could legitimately conduct research on blogs. Concerns were also expressed by some bloggers about the research's empirical, quantitative approach. Some critics expressed the view that this approach (which showed [[blog]]s to be less interlinked and conversational than was popularly believed) missed important aspects of the blogging experience.

==History==

The Gurjar-Bakarwals claim a common ancestry from the ancient [[Gujjar]] tribe. 

Many Kashmiri Muslims including many Bakerwals and Gujjar migrated from the Valley to Punjab due to famine and policies of Hindu Dogra rulers, during the mid-18th Century. They are traditionally [[Sunni]] Muslims.

== Etymology ==

'Bakarwal' is derived from the [[Indic language]]&lt;ref&gt;Compare: [[Gojri language|Gojri]], [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Dogri language|Dogri]], [[Jammu]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] language terms.&lt;/ref&gt; terms, ''bakara''&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: बर्कर ''bakara''&lt;/ref&gt; meaning goat or sheep, and ''wal''&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: पालक ''palaka'' "keeper"&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "one who takes care of".&lt;ref name="Khatana" /&gt; Essentially, the name "Bakarwal" implies "high-altitude goatherds/shepherds".

== Society ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}
The Bakarwals belong to the same ethnicity as the [[Gujjar]]s, and inter-marriages take place among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}} citing an unpublished paper by Negi, R. S. ''et al.''  "Socio-Economic Aspirations of Guijjara and Bakerwal"&lt;/ref&gt; Bakarwals have clans (''[[gotra]]'') like Gujjars; however, "''bakarwal''" is also occasionally used indiscriminately to refer to any nomadic shephard group in the foothills, even those who may not belong to a Bakarwal community ([[Wiktionary:qafila|qafila]] group).
The Gadaria-Bakarwals have divided themselves into three principal kinship groups:
:(i) The dera (household),
:(ii) Dada-Potre (lineage), 
:(iii) the [[gotra]] (clan).

The dera is the basic unit of social structure among the Gujjar-Bakarwals. They count their numbers and describe their grazing and qafila groups in terms of the number of deras.

A dera usually comes into existence when a person establishes an independent household, which happens normally after his marriage. Each son, thus, establishes his own dera as he gets married. A dera usually consists of five to six members. There is a division of labour among the members of the household on the basis of sex and age.

Females perform the domestic tasks of cooking, washing, fetching of water, upbringing of children, collection of wood, and spinning and making of woolen garments. On the other hand, males perform tasks like herding of flock and cattle, repairing of tools and equipment, collection of grass, herbs, deer-musk, hunting of wild animals, ploughing and harvesting of crops.{{Copyright violation|date=April 2018|sure=no}}&lt;!--See "Society section copyright problem or plagiarism" on talk page. --&gt;

The household is, thus, a primary economic unit. A nuclear family is the production and consumption unit. A joint family which is generally large cannot survive on the meagre pasture resource as the transhumance are on the move for about 110 to 130 days in a year.{{Copyright violation|date=April 2018|sure=no}}&lt;!--See "Society section copyright problem or plagiarism" on talk page. --&gt;

The elders want the eligible married youngsters to shoulder the responsibility of looking after the flock of sheep and goats independently. This would ensure greater security to the herds and sharing all responsible jobs by the adult members.{{Copyright violation|date=April 2018|sure=no}}&lt;!--See "Society section copyright problem or plagiarism" on talk page. --&gt;

Several deras (households) constitute a lineage (dada-potra). The pastures are allotted to the lineage and not to the individuals. In a lineage, there may be about two hundred persons. Usually, a Gujjar-Bakarwal father divides his property (animal wealth) among his male children as and when they get married.

The lineage, thus, consists of several generations and includes cousins and distant relatives. They share the common pastures. The lineage unit is quite powerful administrative unit. Each lineage has a head who is responsible for the socio-economic and political activities of his group.

== Economy ==
As sheep and goat rearing [[Transhumance|transhumants]], the Bakarwal alternate with the seasons between high and low altitudes in the
hills of the Himalayas.&lt;ref name="Khatana" /&gt;
 
While traditionally goat and sheep herders, governmental restrictions, land development, population growth, and advancements in the [[market economy]] have caused some Bakarwallah to settle in one place and engaged in other forms of agriculture in addition to [[animal husbandry]].

== Legal status ==
In 1991 in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] the Bakarwal were first recognized as an [[Government of India|Indian]] [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|Scheduled Tribe]]. {{As of|2001}}, the Bakarwal were classified as a Scheduled Tribe under the [[Reservation in India|Indian government's general reservation program]] of [[positive discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Census of India: Government of India |date=7 March 2007 |title=List of Scheduled Tribes |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/scst_main.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207163453/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/scst_main.html |archive-date=7 February 2013  |dead-url=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Biharis''' ({{Audio|Bihari.ogg|listen}}) is a [[demonym]] given to the inhabitants of the Indian state of [[Bihar]]. Bihari people can be separated into three main [[South Asian ethnic groups|ethnic groups]], [[Bhojpuri people|Bhojpuris]], [[Maithil]]s and [[Magahi people|Magahis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SylBHS8IJAUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=bihari+ethnic+groups+bhojpuri+maithili&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir5Yeq_M7SAhUHBsAKHcNCCq0Q6AEIITAC#v=onepage&amp;q=bihari%20ethnic%20groups%20bhojpuri%20maithili&amp;f=false | title=Language, Religion and Politics in North India | accessdate=11 March 2017 | pages=69 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312075028/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SylBHS8IJAUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=bihari+ethnic+groups+bhojpuri+maithili&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir5Yeq_M7SAhUHBsAKHcNCCq0Q6AEIITAC#v=onepage&amp;q=bihari%20ethnic%20groups%20bhojpuri%20maithili&amp;f=false | archivedate=12 March 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Biharis can be found throughout [[North India]], [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Maharashtra]], and in the neighbouring countries of [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]].

Biharis were the founders of many great empires based out of [[Magadh]] including the [[Maurya Empire]] and the [[Gupta Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=biharis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjny_Can7vdAhVJKcAKHazqAkQQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=biharis&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these empires had their capitals in [[Pataliputra]] (modern-day [[Patna]]).

Two of India's major religions also have their origins in Bihar. [[Gautama Buddha]] who was the founder of [[Buddhism]], achieved enlightenment in [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Bihar]]. [[Mahavira]], the founder of [[Jainism]], was born in [[Vaishali district|Vaishali]] in North Bihar.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=loQkEIf8z5wC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=jainism+buddhism+bihar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS0c_1oLvdAhUDD8AKHWqIAgQQ6AEIKTAB&lt;/ref&gt;

The first success for spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced Urdu as the sole official language of the province. In this struggle between competing Hindi and Urdu, the potential claims of the three large mother tongues in the region – [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Magahi language|Magahi]] were ignored. After independence Hindi was again given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Brass Paul R., ''The Politics of India Since Independence'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Urdu became the second official language in the undivided State of Bihar on 16 August 1989. Bihar also produced several eminent Urdu writers including [[Sulaiman Nadvi]], [[Manazir Ahsan Gilani]], [[Abdul Qavi Desnavi]], Paigham Afaqui, [[Jabir Husain]], Sohail Azimabadi, [[Hussain Ul Haque]], Dr. Shamim Hashimi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urduliterature.org/shamimhashimi.aspx DR.Shamim Hashimi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002040811/http://urduliterature.org/shamimhashimi.aspx |date=2 October 2013 }}.

==Bihari diaspora==

===Pakistan and Bangladesh===
{{Main article|Stranded Pakistanis}}
In 1947, at the time of Partition, many Muslim Biharis moved to what was then [[East Bengal]] adjacent to their Bihar province in eastern India.

However, when East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh in December 1971, the Biharis were left behind as the Pakistani army and civilians evacuated and the Bihari population in Bangladesh found themselves unwelcomed in both countries. Pakistan feared a mass influx of Biharis could destabilise a fragile and culturally mixed population, and Bangladeshis scorned the Biharis for having supported and sided with the West Pakistan during the war.

With little or no legal negotiation about offering the Biharis Pakistani citizenship or safe conduit back home to their native Bihar in India, the Biharis (called "stranded Pakistanis" by some Bangladeshi politicians) have remained stateless for 33 years. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ([[UNHCR]]) has not addressed the plight of the Biharis. An estimated 600,000 Biharis live in 66 camps in 13 regions across Bangladesh, and an equal number have acquired Bangladeshi citizenship. In 1990, a small number of Biharis were allowed to immigrate to Pakistan.

Pakistan has reiterated that as the successor state of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), as well as having greater cultural and linguistic similarities with Bengalis, Bangladesh should accept the Biharis as full citizens. Pakistani politicians and government officials have refused to accept these nearly 300,000 stranded Pakistanis of Bihari origin due to inability to absorb such a large number of immigrants at the moment.

In May 2008, a Bangladeshi court ruled that Biharis who were either [[minor (law)|minors]] in 1971 or born after 1971 are Bangladeshi citizens and have the right to vote.&lt;ref name=reuters051908&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-33636220080518 "Court rules that young Biharis are Bangladesh citizens"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119060855/http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-33636220080518 |date=19 November 2016 }}.

''[[BBC News]]''. 19 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the ruling, an estimated 150,000 of the 300,000 Biharis living in Bangladesh are eligible for Bangladeshi citizenship.&lt;ref name=bbc051908/&gt; Although the court ruling explicitly said that the Biharis are eligible to register to vote in the December 2008 elections, the Election Commission closed its rolls in August 2008 without enrolling them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh fails to register its Urdu-speaking citizens as voters |url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/politics/bangladesh-fails-to-register-its-urdu-speaking-citizens-as-voters_10084746.html |newspaper=Thaindian News |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |date=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caribbean, Fiji, Mauritius and South Africa===
A large number of people from present-day Bihar travelled to various parts of the world in the 19th century to serve as [[Indian indenture system|indentured labours]] on sugarcane, cocoa, rice, and rubber plantations in the [[Caribbean]], [[Fiji]]. [[Mauritius]], and [[Colony of Natal|Natal, South Africa]].

==Bihari sub-nationalism==
According to social scientist Dr. [[Shaibal Gupta]], the beating of students from Bihar in Mumbai in October 2008, has consolidated Bihari sub-nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Faizan, ''"Bihar violence: Raj the gainer"'', The times of India, Pune, 27 October 2008, pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1282">'''Buitenvrouw''' (literally "outside wife", IPA: {{IPA-nl|bœytəfrʌu|}}) is a [[Surinamese Dutch]] word for a [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]. Although traditionally considered a taboo, some contemporary [[Surinamese]] cultural figures like Jetty Mathurin and Frits Wols are found to satirize or criticize the institution. 

After the Surinamese mass immigration to the [[Netherlands]], some Surinamese developed extramarital affairs with local [[Dutch people|Dutch]] women, i.e., ''buitenvrouwen''. The 1994 novel ''De buitenvrouw'' by [[Joost Zwagerman]] reverses the roles, featuring Iris, an Afro-Surinamese as the mistress of a [[White people|White]] Dutchman. &lt;ref&gt;[http://studenten.samenvattingen.com/documenten/show/0472070/ De buitenvrouw: roman] {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The word ''buitenvrouw'' has become a part of the standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]] vocabulary and it is found in the [[Wordlist of the Dutch language]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://woordenlijst.org/zoek/?q=buitenvrouw&amp;w=w Woordenlijst Nederlandse Taal]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cancel''', sb., is a [[bibliographic]] term for a replaced [[leaf (books)|leaf]] in a printed book. The technique for this is usually to tear out the rejected leaf and paste a new one to the [[:wikt:stub|stub]] left on the cognate leaf. Alternatively, a false stub (known as a "[[book folding|fold]]") may be added.

The cancelled leaf may be rejected on account of spelling or typing errors, a wording change or addition, or need to suppress [[libel]]lous or otherwise offensive text.

Leaves have been cancelled from around the dawn of [[printing]] in the mid-15th century, peaked from about 1600 to 1800, but the practice is less common today, since it is now cheaper to replace the whole [[sheet of paper|sheet]].

If the replacement is made before [[publication]], the book can exist in two states (i.e. with and without the new leaf). If after sale, from a new leaf supplied by the [[bookbinder|binder]] to the purchaser, it is termed an ''alternative [[issue (periodical)|issue]]''.

Cancels are not always easy to detect, if the stub or fold they are attached to is small; however, often there will be a difference from other leaves in matters such as [[paper thickness]], [[watermark]]s, [[chainline]]s, etc. Whether the old leaf had a [[signature]] or not, the new one usually has one added. It occasionally occurs as an error that the old leaf is not excised, or even that the wrong leaf is removed. To obviate this, the old leaf is sometimes partly slit.

==Terminology==
The terminology, coined by [[R. W. Chapman]] in 1930, is:

English: ''cancel'' (pl. ''cancels'') or ''cancel leaf'' (pl. ''cancel leaves''); Latin: ''cancellans'' (pl. ''cancellantia''):
The new (or replacement, or corrected leaf.

English: ''cancelland'' (pl. ''cancellands''); Latin: ''cancellandum'' (pl. ''cancellanda''):
The leaf intended to be replaced, or removed, but when this has not yet been done.
 
English: ''cancelled leaf'' (pl. ''cancelled leaves''); Latin: ''cancellatum'' (pl. ''cancellata''):
Refers to the cancellandum after it has been removed.

In December 2014, an [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs|ILAB]] ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' reported 8 goods produced in such working conditions in Tanzania, 6 of them are agricultural goods (most importantly [[Coffee production in Tanzania|coffee]], sisal, tea and tobacco).

A '''civil penalty''' or '''civil fine''' is a financial penalty imposed by a [[government agency]] as restitution for wrongdoing.  The wrongdoing is typically defined by a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[legislation]], [[regulation]]s, and [[decree]]s. The civil fine is not considered to be a [[Crime|criminal]] [[punishment]], because it is primarily sought in order to compensate the state for harm done to it, rather than to punish the wrongful conduct. As such, a civil penalty, in itself, will not carry jail time or other legal penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/cc.htm|title=Differences between Civil and Criminal Law in the USA|date=1998|author=Ronald B. Standler|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2014}} For example, if a person were to dump toxic waste in a state park, the state would have the same right to seek to recover the cost of cleaning up the mess as would a private landowner, and to bring the complaint to a [[court]] of law, if necessary.

Civil penalties occupy a strange place in some legal systems - because they are not criminal penalties, the state need not meet a [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that is "[[balance of probabilities]]"; but because the action is brought by the government, and some civil penalties can run into the millions of dollars, it would be uncomfortable to subject citizens to them by a burden of proof that is merely a "[[preponderance of the evidence]]." Therefore, the assessment of most civil penalties requires a finding of "[[clear and convincing evidence]]" before a civil defendant will be held liable. A defendant may well raise [[excuse|excuses, justifications]], [[affirmative defense]]s,  and [[procedural defense]]s. An [[administrative law judge]] or [[hearing officer]] may oversee the proceedings and render a [[Legal judgment|judgment]]. Judgment is made on the balance of probabilities, meaning if it is more than fifty percent likely that the accused is responsible then the accused shall be found guilty.

In some cases, a civil penalty may be supplemented by other legal process, including administrative sanctions or even criminal charges, and their respective [[appeal]]s. For example, failure to pay a fine assessed for a [[traffic code]] violation may result in administrative suspension of a [[driver's license]], and further driving after suspension may be a criminal offense. On the other hand, a minimal case may be "put on file", or otherwise suspended for a period during which the defendant may be required to avoid further violations, or carry out specific duties (such as making repairs or restitution, or attending supplemental education), after which the matter is dismissed.

In other cases, such as [[public safety]] and [[consumer protection]] violations, the local authorities may revoke permits and licenses, and seek [[injunction]] to stop or remove non-conforming works or goods, in addition to the civil penalty.

Pending or admitted civil violations may also be used as [[evidence]] of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] in a [[lawsuit|civil suit]]. One example is [[speed limit|speeding]] causing in a [[car accident]], resulting in a [[wrongful death claim]].  However, the plaintiff may be required to prove [[causation (law)|causation]] through a harm encompassed in the regulations.

== Civil Penalties in England ==
The concept of civil penalties in English is in a state of flux.  In contract, damages is a remedy to provide monetary compensation for loss; and damages may be unliquidated (general damages), or liquidated (pre-determined).  In the absence of an out-of court settlement, unliquidated damages must be ascertained by a court or tribunal, whereas liquidated damages will be determined by reference to the contract or to a mutually agreed arbitrator.  The purpose of liquidated damages is to provide certainty and to avoid both the bother and cost of legal proceedings. 

It is well established that liquidated  damages for breach of contract are void if they seek to punish rather than to compensate for loss.  For a contractual "penalty" clause to be valid,  one must show that it was drawn up after a bona fide attempt to estimate loss in advance of the breach.   For example, a motorway construction contract may have an estimated finish date with a "penalty clause" for every day late; but provided that this date is realistic and the "penalty" is a reasonable approximation of loss, the clause will be valid. The validity of the clause will be advanced if there is an equivalent bonus for finishing early.

Difficulties can arise with fines for wrongful parking (parking in the wrong area, or overstaying).  There are three scenarios: (i) parking on public streets; &amp; parking in a private car park either (ii) with permission, or (iii) without permission.  If a parking fine is imposed for type (i), since the powers exercised by the local authority have been delegated by Parliament, there is little that one can do, except to seek judicial review and allege disproportionality.  If it is type (ii), such as in a supermarket car-park, then contract rules apply.  If, say, the cost was £1 for an hour, and you got a £60 ticket for overstaying a further hour, you can legally send them an extra £1, plus (say) £5 as a contribution to their administration expenses.  If they are not satisfied, they would have to issue a county court summons, which might not be cost effective.

In type (iii) where one has parked on private land without permission, a typical notice might read: "In parking on this land, you hereby accept that your vehicle will be clamped and a £100 release charged".  Although this may seem a simple matter of [[trespass]] with an unavoidable fine, it may amount to a case of implied contract (i.e. "if you park here, you agree to pay a penalty"); and such a "penalty" (read "damages") must be proportionate or else the fine will be void.  Also, since the penalty notice could have been attached to the windscreen, the clamping of the vehicle may itself be unlawful trespass. It should be noted that since the introduction of the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] (also known as POFA), that wheel clamping is illegal unless by an Authority (e.g. Police, Local Authority or DVLA).

'''Crime in Flint, Michigan''', has been a serious issue, primarily due to an ongoing [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]]. Since the late-2000s, [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] has consistently ranked among the most violent cities in the [[United States]]. Law enforcement in Flint is primarily the responsibility of the Flint Police Department, which is often assisted by the Genesee County Sheriff's Department and the [[Michigan State Police]], which maintains a post in adjacent [[Flint Township, Michigan|Flint Township]] that serves all of [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]], as well as the Genesee County Parks and Recreation Commission and the [[campus police]] departments of the [[University of Michigan–Flint]], [[Kettering University]], and [[Mott Community College]].

==Flint Police Department==
{{update section|date=September 2018}}
The Flint Police Department (a.k.a. Flint PD or FPD) is the primary law enforcement agency in the city, led by Chief Tim Johnson. In recent decades, it has faced significant downsizing due to population decline and the ongoing economic depression in the city.

Between 2008 and 2010, mayor [[Dayne Walling]] reduced the number of patrol-level [[police officers]] from 208 to 67. The total number of police officer positions fell by 141, due to a combination of layoffs, resignations, and retirements&lt;ref name="pubsafety2010"&gt;{{cite news |first = Kristin |last = Longley |url = http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2010/12/2010_a_difficult_year_for_publ.html |title = 2010 a 'difficult year' for public safety, Flint Mayor Dayne Walling says |work = [[The Flint Journal]] |date = December 17, 2010 |access-date = December 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="union layoffs"&gt;{{cite news |first = David |last = Harris |url = http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2010/12/flint_police_officers_union_he.html |title = Flint Police officers union head: Response times expected to go up another 25 percent after layoffs |work = The Flint Journal |date = December 19, 2010 |access-date = December 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2011, the Flint Police Department was awarded $1,225,638 from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s [[Community Oriented Policing Services]] (COPS) program to re-hire 6 laid off patrol officers. The officers were scheduled to be on the job starting in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Kristin |last = Longley |url = http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2011/09/6_additional_flint_police_to_b.html |title = 6 additional Flint police to be rehired with $1.2 million federal grant |work = The Flint Journal |date = September 28, 2011 |access-date = December 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2012, Michigan Governor [[Rick Snyder]] visited Flint and announced additional [[Michigan State Police|state troopers]] would be sent to Flint and that additional state money would be provided to Flint for the city jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Kristin |last = Longley |url = http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/06/gov_snyder_in_flint.html |title = Gov.

He also pointed out that [[Scrap|scrap metal]] thefts are on the rise in the city, and proposed a portion of the $97 million fund be set aside to prevent them, which he claimed will also benefit the local economy by attracting new businesses to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Kristin |last = Longley |url = http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/07/flint_lawmaker_pushes_for_publ.html |title = Flint lawmaker pushes for public safety funding out of foreclosure settlement |work = The Flint Journal |date = July 17, 2012 |access-date = December 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flint PD's newest squad is the Crime Area Target Team, formed by Chief Tim Johnson in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/04/new_flint_police_task_force_se.html New Flint police task force seizes guns, drugs, $18K in two-week period] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, April 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It concentrates on combating the illegal narcotics trafficking and firearms trades. In February 2017, it confiscated $20,000 street value crystal methamphetamine, $20,000 street value heroin, nearly $10,000 worth of powder cocaine, $2,300 worth of crack cocaine, $30,000 worth of  marijuana, $1,500 in psilocybin mushrooms, $1,500 of illegal prescription medications, and about $34,000 cash. This resulted in 126 arrests, 238 new felonies, 82 new misdemeanors, 22 felony warrants, 19 misdemeanors, 30 guns confiscated and 30 vehicles impounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/03/flint_police_drugs_guns.html Flint police CATT squad seizes guns, drugs and arrests 126] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, March 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
The Flint Police Department was featured in a 2015 episode of [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]'s ''[[Cold Justice: Sex Crimes]]'', which paid to test old rape kits that resulted in convictions of three people for [[Sexual assault|criminal sexual conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/08/three_men_charged_in_flint_cas.html 'Cold Justice: Sex Crimes' TV show results in charges against Flint trio] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, August 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flint Police Department has appeared in the 31st season of the reality show ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'', which aired in the summer of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nbc25news.com/news/local/flint-pd-featured-on-cops Flint PD featured on network series COPS] NBC25 (WEYI-TV)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">Criminal activity in '''[[Trinidad and Tobago]]''' has been and still is a controversial topic on the two islands. Gang Murders and murders rose every year from 1999 to 2008. Approximately 529 people were murdered in 2008, the highest number ever. In January 2018 Trinidad recorded 40 killings in the month. Nearly 500 murders per year were recorded in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2017-12-26/murder-rate%E2%80%9440-killings-month&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Port of Spain]] and its immediate environs have a higher crime rate than any other part of Trinidad. Homicides countrywide rose from fewer than 50 in the 1980s, to 97 in 1998, then to 360 in 2006 (30 murders per 100,000 persons). It rose to approximately 529 in 2008 but decreased in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ttps.gov.tt/Statistics/tabid/141/Default.aspx |title= Trinidad and Tobago Police Service website |publisher=www.ttps.gov.tt |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A common explanation is that the outbreak in murders is due to drug and gang related issues, especially in the depressed communities of East Port of Spain. Some researchers, while acknowledging the connections between gangs and violence in the area, argue that the role of illegal drugs has been overstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmaguire.net/Articles_detail/26|title=Maguire, Willis, Gantley, and Snipes (2008). "Spatial Concentrations of Violence in Trinidad and Tobago"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police administration has responded by improving the working conditions of officers, increasing the use of forensic evidence and surveillance technology (CCTV cameras) as well as hiring overseas experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ttps.gov.tt/Media/PressReleases/tabid/70/Default.aspx|title = Trinidad and Tobago Police Service website Press Releases|date =|publisher = Ttps.gov.tt|accessdate = 2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of kidnappings for ransom which were on the rise a few years ago have declined dramatically since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctntworld.com/LocalArticles.aspx?id=27648 |title=Kidnappings for ransom down |date=May 13, 2011 |publisher=Ctntworld.com |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516221538/http://www.ctntworld.com/LocalArticles.aspx?id=27648 |archivedate=2011-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12649870 |title= Police Tackle Kidnappings |publisher=NPR |date=17 August 2007 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, theft and violent crimes remain prevalent to this date, while crime and the perception of crime continues to hamper the economic prospects of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/commentaries/We_must_get_serious_about_combatting_crime-124472079.html |title= We must get serious about combatting crime |work=Trinidad Express|date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10903343|title= A Caribbean crime wave |work=The Economist |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laventille]] has some of the highest crime rates in Trinidad and Tobago, with drugs, gangs, and murders being the main problem in this community.

'''Media Lab Asia''' (MLAsia) was founded in 2001 as a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit research entity]] as a result of cooperation between the [[MIT Media Lab]] and the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Ministry of Communications and Information Technology]] of the [[Government of India]]. The objectives of MLAsia are to bring the benefits of [[Information and communications technology]] (ICT) to the people in Asia and around the world.

==Research focus==
Media Lab Asia started with the projects such as World Computer (affordable computing and access devices), Bits for All (low cost, high bandwidth connectivity) and Tomorrow's Tool (rurally relevant applications). It later switched to application development, including ICT for Healthcare, Education, Livelihood and Empowerment of Disabled. Since then, MLAsia has taken up 75 development projects. After development, the new technology is taken from the lab to pilot testing, and then for large scale deployment through a scheme of provider/user membership.

==Functional model==
MLAsia utilizes a way of growth by working with a network of  research academic and private organizations for undertaking development work. It serves as a research hub for the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs). The other partners are a combination of academic and industry R&amp;D institutions, NGOs and governmental agencies. The projects are sponsored by corporate bodies, non-profits and the government. The list of project partners has grown to more than 58.

The '''Duchers''' ({{lang-ru|дючеры}}  or дучеры) was the Russian name of the people populating the shores of the middle course of the [[Amur River]], approximately from the mouth of the [[Zeya River|Zeya]] down to the mouth of the [[Ussury]], and possibly even somewhat further downstream.&lt;ref name=amu&gt;[http://www.amurobl.ru/index.php?m=24596&amp;r=4&amp;c=2697&amp;p=3997 Амурская область: История НАРОДЫ АМУРСКОЙ ЗЕМЛИ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718030231/http://www.amurobl.ru/index.php?m=24596&amp;r=4&amp;c=2697&amp;p=3997 |date=July 18, 2011 }} (Amur Oblast - the History.

== Life of the Duchers ==
The total number of Duchers (including other related Manchu groups, but not the [[Daur people|Daurs]] or [[Evenks]]) of the Amur Valley at the time of the [[Russian–Manchu border conflicts|appearance of the Russian explorers]] in the region ca. 1650 has been estimated by modern scholars at 14,000.&lt;ref name=for/&gt;

According to the Russian explorers of the time, the Duchers, as well as the related groups, the Goguls, and their north-western neighbors, the [[Daur people|Daurs]], were agriculturalists. They grew rye, wheat, barley, millet, oats, peas, and hemp, as well as a number of vegetables. The Duchers had horses and cattle; pigs were a particularly important source of meat. They did some hunting and fishing as well.&lt;ref name=amu/&gt;

According to the 17th-century Cossacks' reports, the Duchers lived in fortified villages ({{lang-ru|городок}}) with 60 and more houses in each.
&lt;ref name=pas&gt; А.М.Пастухов (A.M. Pastukhov) [http://altaica.nm.ru/amur/gasyan.dhtml К вопросу о характере укреплений поселков приамурских племен середины XVII века и значении нанайского термина «гасян»] (Regarding the fortification techniques used in the settlements of the Amur Valley tribes in the mid-17th century, and the meaning of the [[Nanai language|Nanai]] word "гасян"  (''gasyan'')) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;The Cossack reports describe houses as ''[[yurt]]'' (юрта), but it appears from the text of other reports from the same era and region that the ''yurt'' may have refer to a variety of housing styles, and not only to the "yurt" in the modern sense.&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessor of the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] fortress [[Aigun]] (which was originally located on the left - now Russian - bank of the Amur, opposite to its later location) was  a Ducher town, currently known to the archaeologists as the Grodekovo site (Гродековское городище), after the nearby village of Grodekovo.&lt;ref name=amu/&gt;  It is located south of the city of [[Blagoveshchensk]] and the fall of the Zeya into the Amur. [[Yerofey Khabarov]] reported the existence of this town (which he called Aytyun (Айтюн))  to the [[Yakutsk]] [[voivode]] D. Frantsbekov in 1652.&lt;ref name=amu/&gt; According to the archaeologists, this fortress was first built around the end of the first or beginning of the second millennium CE.&lt;ref name=amu/&gt;

The "tribute" of furs, grain, and livestock, collected (or looted, as the case may be) by the Cossacks from the [[Daur people|Daurs]] and the Duchers was the main economic benefit derived by the Russians from their expansion in the region in the early 1650s, and, in order to deny it to them, the Qing government starting in 1654 resettled the Ducher farmers from the Amur valley to the [[Songhua River|Sungari]] and [[Mudanjiang River|Hurka]] Rivers further south. The Daurs were resettled (to the [[Nenjiang River]] Valley) as well.&lt;ref name=for/&gt; When [[Onufriy Stepanov]] visited the lower Sungari in 1656, he found the Ducher villages deserted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|E.G. Ravenstein]], ''The Russians on the Amur''.  London, 1861. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_XEEAAAAYAAJ Full text] can be found on Google Book. Pages 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Who were the Duchers? ==
The ethnic identification of the Duchers and even the meaning of their name (and whether it was also a self-name) remain controversial.&lt;ref name=pas1&gt;A.M. Pastukhov, "Regarding the fortification techniques ..." Quote: "Ученые до сих пор не пришли к единому мнению касательно языковой принадлежности этих племен [солоно-дауры (с подгруппой гогули) и дючеры]" / "Researchers still don't have a consensus regarding the linguistic affiliation of these tribes [the [[Solon language]]-[[Daur people|Daurs]] (with their ''Goguli'' subgroups) and the Duchers]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bur&gt;Бурыкин А. А. (Alexey Alexeyevich Burykin), [http://www.zaimka.ru/ethnography/burykin13.shtml Заметки об этнониме «чжурчжэни» и наименовании «чжурчжэньский язык».] (Remarks about the ethnonym "Jurchens" and the term "Jurchen language") {{ru icon}} Quotes: "наименование «дючеры» русских документов XVII века не имеет однозначного истолкования" / "the term 'Duchers' from the 17th-century Russian documents has multiple interpretations". "Под наименованием «дючеры» могут подразумеваться с равной степенью вероятности три разных этноса или этнических группы:    1. собственно чжурчжэни, ... зурчэн ...;  2. эвенки-жители бассейна реки Зеи ....;   3. некая этническая группа, которая предположительно могла войти в состав нанайцев." / "The term 'Ducher' may have referred equally likely to three different ethnic groups: 1. the Jurchens proper (zurchen) ...; 2. The [[Evenks|Evenki]] residents of the [[Zeya River]] basin ...; 3. Some ethnic group which hypothetically   could have been incorporated into the [[Nanais]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Archaeologically, the Ducher culture can be identified since the second half of the 13th century (i.e., soon after the destruction of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Empire]] by the [[Yuan Dynasty|Mongols]]), being a successor of the earlier culture of the Amur Jurchens.&lt;ref name=amu/&gt;

According to the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], today's [[Nanais|Nanai]], [[Ulchs|Ulch]], and other Tungusic people of the middle and lower Amur valley have incorporated descendants of the Duchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatchina3000.ru/great-soviet-encyclopedia/bse/036/086.htm Дючеры] (Duchers)  the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian scholar [[Boris Petrovich Polevoy|B.P. Polevoy]] goes even further, identifying the Duchers (at least, the ones from the Sungari / Ussury mouth area) with the Nanais. 
&lt;ref&gt;Б.П. Полевой (B.P. Polevoi) [http://ostrog.ucoz.ru/publikacii_2/4_53.htm О ПОДЛИННОМ МЕСТОПОЛОЖЕНИИ КОСОГОРСКОГО ОСТРОГА 50-Х гг. XVII ВЕКА] (About the true location of the Kosogorsky ''Ostrog'' of the 1650s) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, and probably  more common, view, expressed e.g. by the Russian archaeologist D.P. Bolotin or Tungusologist A.A. Burykin is that the Duchers were part of the Jurchens.&lt;ref name=bol&gt;Д.П. Болотин (D.P. Bolotin), Б.С. Сапунов (B.S. Sapunov), "[https://archive.is/20120305084716/http://www.2004site.blg.ru/project/18/drkylt.htm Древняя культура Приамурья]" (The ancient cultures of the Amur region)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bur/&gt; This would imply that after being resettled to the Sungari and the [[Mudanjiang River|Hurka]] they simply merged into the Manchu people. 

The etymology of the word "Duchers" (which, besides дючеры and дучеры, had a number of other spelling variants in the 17th-century Russian manuscripts: чючар, джучар, жучер, дючан&lt;ref name=pas/&gt;) is controversial as well.&lt;ref name=bur/&gt; Some researches hold it obvious that it is related to Jurchens' self-name, ''jušen''.&lt;ref name=pas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burykin mentions the ''zurchen'' &gt; ''dyucher'' etymology as well, as one of three possible options, but considers it unlikely.&lt;/ref&gt; Another view, expressed by A.A. Burykin, is that Russian "дючер" (''Dyucher'') may have come from [[Manchu language|Manchu]] ''zuche'', ''zuchen'', meaning "guards along the river".&lt;ref name=bur/&gt;

The '''Erzya language''' ({{lang-myv|эрзянь кель|erzänj kelj}}, {{IPA-all|ˈerʲzʲanʲ ˈkelʲ|pron}}) is spoken by about 37,000 people in the northern, eastern and north-western parts of the Republic of [[Mordovia]] and adjacent regions of [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Chuvashia]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], [[Samara Oblast|Samara]], [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov]], [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]], [[Ulyanovsk Oblast|Ulyanovsk]], [[Tatarstan]] and [[Bashkortostan]] in [[Russia]]. A [[diaspora]] can also be found in [[Armenia]], [[Estonia]] as well as in [[Kazakhstan]] and other states of [[Central Asia]]. Erzya is currently written using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] with no modifications to the variant used by the Russian language. In Mordovia, Erzya is co-official with [[Moksha language|Moksha]] and Russian.

The language belongs to the [[Mordvinic languages|Mordvinic]] branch of the [[Uralic languages]]. Erzya is a language that is closely related to [[Moksha language|Moksha]] but has distinct phonetics, morphology and vocabulary.

[[Minimal pair]]s between {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} include:
*{{IPA|/janɡa/}} "along the path", in which the alveolar {{IPA|/n/}} of the stem is retained before the prolative case ending {{IPA|/ɡa/}}, vs. {{IPA|/jaŋɡa/}}, the connegative form of the verb {{IPA|/jaŋgams/}} "to break"
*{{IPA|/jonks/}} "good", subject or object complement in {{IPA|/ks/}} translative, vs. {{IPA|/joŋks/}} "direction; area". See Rueter 2010: 58.

=== Vowels ===
{{empty section|date=August 2017}}

=== Vowel harmony ===
As in many other [[Uralic languages]], Erzya has [[vowel harmony]]. Most roots contain either [[Front vowel|front vowels]] ({{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}) or [[Back vowel|back vowels]] ({{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}). In addition, all suffixes with mid vowels have two forms: the form to be used is determined by the final syllable of the stem. The low vowel ({{IPA|/a/}}), found in the comparative case '''-шка''' (''ška'') "the size of" and the prolative '''-ка/-га/-ва''' (''ka''/''ga''/''va'') "spatial multipoint used with verbs of motion as well as position"  is a back vowel and not subject to vowel harmony.

The rules of vowel harmony are as follows:

# If the final syllable of the word stem contains a front vowel, the front form of the suffix is used: '''веле''' (''veĺe'') "village", '''велесэ''' (''veĺese'') "in a village"
# If the final syllable of the word stem contains a back vowel, and it is followed by plain (non-palatalized) consonants, the back form of the suffix is used: '''кудо''' (''kudo'') "house", '''кудосо''' (''kudoso'') "in a house"

However, if the back vowel is followed by a palatalized consonant or palatal glide, vowel harmony is violated and the "front" form of the suffix is used: '''кальсэ''' (''kaĺse'') "with willow", '''ойсэ''' (''ojse'') "with butter". Likewise, if a front-vowel stem is followed by a low back vowel suffix, subsequent syllables will contain back harmony: '''велеванзо''' (''veĺevanzo'') "throughout its villages"

Thus the seeming violations of vowel harmony attested in stems, e.g. '''узере''' (''uźere'') "axe", '''суре''' (''suŕe'') "thread (string)", are actually due to the palatalized consonants {{IPA|/zʲ/}} and {{IPA|/rʲ/}}.

One exception to front-vowel harmony is observed in palatalized non-final {{IPA|/lʲ/}}, e.g. '''асфальтсо''' (''asfaĺtso'') "with asphalt".

The '''European Day of Jewish Culture''' is an event celebrated in several countries in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eladelantado.com/noticia/local/86650/Segovia-se-suma-a-la-celebraci%C3%B3n-del-D%C3%ADa-Europeo-de-la-Cultura-Jud%C3%ADa Segovia se suma a la celebración del Día Europeo de la Cultura Judía]. "El Adelantado" Daily Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this day is to organize activities related to Jewish culture and expose them to the public, with the intention that it would reveal the cultural and historical heritage of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldiadecordoba.es/article/ocio/505584/la/jornada/la/cultura/judia/propone/viajes/lucena/y/toledo.html La Jornada de la Cultura Judía propone viajes a Lucena y Toledo]. "El Día de Córdoba" Daily Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; The activities are coordinated by the [[European Association for the Preservation and Promotion of Jewish Culture]] (AEPJ), the [[European Council of Jewish Communities]], [[B'nai B'rith|B'nai B'rith Europe]] and the [[Network of Jewish Quarters in Spain]]. The aim of this day is to promote and raise awareness of [[Jewish culture]] to the wider society in the countries where this event takes place,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salom.com.tr/news/detail/12901-Sesh-septembre-el-Diya-Evropeo-de-la-Kultura-Judiya.aspx Sesh septembre, el Diya Evropeo de la Kultura Judiya]. "Şalom" Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; in the belief that a greater awareness of the culture, tradition and life of the different communities living in the same country or city helps people to know the "other", and thus, strengthens communication and dialogue between cultures in the country.

==History==
The annual event was initiated in 1996 by the [[B'nai Brith]] of [[Strasbourg]] in the [[France|French]] département [[Bas-Rhin]] together with the local Agency for development of tourism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2378 European Day of Jewish Culture 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927220247/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2378 |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110922203129/http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/38750 European Jewish Press]&lt;/ref&gt; It now involves twenty-seven European countries including [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726202855/http://www.jewisheritage.org/jh/edjc.php?lang=1&amp;e= jewishheritage.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The original aim of the day was to permit access to, and ultimately restore, long abandoned [[synagogue]]s of architectural value like those of [[Wolfisheim]], [[Westhoffen]], [[Pfaffenhoffen]], [[Struth]], [[Diemeringen]], [[Ingwiller]] or [[Mackenheim]].
In 2000, a partnership was created between [[B'nai B'rith]] and the other organizations that currently participate in organizing the day's events.

==Activities==
On this day exhibitions, concerts, panel discussions, lectures and excursions are organized in many [[Europe]]an countries. Topics such as [[Jewish Quarter (diaspora)|Jewish neighborhoods]], the coexistence of cultures, exhibitions on sculpture, painting, print, music and Jewish religious objects are discussed.

*Eating out - [[restaurant]]s, [[Coffeehouse|cafe]]s, [[takeaway]]s
*Drinking - [[pub]]s and bars
*Culture and entertainment - theatres, cinemas, [[live music]] and [[live comedy|comedy]] events, [[ten pin bowling]], [[ice skating]]
*Sport - spectator sports including [[association football|football]], [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[greyhound racing]] often take place in the evening, especially during Mondays to Fridays.
*Healthcare, police and firefighting

==Benefits and drawbacks==

*[[Recreation]] for people, which is often welcome after finishing work for the day
*Increased [[employment]] due to local spending
*Reduced [[social exclusion]] and increased vitality in towns

The drawbacks can include:
*[[Noise pollution]]

The '''Global Landscapes Forum''' ('''GLF''') is a knowledge-led multi-stakeholder forum dedicated to promoting the [[Integrated landscape management|landscape approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/blog/recognizing-common-ground-finding-meaning-in-integrated-landscape-management/ |title=Recognizing Common Ground: Finding Meaning in Integrated Landscape Management |last1=Friedman |first1=Rachel |last2=Shames |first2=Seth |last3=Sherr |first3=Sara |date=November 13, 2013 |website=EcoAgriculture Partners |access-date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The GLF is the largest knowledge-led platform on sustainable land use. Since 2013, over 3,900 organizations and 150,000 people have taken part in Forum events in person and online. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globallandscapesforum.org/about/what-is-glf|title=What is the Global Landscapes Forum? - Global Landscapes Forum|work=Global Landscapes Forum|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by the [[Center for International Forestry Research]] (CIFOR).

== History ==
The inaugural GLF event took place alongside to [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP 19) in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/11/17/1256032/-Warsaw-Global-Landscape-Forum-Lanches-Alongside-COP19 |title=Warsaw: Global Landscape Forum Launches Alongside COP19 |last=Phelan |first=Deborah |date=November 17, 2013 |website=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It heralded the merger of [[International Day of Forests|Forest Day]] and [[Agriculture and Rural Development Day]], reflecting a scientific climate that favored breaking down research silos and utilizing an integrated landscape approach.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/11958/forest-day-time-to-move-on|title=Forest Day – time to move on|date=2012-12-02|work=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first four major GLF events were held annually on the sidelines of the [[United Nations Climate Change conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]].

Following a major funding injection from the German government, the GLF moved to establish a [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] in [[Bonn]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.globallandscapesforum.org/glf-marrakesh/pressroom/cop22-german-government-supports-establishment-global-landscapes-forum-bonn/|title=COP22: German government supports establishment of Global Landscapes Forum in Bonn - 2016 Global Landscapes Forum: Marrakesh|work=2016 Global Landscapes Forum: Marrakesh|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of an effort on the part of the German government and the city of Bonn to establish a "sustainability cluster" in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bonn-international.org/international-profile/sustainability-cluster.html|title=Sustainability cluster - Bonn International|website=www.bonn-international.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners ==

CIFOR serves as the implementing organization of the GLF, and the current coordinating partners are the [[World Bank]], and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].

As of 2017, the host country partners are the German [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] (BMUB) and [[Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (BMZ).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cifor.org/corporate-news/german-government-pledges-commitment-global-landscapes-forum-promote-research-connect-results-communities-ground/|title=German Government supports establishment of Global Landscapes Forum in Bonn|work=Center for International Forestry Research|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

=== Predecessor Events ===
Following a move towards more integrated landscape approaches in both the [[forestry]] and [[agriculture]] sides of the research for [[Development aid|development]] sphere, the Global Landscapes Forum was born out of a merger of [[Global Landscapes Forum#Forest Day|Forest Day]] and [[Global Landscapes Forum#Agriculture and Rural Development Day (ARDD)|Agriculture and Rural Development Day]] (ARDD), both of which were formerly long-standing side events at the [[United Nations Climate Change conference]] (COP).

==== Forest Day  ====
{{Main|International Day of Forests}}
Forest Day was an annual COP side event co-organized by CIFOR and the [[Collaborative Partnership on Forests]], since the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP13) in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of 2012, by resolution of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on November 28, 2012, Forest Day became the [[International Day of Forests]].&lt;ref name=declaration&gt;[http://www.fao.org/forestry/36014-063ec88fa19cab1dfe473d7813290b32.pdf "International Day of Forests,"] United Nations General Assembly, November 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the sixth and final Forest Day was held on the sidelines of the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP18) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].

====Agriculture and Rural Development Day ====
{{Main|Agriculture and Rural Development Day}}
Agriculture and Rural Development Day (ARDD) was an annual COP side event. The first event took place as a side event at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ARDDay2009/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2009 Website|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and final ARDD, called Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5 (ALL-5), took place alongside Forest Day on the sidelines of the COP18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wle.cgiar.org/thrive/2012/12/05/story-agriculture-and-climate-change-road-we%E2%80%99ve-travelled|title=The Story of Agriculture and Climate Change: The Road We’ve Travelled|date=2012-12-05|work=Water, Land and Ecosystems|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Events ===
The first major GLF event took place in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] during the [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP19).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/19350/a-sustainable-development-goal-on-landscapes-setting-the-agenda-at-cop19-in-warsaw|title=A Sustainable Development Goal on Landscapes: Setting the agenda at COP19 in Warsaw|date=2013-10-04|work=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the major injection of funding from the German government during the [[Global Landscapes Forum#Marrakesh 2016: Climate Action for Sustainable Development|Marrakesh event]], the GLF moved to establish a more permanent presence in Bonn, Germany. While the [[2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP23) was held in Bonn the same year from November 6–17, 2017, the Global Landscapes Forum event took place just over a month later on December 19–20, 2017. This marked the first year that the GLF existed as its own entity and not as a COP side event. For the first time, the [[Wangari Maathai#Wangari Maathai Forest Champion Award|Wangari Maathai Forest Champion Award]] was presented at the GLF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpfweb.org/93397/en/|title=Collaborative Partnership on Forests|last=Nations|first=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United|website=www.cpfweb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thematic Events ===
The first Investment Case event took place on June 10–11, 2015 at the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It was an invitation-only symposium with 220 attendees from the finance sector.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globallandscapesforum.org/publication/london-final-report/|title=Global Landscapes Forum: The Investment Case — Final Report - Global Landscapes Forum|work=Global Landscapes Forum|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was coordinated by the [[European Investment Bank]], UN Environment, the World Bank, and the [[Program on Forests]] (PROFOR). Sessions were hosted by the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD), [[Unilever]], and the [[Climate Bonds Initiative]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The roadmap from this event were presented at a land use side event [[World Forestry Congress#14th World Forestry Congress: Durban, South Africa, 2015|14th World Forestry Congress]] (WFC XIV) in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cifor.org/wfc-2015/session/wednesday/toward-roadmap-sustainable-landscape-investments-at-scale/|title=Toward a roadmap for sustainable landscape investments at scale: Inputs from forestry science|work=Center for International Forestry Research|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theme of which was ''Forests and People: Investing in a Sustainable Future''.

Other key outcomes were presented to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) workplan for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecoagriculture.org/event/global-landscapes-forum-the-investment-case/|title=EcoAgriculture Partners {{!}}   Global Landscapes Forum: The Investment Case|website=ecoagriculture.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National and Policy Dialogues ===
Riau, Indonesia 2017: Laws and Best Practices for Reducing Fire and Haze

The [[AFR100]] initiative was launched at the GLF in Paris, 2015, and is also supported by the German government. Thus the GLF supported the Second Annual Partnership Conference in 2017, which brought together 23 partner countries, restoration champions, and technical partners such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), [[New Partnership for Africa's Development|New Partnership for Africa’s Development]] (NEPAD Agency), and [[World Vision International|World Vision]].

Organized with CIFOR, this policy dialogue workshop looked at gender-responsive [[Forest restoration#Forest landscape restoration|Forest and Landscape Restoration]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2702">The '''Halbert L. Dunn Award''' is the most prestigious award presented by the [[National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems]] (NAPHSIS). The award has been presented since 1981 providing national recognition of outstanding and lasting contributions to the field of vital and health statistics at the national, state, or local level.  &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://naphsis-web.sharepoint.com/about/Pages/hldaward.aspx|title=Halbert L. Dunn Award|publisher=NAPHSIS|accessdate=8 November 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The award was established in honor of the late [[Halbert L. Dunn]], M.D., Director of the National Office of Vital Statistics from 1936 to 1960.  Dr. Dunn was highly instrumental in encouraging the states to establish state vital statistics associations and played a major role in developing NAPHSIS.  The award is presented at the Hal Dunn Awards Luncheon during the association’s annual meeting.

'''High, middle and low justices''' are notions dating from Western [[feudalism]] to indicate descending degrees of judiciary power to administer justice by the maximal punishment the holders could inflict upon their subjects and other dependents.

Low justice regards the  level of day-to-day civil actions, including voluntary justice, minor pleas, and petty offences generally settled by fines or light corporal punishment. It was held by many petty authorities, including many [[Lord of the manor|lords of the manor]], who sat in justice over the [[serf]]s, unfree tenants, and freeholders on their land. 
Middle justice would involve full civil and criminal jurisdiction, except for capital crimes, and notably excluding the right to pass the [[death penalty]], [[torture]] and severe [[corporal punishment]], which was reserved to authorities holding high justice, or the ''ius gladii'' ("right of the sword").

==Pyramid of feudal justice==
Although the terms ''high'' and ''low'' suggest a strict subordination, this was not quite the case; a case could often be brought in any of several courts, with the principle of "prevention" (in the etymological sense of Latin ''praevenire'', "to come before") granting [[jurisdiction]] to the court in which the case was first filed or otherwise brought.

As a rule, each court administered justice in general (criminal cases were generally not separate from civil actions and other types of justice, while certain matters were separated such as [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]), as long as the matter was not reserved for a higher court or by virtue of some ''[[privilegium fori]]'' (e.g., of clerics to be judged in canon courts by other clergy, sometimes under ecclesiastical law, the origin of the English [[Common law|common-law]] concept—[[benefit of clergy]]). In addition to civil and criminal trials, the notion of justice also included ''voluntary justice'', which is really the official recording of deeds (unilateral or bilateral) such as marital agreements, wills, grants, etc.

A right of appeal was not automatically available, only when explicitly established, and if so not always to a court of the superior political level and/or a higher degree of our trio. In fact, feudal justice was a labyrinth of specific customs and rules in nearly endless variation, not governed by any clear legal logic, and subject to significant historical evolution in time, though the largely [[customary law]] tended by nature to be quite conservative. In judicial matters—as in all spheres of life—feudal society did not see uniformity as either possible or necessarily desirable, each town and region having its own customs and ways of doing things, and resented attempts to interfere with them.

While the right of justice is held by many "unique" courts, relatively strong states make it a pillar of their absolutist (re)emergence to establish numerous courts to administer justice in their name in different territorial circumscriptions, such as the royal (high) sheriffs in England, and/or to impose an appeal (at least unifying the law as such) to a royal court, as to the various French provincial [[parlement]]s.

==High justice==
{{see|Capital punishment in Germany}}
[[File:Hand of justice Louvre MS85.jpg|thumb|150px|Hand of justice displayed at the [[Louvre]], Paris]]
High justice, also known as  ''ius gladii'' ("right of the sword") or in German as ''Blutgerichtsbarkeit'', ''Blutgericht'' (lit. "blood justice", "blood-court";&lt;ref&gt;"blood-court" is a literal of {{lang-de|Blutgericht}}; 
The ''Dictionary of the English and German Languages'' by Christoph Friedrich Grieb (1863) translates the term simply as "a criminal court".&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes also ''Halsgericht'', lit. "neck-justice", or ''peinliches Gericht''&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexika.digitale-sammlungen.de/adelung/lemma/bsb00009132_3_0_452 Halsgericht] in [[Johann Christoph Adelung|Adelung]],  ''Grammatisch-kritisches Wörterbuch der Hochdeutschen Mundart'' (1774–1786).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the highest penal authority, including [[capital punishment]], as held by a sovereign—the [[sword of justice]] and hand of justice are [[regalia]] that symbolize it.  In the early [[Holy Roman Empire]], high justice was reserved to the [[king of Germany|king]]. From the 13th century, it was transferred to the king's [[feudalism|vassals]] along with their fiefs.
The first codification of capital punishment was the ''Halsgerichtsordnung'' passed by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1499, followed in 1507 by the ''Constitutio Criminalis Bambergensis''. Both codes formed the basis of the ''Constitutio Criminalis Carolina'' (CCC), passed in  1532 under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. In the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], all regional codes were superseded by the ''Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana'' in 1768.

The ''Blutbanner'' ("blood banner") or ''Blutfahne'' ("blood flag") was a solid red flag. It was presented to feudal lords as a symbol of their power of high jurisdiction (''Blutgerichtsbarkeit'') together with the heraldic banner of the fief. Some feudal houses adopted a red field symbolic of the blood banner into their coat of arms, the so-called ''Regalienfeld''.
The [[Talschaft]] ([[forest canton]]) of [[canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] used the blood banner as a [[war flag]] from ca. 1240, and was later incorporated into the [[flag of Schwyz]] and the [[flag of Switzerland]].

Often it is proudly displayed, in the form of relevant status symbols. Thus permanent [[gallows]] are often erected in prominent public places; the very word for them in French, ''potence'', is derived from the Latin "potentia" meaning "power".

High justice is held by all states and the highest vassals in the European type of feudal society, but may also be acquired by other authorities as part of a high degree of legal autonomy, such as certain cities; which in time often obtained other high privileges originally reserved for high nobility and sometimes high clergy.  Other such privileges could include a seat in a [[diet (assembly)|diet]] or a similar feudal representative assembly, before the [[Estates of the realm|third estate]] as such even aspired to such "parliamentary" representation, or the right to [[mint (coin)|mint]] coins. These privileges indicating its so-called ''liberty'' was an "equal" enclave in the territorial jurisdiction of the neighboring feudal (temporal or ecclesiastical) Lord, sometimes even extending rather like a ''[[polis]]'' in Antiquity.

Not every [[Vogt]] held high justice. Up to the 18th century, for example, the blood court of much of what is now the [[canton of Zürich]] lay with [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]], even in the territory ruled by the counts of [[Greifensee]].  The self-administration of the blood court was an important factor of [[Imperial immediacy]].

The '''history of the Jews in Haiti''' is a rather long and complex one, as it stretches from the very beginning of the European settlement on the new island.

As of 2013, the Jewish population is around 25 predominately in [[Port-au-Prince]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/haiti.html |title=Haiti |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The first Jewish settlement===
In 1492, the first [[Jews|Jew]] to ever set foot in Haiti was [[Luis de Torres]],&lt;ref name="JTA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2004/02/13/archive/around-the-jewish-world-as-haiti-burns-its-few-jews-choose-business-over-politics |title=Around the Jewish World As Haiti Burns, Its Few Jews Choose Business over Politics |editor=Press |date=13 February 2004 |publisher=JTA (Jewish Telegraphic Agency) |accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an interpreter for [[Christopher Columbus]]. After Haiti was taken over and colonized by the French in 1633, many Dutch Jews (whom many were [[Marrano]]) emigrated from [[Brazil]] in 1634 and became employees of the French sugar plantations and further developed the trade. In 1683, the Jews were expelled from Haiti and all of the other French colonies, due to the [[Code Noir]] ''(Black Code)'', which not only restricted the activities of free Negroes, but forbade the exercise of any religion other than [[Roman Catholic]]ism (it included a provision that all slaves must be baptized and instructed in the Roman Catholic religion), and in turn ordered all the Jews out of France's colonies. However, despite the Black Code, a limited number of Jews remained in French trading companies as leading officials, including foreign citizens ([[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Danish people|Danish]], or [[English people|English]]) or holders of special residence permits ''(lettres patentes)''. These Jews specialized in agricultural plantations. [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] Jews from [[Bordeaux]] and [[Bayonne]] settled mainly in the [[Tiburon Peninsula, Haiti|southern part]] of Haiti ([[Jacmel]], [[Jérémie]], [[Léogâne]], [[Les Cayes]], [[Petit-Goâve]], and [[Port-au-Prince]]) and Jews from [[Curaçao]] settled in the northern part ([[Cap-Haitien]], and [[Saint-Louis-du-Nord|Saint Louis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_03964.html |title=Caribbeans, Spanish--Portuguese Nation of the: La Nacion |accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbell|first=Mordehay|title=The Jewish Nation of the Caribbean: The Spanish-Portuguese Jewish Settlements in the Caribbean and the Guianas|year=2002|publisher=Gefen Publishing House|isbn=965-229-279-6|pages=170, 292}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, in the mid-1700s, many Jews returned to Haiti and were later murdered or expelled during the slave revolt led by [[Toussaint Louverture]] in 1804, as many Jews also arrived from civil strife in Poland (with the invading Russia, Prussia and Austria).

Due to a lack of Sunday school and Jewish community centers, many youth did not grow up with a Jewish education and had to hide their Judaism because only Catholics were permitted to attend public school. Many Jews preferred to settle on the coastline, in port cities as many Jews were involved in commerce and trade establishing communities in major industry centers. Recently, archaeologists have uncovered an ancient synagogue of [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]] in the city of [[Jérémie]], the only one found on the island. Several Jewish tombstones have also been found in port cities such as [[Cap-Haïtien]] and [[Jacmel]].&lt;ref name="JTA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virtual Jewish World"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/haiti.html|title=The Virtual Jewish World: Haiti|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 30 Jewish families by the end of the 19th century have arrived from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]]. A law in France was passed during this period that gave French citizenship to minorities in the Americas; thus many Jews from the Middle East felt secure emigrating to Haiti. These Jews in particular, brought with them their many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] customs and traditions.

==Modern Times==
[[File:Haitian passport issued to Jewish holocaust survivor, stamped in Argentina July 1941.jpg|thumb|right|Passport issued to Hans Erich Max Emden by the Haitian government, who managed to escape the holocaust. In 1941 he used it to travel to Argentina.]]
In 1915, during the [[United States occupation of Haiti]], roughly 200 Jews lived in Haiti at the time. During the 20 years period of occupation, many Jews left Haiti for the United States and [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Virtual Jewish World"/&gt; In 1937, Haiti was responsible for saving about 70 [[Jews|Jewish]] families (an estimated total of up to 300 lives) during the [[Holocaust]] (according to the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]), by issuing passports and visas to Jews escaping [[Nazi]] persecution.&lt;ref name="Virtual Jewish World"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdc.org/jdc-field-blog/2010/from-the-archives-haiti.html |title=From the Archives: Haiti Helped Holocaust Refugees |editor=Press |date=28 January 2010 |publisher=American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee |accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were [[Austria]]n Jews, [[Poland|Polish]] Jews, [[Germany|German]] Jews, and a trickle of [[Romania]]n Jew and [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Jewish descent. While these numbers are not as high as the number of Jewish families that [[Oskar Schindler]] helped save, a life is a life as Haiti played a small, yet critical role in saving Jewish lives during the darkest chapter in the Jewish story&lt;ref name="Kreyollicious"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kreyolicious.com/haiti-history-101-haitis-role-in-saving-jewish-families-during-the-holocaust/3976/ |title=Haiti History 101: Haiti’s Role in Saving Jewish Families During the Holocaust |author=KAT |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, though, it seems that more Jews were unable to acquire visas to Haiti due to the cost. Professor David Bankier, of the Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that after 1938, ''“the cost [of a visa] was outrageous: If you wanted to go to Haiti, you had to pay $5,000.”''&lt;ref name="Virtual Jewish World"/&gt; Haiti at the time, was still unfairly paying reparations on an exorbitant debt with interest fees to France after the [[Haitian Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/france-asked-to-return-money-extorted-from-haiti/ |title=France Asked to Return Money ‘Extorted’ From Haiti |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could have hindered their efforts to continue issuing these visas for free. There were others apart from this bunch who never came to Haiti at all, but from Germany they were given Haitian passports by the Haitian government that allowed them to flee Germany and into other countries.&lt;ref name="Kreyollicious"/&gt; Grateful to the Haitian government, many of these European Jews stayed in Haiti until the late 1950s in which many Haitian Jews left, so that their children could marry other Jews and not assimilate, while finding better economic opportunities. The 1957 Jewish population of Haiti was about 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Haiti |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/haiti |publisher=[[The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot]] |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-20th century was a time where a continued departure of Jews from Haiti for the United States and Panama because of the economic conditions and civil violence in the country.&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"/&gt;

===Judaism===

Today, the Jewish community is led by Rabbi Douglas Lapin, a local businessman.  The Jewish community is known as the "Consistoire d'Haiti" and has been recognized as the representative of the Jewish community by the Haitian Ministry of Religion (Ministere des Cultes) &lt;Rep. d'Haiti; Ministere des Cultes DG/909 6 fevrier 2017&gt;.  Rabbi Lapin has likewise been recognized as the Rabbi in Haiti by the Haitian government&lt;Tribunal de Premiere Instance de Port au Prince; Recipisse No. 3710084007-7; 4 Octobre 2017&gt;.  The community is very small and mostly consists of UN, NGO, and diplomatic personnel, although there are a small number of Haitian Jewish families.  The community does Kosher chicken slaughtering (shkita) and has occasional gatherings for Jewish festivals such as Succos and Purim.  There is also an Esrog, Myrtle (Hadasim) and Willow (Aravos) plantation to supply local needs for Succos.
The community is working on developing a synagogue and community center.  There is a complete library of Jewish liturgical books (seforim), Megillas Esther and Sefer Torah.

===Business===

The 1960s was a time of wealth and high hopes of large future development for Haiti. At the time met many family Jewish names such as: Alvarez, Cardozo, Cohen, Dreyfus, Goldman, Hakim, Hillel, Khan, Monsanto, Pereira, Salzmann, Silveira, and Weiner, which most had forgotten their ethno-religious backgrounds. Today, less than a hundred Jews remain in Haiti on its 9.5 million inhabitants; however, the Weiners (coffee exporters) and the Salzmanns (refugees from Austria) are still today relevant in trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehaitianculture.blogspot.com/2013_05_01_archive.html |title=First Jews In Haiti |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desinfos.com/spip.php?page=article&amp;id_article=16680 |title=Haïti, les Juifs et Israël |editor=Yerouchalmi |date=17 January 2010 |publisher=Des Infos |accessdate=21 December 2015}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Inland Gulf languages''' are a [[language family|family]] of [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] in the classifications of [[Stephen Wurm]] (1975) and [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] (2005). The unity of the languages was established by K. Franklin in 1969. Although the family as a whole is clearly valid, Ipiko is quite distinct from the other languages.

'''Italian colonists''' were settled in the '''Dodecanese Islands''' of the [[Aegean Sea]] in the 1930s by the [[Fascist]] [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] government of [[Benito Mussolini]], Italy having been in occupation of the Islands since the [[Italian-Turkish War]] of 1911.

By 1940, the number of Italians settled in the Dodecanese was almost 8,000, concentrated mainly in [[Rhodes]]. In 1947, after the [[World War II|Second World War]], the islands came into the possession of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]]: as a consequence  most of the Italians were forced to emigrate and all of the Italian schools were closed. However, their architectural legacy is still evident, especially in Rhodes and [[Leros]].

==History==
[[File:Hafenmarkt Rhodos02.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Market ("Nea Agora") of Mandraki, built during the Italian period.]]

The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] occupied the [[Dodecanese]] Islands in the [[Aegean sea]] during the [[Italo-Turkish War|Italian-Turkish war]] of 1911. In the 1919 Venizelos-Tittoni Agreement, Italy promised to cede the overwhelmingly Greek-inhabited islands, except Rhodes, to [[Greece]], but this treaty was never implemented due to the Greek catastrophe in Asia Minor. With the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923, the Dodecanese was formally annexed by Italy, as the ''Possedimenti Italiani dell'Egeo''.

In the 1930s, Mussolini embarked on a program of [[Italianization]], hoping to make the island of Rhodes a modern transportation hub that would serve as a focal point for the spread of Italian culture in [[Greece]] and the [[Levant]]. The Fascist program did have some positive effects in its attempts to modernize the islands, resulting in the eradication of [[malaria]], the construction of hospitals, [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]], a [[power plant]] to provide Rhodes' capital with [[electric lighting]] and the establishment of the Dodecanese [[Cadastre]].

The main castle of the Knights of St. John was also rebuilt. The concrete-dominated architectural style blended in with the islands' picturesque scenery (and also reminded the inhabitants of Italian rule), but has consequently been largely demolished or remodeled, apart from the famous example of the [[Leros]] town of Lakki (founded by the Italians as ''Portolago''), which remains a prime example of Italian [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]].

From 1923 to 1936, governor [[Mario Lago]] was able to integrate the Greek, [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino Jewish]] communities of the island of Rhodes with the Italian colonists. Lago's term of office constituted what might in retrospective be called the "Golden Period" of the Italian Dodecanese, with the economy booming and a relatively harmonious society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dodecaneso.org/2336a.htm |title=Gli anni dorati 1923 - 1936  |publisher=Dodecaneso|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Offices of the Prefecture of the Dodecanese 02.jpg|thumb|right|Former ''Palazzo Governale'']]

In the 1936 Italian census of the Dodecanese islands, the total population was 129,135, of which 7,015 were Italians. Nearly 80% of the Italian colonists lived in the island of [[Rhodes]]. Approximately 40,000 Italian soldiers and sailors were on military duty in the Dodecanese islands in 1940.

The appointment of Fascist [[Quadrumvirs|quadrumvir]] [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]] as governor of the [[Italian Aegean Islands]] in 1936 marked a turning point. De Vecchi promoted a more vigorous and forceful program of Italianization, which was only interrupted by Italy's entry in World War II in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ3gVGqB1uQC&amp;pg=PA436&amp;lpg=PA436&amp;dq=de+vecchi+dodecanese+italian+language&amp;source=web&amp;ots=gIgR81ZYv9&amp;sig=2gIp1imYJUVYZH6iSY9gfq0KXck#PPA436,M1 |title=Rough Guide to the Dodecanese &amp; East Aegean islands |first=Marc Stephen |last=Dubin |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-85828-883-3 |page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, he promoted the possible unification of the islands to Italy as part of the fascist ideal of an [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Imperial Italy]].

During [[World War II]], Italy joined the [[Axis Powers]], and used the Dodecanese as a naval staging area for its invasion of [[Crete]] in 1940. After the [[Armistice with Italy|surrender of Italy]] in September 1943, the islands briefly became a battleground between the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]], [[British Commonwealth|British]] and the Italians (the [[Dodecanese Campaign]]). The Germans prevailed, and although they were driven out of mainland Greece in 1944, the Dodecanese remained occupied until the end of the war in 1945, during which time nearly the entire Jewish population of 6,000 was [[the Holocaust|deported and killed]]. Only 1200 of these [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking Jews survived, thanks to their lucky escape to the nearby coast of Turkey with some help from the Italian colonists of Rhodes. In the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] in 1947, the islands were ceded to Greece.

==Disappearance of the Italian community==

For the nearly 8,000 Italian colonists, after the Italian defeat in [[World War II]], started a process of return to Italy and successive disappearance. The Dodecanese officially passed from Italy to Greece in 1947, and in that year all the Italian schools were closed. Some of the Italian colonists remained in Rhodes and were quickly assimilated. Actually only a few dozen old colonists remain, but the influence of their legacy is evident in the relative diffusion of the [[Italian language]] mainly in [[Rhodes]] and Leros.

==Architectural legacy==

[[File:RodiScuolaMaschile17mm.JPG|thumb|left|Men's High School (Scuola Maschile)]]


The citadel of [[Rhodes, Greece|Rhodes city]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] thanks in great part to the large-scale restoration work carried out by the Italian authorities. The [[Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes]] formed the centerpiece of this project, after being largely destroyed by an ammunition explosion in 1856.

In the 1920s, the Italians demolished the houses that were built in and around the city walls during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period. They also turned the Jewish and Ottoman cemeteries into a green zone surrounding the Medieval Town. The Italians preserved what was left from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]]' period, and destroyed all other Ottoman buildings that weren't of importance. Furthermore, in those years an "Institute for the study of the History and Culture of the Dodecanese region" was established, and major infrastructure work was done to modernize Rhodes. Buildings like the Aquarium were built, mainly in [[art deco]] style.

Indeed, in all the Dodecanese islands remains a huge architectural legacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dodecaneso.org/arch.htm |title=Architettura |publisher=Dodecaneso|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Italian colonists. Here are some examples:
* The ''Grande Albergo delle Rose'' (now "Casino Rodos") built by [[Florestano Di Fausto]] and Michele Platania in 1927, with a mix of Arab, Byzantine and Venetian styles.
* The ''Casa del Fascio'' of Rhodes, built in 1939 in typical fascist style. It serves now as the City Hall.
* The ''Catholic church of San Giovanni'', built in 1925 by Rodolfo Petracco, as a reconstruction of the medieval cathedral church of the Knights of St. John.
* The ''Teatro Puccini'' of the city of Rhodes, now called "National Theater", built in 1937 with 1,200 seats.
* The ''Palazzo del Governatore'' in downtown Rhodes, built in 1927 in Venetian style. It now houses the offices of the Prefecture of the Dodecanese.
* The ''Villaggio rurale San Benedetto'', now Kolymbia village, built in 1938 as a planned model village with all modern services.
* The ''Community of Portolago'' (now Lakki) in the island of Leros, built in 1938 in typical Italian Deco style.

'''Kerala Iyers''' or '''Bhattars''',  are [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Brahmins]] of the Indian state of [[Kerala]] &amp;mdash; people who were residents in the Kerala region, and also people who migrated from present day [[Tamil Nadu]]. The community consists of two groups - the [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] Iyers and Iyers of the [[Cochin]] and [[Travancore]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zamorins and the political culture of medieval Kerala|last=Haridas|first=V. V.|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=2016|isbn=9788125061281|location=Hyderabad|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerala Iyers, like the Iyers of Tamil Nadu and the [[Nambudiri]]s of Kerala,  belonged to the [[Pancha-Dravida]] classification of India's Brahmin community. They mostly belonged to the [[Vadama]] and [[Brahacharanam]] sub-sects. Iyers were usually not recruited as the priest (shanthi) in Kerala  temples which followed [[Tantra|Tantric]] rituals. Furthermore, in the past, the orthodox Nambudiri Brahmins considered the touch of a Tamil Brahmin to be taboo (Eda Shudam), and required a Nambudiri to bathe before resuming ritual activities. Such practices have now disappeared with the criminalisation of untouchability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/sudham.htm http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/sudham.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
So Iyers being Vedic scholars built their own temples in their [[Agraharams]] to conduct pooja, since they followed the Agama rituals and not the Tantric rituals of the Nambudiris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Temples_of_Kerala Temples of Kerala]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brahmana Samooham ==
Where ever they settled, the Kerala Iyers lived together in communities. The settlement consisting of array of houses and other amenities developed by Tamil Brahmins in Kerala came to be known as [[Agraharam]] as in other parts of South India. Each Agraharam consist of two rows of houses facing each other. There is no courtyard but only common street. Several such Agraharams together form an organization called "Samooham".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People of India: Kerala, Volume-27, Part-3|last=Menon|first=T.

Ltd.|year=2002|isbn=8185938997|location=New Delhi|pages=1396-97}}&lt;/ref&gt; There existed 95 Agraharams in Kerala where Brahmins lived in peace, with unity, equality and simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 2014|title=Brahmins and Agraharams|url=http://www.brahmintoday.org/issues/2014/bt201401_front.php|journal=Brahmin Today|location=Chennai|publisher=Vacha Publication|volume=10|issue=11|pages=|access-date=23 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 18th century onwards Tamil Brahmins started establishing "Samooha Madoms". These were common gathering places for get together, conducting religious rites and rituals, cultural events and so on. Samooha Madoms were physically located in close proximity to the temple of the main Village Deity for the convenience of all members. It is believed that as much as 250 Samooha Modoms were established by Tamil Brahmins throughout Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2013|title=Editorial|url=|journal=42nd Annual General Body News Supplement|location=Alappuzha|publisher=Kerala Brahmana Sabha|volume=|pages=1-3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (KBS 2012 – Editorial){{full|date=September 2018}} This was done with the active aid and support of the rulers of the locality. These Samooha Madoms were known by various names such as Brahmana Samooham, Gramajana Samooham, Grama Samudayam and Grama Samooham.

The Palakkad Iyers were greatly affected by the [[Kerala Agrarian Relations Bill, 1957]] (repealed in 1961 and substituted by [[The Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963]]) which abolished the [[tenancy]] system.&lt;ref name="keralagovt_legislations"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://niyamasabha.org/codes/bus_1_1.htm|title=Landmark Legislations - Land Reforms|accessdate=2008-08-27|publisher=Kerala Legislative Assembly|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travancore Iyers ==
During the rule of Travancore kings, many Iyers (Tamil Brahmins) were invited to [[Thiruvananthapuram]] for administrative requirements of Travancore kingdom and for participating in rituals related to [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple]]. Some [[Padamangalam Nair]]s involved in temple service are thought to be descendants of Travancore Iyers. The migration continued for decades, and thus Iyer population is concentrated around this temple in Trivandrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/agraharams-on-the-way-out/article2305300.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=T. | last=Nandakumar | title=Agraharams on the way out?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[light brown apple moth]]''' (''Epiphyas postvittana'', often abbreviated to LBAM) is a leafroller [[moth]] belonging to the [[lepidoptera]]n family [[Tortricidae]].  The moth was confirmed to be present in mainland United States in 2007, principally along the West Coast. The State of California and the US Department of Agriculture quickly imposed quarantine measures and decided to use aerial spraying of cities with pesticides to try to eradicate the moth.  This led to substantial public controversy and claims of adverse health effects.  Aerial spraying was discontinued in 2008.  Trapping, monitoring, and inspection efforts were reduced or eliminated in 2012 due to budget problems.

== Light brown apple moth ==
The insect is regarded as an [[herbivorous]] [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]], and the larvae consume numerous plant crops in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. The species is native to Australia and is found in New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Hawaii.

The moth has been classified as a noxious insect in the United States and Canada, but not in Europe.  This has resulted in restrictions on produce from Mexico and Canada under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].

==Eradication measures==

In late 2007, the moth eradication program controversially included [[aerial application|aerial spraying]] of a product containing ''E. postvittana'' attractant sex pheromones as its active ingredient over sixty square miles near the Pacific coast between [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/phpps/pdep/lbam/lbam_main.html CDFA Light Brown Apple Moth Project]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] authorized the aerial spraying of the pheromone spray every 30 days until 2010.  In June 2008, the State of California announced that it was abandoning plans for aerial spraying over population centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2012, the state cut funding for the pest control program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19930651|title=Five years after the light brown apple moth scare, California quietly stops funding moth-control programs|last=Rogers|first=Paul|date=10 February 2012|newspaper=The San Jose Mercury–News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, a California appeals court ruled against the LBAM pesticide program on the grounds that it violated state environmental laws.&lt;ref name="earthjustice.org"&gt;[http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2015/health-environmental-groups-win-victory-in-apple-moth-pesticide-lawsuit HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WIN VICTORY IN APPLE MOTH PESTICIDE LAWSUIT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though the first light brown apple moth confirmed in [[California]] by DNA analysis was found in February 2007, scientists like James Carey, a professor of [[entomology]] at the [[University of California-Davis]] and associate editor on several journals, believes, based on his previous experience with the gypsy moth program, that the light brown apple moth has likely lived in California for years and possibly decades (in part because it is so widespread, from Los Angeles to north of San Francisco).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/03/06/MN69VD309.DTL&amp;hw=moth&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 Experts question plan to spray to fight moths]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zc7I_o0M6E UC Scientists Speak Out]&lt;/ref&gt;  The debate over how long the moth has been in the state has not yet been resolved.  Questions about the rationale for the timing of the spray program suggest that it appears be more closely related to agricultural quarantines from Mexico and Canada than other factors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.marinij.com/opinion/ci_8712142 Larry Bragman: Will U.S. trade policy again trump public health?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, since the moths appear unlikely to survive in typical conditions of much of the agricultural areas of the state of California, such as in the extremely high temperatures of the Central Valley, some question the level of crop damage possible.  One paper states:

:"Hot, dry conditions may reduce populations significantly, and it is unknown whether the insect will be able to establish in locations such as the Central Valley and inland deserts of California. . . . In California, light brown apple moth has been detected on agricultural lands mostly in production and retail nurseries located near urban areas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://californiaagriculture.ucop.edu/0802AMJ/pdfs/ca6202p57.pdf Light brown apple moth’s arrival in California worries commodity groups]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the confirmation of the presence of the moth in California by the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS), the [[California Department of Food and Agriculture]] issued a State Interior Quarantine order restricting intrastate shipment of plant material from counties where LBAM had been found. APHIS later issued a Federal Domestic Quarantine order on May 2, 2007, with restrictions on interstate shipment of plant material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/lba_moth/downloads/LBAM_IPM_UCDavis.pdf Light Brown Apple Moth in California: Quarantine, Management, and Potential Impacts]&lt;/ref&gt;  CDFA officials, together with the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], initiated what they described as an emergency eradication program, including domestic and international quarantines and inspection programs.  Although a pesticide cannot be legally used if it has not been registered by EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs in accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the EPA has the ability to approve emergency exemptions (under Section 18 of FIFRA) for unregistered uses of pesticides for limited time  periods if the EPA determines that emergency conditions exist and the request meets EPA safety requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/local/region9/lbam_quarantine.htm EPA Quarantine Exemptions for Light Brown Apple Moth Pheromones]&lt;/ref&gt;  The EPA granted a quarantine exemption request from the USDA which stated:

:The Applicant proposes the use of a new chemical which has not been registered by EPA. Due to the unique nature of this emergency situation, in which the time to review the conditions of this situation was short, it was not possible to issue a solicitation for public comment, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, prior to the Agency’s decision to grant these exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastbaypesticidealert.org/USDA%20quarantine%20exemption%20request.PDF (E,E)-9,11-Tetradecadien-1-yl Acetate; Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption, and Solicitation of Public Comment]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2007 the group 'Helping Our Peninsula's Environment'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1hope.org/chkmate.htm Helping Our Peninsula's Environment – Checkmate]&lt;/ref&gt; (HOPE), opponents of the spraying and concerned over the potential impacts to humans and the environment, filed suit to halt the spraying program because the California Dept of Food and Agriculture claimed it was exempt from California's Environmental Quality Act which required analysis of the environmental impacts of the use.

A few weeks later in October HOPE obtained a court injunction that postponed the pheromone spraying for two weeks.  The injunction was lifted a week later, the group said, because it was impossible to prove that "inert" ingredients cause harm when the manufacturer and the government agencies refused to disclose the names and concentrations of the ingredients.

The ''Monterey County Weekly'', in October 2007, reported that according to CDFA spokesman Jay Van Rein, the first two aerial applications over the Monterey Peninsula cost $3.7 million, with $3.1 million of that used to buy the spray products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/archives/2007/2007-Oct-25/Article.news_2/1/@@index State releases list of moth spray ingredients, legal battle continues]&lt;/ref&gt;  The November 2007 application was described as costing $2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemtrails911.com/docs/-%202007/00_LBAM/State%20to%20spray%20Santa%20Cruz%20County%20in%20bid%20to%20eradicate%20apple%20moth%20-%20By%20TOM%20RAGAN%20-%20SENTINEL%20STAFF%20WRITER%20-%20September%2026,%202007.htm State to spray Santa Cruz County in bid to eradicate apple moth]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spray ingredients==

Although the ingredients of LBAM-F have been published on the CDFA website, the ingredients of OLR-F and the concentrations of the different components and residues from the chemical manufacturing process—necessary to determine toxicity levels during applications—remain unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/egov/Press_Releases/Press_Release.asp?PRnum=07-086 Light Brown Apple Moth Eradication Program Update: MONTEREY COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT LIFTS TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER, GOVERNOR ORDERS ERADICATION PROGRAM TO RESUME AND INGREDIENTS TO BE MADE PUBLIC]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many question the statements by state officials that the products used for the aerial spray, Checkmate OLR-F and Checkmate LBAM-F, are safe to be sprayed on densely populated residential areas. At an April city council meeting in the city of Alameda California, Councilmember Frank Matarresse asked CDFA Secretary Kawamura, "If this were sprayed on an open field, would farmworkers be allowed to be in the field while you are spraying?" Secretary Kawamura responded with "No.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbamspray.com/00_Audios_Videos/AGnotSafe.mpg Low resolution video of interchange between Secretary Kawamura and Alameda Councilmember Frank Matarresse]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse health reports==
After the spraying in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties in the fall of 2007, over 600 complaints of adverse health effects were reported [http://1hope.org/SPRAYCOMPLPR.PDF].  The California Department of Food and Agriculture received 330 reports of complaints such as eye irritation,&lt;ref name="titleResidents deluge state with apple moth spray criticism - Santa Cruz Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8334217 |title=Residents deluge state with apple moth spray criticism – Santa Cruz Sentinel |accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; difficulty breathing, rashes, headaches, and muscle aches, among others.&lt;ref name="titleMoth-eaten plans"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/22/EDKPV6JNP.DTL |title=Moth-eaten plans |accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= |work= The San Francisco Chronicle| date=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A local environmental group also reported that they received more than 300 complaints.&lt;ref name="titleState will do environmental review on LBAM - Santa Cruz Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8270391 |title=State will do environmental review on LBAM – Santa Cruz Sentinel |accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 2008, the [[Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment]] (OEHHA) issued a report on the complaints of adverse health effects that stated that they did not have enough data to conclude whether or not a link exists between illness complaints and the 2007 pesticide spraying in Santa Cruz and Monterey. Although the press release describing the report explicitly claimed that no link was found,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oehha.ca.gov/risk/pdf/LBAM041008press.pdf |title=Study shows scientists were unable to find a link between aerial spraying and illness complaints |access-date=2008-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026181936/http://www.oehha.ca.gov/risk/pdf/LBAM041008press.pdf |archive-date=2008-10-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the report actually concluded that "It is not possible to determine whether or not there is a link between any of the reported symptoms and the aerial spraying," and later stated that was because, "more than 90 percent of the 463 symptom reports do not contain adequate information for us to determine whether or not there is a link between the reported symptoms and the spray applications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oehha.org/risk/pdf/LBAM041008.pdf Summary of Symptom Reports in Areas of Aerial Pheromone Application for Management of the Light Brown Apple Moth in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties September, October, and November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier news stories by the ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'' and the ''San Jose Mercury News'' based on the press release, were removed and replaced with corrected news stories.

In response to the OEHHA report, on April 11, 2008, Assemblymember [[John Laird (California politician)|John Laird]] stated in a press release:

:"I’m disappointed that what should have been a very serious scientific effort started long ago, became an exercise where just 10% of the reported cases were analyzed and the findings have been used effectively as spin for the CDFA. To say that there is no information to indicate a link between the spraying and health effects is not the same as saying there is no link between spraying and health effects.  The state did not reach out to a single doctor for the report.  At a minimum, the reports associated with doctors should have been retrieved and given full analysis, including speaking with the reporting physicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/press/20080411AD27PR01.htm |title=Laird Reaction to State Report on Health Affects from LBAM Spraying |access-date=2008-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516093950/http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/press/20080411AD27PR01.htm |archive-date=2008-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDFA argues that only very small amounts of the spray were used and so should not have resulted in adverse health effects.

Dr. Lawrence Rose, a former Senior Public Medical Officer for the [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] for 28 years and part of the [[UCSF]] Occupational/Environmental Medicine Department, in a report titled, 'Marin Pesticide Spraying Health Hazard Alert,' described the actions of state officials as "far beyond irresponsible, and in fact criminal [[negligence]] would be a more appropriate label for the lack of public health follow-up."

On April 16, a report on the dangers of the microcapsules was sent as a letter to Dr. Robert Leavitt of the environmental advisory task force, by Dr. Dennis Knepp, a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and Dr. Jeff Haferman, also an engineer, explaining that the spray was shown to include capsules with diameters less than or equal to 10 micrometers in diameter (termed PM10) which, in sufficient concentration, is a known health hazard regardless of the content of the particulates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbamspray.com/Reports/KneppAndHafermanLetterwithAttachments.pdf CheckMate LBAM-F particle size distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy debate and proposed solutions==
Critics state that no published efficacy reports on the pheromone formulations used aerially against LBAM exist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopefortruth.com/lbam_f_a_q.htm Hope For the Truth – FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; raising questions about the validity of the eradication effort.  Additionally, University of California scientists and other independent experts recommend containment measures in urban areas, but that full-scale airplane spraying should be saved for crop areas that agricultural departments are trying to protect in the Central Valley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/03/06/MN69VD309.DTL Experts question plan to spray to fight moths]&lt;/ref&gt;  Oakland city council member Jane Brunner questioned the location of the sprayings in interviews and in her resolution against the efforts, stating, "A very curious issue for me is that they're spraying in Richmond, Berkeley and Oakland, but they are not spraying in Danville, Walnut Creek and out in the valley."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20080228/ai_n24373224 Berkeley may try to halt spraying]&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2008, Oakland City Attorney John Russo, in an article expressing his reasons for opposing the spray, said that state officials cannot describe the amount of the chemical it will take to rid the state of apple moths, nor how many years the spray will need to be conducted.  He also mentioned:

:"As it happens, the company that makes the spray is owned by a wealthy agri-business tycoon who has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the campaigns of state officials. But that's probably just another coincidence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/2008/04/read_the_label.html Read the Label and Conduct an Environmental Review Before Spraying Californians With Pest Control Chemicals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427061558/http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/2008/04/read_the_label.html |date=2008-04-27 }}, John Russo, CA Progress Report, accessed 4.17.08&lt;/ref&gt;

The group 'Helping Our Peninsula's Environment' proposes controlling the moth with the targeted use of pheromone-baited sticky traps. These are the same traps used for population size measuring purposes. The traps have caught and killed almost all the 27,000 LBAM moths found so far in California.[http://www.1hope.org/nonspray.htm] This method would employ four additional traps for every LBAM caught and consumes far less resources in traps and staff than applying 160,000 twist ties per square mile (250 per acre).

Other critics of the aerial spray plan, such as The California Nevada Regional Conservation Committee of the [[Sierra Club]][http://www.sierraclubcalifornia.org/policyonaerialspraying.html], propose that [[twist tie]]s be impregnated with the pheromone and hung on trees and other structures across the area.  They say they prefer least-toxic, environmentally sensitive control methods to spraying.[http://www.lbamspray.com/00_Legal/SCRESOLUTIONNS-27,783%20Aerial%20Spraying.pdf]  The [[California Department of Food and Agriculture]] has determined that more than nine million twist ties would be required to cover the infested area.  Because the twist ties need to be placed at optimal distances from each other, one trained employee can correctly place 30 to 40 twist ties in a single day.[http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/phpps/PDEP/lbam/pdfs/LBAM_QandA.pdf]  Twist ties become ineffective after about three months and then need to be removed, disposed of, and replaced four times a year.  As a result, using twist ties as the primary measure to control the moth has been ruled out.[http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/phpps/PDEP/lbam/pdfs/LBAM_QandA.pdf]  In early February 2008, the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) announced that treatment using pheromone-infused twist ties was scheduled for LBAM eradication in some lightly infested areas.&lt;ref name="titleCCT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/environment/ci_8345117?nclick_check=1 |title=Contra Costa Times |accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A USDA official has stated that they are still considering whether to treat San Francisco and the East Bay Area through ground or aerial application.[http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?page=3&amp;entry_id=5325&amp;catid=&amp;volume_id=317&amp;issue_id=332&amp;volume_num=42&amp;issue_num=14]

In March 2008, [[Fairfax, California]] City Councilmember Larry Bragman wrote an article stating that since no biological basis for the spraying appears to exist, the more likely issue appears to be  the costly trade quarantines invoked by [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]] under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).  But he also cited an excerpt from the Mexican quarantine demand:

:"The present phytosanitary conditions may be modified or harmonized whenever we have more technical and scientific information regarding E. postvittana (LBAM) as well as we receive more information about the evolution status of this pest in the United States."

Bragman, like others, notes that the moth is not a quarantine pest in Europe, and pointed to the recent research papers by Harder&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/pdf/HarderNZReportFINAL.pdf |title=Integrated Pest Management Practices for the Light Brown Apple Moth in New Zealand: Implications for California |access-date=2008-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512200800/http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27//pdf/HarderNZReportFINAL.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carey that he believes constitute technical and scientific information which should be conveyed to trade representatives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Several county public health officials posted public letters expressing their concerns or disagreements with the spray program.  Health Officer of the Public Health Division of the County of Santa Cruz, Poki Stewart Namkung, stated in a letter on March 18, 2008, to Santa Cruz Assemblymember Laird, that:

:"We do not believe that any spraying should commence before completion of an EIR that includes a comprehensive human health assessment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/MEMBERS/A27/pdf/Namkung_LBAM%20Letter%20to%20Laird_18MAR09.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026204630/http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/pdf/Namkung_LBAM%20Letter%20to%20Laird_18MAR09.pdf |archive-date=2008-10-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And Alameda County Public Health Director, Athony Iton, along with [[Alameda County]] Supervisor [[Keith Carson]], stated in a letter on February 26, 2008, to the CDFA, that:

:"We are confident that there are a variety of other methods to address the LBAM that are much safer for people and the environment and do not pose a major health risk to the residents of Alameda County and California."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.acphd.org/AXBYCZ/Admin/Publications/documents/MOTH_LBAM_letter.pdf |title=Alameda County Public Health Director Tony Iton and County Supervisor Keith Carson express concerns |access-date=2008-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527165633/http://www.acphd.org/AXBYCZ/Admin/Publications/documents/MOTH_LBAM_letter.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2008, California Congressmember [[Sam Farr]] (D-Carmel) further inquired at an agriculture hearing in Washington D.C. about how and when the light brown apple moth was blacklisted and whether it should be declassified from that status.  News stories about the inquiry quoted Farr as saying:

:"If we don’t even know why the moth is listed as a dangerous pest, it’s impossible to determine how far we must go to control it or whether the current emergency eradication tactics are justified."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfbg.com/blogs/politics/2008/04/cant_we_just_delist_the_moth_a.html Can't we just de-list the moth, already?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.farr.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=355&amp;Itemid=1 |title=April 9, 2008 – Farr Questions Feds on LBAM |access-date=2008-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519231659/http://www.farr.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=355&amp;Itemid=1 |archive-date=2008-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Knight, [[Under Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Regulatory Programs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=bios_knight.xml |title=Bruce I.

In December 2013, a paper titled, "Clear, Present, Significant, &amp; Imminent Danger: Questions for the California Light Brown Apple Moth (Epiphyas postvittana) Technical Working Group," was published in the journal, ''American Entomologist''&lt;ref name="ingentaconnect.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/esa/ae/2013/00000059/00000004/art00010 |title=Clear, Present, Significant, &amp; Imminent Danger: Questions for the California Light Brown Apple Moth (Epiphyas postvittana) Technical Working Group |access-date=2014-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827072835/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/esa/ae/2013/00000059/00000004/art00010 |archive-date=2014-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that called into question the role of scientists in the decision-making that led to the aerial spray.

==Legal challenges, public outcry and investigations==
By June 2008, over 30 California city councils including San Francisco, Monterey, Pacific Grove, Seaside, Santa Cruz, Oakland, Albany and Berkeley had passed resolutions against the spray and over 80 environmental, health and political  groups were on record opposing it.&lt;ref name="titleCCT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stopthespray.org/organizations.htm |title=Local Governments and Groups opposing the Spray |access-date=2008-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613142519/http://www.stopthespray.org/organizations.htm |archive-date=2008-06-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, several legislative bills based on citizen concerns about aerial spraying in [[urban area]]s and the ability of state agencies to declare a [[state of emergency]] were drafted by state legislators.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/23/MN9RV77NK.DTL Bills seek to curb pesticide spray over cities]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/20/MNR6V5B3C.DTL Migden battles aerial moth spraying]&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 13, 2008,
Assemblyman John Laird, D-Santa Cruz, introduced Assembly Concurrent Resolution 117, calling on the Departments of Food and Agriculture and Pesticide Regulation, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and other state agencies to answer unresolved questions.  He stated, "It is the responsibility of our government to demonstrate its LBAM actions are necessary and do not compromise human or environmental health,” Laird said. “It isn’t the responsibility of the people to demonstrate the reverse."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressbanner.com/content/view/1021/42/ Laird calls on state for moth-spray answers]&lt;/ref&gt;  The resolution uses a fast track process in the state House and Senate which does not require the Governor's signature.  Laird's Invasive Pest Planning Act of 2008, AB 2763, passed the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee by a vote of 4–0 on April 2 of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/press/20080402AD27PR01.htm |title=Laird LBAM-based Pest Planning Legislation Passes Assembly Committee |access-date=2008-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516084603/http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/press/20080402AD27PR01.htm |archive-date=2008-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 22, 2008, [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] wrote a public letter to the Governor urging him to study health consequences before continuing with the spray campaign.  He cited relevant state legislation and asked the governor to sign the bills into law immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/56140 |title=Newsom Urges Governor Schwarzenegger To Study Health Consequences Before Moth Spraying Proceeds |access-date=2008-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328055809/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/56140 |archive-date=2008-03-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to conduct the spraying, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (not the state agency) was able to obtain an "emergency exemption from registration" from the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]].  Representatives of the [[California Department of Pesticide Regulation]] say that because of that exemption, the spraying program is not subject to state approval.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  But Santa Cruz city Attorney John Barisone has said that the moth "isn't an emergency. We've known about it for quite a while."  The legal brief he is involved in argues that the state first knew, in 1995, that the moth was "highly likely" to establish itself in the United States, but that no environmental studies were done on how best to deal the moth, resulting in the spray plan and consequent panic among residents fearful of spray effects.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/centralcoast/ci_8726089 |title=Light brown apple moth fight heads to court |access-date=2008-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914151814/http://www.mercurynews.com/centralcoast/ci_8726089 |archive-date=2012-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, an [[Associated Press]] investigation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/03/12/state/n164613D24.DTL AP Exclusive: Moth-spraying PR deal suspended amid questions]&lt;/ref&gt; into the decision to award a $497,000 no-bid contract to [[Porter Novelli]], a public relations firm tasked to promote the spraying program, described e-mails obtained by AP as indicating that a senior state contracting official questioned the contract award.  The e-mails, obtained through a California [[Public records|Public Records Act]] request, also showed that a senior counsel with the [[California Department of General Services]] questioned the rationale for a [[no-bid contract]], and admitted that he had never before been asked to approve a no-bid contract for public affairs work.  The investigation also focused on an expected winner in the contract, naming Jeff Randle, a frequent campaign and political adviser to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], as being promised by state officials to receive a share of the work.  Randle was a campaign consultant involved in the scandal that drove disgraced state Insurance Commissioner [[Chuck Quackenbush]] from office, and was hired as a consultant for Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial campaign in 2003.  A CDFA spokesperson said that U.S. Department of Agriculture would be reimbursing the state of California for much of the cost of the $497,000 PR firm contract, but could not provide any details.  One day after the Associated Press published the story behind the contract, the deal was suspended.

Another contract questioned by some has been the contract for the aerial dispersal of the pheromone, given to Dynamic Aviation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dynamicaviation.com/ Dynamic Aviation]&lt;/ref&gt; an experienced Virginia aerial application&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dynamicaviation.com/aerial.htm |title=Dynamic Aviation Aerial Application |access-date=2009-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219082913/http://www.dynamicaviation.com/aerial.htm |archive-date=2009-12-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; company that also has government contracts with the Defense Department and Homeland Security,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.svtc-va.org/files/SVTC_program_TN7.pdf |title=National Defense / Homeland Security Award |access-date=2012-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008064915/http://www.svtc-va.org/files/SVTC_program_TN7.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paulina Borsook|Borsook, Paulina]]. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paulina-borsook/bush-administration-to-bl_b_92636.html Bush Administration to Blue-State California: Drop Dead!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopefortruth.com/lbam_f_a_q.htm LVAMspray FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for ''The California Progressive Report'', the Mayor of [[Albany, California]], Robert Lieber, RN, called for the resignation of CDFA Secretary Kawamura, citing his three main concerns: that the pheromone has not been tested for long-term human exposure risk, that the inert ingredients are toxic and [[carcinogenic]], and that  U.C. Davis scientists examining the [[Micro-encapsulation|microcapsules]] found that "some particles are small enough to be inhaled into the deep lung where they cannot be expelled." He described the conduct of Secretary Kawamura as a "disgraceful public deception campaign."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/2008/03/aerial_spraying.html Aerial Spraying for the Light Brown Apple Moth in California is Dangerous to Our Health and Unnecessary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317184726/http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/2008/03/aerial_spraying.html |date=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2007 Helping Our Peninsula's Environment (HOPE) filed the first suit alleging CDFA had violated California's Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) by falsely claiming their aerial spraying program was exempt from CEQA due to an emergency. A little more than one month later the County and City of Santa Cruz filed an essentially identical lawsuit.

On April 24, 2008, Santa Cruz County won their California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) lawsuit against CDFA halting any spraying in that county until an Environmental Impapct Report (EIR) is completed. On May 8 CDFA's attorney Anita Ruud told Monterey County Judge O'Farrell the EIR is expected to be complete in January 2009. In 2008 CDFA suspended aerial spraying during the rainy season until late spring indicating that aerial spraying in Santa Cruz County should not resume until late spring 2009.

In response to Judge Burdick's question CDFA's attorney Bill Jenkins admitted that LBAM had done "no documented damage" to California agriculture or ecosystems. The county attorney Jason Heath cited documentation that some federal officials themselves did not consider the moth to be a serious threat, but instead described it as a "transient pest" and cited "largely untested strategies."

At the end of the hearing the Judge ruled that CDFA had abused their discretion and violated California's Environmental Quality Act when they illegally exempted their aerial spraying program from CEQA claiming the LBAM discovery in California was an emergency. Judge Burdick did not find any evidence that the arrival of the light brown apple moth in California constitutes the claimed emergency. He ordered CDFA to halt the spraying program and rescind their exemption from CEQA until an Environmental Impapct Report is completed.

Just an hour later, following a meeting with State Senator Carole Migden and Marin County officials, Governor Schwarzenegger announced that the state will postpone the spray program until some tests for acute toxicity of the sprays are completed expected on August 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cbs5.com/wrapper_consumer/seenon/apple.moth.spraying.2.708193.html |title=Judge, Schwarzenegger Stop Apple Moth Spraying |access-date=2008-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511042209/http://cbs5.com/wrapper_consumer/seenon/apple.moth.spraying.2.708193.html |archive-date=2008-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 2008, Monterey County Superior Court Judge Robert A. O'Farrell reached a similar conclusion in an identical Monterey CEQA case brought on September 24, 2007 by Helping Our Peninsula's Environment (HOPE).

O'Farrell halted the program of aerial spraying of Monterey peninsula communities until an Environmental Impact Report is prepared. The judge ruled that CDFA had illegally exempted themselves from the California Environmental Quality Act because there was no "substantial evidence" of significant damage by the LBA moth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1hope.org/HOPEWINSPRAY.PDF Judge's Intended Decision]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2008 CDFA filed Notices of Appeal for both of the CEQA lawsuits they had lost. (The following day CDFA announced the abandonment of aerial spraying over populated areas. It is not known whether CDFA will pursue the appeals.)

In December 2013, Drs. James Carey and Daniel Harder published a paper titled, "Clear, Present, Significant, &amp; Imminent Danger: Questions for the California Light Brown Apple Moth (Epiphyas postvittana) Technical Working Group," in the journal, ''American Entomologist''.&lt;ref name="ingentaconnect.com"/&gt;  The study calls into question the role of scientists in the decision-making that led to the aerial spray.

On December 2, 2015, in a case against the CDFA by several groups, including Earth Justice, the California Environmental Health Initiative, Pesticide Action Network, and others, the Third District Court of Appeals ruled against the LBAM pesticide program on the grounds that it violated state environmental laws.&lt;ref name="earthjustice.org"/&gt;

==State legislation==
On April 16, the Assembly Agriculture Committee passed two pieces of legislation: ACR 117 and AB 2763.

ACR 117 is an Assembly Concurrent Resolution that calls on the California Department of Food and Agriculture, the Department of Pesticide Regulation, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and other relevant state departments to address unresolved health, scientific and efficacy issues involving the eradication plans.  The resolution  passed 5–3 and next goes to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

AB 2763, the Invasive Pest Planning Act of 2008 – would require the CDFA to create a list of invasive animals, plants, and insects that have a reasonable likelihood of entering California for which an eradication program might be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/press/20080416AD27PR01.htm |title=Laird LBAM Legislation Passes Assembly Agriculture Committee |access-date=2008-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517092443/http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/press/20080416AD27PR01.htm |archive-date=2008-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, [[United Airlines]] expressed interest in using the CS100 and CS300 for replacing its aging 737–300 and 737-500 aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://blog.seattlepi.com/aerospace/2009/12/10/united-to-consider-bombardier-cseries/ |title= United to consider Bombardier CSeries |work= Boeing and aerospace news |publisher= Seattle PI |date= 10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however a future order is unlikely as airline has made orders for the [[Airbus A319]]-100 and the [[Boeing 737]]-800.

In March 2010, [[easyJet]] stated that the company was having "ongoing discussions with Bombardier regarding its CSeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-19/airbus-weighs-costs-rivals-advances-in-engine-upgrade-choice.html |title=Airbus Weighs Costs, Rivals’ Advances in Engine Upgrade Choice |work=Businessweek |date=March 19, 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326182513/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-19/airbus-weighs-costs-rivals-advances-in-engine-upgrade-choice.html |archivedate=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the airline has since ordered the Airbus A320-200 and A320neo.

In March 2018, it was stated that Garuda Indonesia wanted to order the CS300 as a replacement for the Bombardier CRJ-1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviatren.com/2018/03/10/garuda-indonesia-ganti-atr72-dan-crj1000-dengan-bombardier-cs300/|title=Garuda Indonesia Ganti ATR72 dan CRJ1000 dengan Bombardier CS300?trans-title=Garuda Indonesia to replace ATR72 and CRJ1000 with Bombardier CS300?|date=March 10, 2018|access-date=8 May 2018|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Origins of the name */Term pale blue amended to azure blue in an effort to provide a slightly more specific shade. The Blue Bird and Bluebird vehicles varied somewhat in their exact paint colours; in this case it is to offer an approximation of the colours used, in accordance with the final colour used (RAL 5009 Azure Blue).</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4063">'''''Blue Bird''''' or '''''Bluebird''''' is the name of various cars and boats used by [[Malcolm Campbell|Sir Malcolm Campbell]], his son [[Donald Campbell|Donald]] and other family members to set [[Land speed record|land]] and [[water speed record]]s.

{{TOC right}}

== Origins of the name ==
The name ''Blue Bird'' was originally inspired by the [[The Blue Bird (play)|play of that name]] by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]],&lt;ref name="ODNB, Malcolm Campbeell" &gt;Scott A. G. M. Crawford, "Campbell, Sir Malcolm (1885–1948)", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32271, accessed 25 July 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and the vehicles were painted a shade of azure blue.

Malcolm Campbell had a succession of [[Darracq and Company London|Darracq]] racing cars in the 1920s, which in the fashion of the day he had named '' '[[Flapper]] I' '',  '' 'Flapper II' '' and  '' 'Flapper III' ''. It was '' 'Flapper III' '' which he renamed after seeing the play, famously and impetuously knocking up a paint shop owner at night, so as to purchase blue paint before racing at [[Brooklands]] the following day.&lt;ref name="Tremayne, Behind The Mask" &gt;{{cite book

  |last=Tremayne  |first=David
  |isbn=0-553-81511-3
  |publisher=Bantam Books
  |year=2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, he also raced an [[Itala]] at Brooklands with the name '' 'The Blue Bird' '' painted on the bonnet.&lt;ref name="Villa" &gt;{{cite book

==''Bluebird'' or ''Blue Bird''?==
Malcolm Campbell named them ''"Blue Bird"'', Donald ''"Bluebird"''.

The hydroplane [[Bluebird K4|K4]] began life as Malcolm's ''"Blue Bird"'', but when Donald decided to use her in 1949, after his father's death, he renamed her ''"Bluebird"''.&lt;ref name="Tremayne, Behind The Mask" /&gt;

According to the 2011 census, there were 17,642 resident '''Nigerians in Ireland''', representing a 9.67% change over the 2006 figures of 16,300 Nigerian born people resident in Ireland. They constitute the largest African group in the country.

==Migration==
===History===
Recent Nigerian migration to Ireland began after [[History of Nigeria#Independence|Nigeria's independence from the United Kingdom]] in 1960; migration began to accelerate slightly during the late 1960s [[Nigerian Civil War]], though it remained small.&lt;ref name="IOM6"&gt;{{harvnb|IOM|2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Nigerian migration to Ireland consisted primarily of businesspeople, especially in the fishing industry (Irish-exported [[mackerel]] is widely consumed in Nigeria). Other early migrants included medical students, who had intended to return to Nigeria after completing their courses, but ended up staying in Ireland. Migration began to become more noticeable after 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Komolafe|2002|loc=A Brief History of Nigerian Migration to Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical students trained at the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|Royal College of Surgeons]] as well as [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name="IOM7"&gt;{{harvnb|IOM|2010|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant mass-migration of Nigerians to Ireland comprised [[British Nigerian|Nigerians from the United Kingdom]]. Most came only with the intention of extending their UK visas and then returning, but the ones who failed settled down in Ireland as illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Komolafe|2002|loc=Visa Extension-Seekers}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the landmark High Court case ''Fajujonu v. Minister for Justice'', which prohibited deportation of parents of Irish-born children, more Nigerians began coming to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Komolafe|2002|loc=Legal Resident Status Seekers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, from around 1996, during Ireland's "[[Celtic Tiger]]" period of rapid economic expansion and labour shortages, some Nigerian workers were recruited from overseas by Irish companies, while others came to the country, seeking either opportunities for jobs, or to set up niche businesses aimed at other African migrants providing goods and services which they expected would not otherwise be available in the Irish market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Komolafe|2002|loc='Celtic Tiger' Migrants}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2002 and 2006, the population of Nigerian citizens in Ireland grew by 81.7%, according to Irish census figures, making them the country's fourth-largest migrant group at the time.&lt;ref name="ICI2008"&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many recent migrants are asylum-seekers.&lt;ref name="IOM6"/&gt; However, from 2002 to 2009 the number of Nigerian applicants for asylum fell sharply, dropping from a peak of 4,050 to just 569.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IOM|2010|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sharp drop in Nigerian asylum applicants was due to the obtaining residency via parentage of Irish citizen children or marriage to Irish and EU spouses and due to the high failure rates in the granting of asylum and the granting of leave to remain. Nigerians were also in the top 3 candidates for deportation orders.&lt;ref name="inis.gov.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/AnnRpt05Immig.pdf/Files/AnnRpt05Immig.pdf |title=HLG 3 – Asylum, Immigration and Citizenship |publisher=[[Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service]] |date= |accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivations===
Though their migration is relatively recent, Nigerian migrants mention that they had contact with Irish people and institutions in their home country, such as charitable activities run by Irish Catholic clergy or Irish non-governmental organisations, which contributed to their positive image of Irish people prior to migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Nigerian respondents to a 2008 survey, 40% had no friends or family in the country at all prior to arrival, double the rate of other migrant groups such as Indians and Lithuanians, though slightly less than Chinese. 22% mentioned education and training as their motivation for migration, while 16% mentioned joining family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are far more likely (90%) than other migrant groups surveyed to have children, whether in Ireland or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, about half state that they are responsible for full or partial support of other adult or minor family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80% were married, and those, for about one-fifth, their partners lived in Nigeria rather than in Ireland; more than 90% have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|pp=145&amp;ndash;147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2004, liberal citizenship laws entailed that any child born in Ireland was an Irish citizen, regardless of the nationality of the parent or their link to Ireland. After the landmark High Court case ''Fajujonu v. Minister for Justice'', which prohibited deportation of parents of Irish-born children, more Nigerians began coming to Ireland, some initially seeking asylum and then giving birth shortly upon arrival. However reform was sought by the general public to the phenomenon known as "anchor babies" . In the Supreme Court case of ''L. and O. v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform'', delivered on 23 January 2003, it was held that a foreign national parent of an Irish-born child did not have an automatic entitlement to remain in the State with the child. As a result of that case the Minister reviewed his policy. The Minister decided that the separate procedures for the consideration of residency applications based solely on parentage of an Irish-born child should cease with effect from 19 February 2003. At that date a total of 11,493 applications, which had been made on this basis, were outstanding. This review became known as the IBC 05 Scheme. In addition, Irish citizenship laws were amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004 for future cases, removing the automatic right of Irish citizenship at birth were parents of the child were non-Irish. As of January 2006, a total of 17,917 applications under the IBC 05 Scheme were received and processed. A total of 16,693 applicants were given leave to remain under the scheme and 1,119 were refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/0/82FD2F88CE3F06EF802573B7005C895E |title=Bode (a minor) -v- Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform &amp; ors : Judgments &amp; Determinations |publisher=[[Courts Service]] |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been cited that Nigerian nationals made up 59% of applicants of the IBC 05 Scheme and 57% of successful applicants.&lt;ref name="inis.gov.ie"/&gt;

==Business and employment==
A 2008 survey found that 86% of Nigerian respondents had been employed before migration to Ireland, while just 8% were full-time students. 27% had been self-employed, a much higher rate than other migrant groups surveyed. 25% had worked as managers and executives, 11% in business and commerce, 17% in local or central governments, 12% in health-related occupations, and 5% in personal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 16% had a job offer in Ireland prior to arrival, about double the rate of Chinese respondents, but less than a third the rate of Indian or Lithuanian respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are more likely than the other groups surveyed to find their employment through newspaper advertisements, rather than the internet or friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of the survey respondents were employed at the time of the survey, with another 16% of men and 13% of women looking for work. Many work in personal services and childcare (positions such as care assistants, security guards, waiters, or hotel staff).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a significant shift from their previous pattern of employment in their home country, and has been interpreted as evidence of [[deskilling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|pp=92&amp;ndash;93}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of Nigerian men and two-thirds of Nigerian women feel that their qualifications are fully recognised in their main job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other groups they have an intermediate level of income (majority reporting between €14,401 and €31,720).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 2% are employed in predominantly Irish working environments.&lt;ref name="McFadyen 2008 123"&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Compared to other migrant groups, Nigerians have been noted for their high level of involvement in electoral politics, community organisations, and anti-racism struggles.&lt;ref name="IOM7"/&gt; By 2008, two Nigerians had been elected to city council positions in Ireland, namely in [[Portlaoise]] ([[Rotimi Adebari]]) and [[Ennis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey found that 50% of Nigerian respondents were registered to vote, more than double the other recent migrant groups surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25% of the same survey group were again involved with trade unions, again far more than the other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Involvement in political and civic activity tends to be high among asylum seekers while they are awaiting the completion of the asylum process, but drops off afterwards due to increased demands on their time by employment.&lt;ref name="McFadyen 2008 84"&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey found that, Nigerians, in common with Chinese, often reported racism or [[employment discrimination|discrimination in the workplace]]. They stated that they often suffered bullying from their managers as well as their co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often stereotyped as criminals.&lt;ref name="McFadyen 2008 123"/&gt; They are also more likely than other groups surveyed to feel that Irish people are not accepting of diverse cultures and communities as part of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==
There are many Nigerian organisations in Ireland. Most are affiliated with the Houston, Texas-based [[Nigerian Union Diaspora]] (NUD), which is the umbrella Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) for the economic and political empowerment of the people of Nigerian descent outside Nigeria.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Community organisations established by Nigerians within Ireland include the [[Nigerian Association of Ireland]] and the [[Igbo Association of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="McFadyen 2008 84"/&gt; Nigerian organisations are typically ethnic-specific (as in the Bini Community in Ireland and the Igbo Progressive Union) or local-specific (as in the Association of Nigerians in Galway). There is also an umbrella organisation, the Nigerian Association Network in Ireland. Nigerians are also active in pan-African organisations and general migrant organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IOM|2010|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arambe Theater Productions, a pan-African drama group, was established in 2003 by Nigerian performance artist Bisi Adigun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIvor|2008|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also Nigerian Carnival Ireland (NCI), an annual festival to celebrate Nigerian &amp; other ethnic cultures in Ireland, established in 2010 by Nigerian TV personality &amp; consummate speaker Yemi Adenuga. A Nigerian-run beauty pageant, The Most Beautiful African Girl is also in Ireland. Some Nigerian churches have been established in various places in Ireland, along with various Nigerian-owned shops and restaurants, especially in [[Dublin]]'s [[Moore Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Komolafe|2002|loc=Institution Building}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{citation|date=2 September 2004|periodical=BBC News|title=Nigerians put down new roots in Ireland|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3618590.stm|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of Nigerian Doctors in Ireland (ANDI) was inaugurated in a dinner on 6 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalmedics.com/news-association-nigerian-doctors-ireland/|title=Association of Nigerian Doctors in Ireland|publisher=Global Medics|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerians have also established several magazines such as ''Bold &amp; Beautiful'' and ''Xclusive''. Nigerian television stations are available through satellite providers such as [[Africa Independent Television]] and [[BEN Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IOM|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Yoruba and Igbo were the most common spoken languages by the Nigerian community in Ireland. According to the Irish population and housing census of 2011, 10,093 people spoke Yoruba at home, making it the most widely spoken African language in the country, while 3,875 spoke Igbo. Other Nigerian languages were not specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile6/Profile_6_Migration_and_Diversity_entire_doc.pdf |title=Profile 6 - Migration and Diversity |date=October 2012 |publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] |accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to other migrant groups surveyed, Nigerians have a high level of English usage in almost all kinds of interactions, including with children, with other Nigerian friends, in other socialisation, and at work; only communication with partners was an exception to this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; 95% rate themselves as having "fluent" or "adequate" command of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are strongly likely to feel that they do not have many values in common with Irish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
In a 2008 survey, about one-third of Nigerian respondents were in education on a part-time or full-time basis, mostly at tertiary institutions. They often face high tuition fees, due to the requirement that students have been employed and paying taxes in three out of the five preceding years to qualify for reduced European Union tuition rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey found that 90% of Nigerian respondents had made use of health services in Ireland (such as GPs, hospitals, community health centres, medical cards, and private insurance providers), a much higher rate than the other groups surveyed (Chinese, Indians, and Lithuanians, ranging from 40% to 60%).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McFadyen|2008|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oneida Indian Nation''' (OIN) or '''Oneida Nation''' is a [[federally recognized tribe]] of [[Oneida people]] in the United States. The tribe is headquartered in [[New York (state)|New York]], where the tribe originated and held its historic territory long before European colonialism. It is an Iroquoian-speaking people, and one of the [[Iroquois|Five Nations]] of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], or ''Haudenosaunee''. Three other federally recognized Oneida tribes operate in locations where they migrated and were [[Indian removal|removed]] to during and after the [[American Revolutionary War]]: one in [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] in the United States, and two in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

Today the Oneida Indian Nation owns tribal land in [[Verona, New York|Verona]], [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]], and [[Canastota, New York]], on which it operates a number of businesses. These include a resort with a Class III gambling casino.

Since the late 20th century, the OIN has been a party to [[Indian Land Claims Settlements|land claim suits]] against the state of New York for treaties and purchases it made after the [[American Revolutionary War]] without ratification by the [[United States Senate]], as required under the [[US Constitution]]. Litigation has been complex, related to trust lands, Class III gaming, property, and sales tax collection. The [[Oneida_Indian_Nation#2013_landmark_agreement_between_New_York_State,_Madison_and_Oneida_Counties,_and_the_OIN|landmark agreement entered into on May 16, 2013]] between Madison and Oneida Counties, the OIN, and the state resolved these issues.

==Government==
The tribe is headquartered in [[Verona, New York]], and the Nation Representative is [[Ray Halbritter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncai.org/tribal-directory?letter=O "Tribal Directory"], ''National Congress of American Indians.'' Retrieved 1 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been the leader since 1975.  In 1993, the United States government formally recognized Mr. Halbritter as the OIN leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/10/the-anti-redskin/403213|title=The Anti-Redskin|last=Sabar|first=Ariel|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Membership==
The tribal council of the OIN has established the rules for citizenship: it requires documentation of at least 1/4 blood ancestry (equivalent to one grandparent) through the maternal line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Oneida-Nation-Fact-Sheet-for-Web-2017.pdf OIN Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; The OIN and other Iroquois nations have had a [[matrilineal]] [[kinship system]], with descent and inheritance through the mother's line.

== Clans ==
The OIN consists of three clans: Turtle, Wolf, and Bear.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; Each Nation member belongs to one of these clans. A child is considered born into the mother's clan, and takes social status from her people.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation ===
Legend has it that clan names and the matrilineal kinship system came from a response to issues that arose during the [[Haudenosaunee]] mourning process. Prior to clans being created, the entire Oneida village would mourn after the death of a village member. This caused problems as important decisions were put on hold during the time of mourning. Village leaders were at a loss as to how to continue everyday life while at the same time observing traditional mourning practices. A young village member approached the leaders with a possible solution.  He suggested sending three female elders to the nearby river, having them build a fire, and spend the night. At first light the following morning the women were to pray to the Creator and take notice of the first animal that approached the river. Once the women had seen an animal, they were to report back to the village leaders. The elders put the young man’s plan into action. Three women were sent to the river. Upon their return one woman reported that she had seen a turtle at the edge of the river. The second woman reported seeing a wolf running along the river. The third woman stated that she had seen a bear feeding in the river along the rocks. Following the reports of the women, village leaders named the Oneida clans the Turtle, Wolf and Bear clans. They determined that a village member’s clan would be passed through the mother's line from generation to generation, as women have the Creator’s gift to create life.  The Oneida Nation is still a matrilineal kinship society. After the clans were established, the people developed their practices for a mourning process. When there was a death in the village, the clan members of that person would mourn. The members of a second clan would console them, and the members of the third clan would carry on village business as usual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/how-the-clans-were-chosen/ Clan creation legend]&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Meaning ===
The Haudenosaunee people are made up of several Nations. Among these nations are kinship groups called clans.  While Nation members have their immediate family of parents and siblings, they also have an extended family of fellow Clan members.  As a matrilineal society, each clan member is born into their clan by their mother. The three Oneida Nation clans are named after animals, the turtle, wolf, and bear.  Each animal is considered to have certain positive characteristics or attributes.  The turtle teaches patience, as well as the importance of never giving up. Turtles are also seen to be representative of strength and solidarity. They are thought to be old and wise, and are well respected. The wolf teaches the importance of using your ears, listening and being watchful. They embody a strong sense of family. Finally, the bear is seen as gentle and strong. Bears are seen as having strength in knowing that takes more strength not to raise your hand and strike, than to give into the impulse to strike.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oneida-nsn.gov/our-ways/our-story/clan-systems/ Clan animal meanings]; [http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/the-haudenosaunee-creation-story/ Haudenosaunee creation legend],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Not sure if this is sufficient, but best I could find{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--It may be legend, but this version is likely written somewhere--&gt;

==Businesses==
The tribe set up '''Oneida Nation Enterprises''', through which it operates a number of businesses in [[Central New York]]. As of 2013, it was the largest employer of the area, with approximately 5,000 jobs total.&lt;ref&gt;(1) [http://www.onenterprises.com/ Oneida Nation Enterprises website.] Accessed: September 3, 2013.&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web|first=Theresa|last=Vargas|first2=Annys|last2=Shin|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6eRepM6Ct?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/oneida-indian-nation-is-the-tiny-tribe-taking-on-the-nfl-and-dan-snyder-over-redskins-name/2013/11/16/10ef9290-4c88-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html|archivedate=January 11, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/oneida-indian-nation-is-the-tiny-tribe-taking-on-the-nfl-and-dan-snyder-over-redskins-name/2013/11/16/10ef9290-4c88-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html|title=Oneida Indian Nation is the tiny tribe taking on the NFL and Dan Snyder over Redskins name|date=November 16, 2013|work=Local|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=January 10, 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business interests include:

===Bingo and gasoline===
In the early 1990s, the OIN opened a [[Bingo (US)|bingo]] hall. [[Arthur Raymond Halbritter|Ray Halbritter]] (Oneida), opened a gas station known as '''SavOn''' across the street. The cheaper gasoline &lt;!-- Why cheaper? Compared to what? --&gt;made the gas station popular among the community.

Eventually the OIN bought SavOn and expanded it into multiple locations within the area. Today ''SavOn'' (or ''SāvOn'') is a chain of gas stations and convenience stores in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida]] and [[Madison County, New York|Madison]] counties, owned and operated by the Oneida Indian Nation.

===Casinos and resorts===
The OIN opened several casinos.  The first was the Turning Stone Casino &amp; Resort, in 1993.  After the 2013 landmark settlement, the OIN opened the Yellow Brick Road Casino in June 2015.  And on March 3, 2018, OIN opened the Point Place Casino in Brideport, NY.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oneidaindiannation.com/enterprises]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribe's most profitable business is the [[Turning Stone Resort &amp; Casino]], which has been expanding continuously since its opening in 1993.  The current game-space is approximately {{convert|100000|ft2|m2}}. Begun as a bingo hall, it has been developed as a large, Class III gaming facility and resort.&lt;ref&gt;Class III gaming is the broadest class of gambling under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA).&lt;/ref&gt; The entertainment site includes nationally ranked hotels and restaurants. Many shows are performed throughout the year. The resort is the host for a fall [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|Professional Golfers' Association]] (PGA) tournament.
Some parties have challenged the tribal-state gaming compact between the OIN and New York state.  The 2013 agreement between the OIN, Madison and Oneida Counties, and New York resolved all challenges to the casino.

In 2016, the casino and resort underwent a $20 million upgrade and renovation project to provide better smoke-free areas on the gambling floor, improve ventilation facilities, add a cafeteria, and add/upgrade rooms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/11/turning_stone_to_limit_smokers_to_own_mini-casino_20_million_project_to_upgrade.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The OIN has purchased a [[marina]] on the south-eastern shore of [[Oneida Lake]] and many plots of land in the area.

The [[Indian Country Media Network]] (ICMN) was owned by the Oneida Nation of New York until 2017; it included the ''Indian Country Today'' online newspaper. That year the OOIN donated the news organization's assets to the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/native-news/oneida-nation-donate-indian-country-today-media-network-assets-ncai/|title=Oneida Nation to Donate Indian Country Today Media Network Assets to NCAI|last=|first=|date=2017-10-04|website=Indian Country Media Network|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI has continued to publish ''Indian Country Today'' online.

==OIN land litigation==
Since the 1970s, the OIN have been involved in several lawsuits involving real property.  In the 70s, the OIN filed suit seeking recovery of the original land grant contained in the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua arguing the land was improperly transferred in violation of federal law and the US Constitution.  As time progressed, the OIN began purchasing real property within this original grant as it became available.  The OIN asserted its limited sovereignty status to claim the properties exempt from county and state property taxes.  This culminated in several additional suits preceding the 2013 landmark agreement.

===Land claim===
{{main article|Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State v. Oneida County|Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State|City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y.}}

In 1970 and 1974, the OIN, [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin]] and the [[Oneida Nation of the Thames]] (Canada) filed lawsuits in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]]; they alleged that the reservation land granted to them by a treaty between the OIN and New York State was taken from the Oneida people (from their historic territory) and the treaty was never ratified by the Senate, making it unconstitutional. The state did not have authority under the US Constitution to deal directly with the Indian nations. The Oneida said that they still legally owned the lands in question.

In 1970, the OIN filed a "test" case in federal court, suing Oneida and Madison counties for two years' rent (1968-1969) on county-owned acreage; the rent amounted to $16,694. The OIN argue that as the original action by the state was unconstitutional, they still owned the land and were owed rent by the counties. The [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] dismissed the action, and the OIN appealed. On July 12, 1972, the Second Circuit United States Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s decision.&lt;ref&gt;464 F2d 916&lt;/ref&gt; The OIN petitioned the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to grant ''cert.''  In ''[[Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida]]'' (1974), the Supreme Court decided in favor of the Oneida Indian Nation.&lt;ref&gt;414 US 661 [1974]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 1977, on [[remand (court procedure)|remand]] to the District Court with Judge Edmund Port presiding, the Court sided with the OIN. The counties appealed to the Second Circuit, which affirmed Judge Port's decision. The counties had argued the OIN did not have standing for its claim, and the claim was too old and should not be considered.&lt;ref&gt;719 F2d 525 [1983]&lt;/ref&gt; The counties petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of ''cert.'', which the court granted.

On March 4, 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court opined in favor of the OIN in a 5 to 4 vote.&lt;ref&gt;''County of Oneida v Oneida Indian Nation'', 470 US 226 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court opined three principles"
* that the OIN had a common-law right to sue in federal courts;
* that such claims were justiciable; and
* there was no state or federal statute of limitations that would bar such claims. The majority opinion includes the following footnote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present day Oneida Indians was not addressed by the Court of Appeals or presented to this Court by petitioners. Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether other considerations may be relevant to the final disposition of this case should Congress not exercise its authority to resolve these far-reaching Indian claims."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote in his dissent: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This decision upsets long-settled expectations in the ownership of real property in the Counties of Oneida and Madison, New York, and the disruption it is sure to cause will confirm the common law wisdom that ancient claims are best left in repose. The Court, no doubt, believes that it is undoing a grave historical injustice, but in so doing it has caused another, which only Congress may now rectify."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1998, the [[United States]] Department of Justice intervened in the lawsuits on the plaintiff's behalf in order for the claim to proceed against New York State because the state asserted its immunity under the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|11th Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madisoncounty.org/motf/fed128.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112004911/http://www.madisoncounty.org/motf/fed128.html |date=November 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on ''[[City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation]]'' and ''[[Cayuga Indian Nation v New York'']], the Defendants moved for summary judgment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upstate-citizens.org/USDC-Oneida-SJ-MOL.pdf UCE motion], Upstate Citizens for Equality (UCE)&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 2007, Judge Kahn dismissed the OIN's possessory land claims and allowed the non-possessory claims to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upstate-citizens.org/USDC-Oneida-SJ-Decision.pdf Judge Kahn's decision], Upstate Citizens for Equality&lt;/ref&gt;

Both parties appealed Judge Kahn's decision. In a decision dated August 9, 2010, the Second Circuit opined that the non-possessory claims could not proceed and remanded the case back to the district court to enter a judgement in favor of the State and Counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upstate-citizens.org/07-2430-cv_opn.pdf|title=Second Circuit decision|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OIN appealed to the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1652682626/Halbritter-Oneidas-to-appeal-claim-ruling-to-U-S-Supreme-Court "Oneidas to Appeal Claim Decision"], Upstate Citizens for Equality&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of former tribal lands re-acquired on the open market===
[[File:US Navy 061104-N-0000P-003 Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman, Navy Adm. Edmund Giambastiani speaks with attendees of the Oneida Indian Nation veterans recognition ceremony in Verona, N.Y.jpg|thumb|Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman, Navy Adm. [[Edmund Giambastiani]] speaks with attendees of the Oneida Indian Nation veterans recognition ceremony in Verona, N.Y, November 4, 2006]]

The OIN has purchased lands which had been part of its historic reservation, as established by treaty with New York State. These had later been sold to the state and subsequently to non-Indians. For some time, the OIN and the state believed that the OIN's purchase of the land restored the property to its status as Indian Territory under Oneida possession.

State law prohibits Class III gaming facilities. The OIN developed its resort and casino on what was understood to be its federal reservation, where that action was authorized under tribal sovereignty.

The city of Sherrill challenged the OIN by trying to collect property taxes on the land the tribe bought in that jurisdiction, where it developed its casino. In ''[[City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation]]'' (2005), which went to the US Supreme Court, Justice [[Ginsburg]] determined that the land the casino is on was part of the original tribal lands.&lt;ref&gt;544 US 197 [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; But, Justice Ginsburg held that although the land may be part of an ancient reservation land grant, as the OIN had not controlled it for more than 200 years, during which time it was non-Indian territory, the tribe could not re-establish its immunity (from state law) over those lands.

To "re-establish sovereign authority" over ancient tribal lands which the Oneida had re-acquired on the open market, the U.S. Supreme Court said that the "proper avenue" for the Oneida Indian Nation was through § 465 of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]]. The OIN needed to apply to the Department of the Interior to place the disputed lands into federal trust.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation'', 544 US 197, 217-221 [2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Comments on the court decision varied. The issue in ''Sherrill'' was whether the city could levy property taxes on OIN's re-acquired tribal lands. The US Supreme Court determined that the City of Sherrill could levy property taxes. But the court failed to overturn the Second Circuit's finding that the land qualified as Indian Territory.

OIN supporters argue that ''Sherrill'' stands only to say that the OIN cannot re-instate its tax immunity, but that the land is Indian Land. UCE and its supporters disagreed; they counter that the ''Sherrill'' ruling provided a blanket approval for the jurisdictions to foreclose on all OIN property that owe back taxes. Some UCE members interpreted the ruling as making the OIN casino operation illegal under state law. They speculate that it should be closed until the state and the tribe reach a new agreement on gaming.

===Land trust application===

In April 2005, the OIN applied to the Department of Interior to have this land taken into federal trust on its behalf.  By letter dated June 10, 2005, Associate Deputy Secretary Cason advised [[Ray Halbritter]], the tribe's lead on this issue, of its position:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Department of Interior’s ("DOI") position with respect to certain issues related to the status of OIN lands ... we do not agree with [the] assertion that the Court’s ruling in Sherrill recognizes the continuation of restriction on alienation protections over recently re-acquired lands ... it is our opinion that Court in ''City of Sherrill'' unmistakably held that the lands at issue (property interests purchased by OIN on the open market) are subject to real property taxes. In the event these taxes are not paid, we believe such lands are subject to foreclosure. Further, please be advised that the BIA is in the process of taking appropriate action to clarify that its recordation of OIN deeds does not have the legal effect of designating these lands as restricted against alienation pursuant to 25 USC 177."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Exhibit-C-10-JUN-05-Letter-of-James-E-Cason.pdf|title=James E. Cason Letter, June 10, 2005|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In order to accept the lands as federal trust property, the BIA had to prepare an [[environmental assessment]] of the action. On February 27, 2008, the BIA released its Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on taking the lands in question into trust on behalf of the OIN. It recommended that {{convert|13084|acre|km2}} be placed into trust. After this announcement, the DOI gave a 30-day comment period and announced that it would have a decision on or after March 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneidanationtrust.com/ Final Environmental Impact Statement], Oneida Nation Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

Some government officials expressed concern about creating a "patchwork of taxable and tax-exempt properties," making a "jurisdictional nightmare." However, a sting operation conducted in conjunction with OIN Police and the Oneida County Sheriff disproved this argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uticaod.com/news/x222985276/Prostitution-sting-at-Turning-Stone-nets-three Prostitution Sting At Turning Stone Nets Three], Utica OD&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposing the OIN's land-into-trust application, New York State raised the question of whether the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] applies to the OIN, as the OIN had rejected reorganizing according to its rules, by a vote of 12 to 57 on June 17, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/legal_protection_pdf/platkin.pdf|title=Letter from Richard Platkin, Counsel to the Governor, to Franklin Keel, Regional Director, Eastern Regional Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the letter from Richard Platkin, Counsel to the Governor, to Franklin Keel, citing Michael T. Smith's Memorandum to Director, Office of Indian Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs, dated February 24, 1982, "the Oneida were considered not eligible, but in a reconsideration based on the discussion in the case of 'US v Boylan', the Department of Interior changed its position and conducted the referendum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/legal_protection_pdf/platkin.pdf |title=Letter from Richard Platkin, Counsel to the Governor, to Franklin Keel, Regional Director, Eastern Regional Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OIN have noted that, as early as 1910, they have been a federally recognized tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/microfilm/m595.pdf |title=Archival roll of Indian Census Rolls, 1850-1940 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-10-09}}, pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;  The OIN is part of the original Oneida tribe that was party to the [[Treaty of Canandaigua|1794 Treaty of Canadaigua]]. In unrelated cases involving other Indian tribes and whether the IRA applied to them, the BIA issued a ruling that the fact that a tribe conducted a vote related to reorganizing under the IRA, was sufficient to establish that an Indian Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/solicitor/opinions/M-37029.pdf |title=M37029 The meaning of "under federal jurisdiction" for purposes of the Indian Reorganization Act |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1980 BIA memorandum determined that the phrase "recognized tribe now under federal jurisdiction" includes tribes that existed in 1934 and had a continuing course of dealing with the United State or some other legal obligation.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt;  To this day, the United States honors its legal obligations to the OIN under the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneidanation.org/uploadedFiles/Departments/Cultural_Heritage/Sub_Pages/09.10.19%20Treaty%20of%201794%20and%20Annuities%20New%20Format.pdf |title=Treaty of Canadaigua and the Oneida Annuity Payments |format=PDF |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any flawed claim that the OIN is not a federally recognized tribe was unequivocally debunked in the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in 2016, where the Court affirmed, inter alia, that the OIN is an Indian Tribe within the meaning of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.&lt;ref&gt;''Upstate Citizens for Equality v. United States, No. 15-1688'' (2d Cir. 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2013, the BIA issued an amendment to its 2008 record of decision, accepting 13,082 acres into federal trust.  In that amendment, the BIA unequivocally determined that the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 is applicable to the OIN not only by virtue of the vote held, but also by the ''Boylan'' litigation, the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua, and the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/344-interior-rod-amendment.pdf |title=Notice Of Filing Of Amendment To The May 20, 2008 Record Of Decision For Oneida Indian Nation Of New York Fee-To-Trust Request |format=PDF |date=2014-02-05 |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted below, New York State, and Oneida and Madison Counties have agreed to this decision's validity and discontinued any legal challenge, in perpetuity.

On March 2008, County Executive Anthony Picente held a public meeting to discuss the possibility of negotiating a settlement before the March 25 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uticaod.com/homepage/x288023488 Picente Seeks Compromise with Oneidas]; for a copy of the transcript of that hearing, FOIL it from [http://www.co.oneida.ny.us/ Oneida County Government] page&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman Arcuri tried to stall the decision by seeking to block such a settlement through legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uticaod.com/archive/x1620713573|title=Arcuri Attempts to Stall Decision|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arcuri"&gt;[http://www.uticaod.com/archive/x1135864165 "Nation Spokesman Says Arcuri's 'Secret' Legislation Is Discriminatory, Immoral"], Upstate Citizens for Equality&lt;/ref&gt; While criticized by both sides for killing any progress made between the two sides, Arcuri said he wanted to encourage negotiations.&lt;ref name="Arcuri"/&gt;

On January 2008, Halbritter sent a proposed settlement offer to the state and the county, but did not receive a response before DOI announced its decision. The OIN offered to negotiate an agreement pertaining to future trust applications, but the state and local governments have not responded.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2008, the DOI announced that it would take {{convert|13004|acre|km2}} into trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneidanationtrust.com/downloadfiles/ROD/Final%20Oneida%20ROD%2005-20-08%20(2).pdf|title=DOI Decision|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OIN offered to negotiate and settle the issues involved, while the state and county officials promised continued litigation.

On or about June 17, 2008, two groups filed separate lawsuits in federal court challenging the DOI's decision.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1824230392/2-suits-filed-opposing-land-into-trust "2 Suits Filed Opposing Land Into Trust Decision"], UCE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upstate-citizens.org/UCE-v-United-States.htm Article re: suit ], UCE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upstate-citizens.org/USDC-UCE-v-US.htm Copy of complaint: ''UCE, et al. v. United States''], UCE&lt;/ref&gt; UCE's suit challenges the DOI's authority to take the land into trust under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, alleging that this trust decision violates the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; The other group alleges that the DOI's decision was arbitrary and capricious because some of the trust land is subject to outstanding litigation between the group and the OIN.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2008 (the deadline to file suit), New York State, Oneida and Madison counties filed their suits in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1165649060/State-Oneida-and-Madison-counties-file-land-into-trust-suit "State, counties file land-into-trust suit"], UCE&lt;/ref&gt; The state and county governments' arguments are similar to those of UCE. The opposing parties allege that the DOI's decision violates the United States constitution and that the DOI's decision was arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

By letter dated January 7, 2009, Steven Miskinis, Esq. of the U.S. Department of Justice notified the Court (in which the above-mentioned challenges to the May 20, 2008 determination are pending) that the U.S. has taken {{convert|18|acre|m2}} of land known as the former United States Air Force Space Command Complex at the Verona Research Facility, Germany Road, [[Verona, New York]] into trust for the OIN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upstate-citizens.org/GAFB-Trust-Notice.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the Assistant Attorney General for the State of New York objected to this action. He requested an expedited conference and asked that the United States voluntarily refrain from any further efforts to transfer land into trust for the Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upstate-citizens.org/USDC-NY-Letter-to-Court-Verona-xfer.pdf|title=Transfer memo|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Kahn dismissed UCE's complaint, including the failed theory that the IRA is unconstitutional, on the basis of longstanding and settled law on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1224398048/Another-ruling-supports-Oneidas-trust-land-push "Judge dismisses citizen-group's claims"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130205075716/http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1224398048/Another-ruling-supports-Oneidas-trust-land-push |date=2013-02-05 }}, ''Utica OD''&lt;/ref&gt;

As detailed below, on May 16, 2013, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]], Oneida County Executive [[Anthony Picente]], Madison County Board of Supervisors Chairman John Becker, and Oneida Indian Nation leader [[Ray Halbritter]] announced a deal that settled all of their differences.  Before the deal became effective, the majority of each government's legislative branches had to approve it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uticaod.com/features/x90717556/Oneidas-reach-revenue-sharing-deal-with-state-counties?zc_p=0 "Oneidas, State, and counties reach a revenue sharing deal"], ''Utica OD''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/05162013-agreement-with-state-oneida-nation-and-oneida-and-madison-counties Cuomo Announces Landmark Agreement between State, Oneida Nation, and Oneida and Madison Counties"], ''Governor of New York''&lt;/ref&gt;  The key components of the agreement are as follows: 
# The OIN will pay 25% of its profits from its new slot machines to the state; 
# The State agrees to allow a maximum of 25,000 acres to be placed into federal trust; 
# The OIN will have exclusive gaming rights within a 10-county region;
# All pending litigation will be withdrawn; and 
# The OIN will charge its own sales tax on cigarettes and gas sales made to non-Indian purchasers, to be paid to the state. Of the 25% revenue that the state will receive, it will give half to the governments of Oneida and Madison counties.

{{main article|Washington Redskins name controversy}}
In 2013, the OIN renewed a campaign to compel the Washington Redskins to change their team name and mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/oneida-indian-nation-is-the-tiny-tribe-taking-on-the-nfl-and-dan-snyder-over-redskins-name/2013/11/16/10ef9290-4c88-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html|title=Oneida Indian Nation is the tiny tribe taking on the NFL and Dan Snyder over Redskins name|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OIN leader Halbritter launched the website "Change the Mascot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.changethemascot.org/|title=Change The Mascot - Launched By The Oneida Indian Nation|website=ChangeTheMascot.org|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014-2015 there was new publicity related to this national campaign, with other Native American tribes participating.

The OIN has both internal and external opposition. Internally, members of the Wolf Clan in particular protest Halbritter's assumption of power and dissolving of the traditional Oneida government, which was based on hereditary leaders for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oneidasfordemocracy.org/|title=Detroit Car Accident Law Firm - Best Auto Accident Attorneys in Michigan|website=oneidasfordemocracy.org|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal governance issues ===
''Shenandoah v. United States DOI,'' 159 F.3d 708, (2d Cir. 1998) was a lawsuit that challenged the legitimacy and authority of Ray Halbritter to act on behalf of the OIN.  Specifically,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In 1977, members of the Oneida Nation appointed Halbritter and two other Nation members as interim representatives of the Nation. On April 25, 1993, the Grand Council, consisting of representatives from all six Iroquois nations, including the Oneida Nation, purported to remove Halbritter from his position as interim Nation representative. The Department [of Interior] acknowledged the removal on August 10, 1993, but the next day stayed its acknowledgment pending BIA review. After requesting the Nation to conduct a referendum to select a representative, the Department agreed to Halbritter's proposal to submit "statements of support" from Nation members. On February 4, 1994, the Department notified Halbritter that it would continue to recognize him as the Nation's permanent representative until such time as he resigned or was removed by the Nation in accordance with certain procedures. According to plaintiffs, on May 21, 1995, the Nation once again removed Halbritter from his position as Oneida representative. Although informed of Halbritter's alleged second removal, the Department had not acted upon that notification by the time of oral argument, and as of the time of this opinion, we have received no information to the contrary."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The district court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss both the non-habeas and habeas claims of the plaintiffs. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court.&lt;ref name=WolfClan&gt;{{cite court |litigants=SHENANDOAH v. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR |reporter=F. 3d |opinion=708 |pinpoint= |court=U.S. 2nd Circuit |date=October 6, 1998 |url=http://openjurist.org/159/f3d/708/shenandoah-v-united-states-department-of-the-interior |publisher=OpenJurist.org |accessdate=April 2016 |quote=The district court's judgment is affirmed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== External issues ===
External opposition comes from organizations such as [[Upstate Citizens for Equality]] (UCE), a group that opposed Haudenosaunee land claims in upstate New York. UCE also opposed the OIN being able to operate its enterprises tax-free on land it asserted sovereign status.&lt;ref&gt;(see [[Oneida Tribe]])&lt;/ref&gt;  These issues were resolved by the [[Oneida_Indian_Nation#2013_landmark_agreement_between_New_York_State,_Madison_and_Oneida_Counties,_and_the_OIN|2013 landmark agreement]].

====Tax issues====
Disputes have arisen with the state over the OIN's economic advantage of operating the Class III gaming facility without having to collect or pay state taxes on retail sales at the resort. The tribe does pay a portion of the revenues to the state under the gaming compact, (essentially in lieu of taxes). The OIN and other parties believed operations on property it controlled were tax free. ''City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation'', 544 US 197 (2005).

Vernon Downs opened a casino to try to compete with Turning Stone. It is heavily taxed under state law. Downs struggles to operate and, in late 2007, many of his original investors pulled out of the venture. The Upstate Citizens for Equality and supporters attribute his failure to the OIN being able to operate its casino tax free.

OIN supporters attribute Downs' troubles to the state collecting a total of 54% of the revenue in taxes, making profitability difficult. In early 2008, the director Steve Gural closed down the racino at Vernon Downs for three days.[7] He was trying to make the state decrease its rate of taxation of the facility, to enable it to be more profitable.[8] This period of closure cost the state approximately $1.5 million in lost tax revenues. (The state has earmarked revenues from gambling for education, which was part of the original campaign to have voters approve the state's authorization of gaming activities.)[8] Many argued that the state should not call this "lost revenue." Building the track created the revenue; without the track, there would be no revenue. The track was facing insolvency.

The OIN asserted that it made up for this lack of land tax by donating to local schools in amounts that exceed the taxes which the county would normally receive from the land plots, in a program known as the Silver Covenant Chain Education Grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneida-nation.net/BRHISTORY.HTML|title=Oneida Indian Nation - A Brief History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As tensions increased between the various local governments, the state government, and the OIN, the OIN decreased or stopped the donations.

Stockbridge Valley School has several OIN children as students, but the OIN has discontinued grants to the school because it disapproved of the views of one teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=1074964438 "School caught in Oneida Nation dispute"], ''Indian Country Today'' [2004/01/24&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In late fall 2003, an OIN representative contacted the Stockbridge Valley Community School District and advised that it would not make the Silver Covenant unless a particular teaching assistant was fired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madisoncounty.org/motf/ExhEAffidavitofRRichards62105.pdf R Richards], Madison County&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v Gould]]'', 14 NY3d 614 [2010] is a case brought on the issue of whether federally recognized Indian Tribes, such as the OIN, have to collect state sales taxes from retail sales to non-Indian consumers made within their reservation.  According to the Court of Appeals in ''Gould'', the Indian Tribe is not subject to State tax law. For purposes of the State Tax Law, the Nation's retail operations on its lands, even if reacquired on the open market, are not subject to state tax law.

===Potential pact between Oneida County and the OIN in 2009===
On May 8, 2009, Anthony Picente, Oneida County Executive, announced a pact between Oneida County and the OIN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wktv.com/news/local/44613472.html Picente Announces Agreement], WKTV&lt;/ref&gt;  The Oneida County Board of Legislators and the State legislature would have had to approve this pact within the next 60 days.  If this pact had been approved, the OIN would have paid $55 million to Oneida County over the next 10 years, beginning with a $30 million lump sum payment the same year.  Additionally, the OIN would have made make Silver Covenant Grants for the next five years, in order to apply for more trust land without county opposition.  In return for this, the county would have agreed to drop its lawsuits and satisfy all pending tax lien and tax foreclosure proceedings.  The OIN would have agreed to impose a sales tax on all businesses situated on its lands equal to Oneida County's sales tax rate.  This OIN sales tax would have been imposed on all non-Indian patrons as well as tribal members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.oneida.ny.us/oneida/node/435 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531104734/http://www.co.oneida.ny.us/oneida/node/435 |archive-date=May 31, 2009 |title=Picente Announces Oneida County Partnership Plan |publisher=[[Oneida County, New York]] |date=May 8, 2009 |accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pact would have required the Oneida County Sheriff and the OIN Police Department to negotiate a law enforcement pact to settle questions of jurisdictional authority and operations.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 27, 2009, the County Board of Legislators rejected the proposed pact, citing many reasons for rejecting the proposed agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 landmark agreement between New York State, Madison and Oneida Counties, and the OIN==
On May 16, 2013, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the OIN reached a settlement agreement between the state, and Oneida and Madison counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/05162013-agreement-with-state-oneida-nation-and-oneida-and-madison-counties Cuomo Announces Landmark Agreement between State, Oneida Nation, and Oneida and Madison Counties"], ''Governor of New York''&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement resolved multiple legal issues between the parties.  Pursuant to the agreement, the OIN would pay 25% of its revenue to the State, a quarter of which is paid to Oneida County and Madison County.  These monies are to offset any property and sales taxes the Counties would otherwise receive if the property remained on the tax rolls.  The State and Madison and Oneida counties agree to withdraw their objections to the OIN's land-trust application, with a cap of {{convert|25000|acres|km2}} that can be transferred to the federal government.  The OIN will have a 10-county (Oneida, Madison, Onondaga, Cayuga, Herkmimer, Oswego, Cortland, Chenango, Otsego, and Lewis counties) geographic gambling monopoly.  The OIN will implement a sales tax system to tax products sold to non-Indians on Indian Territory, such as cigarettes.  And the agreement would terminate all related litigation between the OIN, the state, and Madison and Oneida Counties.  This agreement required the State Legislature, the Oneida County and Madison County Boards of Legislators, the US Department of the Interior, and the Judiciary to ratify this agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianz.com/docs/court/cayuga/280-4.pdf|title=Agreement text|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2013, the Oneida County Board of Legislators approved the agreement in a 16-13 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocgov.net/node/1758|title=Historic Settlement Agreement Approved|work=ocgov.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 29, 2013, New York State, through Governor Cuomo, signed the agreement.  On May 30, 2013, the Madison County Board of Supervisors approved the agreement in a weighted vote of 847-653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/05/madison_county_oneida_nation-n.html|title=Madison County approves Oneida nation-New York land, taxes agreement|work=syracuse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 1, 2014, the US Department of the Interior approved of the agreement.  On June 22, 2013, both the state Senate (48-11) and the state Assembly (83-44) approved the agreement.  The final entity to approve the agreement was the Judiciary.  On March 4, 2014, US District Court Judge Kahn approved the settlement agreement.  On September 4, 2014, the {{convert|13000|acres|km2}} of OIN real property was formally transferred into US trust.

On August 19, 2013, the Towns of Vernon and Verona jointly filed a lawsuit to oppose the ratified settlement, citing a violation of their freedom of speech and equal protection.  On October 30, 2013, US District Court Judge Kahn remanded the lawsuit to the state court system because the towns lacked standing.  On June 27, 2014, Albany County Supreme Court denied and dismissed the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2014/2014-ny-slip-op-51332-u.html|title=Matter of Town of Verona (Oneida County) v Cuomo|work=Justia Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OIN revenue sharing agreement===
Oneida County offered an OIN revenue sharing agreement with at least five municipalities affected most by the 2013 landmark agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-oneida-daily-dispatch-oneida-ny/20140605/281492159374340 Town of Augusta, Village of Vernon, and City of Sherill approved OIN revenue sharing agreement with Oneida County as of June 4, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  The five municipalities offered this deal are the City of Sherrill, Town of Sylvan, Town of Verona, Village of Vernon, and Town of Augusta.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 27, 2014 the Sherrill City Commission voted 3-1 to accept $160,000 annually from Oneida County, in exchange for the current commission and future commissions waiving their right to challenge the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sherrillny.org/wp-content/uploads/02012/06/14-05-27.doc May 27, 2014 Agenda Minutes]&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 29, 2014, the Vernon Village Board unanimously agreed to receive annual payments of $60,000 from Oneida County in exchange for the current board and future boards waiving their right to challenge the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villageofvernonny.org/articles/article/8882638/178831.htm Meeting Minutes]&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 7, 2014, the Town of Augusta accepted an agreement with Oneida County.  By a 3-1 vote, the town will receive $107,500 a year as compensation for lost property tax revenue based on OIN trust lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocgov.net/sites/default/files/budget/2015/2015%20Adopted%20Budget%20-%2012-30-14.pdf 2015 Oneida County Budget] at p. 42; [http://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-oneida-daily-dispatch-oneida-ny/20140605/281492159374340 Town of Augusta, Village of Vernon, and City of Sherill approved OIN revenue sharing agreement with Oneida County as of June 4, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, several other municipalities and school districts have requested to become part of the OIN revenue sharing agreement.  However, to do this, Oneida County is trying to undo its agreements with the prior municipalities in order to do a new agreement that covers all of the affected municipalities.  This has drawn strong opposition from the original municipalities that accepted the initial agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://romesentinel.com/county/two-municipalities-balk-at-zeroing-out-gaming-revenue-sharing/QBqrkm!Ge1EcGh5pYenSkNRxvSAKQ/ Two municipalities balk at zeroing out gaming revenue sharing agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pakistanis in Afghanistan''' are mostly [[refugee]]s,&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt; but also include laborers, [[merchant|trader]]s, [[businessperson]]s, and small number of [[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations|diplomats]]. Because [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] are neighbouring states with a loosely controlled [[Durand Line|border]], and a distributed population of ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] and [[Baloch people]], there is constant flow of population between the two countries.

== History ==
{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}
Dynasties, such as those of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], as well as nomad people from the [[Indian subcontinent]] (including modern-day Pakistan) have been invading and coming to Afghanistan for the past many centuries. Before the mid-19th century, Afghanistan and the entire present-day Pakistan were part of the [[Durrani Empire]] and ruled by a successive line of [[List of monarchs of Afghanistan|Pashtun kings]] who had their capitals in Afghan cities. In 1857, in his review of [[John William Kaye|J.W. Kaye's]] ''The Afghan War'', [[Friedrich Engels]] describes "Afghanistan" as:{{quote|''[...] an extensive country of Asia [...] between Persia and the Indies, and in the other direction between the Hindu Kush and the Indian Ocean. It formerly included the Persian provinces of Khorassan and Kohistan, together with Herat, [[Balochistan|Beluchistan]], [[Kashmir|Cashmere]], and [[Sindh|Sinde]], and a considerable part of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] [...] Its principal cities are Kabul, the capital, [[Ghazni|Ghuznee]], [[Peshwar|Peshawer]], and Kandahar.''&lt;ref name="Engels"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/afghanistan/index.htm |title=Afghanistan |accessdate=August 25, 2010 |author=[[Friedrich Engels]] |others=Transcribed by Andy Blunden |quote=The principal cities of Afghanistan are Kabul, the capital, [[Ghazni|Ghuznee]], [[Peshwar|Peshawer]], and Kandahar.|work=The New American Cyclopaedia |volume=1 |year=1857}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus, interaction and migration between the native people in this region was common. After the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], the [[Durand Line]] was established in the late 1800s for fixing the limits of [[sphere of influence]] between [[Mortimer Durand]] of [[British Raj|British India]] and Afghan [[Emir|Amir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]]. When Pakistan inherited this single-page agreement in 1947, which was basically to end political interference beyond the [[frontier]] line between Afghanistan and what was then colonial British India,&lt;ref name="LoC-Smith"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/pub/afghanistan.html |title=A Selection of Historical Maps of Afghanistan - The Durand Line|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |location=United States |first=Cynthia |last=Smith |date=August 2004|accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; it divided the [[List of indigenous peoples|indigenous]] ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribes. 

During the 1980s [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet war]], a large number of Pakistan-based [[Mujahideen]] forces began crossing the [[Durand Line|Pak-Afghan]] border into Afghanistan to fight the Soviets and the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan government]]. 

After the death of Massoud and the removal of the Taliban regime of Afghanistan in late 2001 by [[United States armed forces|US]]-led coalition forces, members of the Taliban regrouped and began a strong [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]] campaign inside Afghanistan. The insurgents are members of Afghan-based and Afghan-led militant groups such as the [[Afghan Taliban]] (including the [[Quetta Shura]] chapter), the [[Haqqani network]], or [[al-Qaida]] and others. The militant groups include a small number of Pakistanis and other Muslim foreigners among their ranks.

==Refugees==
In January 2008, [[BBC News|BBC]] reported that about 6,000 Pakistanis from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] crossed into Afghanistan, which included women and children. While fighting in northwest-Pakistan between the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]] and the [[Pakistani Taliban]] may have been one reason, [[Sectarian violence in Pakistan|Sunni Shia sectarian strife]] was also suggested as a possible driver for their flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7174294.stm|title=Pakistanis flee into Afghanistan|periodical=BBC News|date=2008-01-07|first=Alastair|last=Leithead|accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to receive medical aid in [[Khost Province|Khost]] and [[Paktika Province|Paktika]] provinces. By September 2008, their number had reached 20,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/world/asia/30refugees.html |title=Pakistani Refugees Pour Into Afghanistan  |first=John F. |last=Burns |date=September 29, 2008 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 70% of the refugees were Pakistanis while the rest were [[Afghans in Pakistan|Afghans who had settled in Pakistan]] during the last 20 or so years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7642015.stm|accessdate=2009-04-28|title=Pakistanis flee into Afghanistan|date=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; More Pakistani refugees went to Afghanistan after the [[2010 Pakistan floods]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pajhwok.com/en/photo/149124 Pakistani female beggars in Kabul]. June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pajhwok.com/en/photo/149122 Pakistani female beggar in Kabul].

June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, around 221,432 Pakistanis are found living in Afghanistan. Most of them are in [[Khost Province]] and [[Paktika Province]].&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper |title=Section 2.d. Protection of Refugees |work=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and LaborCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015: Afghanistan |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a small number of Pakistani [[Baloch people|Baloch]] migrants, mainly concentrated in the southern parts of Afghanistan like [[Nimruz Province|Nimruz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/09/pakistani-baloch-find-home-afghanistan-2014911102917695950.html Pakistani Baloch find home in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workers==
Pakistani expatriates have been involved in the rebuilding and reconstruction of Afghanistan and have made contributions towards the [[Afghan economy]]. By 2006, there were about 60,000 Pakistanis working in Afghanistan;&lt;ref name=USIP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/publications/resolving-pakistan-afghanistan-stalemate |title=Resolving the Pakistan- Afghanistan Stalemate |work=Barnett R. Rubin and Abubakar Siddique |date=October 2006 |publisher=[[United States Institute for Peace]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the exact number was unclear because of the lack of government records. Pakistanis could be found working not just in the main cities such as [[Kandahar]], but also less-accessible provinces such as [[Ghazni]], [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], or [[Helmand]]. Many work in the construction sector, while others have found [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs such as information technology professionals for United Nations organisations and foreign companies in urban areas; they have an increasing demand due to their skills and mostly originate from the northwest [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province. As many as one-sixth cross the border on any given day.

In May 2011, several expatriate Pakistanis crossing the border at [[Torkham]] were routinely being harassed and bothered by intelligence agencies in Pakistan; some were asked repetitive questions as to why they were going to Afghanistan while others had their materials and laptops searched. The expatriates sent a complaint and brought the issue to the notice of the Pakistani ambassador in Kabul, [[Mohammed Sadiq (diplomat)|Muhammad Sadiq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=46685&amp;Cat=6&amp;dt=5/13/2011 Pakistanis working in Afghanistan being bothered by agencies], ''The News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
However, NATO and Afghan officials also blame Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) spy network for being involved in terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=news world asia india }} {{Dead link fixed|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan and Afghanistan have an irregular and poorly marked border. This allows militants to frequently cross back and forth across the border unchecked and undetected. A few of the insurgents and militants in Afghan resistance groups were of Pakistani origin. They have been arrested in the last decade and are held in different prisons across the country. They are usually from regions along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, including the [[Waziristan]] region, the city of [[Quetta]] and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, and engaged in attacks against [[United States armed forces|US]]-led [[International Security Assistance Force|NATO forces]] and the [[Government of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/taliban-killer-zar-ajam-duped-terror-attack/story?id=13894578&amp;singlePage=true |title=How the Taliban Turned a Child Into a Suicide Bomber |first=Nick |last=Schifrin |publisher=ABC News |date=June 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/07/28/bombing-suspect-says-pakistani-mullahs-brainwashed-him |title=Bombing suspect says Pakistani mullahs brainwashed him |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/06/15/haqqani-network-threatens-attacks-judges |title=Haqqani network threatens attacks on judges |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=June 15, 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO and Afghan officials also blame Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy network for being involved in some of the attacks. Besides the serious criminals, there are unknown number of Pakistani prisoners in Afghanistan who are held for visa violation or petty crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/05/31/pakistan-afghanistan-discuss-prisoner-swap Pakistan, Afghanistan discuss prisoner swap]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Gerard Scully''' (born 13 January 1963) is an Australian convicted child sex abuser. In June 2018, he was found guilty of one count of human trafficking and five counts of rape and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-14/australian-peter-scully-convicted-in-philippines/9868958 | title=Australian Peter Scully given life sentence for human trafficking, rape in Philippines, reports say | publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] | date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains on trial for numerous other crimes against children, including the production and dissemination of sadistic child pornography, torture and murder.

== Background ==
In 2011 Scully fled from [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], to the [[Philippines]] before he could be charged with 117 fraud and deception offences relating to his involvement with a crooked property scheme.&lt;ref name="SMH bground"&gt;{{Cite web |last1= Mills |first1= Tammy |last2= Vedelago |first2= Chris |last3= Murdoch |first3= Lindsay |date= 6 March 2015 |title= Alleged paedophile Peter Gerard Scully fled a sordid past in Melbourne |url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/alleged-paedophile-peter-gerard-scully-fled-a-sordid-past-in-melbourne-20150306-13x5m8.html | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date= 11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the island of [[Mindanao]] he is alleged to have built up a lucrative international [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] ring that offered [[pay-per-view]] video streams of children being tortured and sexually abused on the [[dark web]]. Among the victims who had their videoed ordeals sold over the Internet was an 18 month old infant who was hung upside down while Scully and two accomplices raped and tortured her.&lt;ref name="NewsAUS deathpen"&gt;{{Cite web |last= Sutton |first= Candace |date= 23 September 2016 |title= Australian child molester Peter Scully faces death penalty in Philippines |url= http://www.news.com.au/world/asia/australian-child-molester-peter-scully-faces-death-penalty-in-philippines/news-story/f15a28a8b971d95f815b5f6105814ff9 |website= news.com.au |access-date= 11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims were procured by Scully with promises to impoverished parents of work, educating their child and the like, or by his two Filipino girlfriends, Carme Ann Alvarez and Liezyl Margallo,&lt;ref name="SMH deathpen"&gt;{{Cite web |last= Murdoch |first= Lindsay |date= 20 September 2016 |title= Death penalty call for accused Australian child sex predator Peter Scully in Philippines |url= http://www.smh.com.au/world/death-penalty-call-for-accused-australian-child-sex-predator-peter-scully-in-philippines-20160920-grk65r.html | work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date= 11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other female acquaintances such as Maria Dorothea Chi y Chia.&lt;ref name="ABSCBN another"&gt;{{Cite web |last= Mendoza |first= Greanne |date= 17 February 2017 |title= Another suspect linked to Australian sex fiend arrested |url= http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/17/17/another-suspect-linked-to-australian-sex-fiend-arrested |website= [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News]] |access-date= 11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Alvarez and Margallo also abused children in Scully's videos.

One instance involved the entrapment of two cousins, aged 9 and 12, who might perhaps have narrowly avoided being murdered. After Alvarez, a former child prostitute whom Scully had picked up off the streets and [[child grooming|groomed]] to be a compliant accomplice, had coaxed the two girls back to Scully's abode with a promise of food, he forced them to perform sex acts on each other, which he photographed and videoed. With Alvarez's assistance, Scully also sexually abused both of them. The girls were kept chained in dog collars and, after an escape attempt, were made to dig what they were told would be their own graves.&lt;ref name="SMH deathpen" /&gt; After five days of abuse, Alvarez took pity on them, releasing them and letting them escape. The cousins went to the police; Alvarez was arrested and Scully went on the run.

=== ''Daisy's Destruction'' ===
The most notorious of Scully's output was titled ''Daisy's Destruction'', which he sold to clients for up to $10,000.&lt;ref name="SMH deathpen" /&gt; Made in 2012, the multi-part film is so extreme that it was for some time regarded as an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Waugh |first= Rob |date= 26 September 2016 |title= What is Daisy's Destruction?

Urged on by Scully, some of the worst physical and sexual abuse was carried out on the children by one of his girlfriends, Liezyl Margallo, a former child prostitute then 19 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1= Alipon |first1= Joworski |last2= Andrade |first2= Angelo |date= 27 January 2017 |title= Filipina behind brutal 'Daisy' sex videos arrested |url= http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/01/27/17/filipina-behind-brutal-daisy-sex-videos-arrested |website= ABS-CBN News |access-date= 11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it seems Margallo was the sole hands-on victimizer of Daisy: The introduction to the film invites the viewer to watch Daisy's "mental ruin" as she "learn[s] how to please her mistress".&lt;ref name="60 Mins monster" /&gt;

Scully put ''Daisy's Destruction'' out under his No Limits Fun "production company", selling it to other pedophiles via the [[dark web]]. Among those who acquired it was one of the biggest ever purveyors of child pornography, Scully's fellow Australian Matthew David Graham. Apprehended at age 22, he ran a series of "[[hurtcore]]" child pornography sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/national/lux-captured-the-simple-error-that-brought-down-the-worlds-worst-hurtcore-paedophile-20160513-goum54.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Dunn |first= Matthew |date= 20 February 2016 |title= FBI describe dark net paedophile kingpin as one of the most prolific child sex offenders ever |url= http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/censorship/fbi-describe-dark-net-paedophile-kingpin-as-one-of-the-most-prolific-child-sex-offenders-ever/news-story/eb468fcdb238a09883a1a6fe3b69d0a2 |website= news.com.au |access-date= 11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham said he got the video so he could use it to attract more viewers to his network of websites.

== Arrest and trial ==
After ''Daisy's Destruction'' surfaced, an international manhunt was launched. Scully was eventually tracked to [[Malaybalay|Malaybalay City]] in the Philippines and arrested on 20 February 2015. Investigators had six warrants for his arrest,&lt;ref name="60 Mins monster"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Catching a Monster |access-date= 4 November 2018 |series= [[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]] |first= Tara |last= Brown |network= [[Nine News]] |station= |date= 2015 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI33EPlCW5w Part 1] - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MftNB12leI Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt; all relating to the abduction and sexual abuse of the two cousins.&lt;ref name="SMH deathpen" /&gt;

While they searched for Scully in the Philippines, investigators managed to uncover the fates of the three primary victims in ''Daisy's Destruction''. Liza was found to be alive, as was Daisy, though her treatment had been so vicious that she has lasting physical injuries. Eleven-year-old Cindy had been murdered, allegedly by Scully. Before being strangled to death with a rope, the girl was subjected to bouts of rape and torture, and was made to dig her own grave. According to Margallo,&lt;!-- she may have claimed this to help explain how she knew of the details about Cindy's murder ("Scully showed me the video, that's how I know..." --&gt; Scully videotaped himself killing Cindy.&lt;ref name="60 Mins monster" /&gt;

Scully faced a total of 75 charges. He was on trial with others who assisted in the production of his pornography, including four men&amp;nbsp;— Germany's Christian Rouche, Filipinos Alexander Lao and Althea Chia and a Brazilian doctor, Haniel Caetano de Oliveira.&lt;ref name="NewsAUS deathpen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Reformina |first= Ina |date= 6 March 2015 |title= Australian behind 'Daisy' sex videos charged |url= http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/03/06/15/australian-behind-daisy-sex-videos-charged |website= ABS-CBN News |access-date= 11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1= Rocha |first1= Alex |last2= Idaló |first2= Eduardo |date= 21 December 2015 |title= Médico de Uberaba admite pedofilia e se diz doente, segundo PF |url= http://g1.globo.com/minas-gerais/triangulo-mineiro/noticia/2015/12/medico-de-uberaba-admite-relacao-com-pedofilia-e-se-diz-doente-diz-pf.html |language= Portuguese |website= [[Grupo Globo|g1.globo.com]] |access-date= 11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Akullo, then Project Coordinator for the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] and an expert on child abuse investigations,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/documents/southeastasiaandpacific/2014/11/vac/Speakers_Facilitators_Trainers_BIO_3-5_Nov_2014.pdf Regional Training Workshop on Responding to Violence against Children in Contact with the Justice System]. 3–5 November 2014 conference at United Nations Conference Center, Bangkok, Thailand.&lt;/ref&gt; described the case as "horrific" and the worst she had ever heard of.

In 2017, Scully escaped the looming threat of capital punishment after Philippine politicians excluded the crimes of rape, treason and plunder from a bill that reintroduced capital punishment to the country. Supporters of the bill agreed to exclude such crimes from the list of those punishable by the death penalty so as to permit smoother passage of the bill through [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]]. The law passed by 216 votes to 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Murdoch |first=Lyndsay |date=8 March 2017 |title=Alleged sex predator Peter Scully to escape Philippines death penalty if convicted |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/alleged-sex-predator-peter-scully-to-escape-philippines-death-penalty-if-convicted-20170307-gusyz4.html |website=smh.com.au |access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''pollinator decline''' refers to the reduction in abundance of insect and other animal [[pollinator]]s in many [[ecosystem]]s worldwide beginning at the end of the 20th century, and continuing into the present.&lt;ref&gt;Kluser, S. and Peduzzi, P. (2007) [http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:32258/ATTACHMENT01 "Global pollinator decline: a literature review"] [[UNEP]]/GRID – Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollinators participate in sexual reproduction of many [[plant]]s, by ensuring cross-[[pollination]], essential for some [[species]], or a major factor in ensuring [[genetic diversity]] for others. Since [[plant]]s are the primary [[food]] source for [[animal]]s, the reduction of one of the primary pollination agents, or even their possible disappearance, has raised concern, and the [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] of pollinators has become part of [[biodiversity]] conservation efforts.

== Decline ==
Pollinators, which are necessary for 75% of food crops, are declining globally in both abundance and diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Dirzo|first= Rodolfo|author2= Hillary S.

The [[Colony collapse disorder|decline in bee numbers]] has attracted much public attention.  Members of the British Beekeepers' Association have issued numerous warnings in the 21st century that the country's bees are in rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/8306970/Einstein-was-right-honey-bee-collapse-threatens-global-food-security.html|title=Einstein was right - honey bee collapse threatens global food security|publisher=''The Daily Telegraph''|date=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1547243/Flowers-and-fruit-crops-facing-disaster-as-disease-kills-off-bees.html|title=Flowers and fruit crops facing disaster as disease kills off bees|publisher=''The Daily Telegraph''|date=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in 2013, Elizabeth Grossman noted that the winter losses of beehives had increased in recent years in Europe and the United States, with a hive failure rate up to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/features/declining_bee_populations_pose_a_threat_to_global_agriculture|title=Declining Bee Populations Pose a Threat to Global Agriculture|publisher=''Yale Environment 360''|date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In France, the [[honey]] harvest for 2017 has been estimated at around 10,000 tons, representing a decline of two-thirds against the average annual harvest during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"/&gt;

A 2017 study led by [[Radboud University Nijmegen|Radboud University's]] Hans de Kroon, using 1,500 samples from 63 sites, indicated that the biomass of insect life in Germany had declined by three-quarters in the previous 25 years.  Participating researcher Dave Goulson of [[Sussex University]] stated that their study suggested that humans are making large parts of the planet uninhabitable for wildlife.  Goulson characterized the situation as an approaching "ecological Armageddon", adding that "if we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse".  Lynn Dicks at the [[University of East Anglia]] in 2017 estimated the rate of decline in flying insect biomass at roughly 6% a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers|title=Warning of 'ecological Armageddon' after dramatic plunge in insect numbers|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

The value of animal pollination in human [[nutrition]] and food for [[wildlife]] is immense and difficult to quantify.

An estimated 87.5% of the world's flowering plant species are animal-pollinated,&lt;ref name=Ollerton&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ollerton, J. |author2=Winfree, R. |author3=Tarrant, S. |year=2011 |title=How many flowering plants are pollinated by animals? |journal=Oikos |volume=120 |issue=3 |pages=321–326 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18644.x/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18644.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 35% of crop production&lt;ref name=Kremen&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kremen, C. |author2=Williams, N.M. |author3=Aizen, M.A. |author4=Gemmill-Herren, B. |author5=LeBuhn, G. |author6=Minckley, R. |author7=Packer, L. |author8=Potts, S.G. |author9=Roulston, T.a. |author10=Steffan-Dewenter, I. |author11=Vázquez, D.P. |author12=Winfree, R. |author13=Adams, L. |author14=Crone, E.E. |author15=Greenleaf, S.S. |author16=Keitt, T.H. |author17=Klein, A.-M. |author18=Regetz, J. |author19=Ricketts, T.H. |year=2007 |title=Pollination and other ecosystem services produced by mobile organisms: a conceptual framework for the effects of land-use change |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=299–314 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01018.x |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01018.x|pmid=17355569 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of crop plant species&lt;ref&gt;Roubik, D.W., 1995. "Pollination of Cultivated Plants in the Tropics". In: Agricultural Services Bulletin 118. Food Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy. Pages 142–148&lt;/ref&gt; depend on animal pollinators. This includes the majority of [[fruit]]s, many [[vegetable]]s (or their [[Seed#Economic importance|seed crop]]), and secondary effects from [[legume]]s such as [[alfalfa]] and [[clover]] fed to livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washcoll.edu/centers/ces/crfrs/natural-lands-project/pollinators/|title=Pollinators|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural Lands Project|publisher=Washington College|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Drs. [[Roger Morse]] and Nicholas Calderone of [[Cornell University]] attempted to quantify the effects of just one pollinator, the [[western honey bee]], on only [[United States|US]] food crops. Their calculations came up with a figure of US$14.6 billion in food crop value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterbeekeeper.org/pdf/pollination.pdf |title=The Value of Honey Bees As Pollinators of U.S. Crops in 2000 |author1=[[Roger Morse]]|author2=Nicholas Calderone|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|year=2000|accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722231655/http://www.masterbeekeeper.org/pdf/pollination.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, another study calculated the worldwide value of pollination to agriculture. They calculated the costs using the proportion of each of 100 crops that need pollinators that would not be produced in case insect pollinators disappeared completely. The economic value of insect pollination was then of €153 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallai | first1 = N. | last2 = Salles | first2 = J.

=== Nutritional consequences ===
Several large-scale studies have looked at the nutritional consequences of pollinator decline. Since pollinators are responsible for propagating certain plants and crops, populations that are heavily reliant on those crops are at risk for malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/loss-honey-bees-pollinators-mean-malnutrition-millions-around-world|title=Loss of honey bees and other pollinators could mean malnutrition for millions around the world|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the size of the effect that pollinator decline has on an area depends on the local diet.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Alicia M.|last2=Myers|first2=Samuel S.|last3=Ricketts|first3=Taylor H.|date=2015-01-09|title=Do Pollinators Contribute to Nutritional Health?|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114805|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=e114805|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0114805|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2015PLoSO..10k4805E}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2015 study published in the Public Library of Science, pollinator decline is most likely to have negative impacts on the nutritional health of an area when the people living there get the majority of their nutrients from crops that are heavily dependent on pollinators, the affected people are not already severely deficient in a nutrient or consuming significantly higher amounts of the nutrient than is recommended, they do not have access to other foods that could substitute the nutrients from the crops they are losing, and they do not have access to supplements, fortified foods, or targeted nutrition programs that could help ensure they are still getting adequate nutrients. In contrast, populations whose diets are not heavily based on pollinator-dependent crops likely will not be affected by pollinator decline to the same extent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2015 study done by the Harvard School of Public Health modeled what would happen should 100% of pollinators die off. In that scenario, 71 million people in low-income countries would become deficient in vitamin A, and the vitamin A intake of 2.2 billion people who are already consuming less than the recommended amount would further decline. Similarly, 173 million people would become deficient in folate, and 1.23 million people would further lessen their intake. Additionally, the global fruit supply would decrease by 22.9%, the global vegetable supply would decrease by 16.3%, and the global supply of nuts and seeds would decrease by 22.1%. This would lead to 1.42 million additional deaths each year from noncommunicable and malnutrition-related diseases, as well as 27 million disability-adjusted life years. In a less extreme scenario wherein only 50% of pollinators die off, 700,000 additional deaths would occur each year, as well as 13.2 million disability-adjusted years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-11-14|title=Effects of decreases of animal pollinators on human nutrition and global health: a modelling analysis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615610856|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=386|issue=10007|pages=1964–1972|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61085-6|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 study done in the United Kingdom, vitamin A was identified as the most pollinator-dependent nutrient.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaplin-Kramer|first=Rebecca|last2=Dombeck|first2=Emily|last3=Gerber|first3=James|last4=Knuth|first4=Katherine A.|last5=Mueller|first5=Nathaniel D.|last6=Mueller|first6=Megan|last7=Ziv|first7=Guy|last8=Klein|first8=Alexandra-Maria|date=2014|title=Global malnutrition overlaps with pollinator-dependent micronutrient production|jstor=43601745|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|volume=281|issue=1794|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin A deficiency is one of the biggest malnutrition concerns when it comes to pollinator decline, as it is one of the leading causes of blindness, accounting for 500,000 cases annually.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eilers|first=Elisabeth J.|last2=Kremen|first2=Claire|last3=Greenleaf|first3=Sarah Smith|last4=Garber|first4=Andrea K.|last5=Klein|first5=Alexandra-Maria|date=2011-06-22|title=Contribution of Pollinator-Mediated Crops to Nutrients in the Human Food Supply|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021363|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=6|pages=e21363|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021363|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2011PLoSO...621363E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin A deficiency is also responsible for the deaths of about 800,000 women and children worldwide, as well as between 20% and 24% of deaths from measles, diarrhea, and malaria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An estimated 70% of dietary vitamin A worldwide is found in crops that are animal pollinated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Folate deficiency, a type of vitamin B, is also of concern. An estimated 55% of folate is found in animal-pollinated crops such as beans and dark, leafy, green vegetables. Folate is highly recommended for pregnant women, as it helps to prevent neural tube defects in fetuses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Calcium, fluoride, and iron deficiencies are also likely consequences of pollinator decline. Animal pollinators are responsible for 9%, 20%, and 29% of fruits and nuts that contain calcium, fluoride, and iron, respectively. While those percentages are not high compared to how much of those nutrients come from meat and dairy, fruits and nuts are more bioavailable. More so, meat and dairy production is expensive, inefficient, and not feasible in certain areas. Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide, leading to preventable cognitive impairment and infection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Additionally, 74% of all globally produced lipids are found in oils from plants that are animal pollinated, as well as 98% of vitamin C.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Increasing public awareness ==

Some international initiatives (e.g. the International Pollinator Initiative (IPI)) highlight the need for public participation and awareness of pollinator, such as bees, conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, A., and Fitzpatrick, U. 2009. Bee conservation policy at the global, regional and national levels. Apidologie 40(3):194-210&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollinators and their health have become growing concerns, resulting in an increase in public awareness. Around 18 states within America have responded to these concerns by creating legislation to address the issue. According to the [[National Conference of State Legislatures]], the enacted legislation in those states addresses five specific areas relating to pollinator decline: "awareness; research; pesticides; habitat protection; and beekeeping".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/pollinator-health.aspx|title=Pollinator Health|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible explanations ==
Probable explanations for the decline in pollinators can be attributed to the use of pesticides, pests and diseases, [[habitat destruction]], [[air pollution]], pollinators' reaction to climate change, the effects of [[monoculture]] (especially in regards to bees), and the [[intraspecific competition]] and [[interspecific competition]] between "native and introduced or [[invasive species]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/11761/chapter/5|title=3 Causes of Pollinator Declines and Potential Threats {{!}} Status of Pollinators in North America {{!}} The National Academies Press|language=en|doi=10.17226/11761}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ento.psu.edu/research/labs/john-tooker/news/2014/how-do-monocultures-influence-bee-health|title=How do monocultures influence bee health?

=== Pesticide use ===
{{Further|Bees and toxic chemicals|Regent (insecticide)|Pesticide toxicity to bees}}

Studies have linked [[neonicotinoid]] pesticide exposure to bee health decline.&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=Mickaël|author2=Maxime Béguin, Fabrice Requier, Orianne Rollin, Jean-François Odoux, Pierrick Aupinel, Jean Aptel, Sylvie Tchamitchian, and Axel Decourtye|title=A Common Pesticide Decreases Foraging Success and Survival in Honey Bees|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=April 20, 2012|issue=6076|pages=348–350|doi=10.1126/science.1215039 |volume=336|pmid=22461498|bibcode=2012Sci...336..348H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whitehorn&gt;{{cite journal|last= Whitehorn|first=Penelope|author2=Dave Goulson|title=Neonicotinoid Pesticide Reduces Bumble Bee Colony Growth and Queen Production|journal=Science|volume=336|date=April 2012|issue=6076|pages=351–352|doi=10.1126/science.1215025 |authorlink2=Dave Goulson|pmid=22461500|bibcode=2012Sci...336..351W}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies add to a growing body of scientific literature and strengthen the case for removing pesticides toxic to bees from the market. Pesticides interfere with honey bee brains,&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt; affecting their ability to navigate. Pesticides prevent bumble bees from collecting enough food to produce new queens.&lt;ref name=Whitehorn/&gt;

Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to a range of insects, including honey bees and other pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feldman|first=Jay|title=Protecting Pollinators: Stopping the Demise of Bees|url=http://www.beyondpesticides.org/pollinators/documents/protectingpollinators.pdf|work=Pesticides and You|publisher=Beyond Pesticides}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are taken up by a plant’s vascular system and expressed through pollen, nectar, and [[guttation]] droplets from which bees forage and drink. They are particularly dangerous because, in addition to being acutely toxic in high doses, they also result in serious sublethal effects when insects are exposed to chronic low doses, as they are through pollen and water droplets laced with the chemical, as well as dust that is released into the air when [[Imidacloprid effects on bees|coated seeds]] are planted. These effects cause significant problems for the health of individual honey bees, as well as the overall health of honey bee colonies, and they include disruptions in mobility, navigation, feeding behavior, foraging activity, memory and learning, and overall hive activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muglacongress.org/eng/?page=invitation_apimondia_president|title=Invitation Letter of Apimondia President|last=McCabe|first=Philip|date=|website=International Mugla Beekeeping &amp; Pine Honey Congress|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A French 2012 study of ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' (western honey bee or European honey bee)&lt;ref name="French_2012"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |date=20 April 2012 |volume=336 |number=6079 |pages=348–350 |doi=10.1126/science.1215039 |pmid=22461498 |title=A Common Pesticide Decreases Foraging Success and Survival in Honey Bees |first1=Mickaël |last1=Henry |first2=Maxime |last2=Béguin |first3=Fabrice |last3=Requier |first4=Orianne |last4=Rollin |first5=Jean-François |last5=Odoux |first6=Pierrick |last6=Aupine |first7=Jean |last7=Aptel1 |first8=Sylvie |last8=Tchamitchian |first9=Axel |last9=Decourtye |accessdate=4 October 2014 |url=http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/files/abeilles-pesti-2.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003456/http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/files/abeilles-pesti-2.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= |bibcode=2012Sci...336..348H }}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the neonicotinoid pesticide [[thiamethoxam]], which is metabolized by bees into [[clothianidin]], a pesticide cited in legal action, tested the hypothesis that a sublethal exposure to a neonicotinoid indirectly increases hive death rate through homing failure in foraging honey bees. When exposed to sublethal doses of thiamethoxam, at levels present in the environment, honey bees were less likely to return to the hive after foraging than control bees that were tracked with radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagging technology, but not intentionally dosed with pesticides. Higher risks are observed when the homing task is more challenging. The survival rate is even lower when exposed bees are placed in foraging areas with which they are less familiar.&lt;ref name="French_2012"/&gt;

In their 2014 study of ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'' (buff-tailed bumblebee or large earth bumblebee), researchers tracked bees using RFID tagging technology, and found that a sublethal exposure to either [[imidacloprid]] (a neonicotinoid) and/or a [[pyrethroid]] (?-[[cyhalothrin]]) over a four-week period caused impairment of the bumblebee's ability to [[forage]].&lt;ref name="Gill_Raine_2014"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Functional Ecology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1459–1471 |title=Chronic impairment of bumblebee natural foraging behaviour induced by sublethal pesticide exposure |first1=Richard J. |last1=Gill |first2=Nigel E. |last2=Raine |date=7 July 2014 |doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imidacloprid effects on bees]] were examined by researchers exposing colonies of bumblebees to levels of imidacloprid that are realistic in the natural environment, then allowed them to develop under field conditions. Treated colonies had a significantly reduced growth rate and suffered an 85% reduction in production of new queens compared to unexposed control colonies. The study shows that [[bumblebee]]s, which are wild pollinators, are suffering similar impacts of pesticide exposure to "managed" honey bees. Wild pollinators provide [[ecosystem services]] both in agriculture and to a wide range of wild plants that could not survive without insect pollination.&lt;ref name=Whitehorn/&gt;

In March, 2012, commercial beekeepers and environmental organizations filed an emergency legal petition with the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to suspend use of clothianidin, urging the agency to adopt safeguards. The legal petition, supported by over one million citizen petition signatures, targets the pesticide for its harmful impacts on honey bees. The petition points to the fact that the EPA failed to follow its own regulations. EPA granted a conditional, or temporary, registration of clothianidin in 2003 without a field study establishing that the pesticide would have no "unreasonable adverse effects" on pollinators. The conditional registration was contingent upon the submission of an acceptable field study, but this requirement has not been met. EPA continues to allow the use of clothianidin 9 years after acknowledging that it had an insufficient legal basis for initially allowing its use. Additionally, the product labels on pesticides containing clothianidin are inadequate to prevent excessive damage to nontarget organisms, which is a violation of the requirements for using a pesticide and further warrants removing all such mislabeled pesticides from use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The disappearance of honeybees was documented in the 2009 film ''[[Vanishing of the Bees]]'' by George Langworthy and [[Maryam Henein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Vanishing of the Bees|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/09/vanishing-of-the-bees-review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 June 2015|date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rapid transfer of parasites and diseases of pollinator species around the world ===

Increased international commerce has moved [[diseases of the honey bee]] such as American foulbrood and chalkbrood, and parasites such as [[varroa]] [[mite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Victoria (7 June 2012) [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/18339797 Honeybee virus: Varroa mite spreads lethal disease] BBC Nature News, Retrieved 11 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[acarina]] mites, and the small African hive beetle to new areas of the world, causing much loss of bees in the areas where they do not have much resistance to these pests. [[Solenopsis invicta|Imported fire ants]] have decimated ground-nesting bees in wide areas of the southern US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Loss of habitat and forage ===

Bees and other pollinators face a higher risk of extinction due to loss of habitat and access to natural food sources. The global dependency on livestock and agriculture has rendered no less than 50% of the earth's landmass uninhabitable for bees. The agricultural practice of planting one crop (monoculture) in a given area year after year leads to extreme malnourishment. Regardless if the planted crop does flower and provide food for the bee, the bee will still be malnourished because a single plant cannot meet its nutrient requirements. Furthermore, the crops needed to support livestock (primarily cattle) tend to be grains which do not provide nectar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lebuhn | first1 = Gretchen | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Detecting Insect Pollinator Declines on Regional and Global Scales | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 113–120 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01962.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial water bodies, open urban areas, large industrial facilities including heavy industry, railways and associated installations, buildings and installations with sociocultural purpose, camping, sports, playgrounds, golf courts, oilseed crops other than oilseed
rape such as sunflower or linseed, some spring cereals and former forest clearcuts or windthrows were frequently associated with high honey bee colony losses.&lt;ref name=Clermont&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Clermont, A.. |author2=Eickermann, M. |author3=Kraus, F. |author4=Hoffmann, L.|author5=Beyer, M.|year=2015 |title=Correlations between land covers and honey bee colony losses in a country with industrialized and rural regions |journal=Science of the Total Environment |volume=532 |pages=1–13 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.05.128 |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.05.128|bibcode=2015ScTEn.532....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at UC Berkeley and UC Davis have found that if farms were to plant and maintain wildflower borders around their crop fields, they would see an eight-fold increase in bee abundance compared to farms without wildflower habitat. While most farms use managed bees, from either their own hives or rented, to pollinate their crops, wild bees can meet 100% of their pollination needs so long as they are plentiful. By maintaining wildflowers near their crops, farms would be able to resource natural pollination. The act of providing pollinators with more nutrient rich habitats, while having the benefit of  "free" crop pollination, is a simple way to aid in the reduction of pollinator decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icpbees.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CA-Row-Crops-Habitat-Guide-FINAL-1.pdf May, E.; Ward, K.; Williams, N; Ullmann, K; Isaacs, R; Kay Cruz, J.; Bolte, K.; Foltz Jorda, S.; Hopwood, J.; Vaughan, M.. (2017). "Establishing Wildflower Habitat to Support Pollinators of California Row Crops". The University of California, Davis and The Xerces Society of Invertebrate Conservation. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air pollution ===

Researchers at the [[University of Virginia]] have discovered that [[air pollution]] from [[automobile]]s and [[power plant]]s has been inhibiting the ability of pollinators such as bees and [[butterfly|butterflies]] to find the [[fragrance]]s of [[flower]]s. [[Pollutant]]s such as [[ozone]], [[hydroxyl]], and [[nitrate]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]s bond quickly with volatile scent molecules of flowers, which consequently travel shorter distances intact. There results a [[vicious cycle]] in which pollinators travel increasingly longer distances to find flowers providing them nectar, and flowers receive inadequate pollination to reproduce and diversify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-04/uov-ffd041008.php|title=Flowers' fragrance diminished by air pollution, University of Virginia study indicates|date=10 April 2008|work=EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes in seasonal behaviour due to global warming ===

In 2014, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] reported that bees, butterflies, and other pollinators faced increased risk of extinction because of [[global warming]] due to alterations in the seasonal behaviour of species.&lt;ref name= DailyTelegraph&gt;Gosden Emily (29 March 2014) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/10730667/Bees-and-the-crops-they-pollinate-are-at-risk-from-climate-change-IPCC-report-to-warn.html Bees and the crops they pollinate are at risk from climate change, IPCC report to warn] The Daily Telegraph, Retrieved 30 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change was causing bees to emerge at different times in the year when flowering plants were not available.

=== Artificial lighting at night ===
In June 2018, the ''Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries'' [[:de:Leibniz-Institut für Gewässerökologie und Binnenfischerei|(de)]] released an article that discusses a possible link between the sharp decline in flying insects and also  high levels of light pollution. Many studies would suggest that artificial light at night has negative impacts on insects, and scientists should therefore pay greater attention to this factor when exploring the causes of insect population decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igb-berlin.de/en/news/light-pollution-reason-insect-decline Light pollution a reason for insect decline!?] press release igb-berlin.de, 19 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.photonics.com/Articles/Artificial_Lighting_at_Night_Could_be_Cause_of/a63612 Artificial Lighting at Night Could be Cause of Declining Insect Populations] photonics.com, 29 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/319074 Insects, bats and artificial light at night: Measures to reduce the negative effects of light pollution] in: dspace.library.uu.nl, retrieved 28 July 2018, author: Claudia Rieswijk (2015), Faculty of Science Theses (Master thesis), [[Utrecht university]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The structure of plant-pollinator networks ==
{{importance section|date=August 2015}}
Wild pollinators often visit a large number of plant species and plants are visited by a large number of pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities were found in the structure of networks consisting of the interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure was found to be similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bascompte | first1 = J. | last2 = Jordano | first2 = P. | last3 = Melián | first3 = C. J. | last4 = Olesen | first4 = J.

The structure of plant-pollinator networks may have large consequences for the way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions. Mathematical models, examining the consequences of this network structure for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bastolla | first1 = U. | last2 = Fortuna | first2 = M.

But it also means that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions.&lt;ref name=Lever_et_al /&gt;

Such a community-wide collapse, involving many pollinator species, can occur suddenly when increasingly harsh conditions pass a critical point and recovery from such a collapse might not be easy. The improvement in conditions needed for pollinators to recover, could be substantially larger than the improvement needed to return to conditions at which the pollinator community collapsed.&lt;ref name=Lever_et_al /&gt;

== Solutions ==

=== Conservation and restoration ===
Efforts are being made to sustain pollinator diversity in agricultural and natural ecosystems by some [[Environmental movement|environmental]] groups.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Prairie restoration]], establishment of [[wildlife preserve]]s, and encouragement of diverse wildlife landscaping rather than mono culture lawns, are examples of ways to help pollinators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=21st Century Homestead: Beekeeping|last=Reuber|first=Brant|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2015|isbn=978-1-312-93733-8|location=|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the [[Obama administration]] published a fact sheet, "The Economic Challenge Posed by Declining Pollinator Populations", which stated that the "President's 2015 budget recommends approximately $50 million across multiple agencies within USDA to ... strengthen pollinator habitat in core areas, double the number of acres in the [[Conservation Reserve Program]] that are dedicated to pollinator health".&lt;ref name=obama&gt;{{cite web|author1=Office of the Press Secretary|title=The Economic Challenge Posed by Declining Pollinator Populations|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/20/fact-sheet-economic-challenge-posed-declining-pollinator-populations|publisher=The White House|accessdate=31 August 2015|format=Factsheet|date=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their three core projects are standardization of methods for studying the honey bee, colony loss monitoring, and bridging research and practice.&lt;ref name=coloss&gt;{{cite web|title=COLOSS|url=http://www.coloss.org/|publisher=Institute of Bee Health University of Bern|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contract pollination ===
The decline of pollinators is compensated to some extent by beekeepers becoming migratory, following the bloom northward in the spring from southern wintering locations. Migration may be for traditional honey crops, but increasingly is for [[contract]] pollination to supply the needs for growers of crops that require it.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Hashtag activism===
In 2014, [[Honey Nut Cheerios]] and [[Burt's Bees]] joined forces to support the [[Bring Back the Bees]] campaign, which aims to inform people about the potentially catastrophic decline in the bee population. As of 2017, Honey Nut Cheerios has sold over 1.5 billion wildflower seeds, greatly surpassing their goal of 100 million.&lt;ref name= "Honey Nut Cheerios Wildflowers"/&gt;

The '''Senoi''' (also spelled '''Sengoi''' and '''Sng'oi''') are a group of [[Malaysia]]n peoples classified among the [[Orang Asli]], the indigenous peoples of Peninsular Malaysia. They are the most numerous of the [[Orang Asli]] and widely distributed across the peninsula. The Senois speak various branches of [[Aslian languages]] which in turn a branch of [[Austroasiatic languages]], many of them are also bilingual in the national language, [[Malaysian language]] (Bahasa Malaysia). Their main means of subsistence is [[swidden]] agriculture, which may be supplemented with hunting, fishing, gathering, and the processing and sale of forest products.

The Senoi people are also known as '''Sakai''' people among the locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivor Hugh Norman Evans|title=The Negritos of Malaya|year=1968|contribution=|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=07-146-2006-8|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Malaysian Malay|Malay people]], the term ''sakai'' is a derogatory term in [[Malaysian language|Malay language]] and its derivative word ''menyakaikan'' means "to treat with arrogance and contempt". However, for the Senoi people ''mensakai'' means "to work together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Salma Nasution Khoo &amp; Abdur-Razzaq Lubis|title=Kinta Valley: Pioneering Malaysia's Modern Development|year=2005|contribution=|publisher=Areca Books|isbn=98-342-1130-9|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the colonial British administration, [[Orang Asli]] living in the northern Malay Peninsula were classified as Sakai and to a point later it was also a term to refer to all [[Orang Asli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ooi Keat Gin|title=Historical Dictionary of Malaysia|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-6305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often misunderstood that Senoi people who have abandoned their own language for the [[Malaysian language|Malay language]] are called the Blandas, Biduanda or Mantra people.&lt;ref name="TTW124"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra Khor Manickam|title=Taming the Wild: Aborigines and Racial Knowledge in Colonial Malaya|year=2015|contribution=|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=99-716-9832-3|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blandas people are of the Senoi race from [[Melaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter William Skeat &amp; Charles Otto Blagden|title=Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula: Preface.

==Demography==
The Senoi tribes live in the central part of the [[Malay Peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keene.edu/library/orangasli/map1.cfm Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118135634/http://www.keene.edu/library/orangasli/map1.cfm |date=18 November 2011 }}, Keen State College&lt;/ref&gt; and consist of six different groups, the [[Semai people|Semai]], [[Temiar people|Temiar]], [[Mah Meri people|Mah Meri]], [[Jah Hut people|Jah Hut]], [[Semaq Beri people|Semaq Beri]] and the [[Cheq Wong people|Cheq Wong]] and have a total population of about 60,000.&lt;ref name =codenavia /&gt; An example of a typical Senoi (Central Sakai) people, the purest of the Sakai are found in Jeram Kawan, [[Batang Padang District]], [[Perak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ivor Hugh Norman Evans|title=Notes on the Sakai of the Ulu Sungkai in the Batang Padang District of Perak|journal=Journal of the Federated Malay States Museums, Volume 6|year=1915|contribution=Selangor State Museum, Kuala Lumpur, Malaya|publisher=|isnn=|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
[[File:Muthukrishnan and Orang Asli Guide at Mount Korbu.JPG|thumb|left|A Senoi man (in the background) serving a hiker (foreground) as a guide at [[Mount Korbu]], [[Perak]], [[Malaysia]].]]
The Senois speak various sub-branches of Aslian languages. The Aslian languages are divided into several branches namely [[Jahaic languages|Jahaic]], [[Semelaic languages|Semelaic]], [[Senoic languages|Senoic]] and Jah Hut. Most Senois speak a branch of Semelaic, Senoic and Jah Hut branches. Almost all Senoic and Semelaic branches are spoken by Senoi peoples (with the exception of the [[Lanoh people]] (also known as Sakai Jeram people)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamid Mohd Isa|title=The Last Descendants of The Lanoh Hunter and Gatherers in Malaysia|year=2015|publisher=Penerbit USM|isbn=98-386-1948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is classified as [[Semang]] but speak a branch of Senoic languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Pacific Linguistics, Issue 42|year=1976|contribution=Linguistic Circle of Canberra. Publications. Series C: Books, Linguistic Circle of Canberra, Australian National University, Australian National University. Research School of Pacific Studies. Dept. of Linguistics|publisher=Australian National University|isbn=|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Semelai people|Semelai]] which is classified as [[Proto-Malay]] but speak a branch of Semelaic languages. Jah Hut language is an isolate within Aslian languages.

==History==
[[File:Women of all nations, a record of their characteristics, habits, manners, customs and influence; (1908) (14583642829).jpg|thumb|right|A Senoi family, 1908.]]
Their ancestors are believed to have arrived from southern [[Thailand]] about 4,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume4/neolithiclife.html "ECONOMIC PATTERNS OF NEOLITHIC LIFE"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215001612/http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume4/neolithiclife.html |date=15 February 2012 }}, The Encyclopedia of Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Malayan Emergency]], the guerrilla war fought from 1948 to 1960 a small fighting force, the [[Senoi Praaq]] was created, which is now part of the [[General Operations Force]] of the [[Royal Malaysia Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/02/24/small-town-with-many-links/ |author=Chang Yi |title=Small town with many LINKS |publisher=The Borneo Post |date=24 February 2013 |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lucid dreaming==
[[Kilton Stewart]], who had travelled among the Senoi before the Second World War wrote about the Senoi in his 1948 doctoral thesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lse.ac.uk/anthropology/research/research_students/PhD_theses/theses1927-60.aspx "Magico-Religious Beliefs and Practices in Primitive Society - a Sociological Interpretation of their Therapeutic Aspects"], [[London School of Economics|LSE]]&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1954 popular book ''Pygmies and Dream Giants''. This work was publicised by [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]] [[Charles Tart]] and [[pedagogue]] [[George Leonard]] in books and at the [[Esalen Institute]] retreat center, and in the 1970s Patricia Garfield describes use of dreams among Senoi, based on her contact with some Senoi at the aborigine hospital in [[Gombak]], Malaysia in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Dreaming-Patricia-Garfield-Ph-D/dp/0345331443 ''Creative Dreaming'', Patricia Garfield, Ph.D.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later researchers were unable to substantiate Stewart's account and in 1985 [[G. William Domhoff]] argued&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Mystique of Dreams: A Search for Utopia Through Senoi Dream Theory]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ucsc.edu/dreams/Library/senoi.html |title=Senoi Dream Theory: Myth, Scientific Method, and the Dreamwork Movement |author=G. William Domhoff |publisher=University of California Santa Cruz |date=March 2003 |accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[anthropologist]]s who have worked with the [[Temiar people]] report that although they are familiar with the concept of [[lucid dreaming]], it is not of great importance to them, but others have argued that Domhoff's criticism is exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.improverse.com/ed-articles/strephon_kaplan_williams_2004_dec_revisiting_senoi.htm ''Revisiting the Senoi Dream Theory:The Bad Logic of Sir G. William Domhoff'', Strephon Kaplan-Williams ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asdreams.org/magazine/articles/domhoff01.htm ''Do Senoi practice "Senoi dream theory"?", G. William Domhoff]&lt;/ref&gt;
Domhoff does not dispute the evidence that dream control is possible, and that dream-control techniques can be beneficial in specific conditions such as the treatment of nightmares: he cites the work of the psychiatrists Bernard Kraków&lt;ref&gt;B. Krakow, R. Kellner, D. Pathk, and L. Lambert, "Imagery rehearsal treatment for chronic nightmares," Behaviour Research &amp; Therapy 33 (1995):837-843&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Krakow et al., "Imagery rehearsal therapy for chronic nightmares in sexual assault survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder: A randomized controlled trial," JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association 286 (2001):537-545&lt;/ref&gt; and Isaac Marks&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Marks, "Rehearsal relief of a nightmare," British Journal of Psychiatry 133 (1978):461-465.&lt;/ref&gt; in this regard. He does, however, dispute some of the claims of the DreamWorks movement, and also the evidence that dream discussion groups, as opposed to individual motivation and ability, make a significant difference in being able to dream lucidly, and to be able to do so consistently.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">The '''Special Agricultural Safeguard''' (SSG) is provision in the [[Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture]].  The SSG allows Member countries to impose additional tariffs on agricultural products if their import volume exceeds defined trigger levels, or if prices fall below specified trigger levels.  Its purpose is to prevent disruption of domestic markets due to import surges or abnormally low import prices.  The SSG applies only to products that are (1) subject to tarrification and (2) in cases where the country has designated a productas eligible for the SSG in its Schedule of Commitments.  It can apply only to imports that exceed tariff-rate quota volumes.  The SSG is an alternative to the general safeguard provision of the GATT and is easier to invoke because it does not require a test of injury or threat of injury.  In the [[Doha Development Agenda]] (DDA) negotiations, the United States, the [[Cairns Group]], and many developing countries have proposed elimination of the SSG.

'''''Star Academy Arab World''''', also known as '''Star Academy: ''Al-Academya''''' ({{lang-ar|الأكاديمية}}) or '''Star Academy Arabia''', is a [[pan-Arab]] televised talent show, which aired in 2003. The show features a group of young male and female candidates who are selected from a [[pan-Arab]] pool of more than three-thousand and are sequestered for four months in "The Academy," a four-story building in [[Lebanon]], where they live, train, and compete against one another every week. The show became an instant success and an everyday much-watched event across the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was adapted from a French show of the same name and is produced by Dutch company [[Endemol]], Vanilla Productions &amp; PAC Ltd. Star Academy Arab World is based on the Spanish format called [[Operación Triunfo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show centers around the 16 candidates who compete in weekly talent competitions, singing, dancing, and acting during on-stage performances. At the end of every week, one contestant is kicked off by a public vote by the viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the show's highlights are the appearances of some of the [[Arab World]]'s most important performers such as [[Najwa Karam]], [[Diana Haddad]], [[Haifa Wahbe]], [[Elissa (Lebanese singer)|Elissa]], [[Angham]], [[Asalah]], [[Ramy Ayach]], [[Myriam Fares]], [[Kazem Al Saher]], [[Nawal Al-Zoghbi]], [[Marwan Khoury]], [[Carole Samaha]], [[Ehab Tawfik]], [[Wael Kfoury]], [[Sherine]], [[Fares Karam]], [[Abdallah Al Rowaished]], [[Saad Lamjarred]] and many more. The show has also been successful for its reinvention and continuous changes, just as, starting from the third season, the show witnessed guests from international superstars such as [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Anggun]], [[Karl Wolf]], [[Tina Arena]], [[Chris De Burgh]] and [[Massari]].

On February 10, 2014, [[LBCI]] [[Capital Broadcast Center|CBC]] &amp; [[Endemol]] Middle East announced that Star Academy will renew another season. The casting started and will be held in [[Amman]], [[Beirut]], [[Erbil]], [[Dubai]], [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], [[Casablanca]], [[Marrakech]], [[Tunis]], and [[Sousse]].

==Overview==
Based in Adma, a city north of [[Beirut, Lebanon]], the show is aired for 4 months on the Egyptian TV station CBC and on the Lebanese terrestrial channel LBC and is hosted by Hilda Khalife. The show follows 16 candidates through their weeks living in "The Academy," training with "teachers," and performing their talents in live on-stage shows. While many choose to sing, talents are not restricted to vocal performances; acting and dancing are also common talents.

The show takes on a few different formats depending on the day of the week. Every day, there is a one-hour "access" show that goes over the day's important and exciting events. On Friday, there is a live performance show where the candidates compete against each other, sometimes alongside famous domestic and international stars, and are voted off one by one. In addition, viewers can tune into "The Academy" 24/7 by watching LBC Reality, a dedicated satellite station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the show is training the students in several disciplines: singing, acting, sports, vocalizing, theatre expression, dancing, and musical culture. Then, each Monday, the three weakest students are nominated. The nomination is done by the teaching staff after the candidates undergo an evaluation test the day before Sunday. On Friday, a special live show called "Prime" is broadcast. During the prime show, the candidates perform and sing either by themselves or with guest artists. The three nominated candidates' initial voting is through the public, done by either phone calls or text messages. The one with the highest percentage of votes returns. The two remaining candidates are then voted on by their fellow candidates, and the one with the most votes remains. The other candidate has to leave the academy immediately. When the overall number of candidates is reduced, the nomination by the professors comes down to two students. At this point, it's completely up to the public to vote who is in and who is out, as the remaining candidates do not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show proved to be immensely popular. As the CBC station also provides satellite connections to more than two dozen Arab countries and to Egyptian and/or Arab communities throughout the world, it became one of the most popular shows in the Arab-speaking world. In [[Saudi Arabia]] in particular, ''Star Academy'' was a media event so popular that its broadcasts achieved record ratings, emptied streets in major cities like [[Jedda]], animated debates, inspired Mosque sermons, and widely distracted students from focusing on final exams in May 2004. (Al-Humaydan, 2005) CBC And LBCI, the networks airing the show, reaped huge profits from the show but have been unable to replicate the show's success with other reality shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate also caused the indefinite postponing of West Asian edition of ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', also known as ''Big Brother – Al Raiss''.

==Reception==

===Conservative response===

While the show is immensely popular among viewers, especially in [[Saudi Arabia]], many conservative and religious leaders have criticized the show for promoting anti-Islamic behavior and ideals. ''Star Academy'' has sparked intense debates over the role of [[Islam]] in public life, Western cultural influence, gender relations, and political participation and has subverted [[Wahhabi]] notions of social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television, Gender, and Authenticity in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Journal of Communication|date=2009|volume=59|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to countless questions from religious Saudi viewers who questioned whether or not it was religiously haram (prohibited) or halal (permitted) to watch the show and participate in the voting component of ''Star Academy'', the Permanent Committee for Scientific Research and the Issuing of Fatwas issued a related [[fatwa]] (religious ruling) that prohibited watching, discussing, voting in, or participating in ''Star Academy'', as well as urging businessmen not to finance this or any similar show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television, Gender, and Authenticity in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Journal of Communication|date=2009|volume=59|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Committee, the [[fatwa]] was issued because the show carried a number of serious issues including "free mixing of the sexes," "the wanton display and unveiling on the part of the women displaying their charms," and blatant promotion of immorality by "making Muslims get used to seeing these shameful scenes that provoke desires and by distancing them from good morals and virtues." The Committee also declared that simply not watching the show was not sufficient; it is also the duty of all practicing Muslims to advise those who watch or take part in the show that it is against religious law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television, Gender, and Authenticity in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Journal of Communication|date=2009|volume=59|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many individuals have also spoken out against the show, citing religious reasoning as well. An [[Imam]] as Mecca’s Great Mosque called ''Star Academy'' a "weapon of mass destruction." Sahwi activists distributed a series of audiocassette sermons entitled "Satan Academy" while still others created similar sermons that compared the reality show to the virulent virus that had caused severe respiratory syndrome in the population. Religious leaders were not the only one to speak out against the show, though. Al-Riyah published a number of hostile op-eds entitled "Star Academy: A Corrupt Satellite Industry" and "Star Academy… The Other Terrorism" that harshly criticized the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television, Gender, and Authenticity in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Journal of Communication|date=2009|volume=59|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal response===

While there was much criticism of the show by the area’s more conservative members of society, many liberals praised the novel approach to television media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television, Gender, and Authenticity in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Journal of Communication|date=2009|volume=59|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous reporters in [[Saudi]] newspapers praised ''Star Academy'' as an alternative to the extremist dogma that had taken over mass media in the nation. In their view, the show acted as an invitation to dialogue as well as an inspiring lesson in democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television, Gender, and Authenticity in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Journal of Communication|date=2009|volume=59|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a column entitled "Star Academy’s Democracy" a female Saudi journalist wrote that "Arabs sheid away from voting because …[of fraud]… until satellite television… corrupted us by inciting us to vote: "vote you are the referee"…"nominate your favorite candidate"…the Arab viewer has become obsessed with voting because results resemble election results in the United States, where unlike Arab elected, no body wins by 99.9 percent but rather by logical proportions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television, Gender, and Authenticity in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Journal of Communication|date=2009|volume=59|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other liberals were exasperated by the conservatives’ excessive reaction to Star Academy. Another female journalist writing for Arab news asked "how vulnerable must we be if a TV program can ‘destroy our moral standards and teach our children bad things." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television, Gender, and Authenticity in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Journal of Communication|date=2009|volume=59|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major liberal voice hailed from within the royal family when Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, a major stakeholder in [[LBC]], supported ''Star Academy'' by sending his private plane to [[Beirut]] to bring the winner back to [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television, Gender, and Authenticity in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Journal of Communication|date=2009|volume=59|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A "Patriot Night"==

On February 14, 2005, Rula Sa'd, the Director of Marketing and Promotions at the LBC acted in her role as "Director of the Academy" to announce to the contestants that [[Rafiq al-Hariri]] had been assassinated and that Lebanon was in mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the only instances in the show's history that a real-life event had intruded upon The Academy. Like other Lebanese channels, [[LBC]] suspended its regular programing to focus all attention on the aftermath of the assassination, including a ten-day hiatus of ''Star Academy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show resumed on Friday, February 25 with an episode that critics deemed "The Patriotic Night" during which the contestants, along with Arab celebrities and contestants from past seasons came together and sung a number of patriotic songs in solidarity with the mourning nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not once throughout the program was al-Hariri's name said; instead, the show was made to be a demonstration of renewed patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major controversy began when it came time to vote off that week's losing contestant. That week, the three nominees for expulsion included a [[Bahrain]]i man Ahmad Salaheddin, a [[Syrian]] woman Joey Bassous, and a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] man, Samer Doumit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per contest rules, the public votes to save one contestant, and the remaining two are voted for by the other non nominated contestants. The [[Bahrain]]i man was rescued by the public, but the [[Syrian]] women, despite getting higher ratings than Doumit by the public, was ultimately voted off the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ousting was said to echo the tension that already existed between [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] post-assassination, as there was widespread suspicion that the Syrians were implicated in the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraidy|first1=Marwan|title=Reality Television and Arab Politics|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521749046|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seasons ==

=== Star Academy 1 ===
The first season of '''''Star Academy 1''''' made its debut in early December 2003. The first season ended on 4 April 2004. The winner was the Egyptian candidate, Mohammad Attia.

The inaugural show quickly became popular and tickets for the show became harder to get as the show went on. The students, particularly the Top 8, became household names, and those that made the Top 8 became instant stars. The eight finalists were Mohammad Attia ([[Egypt]]), Bashar Al Shatty ([[Kuwait]]), [[Sophia El Mareekh]] ([[Morocco]]), Bahaa' El Kafy ([[Tunisia]]), [[Ahmed El Sherif]] ([[Tunisia]]), Myriam Attallah ([[Syria]]), Mohammad Khalawi ([[Saudi Arabia]]) and Cynthia  Karam ([[Lebanon]]). The teachers were as follows: Wadih Abi Raad, Michael Fadel, Mary Mahfouth, Betty Taoutel, Aida Sabra, Elissar Karakalla and Rola Saad.
At the end of the show, an album featuring the Top 8 was released, as well as a music video for the winner. They then went on a [[Pan Arab]] tour, performing concerts in [[Dubai]], [[Kuwait]], [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], [[Amman]], [[Damascus]], and [[Beirut]].

Many of them released albums, ranging in various degrees of success. Bashar Al Shatty (Kuwait) has gained much success in his three albums which he released over the last five years. Also being crowned as the most successful teenage singer in the [[Persian Gulf]] region was added to his success of being the ''Star Academy'' finalist. However, the most successful was Ahmed El Sherif (Tunisia), despite coming in the 5th place. His album has been the most successful among all student from ''Star Academy'' thus far, and has also dwarfed the albums of any of the contestants from rival show ''SuperStar'' on Future TV.

* Mohammad Attia (Winner; released one album)
* [[Bashar al-Shatti|Bashar Al Shatti]] (Finalist; released three albums)
* Bahaa' El Kafy (3rd place; released one album)
* Mohammad Khalawi place; released one album
* Ahmed El Sherif (5th place; released two albums)
* [[Sophia El Mareekh]] (6th place; released one album)
* Cynthia Karam (7th place; no albums released)
* Myriam Attallah (8th place; no albums released)

The candidate that took the 9th place, Bruno Tabbal, participated in the "World Best" contest that englobed about 11 countries that have this reality show in their country. He took the 10th place, and the French person, Elodie Frégé, won.

'''Tour'''

Mohamad A, Bashar, Bahaa, Ahmad, Mohamad K, Sophia, Cynthia, and Myriam (the Top 8) were chosen to be part of the tour.

=== Star Academy 2 ===

[[Hisham Abdulrahman|Hisham]], from [[Saudi Arabia]], was declared as the winner this year, even though he was not the critic's favorite. He is also the winner with the most nominations in the show's history, with a record 4 nominations. Most felt that Amani or Zizi were the better performers overall. Many also felt that this year was a step-down in the quality of students from the previous year, with only Amani, Zizi, and Ahmed being deemed good singers.

'''Tour'''

Hisham, Amani, Zizi, Ahmad H, Bashar G, Katia, Samer, and Salma (once again, the Top 8) were chosen to be part of the tour.

===Star Academy 3===

[[Joseph Attieh]], who is a radio and TV production student received a trophy, $50,000 in cash and a brand new 2006 car. He was 19 years old and the first Lebanese to win the Title. This year was seen as an improvement over the previous year, and a return to the level of the first season, with many talented students. Some like Hani, Hanaa, and Shayma were deemed just as worthy of winning as Joseph. There were also many other strong performers like Fadi, Khalifa, Rakiya, Maya, and Wajdi.

This year, the show expanded the number of students from 16 contestants, in the two previous years, to 19 students.

'''Tour'''

Joseph, Hani, Hanaa, Chayma, Fady, Khalifa, Maya, Rakiya and Wajdi were chosen to be part of the tour. This was the first year 9 students instead of 8 went on tour. It was also the first time where the Top finishing students did not all go on tour. Despite finishing 8th and 9th, Rym and Mohammed I were not chosen for the tour, Rakiya and Wajdi were selected to go on tour instead.

===Star Academy 4===
[[Shada Hassoun]], from [[Iraq]] and [[Morocco]], made history by being the first girl to take the title.

The fourth season (2007) was also the first season where two girls claimed the first and second place when Shada Hassoun came in first, and Marwa (from [[Tunisia]]) came in second. It was also noteworthy to feature the first female contestant from the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]], Shoroq (from [[Bahrain]]), as well as the first contestant from [[Oman]], Ayoub.

'''Tour'''

Shada, Marwa, Mohamed, Carlo, Sally, Ali, Tina, Ahmad, and Imed were chosen to be part of the tour. Once again, 9 students were chosen for the tour. even though Amel was placed ahead of Imed, he was chosen to go on tour instead of her.

===Star Academy 5===
The fifth season of Star Academy began on 25 January 2008. There were several changes in the academy that included a new swimming pool, a basketball court, a trampoline, a pool and tennis table and a newly decorated building. New lessons were added this season including swimming lessons, basketball lessons and music lessons. Another change was the increase in the number of students, from 19 in the previous season to now 20.

The final prime of Star Academy 5 held on 23 May 2008, witnessed the crowning of [[Nader Guirat]], the first winner from [[Tunis]] and the [[Maghreb]] region.

His victory was somewhat controversial, as [[Nader Guirat]] was the first winner of the program to sing primarily in non-Arabic languages (English, French, etc.). Even though he did sing in Arabic on rare occasions, many felt that his Arabic singing was nowhere near up to the standards of the other contestants, and not worthy of a variety show that is primarily in Arabic. Nader is also the first winner to be a nominee without being saved by the public, as he had received a low percentage of votes.

'''Tour'''

Nader, Mohamad, Saad, Shahinaz, Mirhan, Diaa and Amel B were chosen to be part of the tour. This was the first time only 7 students had been chosen for the tour (previous years had 8 or 9 students). However, for unknown reasons, the tour was cancelled.

===Star Academy 6===

The winner of Star Academy 6 made history by being the first contestant from a country that already had a student win from it. [[Abdulaziz Abdulrahman]] from [[Saudi Arabia]] became the second Saudi Arabian, after [[Hisham Abdulrahman]] from season 2, to win the title.

Star Academy 6 has undergone some major changes, the studio was enlarged and the Academy itself went through an extreme makeover and now includes a theater for movies, a spa, and a DJ Studio.

'''Tour'''

Abdulaziz, Bassma, Ibrahim, Michel A, Lara, Mohamed B, Tania, Yehya and Nasser were chosen to be part of the tour. Once again, unlike the previous season, the tour chose to have 9 students to participate. But once again, for unknown reasons, the tour was canceled.

===Star Academy 7===
Star Academy 7 launched its first prime from Adma, [[Lebanon]] on the 19 February 2010 on [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation|LBC]].

This year's winner was Nassif Zaytoun from [[Syria]]. He made history by being the first contestant from Syria to win.

===Star Academy 11===

Star Academy 11 began in October 2015 and ended in January 2016 with the crowning of this season's winner [[Marwan Youssef]] from Lebanon. Marwan is the second Lebanese contestant to win the first place title after [[Joseph Attieh]] (Star Academy 3). The season was produced by Endemol Shine Middle East and broadcast on [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International]] aka LBC Lebanon) and [[Capital Broadcasting Center]] aka CBC (Egypt) tv networks. Among many other prizes awarded to the winner of the season, [[Marwan Youssef]] won a song produced by Endemol, and released his first single "Watan Hobi." Marwan later went on to release a second single alone with Watary Productions record label titled "Rafed Saddek," which saw great success and lead to him filming his first music video for the song. Marwan has since performed many concerts and performed in important music festivals.

'''Sudanese Arabic''' is the [[Varieties of Arabic|variety]] of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] spoken throughout [[Sudan]] and in parts of [[Eritrea]]. Some of the tribes in Sudan still have similar accents to the ones in [[Saudi Arabia]].

== History ==
In 1889 the ''[[Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute]]'' of [[Great Britain]] claimed that the Arabic spoken in Sudan was "a pure but archaic Arabic". The pronunciation of certain letters was like Hijazi, and not Egyptian, such as g being the pronunciation for the Arabic letter [[Qāf]] and J being the pronunciation for [[Gimel|Jim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSDBkKgNgx8C&amp;pg=PA16 |title=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 17|author=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, JSTOR (Organization)|year=1888|edition=|editor=|publisher=|location=|page=11|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unique phonological characteristics ==
Sudanese Arabic is similar to [[Egyptian Arabic]]. While it does not share some of the characteristic properties of northern Egyptian dialects (like that of [[Cairo]]), Sudanese Arabic is particularly close to central and southern Egyptian or [[Sa'idi Arabic]]. It is also closely related to [[Hejazi Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Ingham, "Some Characteristics of Meccan Speech", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 34, No. 2. (1971), pp. 273–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic letter '''&lt;big&gt;[[ج#Arabic .C7.A7.C4.ABm|ج]]&lt;/big&gt;''' maintains an archaic pronunciation {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}} in Sudanese{{fact|date=August 2016}} (other dialects typically have {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, {{IPA|[ʒ]}} or {{IPA|[j]}}, while Cairene Arabic has {{IPA|[ɡ]}}).

Sudanese Arabic also maintains an archaic rendering of [[Qāf|qaf]] as {{IPA|[ɢ]}} ([[Voiced uvular plosive]]) while Cairene Arabic (like some other modern Urban dialects) renders it as {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. The uvular rendering of qaf has been lost in most other Arabic dialects and is also considered a relic.

Also peculiar to Sudanese is the quality of the Arabic vowel transliterated as ''u/ū''; this is usually transliterated as ''o'' in materials on Sudanese because the sound ranges from {{IPA|ɵ}}~{{IPA|o}} rather than the typical {{IPA|ʊ}}~{{IPA|u}}.

In addition to differences in pronunciation, Sudanese Arabic also uses some different words when compared to Egyptian Arabic. For example, the interrogative pronoun "what" in Sudan is ''shinu''  rather than "eh" as in Egyptian Arabic.

== Influence of Nubian languages ==
In northern and central parts of Sudan, Sudanese colloquial Arabic has been influenced by the [[Nobiin language|Nubian language]], which in ancient times was the dominant language in Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan. Many of the agricultural and farming terms in Sudanese Arabic were adopted from Nubian.

* Sudanese Arabic ''angareb'' &lt; Nobiin: ''àngàréé'' "wooden bed"
* Sudanese Arabic ''kadēsa'' &lt; Nobiin: ''kàdíís'' "cat" versus Standard Arabic ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qiṭṭ}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hirr}}'' (and derivatives of the same, i.e. diminutive ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hurayrah}}'' "housecat, kitten").

== Regional variation ==
Because of the varying influence of local languages in different parts of Sudan, there is considerable regional variation in Arabic spoken throughout the country. Sudanese Arabic typically refers to Arabic spoken mostly in central parts of Sudan. The other most commonly mentioned derivative of Sudanese Arabic is [[Juba Arabic]], a [[pidgin]] of Arabic spoken in [[South Sudan]], which is much more heavily influenced by other local languages.

== Greetings in Sudanese Arabic ==
In northern Sudan, greetings are typically extended, and involve multiple questions about the other person's health, their family etc. When greeting someone you know informally, it is common to begin with the word ''o'', followed by the person's first name: ''Ō, Khalafalla'' or ''Ō, kēf ya Khalafalla''.

Formal greetings often begin with the universal ''As-salām ˤalaykom'' and the reply, ''Wa ˤalaykom as-salām'', an exchange common to Muslims everywhere. However, other greetings typical to Sudan include ''Izzēyak'' (to men) or '' Izzēyik'' (to women). A rather informal way to say "How are you", is ''Inta shadīd? Inti shadīda?'' "Are you well? (to a male and a female, respectively)", the response to which is usually ''al-Hamdo lillāh'' "Praise God" assuming you are indeed feeling well, ''ma batal'' "not bad" or ''nosnos'' "half-half)" if feeling only okay or ''taˤban showayya'' "a little tired" if not so well. Of course, there can be many other responses but these are used in everyday language.

Other everyday greetings include ''kwayyis(a), alhamdulilah'' "Good, thanks to allah", ''Kēf al-usra?'' "how is the family?" or ''kēf al awlād?'' "how are the children". For friends, the question ''Kēf?'' can also be formed using the person's first name, prefixed by ''ya'', for example; ''kēf ya Yōsif?'' "How are you, Joseph?". Another standard response in addition to ''al-hamdu lillāh'' is ''Allāh ybarik fik'' "God's blessing upon you". Additional greetings are appropriate for particular times and are standard in most varieties of Arabic, such as ''Sabāh al-khēr? / Sabāh an-Nōr''.

Sudanese that know each other well will often use many of these greetings together, sometimes repeating themselves. It is also common to shake hands on first meeting, sometimes simultaneously slapping or tapping  each other on the left shoulder before the handshake (particularly for good friends). Handshakes in Sudan can often last as long as greetings. A handshake between well-acquainted Sudanese will often be preceded by raising one's right hand and touching each other's left shoulder simultaneously before engaging in the handshake, all while exchanging verbal greetings.

== Assenting - saying yes ==
The Sudanese Arabic word for "yes" depends on the tribe; ''aye'' is widely used, similar to the Scottish aye, although ''aywa'' or ''na‘am'' are also commonly used.

== Publications ==
In 1927 the Gospel of Mark was published in Roman script ins Sudanese Arabic by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]].  The Gospel of Luke was printed in 1955 and the Gospel of John in 1964, both in Arabic script.  The whole New Testament was published in Sudanese Arabic in Roman script in 1978.  It was translated by Translated by Barbara Harper and Evelyn Stewart of the Bible Alliance Mission.  It included an introduction, section headings, footnotes, note on alphabet and glossary

{{taxation}}
A '''tax protester''' is someone who refuses to pay a tax claiming that the tax laws are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. Tax protesters are different from [[tax resisters]], who refuse to pay taxes as a protest against a government or its policies, or a moral opposition to taxation in general, not out of a belief that the tax law itself is invalid. The United States has a large and organized culture of people who espouse such theories. Tax protesters also exist in other countries.

Legal commentator Daniel B. Evans has defined tax protesters as people who "refuse to pay taxes or file tax returns out of a mistaken belief that the federal income tax is unconstitutional, invalid, voluntary, or otherwise does not apply to them under one of a number of bizarre arguments." (divided into several classes: [[Tax protester constitutional arguments|constitutional]], [[Tax protester conspiracy arguments|conspiracy]], [[Tax protester administrative arguments|administrative]], [[Tax protester statutory arguments|statutory,]] and arguments based on [[Tax protester Sixteenth Amendment arguments|16th Amendment]] and the [[Tax protester 861 argument|"861" section of the tax code]]. An overview can be found [[Tax protester arguments|here]])&lt;ref&gt;Daniel B. Evans, "The Tax Protester FAQ", at [http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#protester]. See also Robert L. Sommers, Testimony Before The Senate Finance Committee, "Taxpayer Beware: Schemes, Scams and Cons: Trust Scams on the Web", April 5, 2001, U.S. Senate web site, at [https://www.senate.gov/~finance/040501rstest.pdf]. See also [[David Cay Johnston]], "White Hats Take to the Web to Dispel Anti-Tax Schemes," ''[[New York Times]]'', March 25, 2004, at [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406EEDF1530F936A15750C0A9629C8B63]. Evans is also cited by tax law professor James Edward Maule; see James Edward Maule, "For Would-Be Travelers on the Noncompliant Federal Income Tax Protester Path," [[Villanova University]] School of Law, at {{cite web |url=http://vls.law.vill.edu/prof/maule/taxprotfr.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225184420/http://vls.law.vill.edu/prof/maule/taxprotfr.htm |archivedate=2008-02-25 |df= }}; see also Joseph A. Gambardello, "Street's position on taxes rejected often by courts," ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Feb. 16, 2008; see also Allen D. Madison, "The Futility of Tax Protester Arguments," 36 ''Thomas Jefferson Law Review'' 253, at 256, footnote 15 (Vol. 36, No. 2, Spring 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Law Professor Allen D. Madison has described tax protesters as "those who refuse to pay income tax on the basis of some nonsensical legal argument that he or she does not owe tax."&lt;ref&gt;Allen D. Madison, "The Futility of Tax Protester Arguments," 36 ''Thomas Jefferson Law Review'' 253, at 256 (Vol. 36, No. 2, Spring 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

An illegal tax-protest scheme has been defined as "any scheme, without basis in law or fact, designed to express dissatisfaction with the tax laws by interfering with their administration or attempting to illegally avoid or reduce tax liabilities."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer E. Ihlo, Senior Trial Attorney, Special Counsel for Tax Protest Matters (Criminal), Tax Division, United States Department of Justice, "The Gold Fringed Flag: Prosecution of the Illegal Tax Protester," ''United States Attorneys' Bulletin'', Vol. 46, No. 3, p. 15 (U.S. Dep't of Justice, April 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Tax Court has stated that "tax protester" is a designation "often given to persons who make frivolous antitax arguments".&lt;ref&gt;Footnote 5 in ''Aldrich v. Commissioner'', T.C. Memo. 2013-201 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax protesters raise a number of different kinds of arguments. In the United States, these typically include constitutional arguments, such as claims that the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution was not properly ratified or that it is unconstitutional generally, or that being forced to file an income tax return violates the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Self-incrimination|Fifth Amendment privilege]] against self-incrimination. Others are statutory arguments suggesting that the income tax is constitutional but the statutes enacting the income tax are ineffective, or that [[Federal Reserve Note]]s or other relevant currencies do not constitute cash or income. Yet another collection of arguments centers on general conspiracies involving numerous government agencies.

Some tax protesters refuse to file a tax return or file returns with no income or tax data supplied.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce I. Hochman, Michael Popoff, Dennis L. Perez, Charles P. Rettig &amp; Steven R. Toscher, "Tax Crimes," p. A-4, ''Tax Management Portfolios, Vol. 636'', Tax Management, Inc., a subsid. of The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==
In the United States, the term "[[protest]]" as applied to a tax generally means "a declaration by a payer, esp. of a tax, that he does not concede the legality of a claim he is paying".&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 1142 (World Publishing Company, 2d Coll. Ed. 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines a tax protest as:

{{quote|The formal statement, usually in writing, made by a person who is called upon by public authority to pay a sum of money, in which he declares that he does not concede the legality or justice of the claim or his duty to pay it, or that he disputes the amount demanded; the object being to save his right to recover or reclaim the amount, which right would be lost by his acquiescence. Thus, taxes may be paid under "protest".&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', p. 1101 (5th Ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At common law, and under some earlier tax statutes, the filing of a protest at the time of payment of an erroneous tax was a requirement in order for the payor to recover a refund of the tax at a later time. In the case of U.S. federal taxes, the rule was abolished by Congress in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, Collector of Internal Revenue'', 289 U.S. 373 (1933); and section 1014(a) of the [[Revenue Act of 1924]], Ch. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 343 (June 2, 1924) (amending section 3226 of the U.S. Revised Statutes).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the current Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the taxpayer's failure to protest does not deprive the taxpayer of the right to file an administrative claim with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) for a refund and, if the claim is not allowed by the IRS, to sue for a [[tax refund]] in Federal district court.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|28|1346(a)(1)}}; {{usc|26|6532(a)}}; subsection (b) of {{usc|26|7422}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "protest" is also used to describe a taxpayer's formal written request for review, by the Appeals Division of the IRS, after the IRS issues a "Thirty-Day Letter" proposing an increased tax liability following an IRS examination of a tax return.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Alexander (lawyer)|Donald C. Alexander]] &amp; Brian S. Gleicher, "IRS Procedures: Examination and Appeals," p. A-46 &amp; A-47, ''Tax Management Portfolios, Vol. 623'', Tax Management, Inc., a subsid. of The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (2d ed. 2004). The late Donald C. Alexander was a former [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania used the term tax "protestor" (protester) in ''United States v. Malinowski''. This case, however, involved a taxpayer who was a member of the Philadelphia War Tax Resistance League who was protesting the use of tax money in [[the Vietnam War]]. The taxpayer was not making arguments that the tax law itself was invalid; he was essentially protesting the war, not the tax. The taxpayer had filed a false [[Form W-4]], and admitted he knew that he was not legally entitled to claim the exemptions (allowances) he claimed on the W-4. Thus, Malinowski might be termed a [[tax resister]] rather than a tax protester. He was convicted, and his motion for a new trial or acquittal was denied.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''United States v. Malinowski'', 347 [[Federal Supplement|F. Supp.]] 347, 73-1 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 9355 (E.D. Pa. 1972), ''aff'd'', 472 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 850, 73-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9199 (3d Cir. 1973), ''cert. denied'', 411 U.S. 970 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

A person could be both a tax protester ''and'' a tax resister if he or she believes that tax laws do not apply to him or her and ''also'' believes that taxes should not be paid based on the use to which the taxes are put. Some tax resisters have put forth legal arguments for their position—for instance that they cannot pay taxes for nuclear weapons development because this would put them in violation of the [[Nuremberg Principles]]—that could be considered varieties of tax-protester theories.

Beginning in the mid-1970s, U.S. Federal courts began using the term "tax protester" in still another, more narrow sense—to describe persons who raised [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous arguments]] about the legality of Federal taxes, particularly income taxes. This particular technical sense of the term is the sense described in the remainder of this article.

==History==

===United States===
{{UStaxation}}
{{main|Tax protester history in the United States}}

While there have been people throughout history who challenged the assessment of taxes as beyond the power of the government, the modern tax-protester movement began after [[World War II]]. One of the first people to fit this description was [[Vivien Kellems]], a Connecticut industrialist and political activist who specifically protested monthly tax withholding. In 1948 she refused to withhold taxes from the wages of her employees, based on the claim that the government had no power to require such withholding. The IRS then seized the money owed from her bank account. She brought suit against them and, in a book she wrote, asserted that she won,&lt;ref&gt;Vivien Kellems, ''Toil, Taxes and Trouble'' (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; although she did not challenge the constitutionality of tax withholding itself.

The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals stated that people are attracted to the "tax protestor movement's illusory claim that there is no legal requirement to pay federal income tax." The court called the tax-protester arguments "wholly defective and unsuccessful."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Sloan'', 939 F.2d 499 ([[7th Cir.]] 1991), ''cert. denied'', 502 U.S. 1060 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas associated with the tax-protester movement have been forwarded under different names over time. These ideas have been put forth, for example, in the broader [[Christian Patriot]] and [[Posse Comitatus (U.S. movement)|Posse Comitatus]] movements, which generally assert that the Constitution has been usurped by the federal government.

The tax-protester phenomenon is not restricted to the United States. Similar arguments are raised in the context of other legal systems in other countries, although it is more notorious in the United States tax system.&lt;ref&gt;Shanoff, Alan "Detaxers tax their credibility" ''The Kingston Whig-Standard'' 16 March 2009 [http://www.thewhig.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1479784]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that tax protester theories originating in the United States, such as denying the authority of courts, have spread into [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;Adrian Humphreys, "[http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/08/06/judges-losing-patience-as-anti-government-tax-deniers-clogging-courts-with-absurd-claims/ Judges losing patience as anti-government tax-deniers clogging courts with ‘absurd’ claims]", ''National Post'' (June 8, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; As with cases in the United States, the courts have uniformly found these arguments to be invalid, and often incoherent.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt;

==Arguments==
{{main|Tax protester arguments}}

In 1986, the Seventh Circuit observed:

{{quote|Some people believe with great fervor preposterous things that just happen to coincide with their self-interest. "Tax protesters" have convinced themselves that wages are not income, that only gold is money, that the Sixteenth Amendment is unconstitutional, and so on. These beliefs all lead—so tax protesters think—to the elimination of their obligation to pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;''Coleman v. Commissioner'', 791 F.2d 68, 69 (7th Cir. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Arguments made by tax protesters in the United States generally fall into several categories: that the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] was never properly ratified; that the Sixteenth Amendment does not permit the taxation of individual income, or particular forms of individual income; that other provisions of the Constitution such as the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], or a "[[Titles of Nobility Amendment|Missing Thirteenth Amendment]]" eliminate an obligation to file a return; that citizens of the states are not also citizens of the United States; that the statutes enacted by the [[United States Congress]] pursuant to their constitutional taxing power are defective or invalid; that the tax code does not apply to inhabitants of U.S. territories; and that the government and the courts engage in various conspiracies to conceal the above deficiencies. Outside of the United States, tax protesters raise similar conspiracy arguments, claims that they are not "citizens" under the jurisdiction of the court where the claim is brought, and claims about the validity of statutes imposing taxation.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt;

Such arguments are usually summarily dispensed with when presented in the courts. For example, the Fifth Circuit once noted:

{{quote|We perceive no need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning and copious citation of precedent; to do so might suggest that these arguments have some colorable merit. The constitutionality of our income tax system—including the role played within that system by the Internal Revenue Service and the Tax Court—has long been established... [Petitioner's argument] is a hodgepodge of unsupported assertions, irrelevant platitudes, and legalistic gibberish.&lt;ref&gt;''Crain v. Commissioner'', 737 F.2d 1417, 18 (5th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In that case, the court viewed the tax-protester arguments as sufficiently frivolous to merit the imposition of sanctions—in this case twice the costs spent by the government in defending the litigation—for even bringing them up. Similarly, a Canadian Tax Court judge found claims asserted by a "tax denier" in that court to be "an absurd blend of the ridiculous arguments... unintelligible, incomprehensible, meaningless, irrelevant and factually hopeless".&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt;

==Penalties ==
In the United States, protesting Federal income taxes is not, in and of itself, a criminal offense. However, a number of offenses arise from failing to pay taxes that are due, and from repeating arguments that have previously been invalidated by the courts.

===Frivolous tax returns===

The [[United States Congress]] has, however, enacted [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 6702 "in an effort to deter tax protesters from filing frivolous returns." This statute was enacted as part of the [[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982]].&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 97-248, 96 Stat. 324, 617, sec. 326(a) (Sept. 3, 1982), effective for documents filed after September 3, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kahn v. United States'', 753 F.2d 1208, 85-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9152 (3d Cir. 1985). In footnote 3 of the ''Kahn'' decision, the U.S. Court Appeals for the Third Circuit states: "The Senate Finance Committee, in articulating the reasons for change, expressed its concern 'with the rapid growth in deliberate definance [''sic''; probably should read "defiance"] of the tax laws by tax protesters.' S. Rep. No. 494, supra, at 277, 1982 U. S. Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 1023-24." Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty under section 6702 is a civil (non-criminal) penalty, and is $500 for positions taken on or before March 15, 2007. For positions taken after that date, the penalty amount has been increased to $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6702}}, as amended by section 407 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-432.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internal Revenue Service has issued a list of positions considered to be legally frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;See Notice 2010-33, 2010-17 I.R.B. 1 (April 2010), Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury, ''modifying and superseding'' IRS Notice 2008-14, 2008-4 I.R.B. 310 (Jan. 14, 2008), ''modifying and superseding'' IRS Notice 2007-30, 2007-14 I.R.B. 883 (March 15, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Shauna Henline, Senior Technical Coordinator of the Frivolous Return Program at the Internal Revenue Service,&lt;ref&gt;"IRS watchdog thwarts tax evasion schemes," Nov. 11, 2012, ''Washington Post'', at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/irs-watchdog-thwarts-tax-evasion-schemes/2012/11/11/561fdd38-2c4b-11e2-a99d-5c4203af7b7a_story.html].&lt;/ref&gt; has testified that the IRS receives about 20,000 to 30,000 frivolous tax returns per year, and that approximately 100,000 related letters and other documents are received each year.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Cundiff, "Trial notebook: a good reason to quit early," Jan. 24, 2008, ''Ocala Star-Banner'', at [http://www.ocala.com/article/20080124/BREAKING_NEWS/254104222/-1/news22&amp;template=artwithcomments].&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, taxpayers have argued that section 6702, the "frivolous argument" penalty statute, is itself unconstitutional. That argument was rejected in ''Hazewinkel v. United States'' (taxpayer's arguments—that sections 6702 and 6703 violate both procedural and substantive due process because there is no right to a prior hearing, and that the word "frivolous" is unconstitutionally vague—were rejected).&lt;ref&gt;84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9152 (D. Minn. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; See also ''Pillsbury v. Commissioner'', a case in which taxpayer Leecil Pillsbury's argument—that section 6702 violates the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause of the Constitution—was ruled to be without merit.

In that case, the court also ruled the following taxpayer arguments to be invalid: (1) the argument that section 6702 is an unconstitutional [[Bill of Attainder]]; (2) the argument that section 6702 unconstitutionally authorizes the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment; (3) the argument that section 6702 unconstitutionally violates the doctrine of separation of powers; and (4) the argument that section 6702 unconstitutionally violates the taxpayer's First Amendment rights to petition the government for redress of grievances.&lt;ref&gt;''Pillsbury v. Commissioner'', 84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9211 (E.D. Mich. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; See also ''Duke v. Commissioner'' (tax-protester argument that 6702 was unconstitutional was rejected by the court),&lt;ref&gt;84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9221 (S.D. Tex. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kane v. United States'' (taxpayer's argument—that because section 6702 does not define the term "frivolous," the statute is unconstitutionally vague—was rejected),&lt;ref&gt;84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9229 (D. Ariz. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hudson v. United States'' (taxpayer's arguments—that section 6702 unconstitutionally violates taxpayer's First Amendment rights, that section 6702 violates due process rights by failing to provide a hearing before assessment of a penalty, that section 6702 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder, and that section 6702 is unconstitutionally vague—were ruled to be without merit).&lt;ref&gt;766 F.2d 1288, 85-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9575 (9th. Cir. 1985) (''per curiam'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frivolous litigation in United States Tax Court, and appeals of Tax Court decisions===

In 1939, Congress enacted section 1117(g) (entitled "Proceeding Frivolous") of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, giving the Board of Tax Appeals (now called the [[United States Tax Court]]) the power to impose a civil monetary penalty of up to $500 against any party who instituted a proceeding "merely for delay" before the Board of Tax Appeals. In 1954, this provision was continued with the enactment of section 6673 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The current version of section 6673 (in the 1986 Code) provides that frivolous arguments may result in a penalty in U.S. Tax Court of up to $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6673}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Internal Revenue Code also provides that the U.S. Supreme Court and the federal courts of appeals may impose penalties where the taxpayer's appeal of a U.S. Tax Court decision was "maintained primarily for delay" or where "the taxpayer's position in the appeal is frivolous or groundless."&lt;ref&gt;See paragraph (4) of subsection (c) of {{usc|26|7482}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frivolous litigation in United States District Court===

In a non-criminal case in a United States district court, a litigant (or a litigant's attorney) who presents any pleading, written motion or other paper to the court is deemed to have certified that, to the best of the presenter's knowledge and belief, the legal contentions "are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law".&lt;ref&gt;Rule 11(b)(2), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;/ref&gt; Monetary civil penalties for violation of this rule may in some cases be imposed on the litigant or the attorney under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Rule 11(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frivolous litigation in various other appeals===

Congress has enacted section 1912 of title 28 of the United States Code providing that in the United States Supreme Court and in the various courts of appeals where litigation by the losing party has caused damage to the prevailing party, the court may impose a requirement that the losing party pay the prevailing party for those damages.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|28|1912}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A person who raises a frivolous argument in a Federal appeals court may also be subject to monetary penalties under Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Crain v. Commissioner'', 737 F.2d 1417, 84-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9721 (5th Cir. 1984) (''per curiam'').&lt;/ref&gt; In one 2007 case, for example, the Seventh Circuit issued an order giving such an attorney "14 days to show cause why he should not be fined $10,000 for his frivolous arguments", based in part on Rule 38.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Patridge'', 507 F.3d 1092, 1097 (7th Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frivolous filing of misconduct complaints===
The "Guiding Light of God Ministries," a tax protester group organized by [[Eddie Ray Kahn]], filed about 2,000 official misconduct complaints against employees of the [[IRS]]. Some tax agents reported that these complaints had influenced their supervisors to order them to back off from audits and collection efforts against members of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment by Internal Revenue Service===
Prior to the [[Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998]] (the "1998 Act"), the Internal Revenue Service had defined a tax-protester scheme as "any scheme without basis in law or fact for the ostensible purpose of expressing dissatisfaction with the substance, form, or administration of the tax laws be [''sic''; "by"] either interfering with tax administration or attempting to illegally avoid or reduce tax liabilities."&lt;ref&gt;''Kline v. Internal Revenue Serv. (In re Kline)'', 26 Fed. Appx. 849, 851 n.1, 2002-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,303 (10th Cir. 2002).{{cite web |url=http://www.kscourts.org/ca10/cases/2002/02/01-2125.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217192629/http://www.kscourts.org/ca10/cases/2002/02/01-2125.htm |archivedate=2005-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS has not released records indicating whom the agency defined as "illegal tax protesters" (coded as TC-148). In testimony before Congress in 1997, former IRS historian Shelley L. Davis contended that the IRS kept lists of citizens "for no reason other than that their political activities might have offended someone at the IRS [….]" and she charged that "anyone who offers even legitimate criticism of the tax collector is [labeled by the IRS as] a tax protester […]"&lt;ref&gt;IRS Nightmares Get Senate Hearing: Finance panel hears from parade of witnesses critical of tax agency, CNN AllPolitics, Sept. 24, 1997, at [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/09/24/irs.hearing/]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1997 congressional hearings, Congress responded with the 1998 Act. Subsection (a) of section 3707 of the 1998 Act now prohibits "officers and employees of the Internal Revenue Service" from designating a taxpayer as an "illegal tax protester" or using any similar designation for a taxpayer.&lt;ref&gt;Sec. 3707(a), Pub. L. No. 105-206, 112 Stat. 685 (July 22, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, subsection (b) of section 3707 provides: "An officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service may designate any appropriate taxpayer as a nonfiler, but shall remove such designation once the taxpayer has filed income tax returns for 2 consecutive taxable years and paid all taxes shown on such returns."&lt;ref&gt;Sec. 3707(b), Pub. L. No. 105-206, 112 Stat. 685 (July 22, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS has prescribed procedures for its personnel to handle frivolous returns (whether considered valid returns or not) in the "Frivolous Return Program" section of the Internal Revenue Manual.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Manual, IRM Part 4, Chapter 10, Section Frivolous Return Program, at [https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-010-012r.html].&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS has concluded, in ''Service Center Advice 200107034'' dated November 15, 2000, that the statutory prohibition on the use of the term "illegal tax protester" by IRS personnel does not prohibit the IRS from maintaining a database of frivolous tax return filers as part of its ''Frivolous Return Program''. IRS Advice 200107034 states (in part):

::The Frivolous Return Program in Examination [an administrative component of the IRS] has the specific assignment of processing assessments of frivolous return penalties pursuant to [Internal Revenue Code] section 6702. The employees of that unit receive documents from throughout the country that IRS employees believe may qualify as frivolous returns under section 6702. The employees reviews the documents and determines how to proceed.

::When the documents come into the Frivolous Return Program, employees enter initial data into a computerized inventory database. […] Initial data includes name, social security number, and tax examiner assigned the case. Later, a tax examiner reviews the documents to see if they qualify as frivolous. If the documents meet the frivolous test, the tax examiner does a compliance check to see if the taxpayer is properly filing returns. If the taxpayer is properly filing returns and is not potentially subject to a frivolous return penalty, then the tax examiner deletes the individual from the database […]&lt;ref name=SCA200107034&gt;Service Center Advice 200107034, National Office Service Center Advice Memorandum for Associate Area Counsel, Salt Lake City, Nov. 15, 2000, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the IRS:

::[…] Congress enacted section 3707 because of its concern that taxpayers may be stigmatized by a designation as an "illegal tax protester." […] Under section 3707(a)(2), the IRS is required to remove illegal tax-protester designations from its individual master file and disregard any illegal tax-protester designation in a place other than the individual master file in the case of any illegal tax-protesters designation made on or before July 22, 1998, the date of the enactment of section 3707. Although section 3707 prohibits the IRS from designating taxpayers as illegal tax protesters, it does provide that the IRS may designated {{sic}} any appropriate taxpayer as a nonfiler. However, the nonfiler designation must be removed once the taxpayer has filed income tax returns for two consecutive years and paid all taxes shown on the returns. Section 3707(b).

::We conclude […] that Congress was concerned that innocent taxpayers may have been mislabeled as illegal tax protesters. However, Congress did not intend to limit the IRS's ability to maintain records and to make designations, other than the illegal tax-protesters designation, where such designations are appropriate.

::As a result of the enactment of sections 3707 [of the 1998 Act] and 6702 [of the Internal Revenue Code], the IRS […] has tried to balance these competing obligations by focusing on the conduct of the taxpayers and specifically identifying those frivolous arguments asserted rather than applying a general label of tax protester.&lt;ref name="SCA200107034"/&gt;

The [[IRS Criminal Investigation Division|Criminal Investigation (CI) division]] of the Internal Revenue Service investigates reports of violations of the federal criminal tax statutes,&lt;ref&gt;See generally "Criminal Investigation (CI) At-a-Glance," Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at [https://www.irs.gov/irs/article/0,,id=98398,00.html]. In the Internal Revenue Code, the CI division is referred to as the "Intelligence Division" of the IRS. See subsection (b) of {{usc|26|7608}}. The Intelligence Division, formerly known as the "Intelligence Unit," changed its name to "Criminal Investigation" in July 1978 (see "The History of IRS Criminal Investigation (CI)," Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at [https://www.irs.gov/compliance/enforcement/article/0,,id=107469,00.html]), although section 7608 has not been amended by Congress to reflect this change.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]] under {{usc|26|7201}}, willful failure to file tax returns or pay tax under {{usc|26|7203}}, willful filing of false returns under {{usc|26|7206}}, and violations of other statutes, and refers tax cases to the [[United States Department of Justice Tax Division|Tax Division]] of the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution.

In July 2008, the office of the Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that the number of federal criminal tax investigations referred by the Internal Revenue Service to the Justice Department is at an eight-year high. According to the report, the fiscal year 2007 ended with 4,600 investigations. The increase is nearly 50 percent from fiscal year 2002 to year 2007. The report also concluded that federal criminal tax convictions increased by 6.7% from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2007. The number of persons convicted in fiscal year 2007 was 2,155.&lt;ref&gt;George L. Yaksick, Jr., CCH News Staff, "IRS Referrals of Criminal Tax Investigations at Eight-Year High," ''Federal Tax Day'', July 21, 2008, Item #T.2, CCH Tax Research NetWork (online), ''citing'' "Statistical Portrayal of the Criminal Investigation Division's Enforcement Activities for Fiscal Years 2000 Through 2007" (July 9, 2008), Reference Number 2008-10-133, Inspector General for Tax Administration, U.S. Department of the Treasury, at [http://www.treas.gov/tigta/auditreports/2008reports/200810133fr.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment by the U.S. Department of Justice===
{{Tax protest in the United States}}

In ''United States v. Amon'' in 1981, Alan Amon was convicted of filing a false withholding allowance certificate under {{usc|26|7205}}. Rather than having been [[Indictment|indicted]] by a [[grand jury]], Amon had been charged by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] in a document called an [[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]]. He appealed the conviction, in part on the ground that the government's prosecution of him was "[[Selective prosecution|unconstitutionally selective]]." The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit noted that the trial court had agreed that Amon was "selected for prosecution because he is an active and outspoken [tax] protester."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Amon'', 669 F.2d 1351, 81-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9495 (10th Cir. 1981), ''cert. denied'', 459 U.S. 825, 103 S. Ct. 57 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial court ruled that Amon's "status as an active protester was insufficient to establish selective prosecution" and that no illegal discrimination occurs where the government prosecutes individuals for actions they take in failing to comply with tax laws where an effect of the prosecution is "...to dissuade others from engaging in that kind of tax protest." The Court of Appeals agreed, stating: "Merely showing that the Government elected, under established IRS directives, to prosecute an individual because he was vocal in opposing voluntary compliance with the federal income tax law, without also establishing that others similarly situated were not prosecuted and that the prosecution was based on racial, religious or other impermissible considerations, does not demonstrate an unconstitutionally selective prosecution."&lt;ref name="SCA200107034"/&gt;

The Department of Justice may obtain a federal court ruling to the effect that a specific tax-protester activity constitutes the promotion of an illegal tax shelter under Internal Revenue Code section 6700 ({{usc|26|6700}}), and may obtain a court order prohibiting that activity under {{usc|26|7408}}, as it did in the case of ''United States v. Robert L. Schulz, [[We the People Foundation]] for Constitutional Education, Inc., and We the People Congress, Inc.''.&lt;ref&gt;''Per curiam opinion'', Feb. 22, 2008, case no. 07-3729-cv, United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tax Division of the U.S. Department of Justice prosecutes violations of the federal criminal tax statutes, generally after an investigation and referral of a case by the Criminal Investigation division of the Internal Revenue Service. See, e.g., subsection (d) of {{usc|26|7602}}.

As of February 2008, the Department of Justice was reported to be "planning a crackdown on the so-called tax-protester movement."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schmidt, Feb. 20, 2008, "Tax Deniers Targeted by U.S. Officials After Wesley Snipes Case," ''Bloomberg News'', at [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.TD_nMkGZl4].&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Assistant Attorney General]] [[Nathan Hochman]], the head of the [[United States Department of Justice Tax Division|Tax Division]] of the Justice Department, stated: "Too many people succumb to the fallacy, the illusion, that you don't have to pay any tax under any set of conditions […] That is a growing problem."&lt;ref name="SCA200107034"/&gt; According to a ''Bloomberg News'' report, the U.S. government has a 97 percent conviction rate in criminal tax denier cases.&lt;ref name="SCA200107034"/&gt;  On April 9, 2008, Hochman announced the launch of the National Tax Defier Initiative, also known as the "TAXDEF Initiative."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dep't of Justice, "Transcript of Nathan J. Hochman, Tax Division's Assistant Attorney General Announcing Creation of the National Tax Defier Initiative," April 9, 2008, at [http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/txdv08NHochman_TAXDEFTranscript.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
Many [[United States Courts of Appeals]] have made blanket statements repudiating tax-protester arguments. For example, see the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]] case of ''United States v. Cheek'':&lt;ref&gt;[[case citation|882 F.2d 1263, 1268 n.2]] (7th Cir. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For the record, we note that the following beliefs, which are stock arguments of the tax protester movement, have not been, nor ever will be, considered "objectively reasonable" in this circuit:&lt;br&gt;(1) the belief that the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was improperly ratified and therefore never came into being;&lt;br&gt;(2) the belief that the Sixteenth Amendment is unconstitutional generally;&lt;br&gt;(3) the belief that the income tax violates the [[Taking|Takings Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]];&lt;br&gt;(4) the belief that the tax laws are unconstitutional;&lt;br&gt;(5) the belief that wages are not income and therefore are not subject to federal income tax laws;&lt;br&gt;(6) the belief that filing a tax return violates the privilege against self-incrimination; and&lt;br&gt;(7) the belief that [[Federal Reserve Note]]s do not constitute cash or income.}}

==Arguments about constitutionality==
{{main|Tax protester constitutional arguments}}
The Supreme Court of the United States addressed tax-protester arguments in ''[[Cheek v. United States]]''.  John L. Cheek, a tax protester, had been prosecuted for [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]] under {{usc|26|7201}}. In response to Mr. Cheek's arguments on appeal, the Court stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Claims that some of the provisions of the tax code are unconstitutional are submissions of a different order. They do not arise from innocent mistakes caused by the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion, however wrong, that those provisions are invalid and unenforceable. Thus, in this case, Cheek paid his taxes for years, but after attending various seminars and based on his own study, he concluded that the income tax laws could not constitutionally require him to pay a tax.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek v. United States'', 498 U.S. 192, at 205-206, 111 S. Ct. 604, 112 L. Ed. 2d 617, 91-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,012 (1991) (footnote omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not believe that Congress contemplated that such a taxpayer, without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. See 26 U.S.C. 7422. Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court, 6213, with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful. 7482(a)(1). Cheek took neither course in some years, and, when he did, was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal prosecution under 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated, but, like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts who "willfully" refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must take the risk of being wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek'', 498 U.S. 192, at 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After a remand by the Supreme Court, Mr. Cheek was ultimately convicted, and the conviction was upheld on appeal. The Supreme Court refused to hear Mr. Cheek's petition for review of his conviction after the remand, and he was sent to prison.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Cheek'', 3 F.3d 1057, 93-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,473 (7th Cir. 1993), ''cert. denied'', 510 U.S. 1112, 114 S. Ct. 1055 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

If a jury finds that a ''criminal'' defendant had a subjective good-faith belief due to a misunderstanding based on the complexity of the tax law (and not based on an argument about its constitutionality), that belief may be a defense with respect to the element of willfulness, even if the belief is unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cheek v. United States]]'', 498 U.S. 192 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the general ''[[mens rea]]'' requirement needed to hold someone criminally liable and the specific intent (required by the word "''willfully''" in the statute) as defined in ''Cheek'' and other cases (see [[Intention (criminal law)|specific intent]] crimes). Persons acquitted of criminal tax evasion may still be sued civilly, and may be required to pay the taxes assessed, along with civil penalties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7927">'''Technoculture''' is a [[neologism]] that is not in standard dictionaries but that has some popularity in academia, popularized by editors Constance Penley and Andrew Ross in a book of essays bearing that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technoculture|first=Constance|last=Penley|author2=Andrew Ross |year=1991|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0-8166-1932-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mediamatic.net/8428/en/penley-ross Mediamatic review] Penley, Ross
Constance Penley &amp; Andrew Ross, Technoculture Cultural Politics vol 3, U of Minnesota Press 1991&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the interactions between, and politics of, [[Technology and society|technology and culture]].

== Programs of study ==
"Technoculture" is used by a number of universities to describe subject areas or courses of study. [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], for instance, has a program of technocultural studies. In 2012, the major merged with Film Studies to form Cinema and Techno-Cultural Studies (CaTS), but in 2013 is being reviewed to become Cinema and Technoculture (see below); the [[University of Western Ontario]] offers a degree in Media, Information and Technoculture (which they refer to as MIT, offering an "MIT BA").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fims.uwo.ca/mit/index.htm Media, Information &amp; Technoculture at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California, Riverside|UC Riverside]] is in the process of creating a program in technocultural studies beginning with the creation of a graduate certificate program in "Science Fiction and Technoculture Studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UCTV|title=Science Fiction Goes to School!|url=http://myuctv.tv/2012/07/13/science-fiction-goes-to-school/|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its description, the Georgetown University course English/CCT 691&lt;ref&gt;CCT stands for "Communications, Culture and Technology"&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Technoculture from Frankenstein to Cyberpunk'', covers the "social reception and representation of technology in literature and popular culture from the Romantic era to the present" and includes "all media, including film, TV, and recent video animation and Web 'zines." The course focuses "mainly on American culture and the way in which machines, computers, and the body have been imagined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/technoculture.html |accessdate=June 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217084240/http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/technoculture.html |archivedate=February 17, 2006 |title=Technoculture from Frankenstein to Cyberpunk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UC Davis Technocultural Studies department focuses on "transdisciplinary approaches to artistic, cultural and scholarly production in contemporary media and digital arts, community media, and mutual concerns of the arts with the scientific and technological disciplines. In contrast to programs which see technology as the primary driving force, we place questions of poetics, aesthetics, history, politics and the environment at the core of our mission. In other words, we emphasize the 'culture' in Technoculture."

The Technocultural Studies major program is an interdisciplinary integration of current research in cultural history and theory with innovative hands-on production in digital media and "low-tech". It focuses on the fine and performing arts, media arts, community media, literature and cultural studies as they relate to technology and science. Backed by critical perspectives and the latest forms of research and production skills, students enjoy the mobility to explore individual research and expression, project-based collaboration and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ucdwebcatalog/PDF/GenCat20102012.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111208135815/http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/UCDWebCatalog/PDF/GenCat20102012.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-12-08 |title=UC Davis General Catalogue 2010-2011 2011-2012 |date=July 2002 |accessdate=2011-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technocultural Studies is a fairly new major at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] and is considered a division of Humanities, Arts and Cultural Studies.

*Film Studies and Technocultural Studies majors at UC Davis have merged into Cinema and Technoculture. The faculty have been hard at work on developing this new major, and it is going through the review process.  Declared students will be grandfathered in to the existing programs to complete their major.  They will also have the option of switching to the new major if they choose.  The faculty of UC Davis believes these new additions will improve the program and hope their students take advantage of them.

== Journals  ==

'''Technoculture: An Online Journal of Technology in Society'' ({{ISSN|1938-0526}}) is an independent, interdisciplinary, annual peer-reviewed journal that publishes critical and creative works that explore the ways in which technology impacts society. It uses a broad definition of technology. Founded by Keith Dorwick and Kevin Moberly, it is now edited by Keith Dorwick. ''Technoculture'' is a member of the Council of Editors of Learned Journals and is indexed by EBSCOhost and the Modern Language Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tcjournal.org |title=''Technoculture: An Online Journal of Technology in Society.'' |date=2009–2011 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall McLuhan]] is most known for his concepts of a "[[Global village (term)|global village]]". In his book ''[[Understanding Media]]'' he talks about how media affects society and culture. He also develops a theory about technology being an extension of the body. According to McLuhan, the alphabet is what gave rise to the idea that sight is more important than hearing because in order to communicate one had to be able to see and understand the alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/ |title=Marshall Who? |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Technoculture: The Key Concepts'', Debra Benita Shaw "outlines the place of science and technology in today's culture" and "explores the power of scientific ideas, their impact on how we understand the natural world and how successive technological developments have influenced our attitudes to work, art, space, language and the human body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technoculture: The Key Concepts|first=Debra Benita|last=Shaw|year=2008|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84520-298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clay Shirky]] writes, teaches, and consults on the social and economic effects of the internet, and especially on places where our social and technological networks overlap. He is on the faculty of NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, and has consulted for Nokia, Procter and Gamble, News Corp., the BBC, the United States Navy and Lego. He is also a regular speaker at technology conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Here Comes Everybody]]|first=Clay|last=Shirky|authorlink=Clay Shirky|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=978-1-59420-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" [[Walter Benjamin]] attempts to analyze the changed experience of art in modern society. He believes that a reproduction of art lacks presence in time and space and therefore has no aura. Original works of art do have an aura. An aura includes authority, its place in space and time (when it was made), how the piece's physical condition suffered and how it's changed owners over time. An original work of art derives its authenticity from history and what has happened to it over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|first=Walter|last=Benjamin|year=2010|publisher=Prism Key Press|isbn=1-4537-2248-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24171">[[File:Energiaberriztagarriak.jpg|thumb|Renewable energy is one primary example of a technological fix, as it has been designed to combat the issues with global warming and climate change.]]
A '''technological fix''', '''technical fix''', '''technological shortcut''' or '''solutionism''' refers to the attempt of using [[engineering]] or [[technology]] to solve a problem (often created by earlier technological interventions).&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Stephen P. ''The Worldview Literacy Book'' Parthenon Books 2009. Excerpt at http://www.projectworldview.org/wvtheme46.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some references define technological fix as an "attempt to repair the harm of a technology by modification of the system", that might involve modification of the machine and/or modification of the procedures for operating and maintaining it.

Technological fixes are inevitable in modern technology. It has been observed that many technologies, although invented and developed to solve certain perceived problems, often [[Law of Unintended Consequences|create other problems in the process]], known as [[externalities]]. In other words, there would be modification of the basic hardware, modification of techniques and procedures, or both.&lt;ref&gt;The sacred and the limits of the technological fix AR Drengson - Zygon®, 1984 - Wiley Online Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological fix is the idea that all problems can find solutions in better and new technologies. It now is used as a dismissive phrase to describe cheap, quick fixes by using inappropriate technologies; these fixes often create more problems than they solve, or give people a sense that they have solved the problem.&lt;ref&gt;The Technological Fix Critique of Agricultural Biotechnology, D Scott, http://wiki.umt.edu/odc/images/d/db/TechFixISU6-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary context==
In the contemporary context, technological fix is sometimes used to refer to the idea of using data and intelligent algorithms to supplement and improve human decision making in hope that this would result in ameliorating the bigger problem. One critic, [[Evgeny Morozov]] defines this as "Recasting all complex social situations either as neat problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimized--if only the right algorithms are in place."&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, To Save Everything, Click Here (2013), pg 5&lt;/ref&gt; While some criticizes this approach to the issues of today as detrimental to efforts to truly solve these problems, opponents finds merits in such approach to technological improvement of our society as complements to existing activists and policy efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/toward-a-complex-realistic-and-moral-tech-criticism/273996/|title=Toward a Complex, Realistic, and Moral Tech Criticism|author=Alexis C. Madrigal|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the criticism is how policy makers may be tempted to think that installing smart energy monitors would help people conserve energy better, thus improving [[global warming]], rather than focusing on the arduous process of passing laws to tax carbon, etc. Another example is thinking of [[obesity]] as a lifestyle choice of eating high caloric foods and not exercising enough, rather than viewing obesity as more of a social and class problem where individuals are predisposed to eat certain kind of foods (due to the lack of affordable health-supporting food in urban [[food deserts]]), to lack optimally evidence-based health behaviors, and lack of proper health care to mitigate behavioral outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Dorfman, Lori and Lawrence Wallack (2007) “Moving Nutrition Upstream: The Case for 
Reframing Obesity,” Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, Vol. 39, Issue 2, S45-S50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, To Save Everything, Click Here (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change ==
The technological fix for [[climate change]] is an example of the use of technology to restore the environment. This can be seen through various different strategies such as: [[Climate engineering|geo-engineering]] and [[renewable energy]].

=== Geo-engineering ===
[[Geo-engineering]] is referred as "the artificial modification of Earth's [[climate]] systems through two primary ideologies, [[Solar radiation management|Solar Radiation Management]] (SRM) and [[Carbon dioxide removal|Carbon Dioxide Removal]] (CDR)".{{source needed|date=August 2018}}  Different schemes, projects and technologies have been designed to tackle the effects of climate change, usually by removing CO2 from the air as seen by [[Klaus Lackner]]'s invention of a Co2 prototype, or by limiting the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, by [[Space mirror (geoengineering)|space mirrors]]. However, "critics by contrast claim that geoengineering isn't realistic – and may be a distraction from reducing emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is geoengineering?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/18/geo-engineering|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;" It has been argued that geo-engineering is an adaptation to global warming. It allows TNC's, humans and governments to avoid facing the facts that global warming is a crisis that needs to be dealt with head-on by reducing emissions and implementing [[Environmental technology|green technologies]], rather than developing ways to control the environment and ultimately allow [[Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse Gases]] to continue to be released into the atmosphere.

=== Renewable energy ===
[[File:Findhorn wind turbines.jpg|thumb|Wind Turbine|189x189px]]
[[Renewable energy|Renewable Energy]] is also another example of a technological fix, as technology is being used in attempts to reduce and mitigate the [[effects of global warming]]. [[Renewable energy|Renewable Energy]] refers to technologies that has been designed to be eco-friendly and efficient for the well-being of the Earth. They are generally regarded as infinite energy sources, which means they will never run out, unlike fossil fuels such as [[Oil shale|oil]] and [[coal]], which are finite sources of energy. They additionally release no [[Greenhouse gas|green house gases]] such as [[carbon dioxide]], which is harmful for the planet as it depletes the [[Ozone layer|ozone]] layer. Examples of renewable energy can be seen by [[wind turbine]]s, [[solar energy]] such as solar panels and [[kinetic energy]] from waves. These energies are regarded as a technological fix as they have been designed and innovated to overcome issues with energy insecurity, as well as to help protect Earth from the harmful emissions released from non-renewable energy sources, and thus overcome global warming. It is also known that such technologies will in turn require their own technological fixes. For example, some types of solar energy have local impacts on ambient temperature, which can be a hazard to birdlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-tech-solar-projects-fail-to-deliver-1434138485 |title=High-Tech Solar Projects Fail to Deliver |quote=Once built, U.S. government biologists found the plant’s superheated mirrors were killing birds. In April, biologists working for the state estimated that 3,500 birds died at Ivanpah in the span of a year, many of them burned alive while flying through a part of the solar instalment where air temperatures can reach 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food famine ==
It has been made explicit within society that the world's population is rapidly increasing, with the  "UNICEF estimating that an average of 353,000 babies are born each day around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Many Babies Are Born Each Day?|url = http://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/How-Many-Babies-Are-Born-Each-Day|website = The World Counts|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is expected that the production of food will not be able to progress and develop to keep up with the needs of species. [[Ester Boserup]] highlighted in 1965 that when the human population increases and food production decreases, an innovation will take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Big Picture|url = http://bigpictureeducation.com/malthus-vs-boserup|website = Big Picture|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be demonstrated in the technological development of [[hydroponics]] and [[genetically modified crops]].
[[File:Bananier-hydrotown.JPG|thumb|hydroponics]]

=== Hydroponics ===
Hydroponics is an example of a technological fix. It demonstrates the ability for humans to recognise a problem within society, such as the lack of food for an increasing population, and therefore attempt to fix this problem with the development of an innovative technology. Hydroponics is a method of food production to increase productivity, in an "artificial environment."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Hydroponics|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_ocr_gateway/green_world/farmingrev2.shtml|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soil is replaced by a mineral solution that is left around the plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Just 4 Growers: Global Garden Community|url = http://www.just4growers.com/stream/plant-nutrition-and-growth-enhancers/how-to-mix-a-3-part-hydroponics-nutrient-solution.aspx|website = www.just4growers.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing the soil allows a greater crop yield, as there is less chance of soil-born diseases, as well as being able to monitor plant growth and mineral concentrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This innovative technology to yield more food reflects the ability for humans to develop their way out of a problem, portraying a technological fix.

=== Genetically modified organism ===
[[Genetically modified organism]] (GMO) reflect the use of technology to innovate our way out of a problem such as the lack of food to cater for the growing population, demonstrating a technological fix. GM crops can create many advantages, such as higher food fields, added vitamins and increased farm profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Q and A About Genetically Modified Crops - Pocket K {{!}} ISAAA.org|url = http://isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/1/default.asp|website = isaaa.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the modifications, they may also introduce the problem of increasing resistance to [[Genetically modified food controversies#Chemical use|pesticides and herbicides]], which may inevitably precipitate the need for further fixes in the future.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/business/energy-environment/04weed.html |title=U.S. Farmers Cope With Roundup-Resistant Weeds |last1=Neuman |first1=William |first2=Andrew |last2=Pollack |date=4 May 2010 |work=The New York Times |page=B1 |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Golden rice ====
[[Golden rice]] is one example of a technological fix. It demonstrates the ability for humans to develop and innovate themselves out of problems, such as the deficiency of [[vitamin A]] in [[Taiwan]] and [[Philippines]], in which the [[World Health Organization]] reported that about 250 million preschool children are affected by.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vitamin A Deficiency|url = http://www.goldenrice.org/Content3-Why/why1_vad.php|website = www.goldenrice.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the technological development of GM Crops, scientists were able to develop golden rice that can be grown in these countries with genetically higher levels of [[beta-carotene]] (a precursor of vitamin A). This enables healthier and fulfilling lifestyles for these individuals and consequently helps to reduce the deaths caused by the deficiency.

== Externalities ==
Externalities refer to the '''unforeseen''' or '''unintended''' consequences of technology. It is evident that everything new and innovative can potentially have negative effects, especially if it is a new area of development. Although technologies are invented and developed to solve certain perceived problems, they often create other problems in the process.

=== DDT ===
[[DDT]] was initially use by the Military in [[World War II]] to control a range of different illnesses, varying from [[Malaria]] to the [[bubonic plague]] and [[Body louse|body lice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/ddtgen.pdf|title = NPIC - National Pesticide Information Centre|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the efficiency of DDT, it was soon adopted as a farm pesticide to help maximise crop yields to consequently cope with the rising populations food demands post WWII. This pesticide proved to be extremely effective in killing bugs and animals on crops, and was often referred as the "wonder-chemical."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The DDT Story {{!}} Pesticide Action Network|url = http://www.panna.org/resources/ddt-story|website = www.panna.org|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite being banned for over forty years, we are still facing the externalities of this technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was found that DDT had major health impacts on both humans and animals. It was found that DDT accumulated within the fatty cells of both humans and animals and therefore highlights that technological fixes have their negatives as well as positives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Environmental Health Criteria. Geneva, Switzerland, 1989; Vol. 83.|last = |first = |date = 2015-10-29|journal = DDT|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animals ====
* DDT is toxic to birds when eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Toxicology Profile for (Update); U. S. Department of Human Health &amp; Human Services, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1994.|last = |first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global warming ===
{{See also|Climate engineering}}
[[Global warming]] can be a natural phenomenon that occurs in long (geologic) cycles. However, it has been found that man-made [[ozone layer depletion]] and the release of [[Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse Gases]] through industry, and traffic, causes the earth to heat up to unnatural temperatures. This is causing externalities on the environment, such as melting icecaps, shifting [[biome]]s and [[extinction]] of many [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] species, through [[ocean acidification]] and changing temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Effects of Global Warming|url = http://www.livescience.com/37057-global-warming-effects.html|website = LiveScience.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Automobiles ====
[[Automobile]]s with [[internal combustion engine]]s have revolutionised civilisation and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = internal-combustion engine: Introduction|url = http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/internal-combustion-engine.html|website = www.infoplease.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst the technology was new and innovative, helping to connect places through the ability of transport, it was not recognised at the time that burning fossil fuels, such as [[coal]] and [[Oil shale|oil]], inside the engines would release [[pollutant]]s. This is an explicit example of an externality caused by a technological fix, as the problems caused from the development of the technology was not recognised at the time.

== Different types of technological fixes ==

=== High-tech megaprojects ===
High-tech [[megaproject]]s are large scale and require huge sums of investment and revenue to be created. Examples of these high technologies are Dams, [[nuclear power plant]]s, and airports. They usually cause externalities on other factors such as the environment, are highly expensive, and are [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] governmental plans. 
[[File:Three gorges dam locks view from vantage point.jpg|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] is a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dam.|176x176px]]

==== Three Gorges Dam ====
The [[Three Gorges Dam]] is an example of a high-tech technological fix. The creation of the multi-purpose navigation hydropower and flood control scheme was designed to fix the issues with flooding whilst providing efficient, clean renewable [[Hydropower|hydro-electric power]] in [[China]]. The Three Gorges Dam is the [[List of largest power stations in the world|world's largest power station]] in terms of [[installed capacity]] (22,500&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]]). The dam is the largest operating hydroelectric facility in terms of annual energy generation, generating 83.7 TWh in 2013 and 98.8 TWh in 2014, while the annual energy generation of the [[Itaipú Dam]]  in [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]] was 98.6 TWh in 2013 and 87.8 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generation|url=http://www.itaipu.gov.br/energia/geracao|publisher=Itaipu Binacional|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Gorges breaks world record for hydropower generation|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2015-01/01/c_127352471.htm|publisher=Xinhua|accessdate=2 January 2015|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drought curbs Itaipu hydro output|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/news/electricpower/drought-curbs-itaipu-hydro-output|accessdate=5 January 2015|agency=Business News Americas|date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated to have cost over £25 billion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = GoConqr - Types of technological fix|url = https://www.goconqr.com/en/p/324288-types-of-technological-fix-mind_maps|website = GoConqr|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been many externalies from this technology, such as the extinction of the [[Chinese river dolphin|Chinese River Dolphin]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; an increase in pollution, as the river can no longer 'flush' itself, and over 4 million locals being displaced in the area.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Intermediate technology ===
[[File:Rooftop rainwater harvesting.jpg|thumb|226x226px|[[Rainwater harvesting]]]]
Is usually small-scale and cheap technologies that are usually seen in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. The capital to build and create these technologies are usually low, yet labour is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Financial Market Integration and Growth: Structural Change and Economic Dynamics in the European Union|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v83xyM9VUZgC|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2011-02-14|isbn = 9783642162749|first = Paul J. J.|last = Welfens|first2 = Cillian|last2 = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local expertise can be used to maintain these technologies making them very quick and effective to build and repair. An example of an intermediate technology can be seen by [[water well]]s, [[Rainwater tank|rain barrels]] and pumpkin tanks.

=== Appropriate technologies ===
{{main article|Appropriate technology}}

Technology that suits the level of income, skills and needs of the people.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Appropriate Technology text|url = http://lsa.colorado.edu/essence/texts/appropriate.htm|website = lsa.colorado.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this factor encompasses both high and low technologies.

An example of this can be seen by [[Developing country|developing countries]] that implement technologies that suit their expertise, such as [[Rainwater tank|rain barrels]] and [[hand pump]]s. These technologies are '''low costing''' and can be maintained by local skills, making them affordable and efficient.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, to implement rain barrels in a [[developed country]] would not be appropriate, as it would not suit the technological advancement apparent in these countries. Therefore,  appropriate technological fixes take into consideration the level of development within a country before implementing them.

==Concerns==&lt;!--could be renamed; e.g. to "Issues" or "Criticism", "Warnings", "Cautions" etc--&gt;
Michael and Joyce Huesemann caution against the hubris of large-scale techno-fixes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moonshots for the Earth: are there technological fixes for climate change?|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/energy/2015/11/moonshots-earth-are-there-technological-fixes-climate-change|publisher=New Statesman|accessdate=11 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won't Save Us Or the Environment'' they show why negative unintended consequences of science and technology are inherently unavoidable and unpredictable, why counter-technologies or techno-fixes are no lasting solutions, and why modern technology in current context does not promote [[sustainability]] but instead collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Techno-Fix|url=https://www.newsociety.com/Books/T/Techno-Fix|publisher=New Society Publishers|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naomi Klein]] is a prominent opponent of the view that simply technological fixes will solve our problems. She explained her concerns in her book ''[[This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate]]''&lt;ref name=guard1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=John|title=This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate review – Naomi Klein’s powerful and urgent polemic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/22/this-changes-everything-review-naomi-klein-john-gray|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 February 2017|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scipes|first1=Kim|title=A Review of Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything|url=http://greensocialthought.org/archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gst67-44-45-Kim-Scipes.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that technical fixes for climate change such as geoengineering bring significant risks as "we simply don't know enough about the Earth system to be able to re-engineer it safely". According to her the proposed technique of dimming the rays of the sun with sulphate-spraying helium balloons in order to mimic the cooling effect on the atmosphere of large volcanic eruptions for instance is highly dangerous and such schemes will surely be attempted if abrupt climate change gets seriously under way.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt; Various experts and environmental groups have also come forward with their concerns over views and approaches that look for techno fixes as solutions and warn that those would be "misguided, unjust, profoundly arrogant and endlessly dangerous" approaches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geoengineering Has No Place Among Serious Climate Solutions, Declare Experts|url=http://billmoyers.com/2015/02/16/geoengineering-place-among-serious-climate-solutions-declare-experts/|website=BillMoyers.com|accessdate=11 February 2017|date=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as over the prospect of a technological 'fix' for global warming, however impractical, causing lessened political pressure for a real solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists: We Cannot Geoengineer Our Way Out of the Climate Crisis|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/scientists-we-cannot-geoengineer-our-way-out-climate-crisis/|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While deploying site specific collaborative art practice of allowing more than 1000 employees of the office building, to participate in the experience of painting in the initial phase, the artist conceptualised the creation as a public art project.&lt;ref name=TOI&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-13/people/28308156_1_paint-mural-employees&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ht&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/artandculture/Three-fold-story/Article1-490407.aspx{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menhem|first1=Chantal|title=Art and The Ancient Secrets of the Tree of Life|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/art-and-the-ancient-secrets-of-the-tree-of-life/|publisher=Mozaico|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovation of methodology==
The methodology of creation was the first-of-its-kind simultaneous use of four different art practices engaging in conceptual, site specific, collaborative, and performance art.  Gupta allowed  the 3500 employees at the site, the experience of putting their brush strokes, while on their job, in the initial half of the project. As a part of his performance art, he executed a series of roles while teaching and motivating employees. At the same time, the artist engaged the employees in his practice of team-building exercise through art while creating a five floor high artwork.
                                                    
In the second half of the project, the colours and strokes were taken as raw stock for creating the composition. He proceeded with the three-month [[performance art]] alone; live in front of 3500 employees and almost as many visitors at the site (the campus) to evolve a storyline. Keeping in mind the visibility of the staircase all over the campus through a 60&amp;nbsp;ft high glass facade, the site specific intervention amalgamated the background wall and the front face of the staircase perspectives of five floors into a single canvas merging surrounding sides and roof within one composition.

==Performance art marathon==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Performance art marathon by Manav Gupta.jpg|thumb|Performance art marathon by Manav Gupta]] --&gt;
The other notable feature of the invention was a marathon performance by the artist working non stop on his creation for three months except for few hours of rest and sleep at night.

==Concept ==

When commissioned by [[Bharti Airtel]] Ltd to create a “staircase artwork”  at their headquarters, the artist brought forth his idea born out of a decade and a half practice of public art projects to a radical reorientation towards introducing a unique sustainable development process in [[corporate]] entity, thus establishing that the art can contribute to the business environment as well, by refreshing the intangible quality of its soft power among employees.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== The evolving storyline==
A philosophical perspective was highlighted in the artist's statement while addressing the translation of his sustainable development ideology in his site specific intervention. 
{{cquote|As an artist my endeavor was to bring in the spirituality of higher consciousness within a business environment. Hence the ''burgeoning'' Tree of Life spreads growth and vibrancy in the ever evolving '''''five elements of [[nature]]'''''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/mittal-unveils-5storey-high-mural-at-airtel-centre/650710/&lt;/ref&gt; Each element depicted on respective floor beginning from earth to water to air, space and fire mingle with one another to create symbolism of an ever growing state of energy in the [[universe]].
The compositions on each floor symbolize the evolving human needs that bind and grow into the next higher stage of consciousness.
Beginning with sustenance and fun depicted on the second floor, to love and bonding, [[Festival|celebration]] and [[procreation]] on the third floor represented by the [[Adam and Eve]] formed out of the intertwined branches, the peacock and the non limiting horizon of the sea behind. It then grows to higher needs as the floors progress upwards into the signature umbilical cords of human existence on the fourth floor from where it rises to the “gaze” a reflection of one‘s introspection on the fifth level - the window to the soul and only then the larger cosmic “glow” emanating from the sixth floor sinks in to drive home the awareness that one begins to have with the experience of life itself.
I see the organization as a symbolism of the above.
Hence the creation shaped from an ever evolving stage where I let the employees experience [[color]] and form and learn the [[joy]] of creation while I absorbed what the organization stood for through its employees by letting them paint and pour on my canvas.
I then transformed  all multifarious hues, shapes, colors and idioms into a composite [[mega (prefix)|mega]] [[canvas]] that spoke one language as a work of [[art]] for me to create the above story-line. }}

The '''Widikum people''' are an [[ethnic group]] of [[Cameroon]]. According to oral tradition, the Widikum people originated from an area near the villages of Bamben and Numben in the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest region]] of Cameroon. Egun Oyimi is said to be the ancestral home of the Widikum-speaking people found in [[Momo (department)|Momo division]], parts of [[Mezam]], [[Lebialem]], [[Manyu (department)|Manyu]], [[Menchum]], [[Menoua]], and [[Bamboutos|Bamboutus]] divisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widikum.info/] Widcom&lt;/ref&gt;
