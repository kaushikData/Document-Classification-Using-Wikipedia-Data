{{grading}}
'''Academic grading in Canada''' varies by [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]], level of education (e.g., high school or university), institution (e.g., [[Wilfrid Laurier University]]), and faculty. The following are commonly used conversions from percentage grades to letter grades, however, this is not necessarily meaningful, since there is not a uniform scheme for assigning percentage grades either.

==Academic grading==

===Alberta===
In Alberta, academic grading follows a scale of letter grades (A through D), sentences to describe how well one's performance is to the curricular tasks expected of them, and percentages which are typically reserved for high school, college, and university students. These percentages vary from faculty to faculty in universities, as well as among different universities.
In most post-secondary institutions, percentages are mainly a suggestion, and not a hard grading system, and even some individual classes can have large deviations from the norm (such as anything below an 80 being a C+ or lower).
Letter grades are not used at all in francophone schools; only percentages are used. In francophone schools, from grades 1–19, as well as kindergarten, an alternative grading system is used instead of percentages and letter grades: numbers 1 to 4 are used, with 4 being excellent, 3 being good, 2 being acceptable, and 1 being poor.

A: 90%–100% (student has demonstrated an exemplary performance to what is expected)

B: 80%–89% (student has demonstrated a proficient performance to what is expected)

C: 70%–79% (student has demonstrated an adequate performance to what is expected)

D: 60%–69% (student has demonstrated a limited performance to what is expected)

F: 0%–59% (student has demonstrated a weak performance to what is expected)

IEA: Insufficient Evidence Available: indicates that the teacher of a particular course has not gathered enough evidence of a student's learning and thus, cannot give a grade for said student.

WDR: Withdrawal: indicted the student has withdrew from a particular course and thus, is given no grade because of it.

AMP: Academic Malpractice: Indicates that the student was placed in an incorrect class, whether it be by not having the pre-requiste or did not request the class upon registration. No mark is given.

P: Pass: indicates that the student has achieved the bare minimum grade to pass the class granted by a teacher due to reasons beyond the students control. A grade of P translates into a 50% when used to calculate averages for university or college admission.

A mark of 0%–49%, or a F and under, is a failure for a class and is typically given for high school and post-secondary students only, but can be given to junior high students too, but isn't typically done. A failing grade will also result in not earning credits for an Alberta High School Diploma or for any subject taken in post-secondary, and typically means the student will more than likely repeat the course.

Letter Grade Interpretation:

A = The student demonstrates excellent or outstanding performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.

B = The student demonstrates very good performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.

C+ = The student demonstrates good performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.

C  = The student demonstrates satisfactory performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.

C- = The student demonstrates minimally acceptable performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.

I = (In Progress or Incomplete) The student, for a variety of reasons, is not demonstrating minimally acceptable performance in relation to the expected learning outcomes. An "I" letter grade may only be assigned in accordance with section 3.

F = (Failed) The student has not demonstrated the minimally acceptable performance in relation to the expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade. F (Failed) may only be used as a final letter grade if an "I" (In Progress) letter grade has been previously assigned or the "F" is assigned as a result of failing a provincially examinable course.

W = (Withdrawal) According to the policy of the board, and upon request of the parent of the student or, when appropriate, the student, the principal, vice principal or director of instruction in charge of a school may grant permission to a student to withdraw from a course or subject.

SG = (Standing Granted) Although completion of normal requirements is not possible, a sufficient level of performance has been attained to warrant, consistent with the best interests of the student, the granting of standing for the course or subject and grade. Standing Granted may be used in cases of serious illness, hospitalization, late entry or early leaving, but may only be granted by an adjudication process authorized by the principal, vice principal or director of instruction in charge of the school. Standing Granted may not be used for a course with a Required Graduation Program Examination. Standing Granted may not be used for Graduation Transitions.

(TS = Transfer Standing) May be granted by the principal, vice principal or director of instruction in charge of a school on the basis of an examination of records from an institution other than a school as defined in the School Act. Alternatively, the principal, vice principal or director of instruction in charge of a school may assign a letter grade on the basis of an examination of those records.

Many school districts in British Columbia have switched the reporting method from percentages to letter grades for Grades 8–9.

===[[Ontario]]===
The grading standards for A-letter grades changed in September 2010 to coincide with a new academic year. The new changes require a higher percentage grade by two or five points to obtain an A or A+ respectively. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
*A (Level 4, beyond government standards) 80% and above
*B (Level 3, at government standards) 70–79%
*C (Level 2, approaching government standards) 60–69%
*D (Level 1, well below government standards) 50–59%
*R (Remedial standards, used from grades 1 to 8)
*F (Failing standards—used in high schools), below 50%. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

At a high school level, most subjects are separated in three competencies. On report cards, marks are normally shown as numbers and an average of the two marks associated to the subject will be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mels.gouv.qc.ca/renouveau/index.asp?page=pub_bulletins&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a student achieves A, A- and B+ in a subject, teachers will calculate an average of the three marks (in this case, 85%).

Quebec passing mark is 60% and not 50% as compared to some other provinces. Note that it is common practice for students to pass with grades in the range of 55% to 59% at the teacher's discretion. Also worth note the military pass mark is also generally 60%.

Note: Most schools in Quebec have now switched to percentages. The mark the students receives is the mark that is shown. The 60% passing mark remains.

The '''African Human Rights Moot Court Competition''' is an international moot court competition with a special focus on human rights in Africa. The competition is organised by the [[Centre for Human Rights]], based at the [[University of Pretoria Faculty of Law]] in South Africa. Each year, the competition is hosted by  a Law Faculty from a different African country. Since its inception in 1992, the competition has had 845 participant teams originating from 125 universities from 45 African countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chr.up.ac.za Centre for Human Rights website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition is tri-lingual and preliminary rounds are argued in English, French and Portuguese. Students argue a hypothetical human rights case and base their arguments on the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.  The final round is argued by two teams made up of the best three Anglophone teams, two Francophone teams and one Lusophone team. The final round is judged by prominent African and international jurists.

==Recognition==

The African Human Rights Moot Court has been described as the largest gathering of law students and lecturers on the African continent. The Centre for Human Rights was awarded the [[UNESCO]] Prize for Human Rights Education in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5243">'''BC Agriculture in the Classroom Foundation''' (BCAITC) is a registered [[nonprofit organization]] that works with educators through various programs to bring [[British Columbia|British Columbia's]] agriculture to elementary and secondary students within the province. Students learn about where their food comes from, how to grow their own food, and why farms and agriculture play such an important role in our society.

== Governance ==
The foundation is part of a national group, [http://www.aitc.ca/ Agriculture in the Classroom] that operates across [[Canada]] through individual provinces. Though partially supported by government, the foundation relies on financial support from the agricultural community to sustain its activities.

The organization's mission is: "Working to bring BC's agriculture to our students".

The foundation has representation on its board of directors from [[teachers]], the provincial government, [[financial institutions]], [[nutritionists]], producers, and [[dieticians]].

==Teacher Resources and Programs==

BCAITC's resource centre provides teachers with print and video resources.&lt;ref&gt;BCAITC Resources http://www.aitc.ca/bc/index.php?page=resources&lt;/ref&gt; With titles such as The Sustainability Road Show, Wonderful Worms, Food For Thought,&lt;ref&gt;Metro Vancouver http://www.metrovancouver.org/region/teachers/Pages/AgricultureFood4Thought.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227083651/http://www.metrovancouver.org/region/teachers/Pages/AgricultureFood4Thought.aspx |date=2011-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spuds In Tubs, teachers from all grades are encouraged to bring resources into their classroom and have developed different programs to help spread awareness of agriculture and the importance of eating healthy and supporting local producers.&lt;ref&gt;BCAITC Programs http://www.aitc.ca/bc/index.php?page=programs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Take a Bite of BC===

Take a Bite of BC was developed in 2009 by BCAITC in partnership with the BC Culinary Arts Association, BC agricultural commodity groups and BC producers. BC grown products are donated to the program and delivered to participating secondary school teaching kitchens over a four-month period. The program provides an opportunity for Chef Instructors to feature locally grown product in secondary school teaching kitchens.&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver Sun https://vancouversun.com/business/Students+serve+tasty+Bite/4463235/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Students gain experience working with fresh products and begin to develop an appreciation for [[farmers]] in their community as they connect with the foods that are grown around them and learn about the benefits of eating healthy, fresh and local. As of the 2016/2017 school year, all 60 secondary schools with culinary arts programs are benefiting from this program.  {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

===Spuds in Tubs===

BCAITC's signature program, Spuds in Tubs enables students to experience growing their own food. With the help of a teacher, students plant seed potatoes into tubs, and from there tend them and watch them grow into something they can harvest and eat. There are currently 125 classrooms and 3,250 students participating {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

===The BC School Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional Program===

The foundation's biggest program, the BC School Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional Program, partners with local producers to deliver fresh, local fruits and [[vegetables]] to BC schools. In 2011 a three million dollar expansion of the program was announced and the program will now reach over 1,200 schools in BC, and serve over 400,000 students with fresh fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;BC Government http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2009-2013/2011PREM0051-000552.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer Institute==

The Summer Institute is a course put on by BCAITC for teachers who want to learn more about [[agriculture]]. This course is designed for teachers in the BC school system to explore practical ways to integrate concepts related to [[food production]] and consumption, [[food safety]], agricultural issues, and [[sustainability]] across the curriculum at all grade levels.  Through active participation, field trips, guest speakers, video presentations, and the like, participants will expand their knowledge of agriculture and food concepts and issues and reflect on their own values and orientations to the topic.  Ways to incorporate this new knowledge into existing courses will be explored with ethical defensibility being the guiding principle.  The goal is to produce curriculum projects that can be implemented in schools or other settings. The course is put on in partnership with the [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;UBC http://www.eplt.educ.ubc.ca/courses/home-economics-education-summer-institutes-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tanjore Balasaraswati''',&lt;ref name=pa/&gt; also known as '''Balasaraswati''' (13 May 1918&amp;nbsp;– 9 February 1984), was a celebrated Indian dancer, and her rendering of [[Bharatanatyam]], a classical dance style originated in the [[South Indian]] state of [[Tamil Nadu]], made this style of dancing well known in different parts of [[India]] and many parts of the world.

She was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1957&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Padma Vibhushan]] in 1977, the third and the second highest civilian honours given by the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref name=pa&gt;{{cite web|title=Padma Awards Directory (1954-2007) |publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] |date=2007-05-30 |url=http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/PadmaAwards1954-2007.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410024701/http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/PadmaAwards1954-2007.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 she was awarded the ''[[Sangeetha Kalasikhamani]]'' award of The Indian Fine Arts Society, Chennai.

==Early life and background==
Balasaraswati was a seventh generation representative of a traditional matrilineal family of temple musicians and dancers ([[devadasi]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/temple-dancer/920036/ |title=Temple Dancer |newspaper=[[Indian Express]] |date=2012-03-05 |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; who traditionally enjoyed high social status), who have been described as the greatest single repository of the traditional performing arts of music and dance of the southern region of India [("Balasaraswati" by V.K. Narayana Menon)]. Her ancestor, Papammal, was a musician and dancer patronized in the mid-eighteenth century by the court of Thanjavur. Her grandmother, Vina Dhanammal (1867–1938), is considered by many to be the most influential musician of the early twentieth century. Her mother, Jayammal (1890–1967) was a singer who encouraged the training of Balasaraswati and was her accompanist.

Balasaraswati created a revolution in traditional music and dance for bharata natyam, a combination of the performance arts of music and dance. She learned music within the family from her infancy, and her rigorous training in dance was begun when she was four under the distinguished dance teacher K. Kandappan Pillai, a member of the famed Thanjavur Nattuvanar family. Her younger brothers were the musicians [[T. Ranganathan]] and [[T. Viswanathan]] who would both become prominent performers and teachers in India and the United States. Her daughter, Lakshmi Knight (1943–2001), became a distinguished performer of her mother's style. Her grandson [[Aniruddha Knight]] continues to perform the family style today, and is artistic director of Bala Music and Dance Association in the United States and the Balasaraswati School of Dance in India. Her son-in-law Douglas M. Knight, Jr. has written her biography with the support of a Guggenheim Fellowship (2003). Famous Indian film maker Satyajit Ray made a documentary on her works.

==Career==
Balasaraswati's debut took place in 1925. She was the first performer of her traditional style outside of South India, performing first in Calcutta in 1934. As a young teenager, she was seen by choreographer [[Uday Shankar]], who became an ardent promoter of her performances, and throughout the 1930s she captured the imagination of audiences across India. She went on to a global career that attracted international critical attention and the respect of dance greats such as [[Shambhu Maharaj]], Dame [[Margot Fonteyn]], [[Martha Graham]], and [[Merce Cunningham]]. Interest in bharata natyam rebounded in the 1950s as the public became interested in promoting a unique Indian art form. Balasaraswati, encouraged by an administrator at the Music Academy in Madras, established a dance school in association with the institution. There she trained new dancers in bharata natyam as per her vision. In the early 1960s she increasingly travelled globally, with performances in East Asia, Europe, and North America. Later that decade, throughout the 1970s, and into the early 1980s, she visited the United States repeatedly and held residencies—as both a teacher and a performer—at Wesleyan University (Middletown, Connecticut), California Institute of the Arts (Valencia), Mills College (Oakland, California), the University of Washington (Seattle), and Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival (Beckett, Massachusetts), among other institutions. Through her international engagements as well as her activities in India, especially in Madras, Balasaraswati not only exposed countless audiences to the traditional style of bharata natyam but also trained many new practitioners of the art form.

She received numerous awards in India, including the President's Award from the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] (1955), [[Padma Vibushan]] from the Government of India for distinguished national service (1977) and [[Sangita Kalanidhi]] from the [[Madras Music Academy]], South India's highest award for musicians (1973). In a review in 1977, the New York Times dance critic [[Anna Kisselgoff]] described her as one of the "supreme performing artists in the world". [[India Today]], one of the leading news magazine of India, based on a survey, classified her as one of the 100 prominent Indians who have shaped the destiny of India. She was the only non-western dancer included in a compilation of the Dance Heritage Coalition, "America's Irreplaceable Dance Treasures: The First 100" (2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">The '''Bremen clause''' ({{lang-de|Bremer Klausel}}) is Article 141 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], which states:
{{cquote|''Artikel 7 Abs. 3 Satz 1 findet keine Anwendung in einem Lande, in dem am 1. Januar 1949 eine andere landesrechtliche Regelung bestand.'' 
The first sentence of paragraph (3) of Article 7 shall not apply in any state in which, on January 1, 1949, state law provides otherwise.}}
The sentence there cited says:
{{cquote|''Der Religionsunterricht ist in den öffentlichen Schulen mit Ausnahme der bekenntnisfreien Schulen ordentliches Lehrfach.''
Religious instruction shall form part of the regular curriculum in state schools, with the exception of non-denominational schools.}}

It limits the range of application of the constitutional (Basic Law) rule over [[religious education]], making it possible to have other types of instruction in some areas of [[Germany]]. A well-known example is the "instruction in [[Bible|Biblical]] history" in [[Bremen]]. It is not religious education in the sense of the Basic Law, because its content is not accountable to a [[religious community]]; therefore it is not a "[[common affair]]" ([[res mixta]]).

'''Certified Information Systems Security Professional''' ('''CISSP''') is an independent [[information security]] [[certification]] granted by the [[(ISC)²|International Information System Security Certification Consortium]], also known as (ISC)².

As of 1 January 2018, there are 122,289 (ISC)² members holding the CISSP certification worldwide, in 166 countries with the United States holding the highest member count at 79,617 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isc2.org/About/Member-Counts|title=Member Counts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=(ISC)²|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{date|June 2004}}, the CISSP designation was accredited under the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] [[ISO/IEC Standard 17024:2003]].&lt;ref name="ansi-17024"&gt;[https://www.ansica.org/wwwversion2/outside/ALLdirectoryDetails.asp?menuID=2&amp;prgID=201&amp;orgID=97&amp;status=4 ANSI Accreditation Services - International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium, Inc.

== History ==
In the mid-1980s, a need arose for a standardized, vendor-neutral certification program that provided structure and demonstrated competence. In November 1988, the Special Interest Group for Computer Security (SIG-CS), a member of the Data Processing Management Association (DPMA), brought together several organizations interested in this goal. The [[(ISC)²|International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium]] or "(ISC)²"  formed in mid-1989 as a non-profit organization.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Shon|title=All-In-One CISSP Exam Guide|edition=5|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-160217-8|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, the first working committee to establish a ''Common Body of Knowledge'' (CBK) had been formed. The first version of the CBK was finalized by 1992, and the CISSP credential was launched by 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.isc2.org/isc2-history.aspx History of (ISC)²]. (ISC)²&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certification subject matter ==
The CISSP curriculum covers subject matter in a variety of [[Information Security]] topics.&lt;ref name="11th_hour_book"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conrad |last2=Misenar |last3=Feldman |title=11th Hour CISSP |publisher=Syngress |isbn=978-0-12-417142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CISSP examination is based on what (ISC)² terms the Common Body of Knowledge (or CBK). According to (ISC)², "the CISSP CBK is a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] – a collection of topics relevant to information security professionals around the world. The CISSP CBK establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles that allow information security professionals worldwide to discuss, debate and resolve matters pertaining to the profession with a common understanding."&lt;ref name="CBK_BOOK"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tipton |last2=Henry |title=Official (ISC)² Guide to the CISSP CBK |publisher=Auerbach Publications |isbn=0-8493-8231-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 15 April 2018, the CISSP curriculum is updated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CISSP-Exam-Outline-121417--Final.ashx|url=https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Certifications/CISSP/CISSP-Exam-Outline-121417--Final.ashx|publisher=(ISC)²|accessdate=20 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Asset Security
*Security Architecture and Engineering
*Communication and Network Security
*Identity and Access Management (IAM)

One year may be waived for having either a four-year college degree, a master's degree in Information Security, or for possessing one of a number of other certifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isc2.org/cissp-professional-experience.aspx |title=CISSP Professional Experience Requirement |year=2009 |publisher=[[(ISC)²]]|accessdate=December 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate without the five years of experience may earn the Associate of (ISC)² designation by passing the required CISSP examination,  valid for a maximum of six years. During those six years a candidate will need to obtain the required experience and submit the required endorsement form for certification as a CISSP. Upon completion of the professional experience requirements the certification will be converted to CISSP status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isc2.org/how-to-become-an-associate.aspx |title=How to Become an Associate |year=2009 |publisher=[[(ISC)²]] |accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing certification ==
The CISSP credential is valid for three years;   most holders renew by submitting Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits. There is also a yearly membership fee required to maintain certification.&lt;ref name="maintain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isc2.org/maintaining-your-credential.aspx|title=Maintaining Your Credential|year=2009|publisher=[[(ISC)²]]|accessdate=December 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Annual Maintenance Fee (AMF) must be submitted by the anniversary date. 

Once the CPE and AMF requirements are met, the certification will automatically renew for another three-year certification cycle. The certification will not renew until the current certification cycle expires. Typically, renewals are processed around the 1st and 15th of every month.

After the certification(s) has been renewed, a confirmation email will be sent to the certification holder. An updated certificate and ID card will follow in the postal mail within 8 to 12 weeks.

== Value ==
In 2005, ''Certification Magazine'' surveyed 35,167 IT professionals in 170 countries on compensation and found that CISSPs led their list of certificates ranked by salary. A 2006 ''Certification Magazine'' salary survey also ranked the CISSP credential highly, and ranked CISSP concentration certifications as the top best-paid credentials in IT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.certmag.com/images/CM1206_salSurveyFig1.jpg|title=Top Certifications by Salary in 2007 |journal=Certification Magazine |date=2007-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329054214/http://www.certmag.com/images/CM1206_salSurveyFig1.jpg |archivedate=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2007-10-14 | author=Certification Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.certmag.com/articles/templates/CM_gen_Article_template.asp?articleid=1524&amp;zoneid=224 |deadurl=yes |title=CertMag's 2005 Salary Survey: Monitoring Your Net Worth |journal=Certification Magazine |publisher=CertMag |date=December 2005 |first=Tim |last=Sosbe |first2=Emily|last2=Hollis |first3=Brian |last3=Summerfield |first4=Cari |last4=McLean |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607155757/http://www.certmag.com/articles/templates/CM_gen_Article_template.asp?articleid=1524&amp;zoneid=224 |archivedate=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, another study came to the conclusion that IT professionals with CISSP (or other major security certifications) and at least 5 years of experience tend to have salaries around US$102,376, about US$21,000 (or 26%) higher than IT professionals with similar experience levels who do not have such certificates.&lt;ref name="brodkin2008"&gt;Brodkin, Jon (2008-06-11).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3881">'''Computer science and engineering''' (CSE) is an academic program at some [[University|universities]] that integrates the fields of [[computer engineering]] and [[computer science]]. It is a sub-field of [[electronics engineering]], covering only the digital aspects of electronics engineering, specializing in hardware-systems areas like [[computer architecture]], [[processor design]], [[supercomputer|high-performance computing]], [[parallel computing|parallel processing]], [[computer networks]] and [[embedded systems]]. CSE programs also include core subjects of computer science such as [[operating systems]], [[theory of computation]], design and analysis of [[algorithm]]s, [[data structures]] and [[database|database systems]]. The program aims at designing, developing and troubleshooting [[computing|computing devices]] (such as [[personal computers]], [[supercomputers]], [[robots]], [[smartphones]], [[networking devices]], [[embedded devices]]), focusing the underlying fundamental issues (like processor architecture design, operating system design, [[memory management]], [[digital system]] design, [[communication protocol]] design, [[software development]] and [[database management]]) in the most efficient and effective way.

Computer science programs typically centers primarily around theory and software, with only some hardware&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/overview/|title=Overview of the Degree Programs - Computer Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; upper division courses tend to allow a lot of freedom to specialize in software and theory related areas (e.g. [[algorithms]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cryptography]]/security, [[computer graphics|graphics]]/[[scientific visualization|visualization]], [[numerical analysis|numerical]] and [[symbolic computation|symbolic computing]], [[operating systems]]/[[distributed processing]], [[software engineering]]).

Computer engineering programs tend to resemble computer science at the lower division with similar introductory programming and math courses, but diverges from computer science at the upper division with heavy electrical engineering requirements (e.g. [[digital electronics|digital]] and [[analogue electronics|analog]] circuits, [[integrated circuit design]], [[VLSI]] design and [[control systems]]. Despite the overlap with computer science at the lower division level, computer engineering skews much more heavily toward the electronics side that it has more in common with [[electrical engineering]].

Computer Science and Engineering integrates all of the above and is intended to develop a solid understanding of the entire machine ([[computer hardware]] and [[software]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.ucdavis.edu/programs/ECS/ECSprog.html|title=UC Davis General Catalog - Computer Science and Engineering - The Program|website=catalog.ucdavis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher unit count required to complete the program often means that a CSE student will need to spend an extra year in university.

Although Computer Science and Engineering is the common designation for the combined program, some universities (such as [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[MIT]]) deviate by calling their program ''Electrical Engineering and Computer Science'' (EECS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/electrical-engineering-computer-sciences|title=Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences|date=11 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, there are some universities (such as [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] and [[UC Merced]]) that named their department EECS and the program housed within CSE.

'''Da Vinci Schools''' is a public charter school network located at the corners of [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]], [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], and [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], [[United States]].

Da Vinci Schools are dedicated to preparing students for college completion and 21st century jobs through an interdisciplinary real-world, [[Project Based Learning|project-based]] "learn by doing" curriculum that exceeds state content standards and California's "a-g" university admissions requirements. Da Vinci signature programs and practices include: project-based real-world learning; career pathways: a small and personalized learning environment where every student is known, seen and valued; strategic public-private partnerships with many innovative industry, higher-ed, and nonprofit leaders; a Work Experience Program in which high school students gain on-the-job, work experience; and an Early College Program in which students take college classes for credit (at no cost to families) while they simultaneously earn their high school diploma.

Established in 2009 as independently governed and operated charter schools, Da Vinci Schools have earned a reputation for hands-on learning and a new public-private partnership model where industry helps to define the real-world skill sets needed to prepare students for jobs in today's global economy. Dr. David Brown, the former executive director of the WASC Accrediting Commission, said "Da Vinci Schools are among the very finest I've seen." Former California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell, said "Da Vinci Schools should be a model for other public schools in the state." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailybreeze.com/ci_14184046?IADID=Search-www.dailybreeze.com-www.dailybreeze.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Los Angeles Times reported that Da Vinci Schools offer a teaching model that would make [[Leonardo da Vinci]] proud.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, Mitchell. [http://www.davincischools.org/press/LATimes_2009Dec_TeachingModel.pdf], "[[Los Angeles Times]]",December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety-eight (98%) of Da Vinci graduates have successfully completed the A-G subject requirements for admission to a University of California or Cal State campus (a rate 51% higher than the State Average). Da Vinci graduates have been accepted to every UC and CSU, and to Stanford, MIT, Yale, Columbia, Brown, Princeton, Dartmouth, Purdue, USC, LMU, and many other prestigious private and public universities across the nation.

In Fall 2017, Da Vinci Communications, Da Vinci Design and Da Vinci Science high schools co-located to a new Wiseburn campus at 201 N. Douglas Street, El Segundo, CA. 

Da Vinci Schools are fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools &amp; Colleges (WASC) and are a member of the [[Coalition of Essential Schools]].

==Board of trustees==

President - Chet Pipkin, Founder, Chairman, President and CEO, [[Belkin|Belkin International]]; Vice President - Dr. Donald Brann, former superintendent of Wiseburn School District and a member of the El Segundo City Council; Trustee - Art Lofton, (Retired) Sector Vice President Global Mission Excellence at [[Northrop Grumman]] Aerospace Systems; Treasurer - Brian Meath, Principal with Nigro Karlin Segal &amp; Feldstein, LLP; Board Secretary - Jennifer Morgan, Wiseburn community member, small business owner; Trustee - Israel Mora, General Manager, Interstate Hotels; Trustee - Roger Bañuelos, President of Element Consulting, Inc.

==Curriculum &amp; philosophy==

Project-based learning (PBL) is learn-by-doing curriculum that integrates core subjects with real-life problems to be solved. Teachers work in teams with one another to identify key content standards and essential skills that need to be addressed at the grade-level. Then, teachers work backwards to plan their curriculum, striving to create a project that centers on a big idea and a real world connection. Students work in teams to create a final product that demonstrates mastery of content standards and a demonstration of key skills. One of the most important aspects of project-based learning is a public presentation of the work created, as assessment is based on students’ ability to articulate and demonstrate the content and skills learned. For a recent Engineering project, students learned about mechanics and motion, then constructed a Medieval-style [[Trebuchet]] to calculate the trajectory of a ball’s travel from its starting point to its ending point represented by a quadratic equation.&lt;ref&gt;http://teachers.egfi-k12.org/where-learning-by-doing-is-no-mere-slogan/&lt;/ref&gt;

Student progress is measured and assessed through traditional tests and quizzes, public presentations of learning, projects, and exhibitions.

Da Vinci Schools' graduation requirements are aligned with the UC/Cal State admission requirements. 98% of the Class of 2018 graduates met the UC and CSU “A-G” requirements for admission; 78% of the Class of 2016 graduates received four-year university offers.

==Community partnerships==

[[Image:Innovation Lab.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Northrop Grumman Innovation Lab]]

Da Vinci Schools has strategic partnerships with many corporate, nonprofit and education institutions. Community partners offer students and faculty access to expert knowledge, industry-specific curriculum, internship opportunities, mentoring, teacher training, early college programs, career guidance, volunteer support, direct funding, and much more.

Some of Da Vinci Schools’ partners include:  Northrop Grumman, Belkin International, [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]], [[Chevron Corporation]], [[Raytheon]], SpaceX, Gensler, 72andSunny, Karten Design, Project Lead the Way, El Camino College, UCLA Extension, Southern New Hampshire University, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Loyola Marymount University, and many more.

==Early college==

High school students have the opportunity to earn college credits for free while simultaneously earning their high school diploma. Higher education partners include El Camino College, UCLA Extension, Southern New Hampshire University, West L.A. College, and Cal State University Dominguez Hills.

==Work experience and internships==

Da Vinci high school students have the opportunity to work unpaid at local businesses and corporations as part of the Real World Learning Program. The goal of the Work Experience Program is to provide students with workplace skills in a real-world environment.  Additionally, the program is designed to develop a talent pool of diverse employees to meet the local community’s [[workforce planning]] objectives.  Work Experience and Internship partners include Belkin, 72andSunny, Gensler, Northrop Grumman, SpaceX, Old Navy, Best Buy, Barnes and Noble, FIDM, Toyota Sports Center, New Earth, and many more.

==Community service==

Da Vinci high school students are required to perform a minimum of 20 hours of Community Service each year.  Community Service must be as a volunteer and benefit the community at large.

==College counseling==

Students and families are guided through the college process, including the financial aid process, via college counseling with on-site counselors and advisory teachers.  Starting in 10th grade, students receive additional guidance in testing, financial literacy, and in exploring college options. By the start of the senior year they will be ready to finalize their college lists and focus on the actual applications. Da Vinci seniors are required to apply to a minimum of two colleges.  Students begin making college visits in the 9th grade. Past college visits have included trips to USC, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, [[Pepperdine University]], LMU, and the [[Claremont Colleges]].

==Advisory==

Every student is enrolled in an Advisory class for the full 4 years of high school that includes students from 9-12 grade. The advisory class is a place where students can bond with each other, get academic support, and have a safe place to share their feelings.

==Technology==

Technology is integrated throughout the day in student performance, classroom instruction, data management, and communication.  Da Vinci Schools recently adopted digital math and physics resources that students use both on campus and from home.  A web-based student management system provides families a portal to check their child’s progress 24/7.

==Seminars (electives)==

Seminar classes (similar to electives) are practical, real-world non-core classes. Some recent seminar classes have included:  Architecture and Design, Vehicle Design, Toy Design, Game Theory, Product and Industrial Design, Web Programming, Robotics, Flight School, Aerospace Engineering, Rocketry, Creative Writing, Leadership, Youth and Government, Drama, Yearbook, CrossFit, Yoga, Photography, and many more.

==Extracurricular activities==

Da Vinci Schools offer extracurricular activities, including CIF sports, after-school clubs, music, and more. There is also a non-profit Crossfit gym, Crossfit Zen, that offers a free after school exercise program for Da Vinci Science students.&lt;ref&gt;http://davincisciencecrossfit.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; This program is funded by a once per year fundraiser, and Da Vinci Science students are creating a documentary that follows its development.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgGeU_MYhXw&lt;/ref&gt;

The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre stated that ''Death Academy'' was "cliche-ridden" and "doesn't provide much entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thelastexit.net/cinema/gore.html#Death_Academy|title = Gore &amp; Splatter|last = |first = |publisher = |date = |work = The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre|accessdate = 30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent Flicks criticized every aspect of it, and gave the film a half-star out of seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://daydreamer-theplayground.blogspot.se/2012/09/dvd-review-death-academy-video-2005.html|title = DVD Review: ''Death Academy'' (Video 2005)|last = Lundin|first = Jurgen|publisher = |date = 9 September 2012|work = Independent Flicks|accessdate = 30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A grade of four out of five was awarded by Slasherpool, which said that ''Death Academy'' was suspenseful, interesting, well-directed and acted and "one of the best [[Slasher film|slashers]] you'll see this year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slasherp.nexcess.net/htm/reviews/deathacademy.htm |title=''Death Academy'' |last= |first= |publisher= |date= |work=Slasherpool |accessdate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014125015/http://slasherp.nexcess.net/htm/reviews/deathacademy.htm |archivedate=October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slasherpool would go on to release a newly edited version of the film under the title ''School Night Massacre'', which is currently the only version of the film with English subtitles.

Despite purported and intended benefits, systematic studies have not shown benefits to diversity training and instead show that they backfire and lead to reductions in diversity and to discrimination complaints being taken less seriously.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"&gt;{{Cite web | last1 = Dobbin | first1 = Frank | last2 = Kalev | first2 = Alexandra | url = http://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/why-diversity-management-backfires-and-how-firms-can-make-it-work|title=Why Diversity Management Backfires (And How Firms Can Make it Work)|website=ethics.harvard.edu | publisher = [[Edmond J.

==Controversial issues==
According to Hans Bader, its opponents consider it an oppressive [[ideology]] and reeducation tactic that actually reduces the ability of organizations to attain their goals. It has been suggested that diversity training reinforces differences between individuals instead of fostering their commonalities, thus helping to further racialize the workplace, creating situations where people "tiptoe" around issues such as how to relate to people of different cultures as opposed to people learning to [[communicate]] with and truly understand each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bader | first = Hans | url = https://cei.org/blog/diversity-training-backfires | title = Diversity training backfires | publisher = [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] | website = cei.org| date = 26 December 2007 | access-date = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs which established specific responsibility for diversity, such as [[equal opportunity]] staff positions or diversity task forces, have proven most effective in general. However, the results also indicate that [[White people|White]] females benefit significantly more from diversity training. The benefits for [[African American]] females and males were appreciably lower than European American females. [[Social network|Networking]] and [[mentor]]ing, which were considered bias mitigating approaches, served [[African Americans|African American]] females the most. African American males were the least likely to benefit from any of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalev | first1 = Alexandra | last2 = Dobbin | first2 = Frank | last3 = Kelly | first3 = Erin | title = Best practices or best guesses? Assessing the efficacy of corporate affirmative action and diversity policies | journal = [[American Sociological Review]] | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | pages = 589&amp;ndash;617 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/000312240607100404 | date = August 2006 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000312240607100404 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sue Steiner and collaborators have advocated that controversy be used as a cooperative learning style. They argue that attempting to see both sides of a controversial issue builds empathy and allows working environments to function better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = Sue | last2 = Brzuzy | first2 = Stephanie | last3 = Gerdes | first3 = Karen | last4 = Hurdle | first4 = Donna | title = Using structured controversy to teach diversity content and cultural competence | journal = Journal of Teaching in Social Work | volume = 23 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 55&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | date = 2003 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandra Kalev conducted a comprehensive review of cultural diversity training conducted in 830 midsize to large U.S. workplaces over a thirty one year period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/19/AR2008011901899.html|title=Most Diversity Training Ineffective, Study Finds|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|date=2008-01-20|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results showed that diversity training was followed by a 7.5 percent drop in the number of women in management. The percentage of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Black, female managers fell by 10 percent. Similar effects were shown for Latinos and Asians. The study did not find that all diversity training is ineffective. Mandatory training programs offered to protect against discrimination lawsuits were called into question. Voluntary diversity training participation to advance organization’s business goals was associated with increased diversity at the management level.

== Purported benefits ==
An analysis of data from over 800 firms over 30 years shows that diversity training and grievance procedures backfires and leads to reductions in the diversity of the firms workforce.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Other research shows that people "were less likely to take discrimination complaints seriously against companies who had diversity programs".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news| last = McElroy | first = Molly | url = http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/04/03/diversity-programs-give-illusion-of-corporate-fairness-study-shows/ | title = Diversity programs give illusion of corporate fairness, study shows | work = UW Today | publisher = [[University of Washington]] | date = 3 April 2013 |access-date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As organizations and communities are becoming more [[Globalization|globalized]], there is a need for an expansion in relation to communication among individuals from all over the world, operating within a diverse environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240550|title=The Myriad Benefits of Diversity in the Workplace|last=Abreu|first=Kim|work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]|access-date= 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe it is beneficial for companies to train a diverse staff, as a reflection of the market in which you wish to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Armache | first = Jalal | title = Diversity in the workplace: benefits and challenges | journal = Journal of International Diversity | volume = 2012 | issue = 1 | pages = 59&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = | date = March 2012 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/75172682/diversity-workplace-benefits-challenges | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jalai Armache, in a heterogeneous workplace environment filled with people knowledgeable of those with different backgrounds and nationalities, there is ability to easily expand an organization.

==== Bachelor of Science in Cyber Security (BSCS) ====
The ECCU BSCS program prepares students to obtain knowledge for careers in cyber security and assurance. The program consists of topical areas dealing with computer security management, incident response, and security threat assessment, which requires students to be creators of knowledge and inventors of processes, not merely users of information. Additionally, students will receive instruction in leadership and management in preparation for becoming managers and directors.

==== EC-Council University’s Graduate Certificate Program ====
EC-Council University’s Graduate Certificate Program focuses on the competencies necessary for Cyber Security professionals to become managers, directors, and CIOs. Each certificate targets skills and understandings specific to particular roles in the IT security framework of an organization. The certificates can be taken singly or as multiples up to a set of five–each building across knowledge domains from IT practitioner skill levels to IT executive skill levels.

* Information Security Professional
* Security Analyst
* Enterprise Security Architect
* Digital Forensics
* Incident Management and Business Continuity
* Executive Leadership in Information Assurance

According to EC-Council, the MSCS program attracted more than 150 candidates for its initial class, only six of whom were accepted. Users are required to take courses in ethical hacking and countermeasures, computer forensics and network intrusion detection. Candidates must then complete six electives to qualify for the degree along with a master's thesis, with the option to choose courses from a list that includes secure network management, security analysis and vulnerability assessment, cyberlaw, principles of e-business security, disaster recovery, project management, penetration testing, secure programming, and wireless networking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eccu.edu/about-eccu/ |title=About EC-Council University |publisher=EC-Council University |accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/10/08/IT-trainer-offers-hacker-masters_1.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[4]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Secondary education==
Secondary education lasts 6–7 years, and consists of:
* Classical system (''enseignement secondaire''):&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/living-luxembourg/education/post-primary/index.html "Post-primary education"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921052010/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/living-luxembourg/education/post-primary/index.html |date=2013-09-21 }}. luxembourg.lu. Retrieved on 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Geared towards a university education. It offers a general, all-round education. The objective is for the students to acquire fundamental knowledge of human sciences, literature, mathematics and natural sciences
* Technical system (''enseignement secondaire technique''):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emphasis on vocational education. It may, however, also allow access to university studies. It is divided into 4 ''régimes'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.men.public.lu/fr/secondaire/offre-scolaire-organisation/organisation-es-est/index.html "Organisation"]. Ministère de l'Éducation nationale et de la Formation professionnelle. Retrieved on 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Technical ''régime'' (since 2017/18 - General ''régime'')
** Technician training ''régime''
** Professional ''régime'', resulting in a Certificate of technical and professional aptitude (CATP)
** Preparatory ''régime'', for those who have not yet fulfilled the requirements of fundamental education
Schools of secondary education (that is, aimed towards university education) are called ''Lycées ''(or, colloquially, ''Lycée classique''), while schools of secondary technical education are ''Lycées techniques''. Some ''Lycées'' offer both types of education. The oldest Lycée in the country is the [[Athénée de Luxembourg]], established in 1603. For a long time, it was also the only secondary school.

32 public Lycées and 5 private Lycées teach the state curriculum. Out of these, the following 4 have a special status to use innovative teaching techniques, while still using the public curriculum: 
* Lycée Ermesinde, an all-day school&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[http://www.men.public.lu/fr/secondaire/offre-scolaire-organisation/offre-scolaire/index.html "Offre scolaire"]. Ministère de l'Éducation nationale et de la Formation professionnelle. Retrieved on 4 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Schengen Lycée, a bi-national school in Perl in Germany&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* Sportlycée, for pupils engaging in sport at a high level&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* École de la 2e chance (School of the second chance), for adolescents or adults who have left the school system without a certification&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Higher education==

===Universities===
[[File:Université du Luxembourg Campus Limp Bâtiment central 2008.jpg|thumb|The University of Luxembourg's main building on the Limpertsberg campus]]
Higher education in Luxembourg is dominated by the [[University of Luxembourg]], this being the only fully-fledged university in Luxembourg. It was founded in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Luxembourg|url=http://wwwen.uni.lu/university/about_the_university|website=University of Luxembourg|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following foreign universities have campuses or outposts in Luxembourg:
* Open University Luxembourg: A cooperation between the Luxembourg Lifelong Learning Center, the Luxembourg Chamber of Employees in the private sector, and the British [[Open University]], offering evening or distance-learning courses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open University Luxembourg|url=http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=2122|website=The Open University|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Miami University Dolibois European Center]] (MUDEC): A campus of [[Miami University]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Non-university higher education===
Higher education is also offered by several ''lycées techniques'', in the areas of business and management, arts, and healthcare. After three years of study, this leads to the award of a ''[[Brevet de technicien supérieur]]'' (BTS).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/societe/education-formation/enseignement-superieur/superieur/index.html "Enseignement supérieur"]. luxembourg.lu. Retrieved on 4 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, the [[Lycée classique d'Echternach]] offers [[classes préparatoires|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[Classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles|''classes préparatoires'']] for the French [[Grandes écoles|grandes école]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since 2012, 3 Higher Education Institutes offer courses exclusively in English in Wiltz in the North of Luxembourg. The schools are located in the castle of Wiltz and are private, non-profit organisations and offer Bachelor, Master and DBA degrees. For information see http://www.bbi-edu.eu; http://www.ubi.edu; http://www.business-science-institute.com.

==Private and international schools==
The vast majority of schools are state-run and free. However, some non-public schools exist. Some of these teach the same curriculum as state schools for the same diplomas, but charge tuition. Others teach foreign curricula and award foreign qualifications.

Among secondary schools, the following private schools teach the state curriculum and receive state subsidies:
* École privée Marie-Consolatrice
* École privée Sainte-Anne
* École privée Fieldgen
* Lycée technique Émile Metz
* École privée Notre-Dame Sainte Sophie
Another five private schools teach a different curriculum, and receive fewer subsidies:
* Waldorf School (teaches towards the [[International Baccalaureate]])
* St. George's International School (teaches the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] of England, Wales and Northern Ireland)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/living-luxembourg/education/international-schools/index.html "International schools"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118063534/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/living-luxembourg/education/international-schools/index.html |date=2013-11-18 }}. luxembourg.lu. Retrieved on 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International School of Luxembourg]] (teaches towards the [[International Baccalaureate]])
* [[Lycée Vauban (Luxembourg)|Lycée Vauban: Lycée francais du Luxembourg]] (teaches the French national curriculum)
* École privée Grandjean
The European schools are public schools, in the sense that they accept (for free) the children of [[European Union]] civil servants, and those whose parents work for other organisations with some special agreement. Other parents may also send their children, spaces permitting, but must pay tuition. They consist of [[European School of Luxembourg I|European Schools I]] and [[European School, Luxembourg II|II]], and award the [[European Baccalaureate]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Multilingualism==
{{See also|Multilingualism in Luxembourg}}

Tri-lingualism is a feature of the state education system, and of Luxembourgish society in general.

From pre-school onwards, Luxembourgish is spoken with the children. For the large number of foreign children in the country, this may be their first exposure to Luxembourgish. From the age of 6, children are taught to read and write German.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/luxembourg-glance/population-languages/languages/index.html "Languages"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104051131/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/luxembourg-glance/population-languages/languages/index.html |date=2013-11-04 }}. luxembourg.lu. Retrieved on 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The year after, French is introduced, while the vehicular language of teaching is German.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In secondary school, German is the vehicular language in the ''Lycées techniques'', and in the lower years of the ''Lycées classiques''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; From the age of 15, however, French is used in ''Lycées classiques''. English is added as a further obligatory language in all secondary schools. In Lycées classiques, pupils may optionally also choose to take lessons in Latin, Spanish or Italian.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The number of hours per week devoted to language teaching at all levels of school is high, at 50% of teaching time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Similarly, for the University of Luxembourg, one of its defining features is its "multi-lingual character": it uses English, French and German.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
The history of education in Luxembourg is closely linked to that of the Athénée de Luxembourg: in addition to being the oldest, and for a long time the only, secondary school in the country, it was also the home of Luxembourg's fledgling higher education courses for a while. It was founded as the Jesuit College (''Collège des Jésuites'') in Luxembourg city in 1603, and from this it derives its nickname "Kolleisch". When the [[Jesuit order]] was abolished by the Pope in 1773, it became a Royal College, staffed by the [[secular clergy]] instead of Jesuits. The French occupation from 1795 to 1814 put an end to its activities.&lt;ref name="Kolleisch"&gt;[http://www.al.lu/index.php/presentation-generale-al/historique-al "L'Athénée – "de Kolléisch""]. Athénée de Luxembourg. Retrieved on 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Athénée Lux 1828.jpg|thumb|The old building of the Athénée de Luxembourg, 1828]]
An ''École centrale'' was created in its place from 1802, renamed an ''École Secondaire'' in 1805. It became a ''Collège communal'' in 1808, then a "Gymnasium" after [[Napoleon]]'s defeat. It was renamed the ''Athénée Royal'' in 1817. That same year, the ''cours supérieurs'' (called ''cours académiques'' from 1824) were founded: these taught metaphysics, logic, physical sciences and mathematics, and were intended to compensate to an extent for the lack of a university in Luxembourg. Around the 1830s, the time of the [[Belgian Revolution]], a distinction started to be made in the higher school years of the Athénée, between the "gymnasium," for those intending to attend university, and the "middle school" (''école moyenne''), later the industrial and commercial school, for everyone else.&lt;ref name="Kolleisch" /&gt;

===Belgian Revolution===

In 1830, most of Luxembourg (with the exception of the capital) sided with the [[Belgian Revolution]] against the Dutch King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]]. The King-Grand Duke therefore sought to prevent young Luxembourgers from attending Belgian universities, which were hotbeds of anti-Dutch revolutionary sentiment. Belgian academic degrees were no longer recognised in Luxembourg from 1832, and an 1835 decree forced Luxembourgish students to study exclusively in the states of the [[German Confederation]]. This Germanisation policy continued with the Friedemann reform in 1837, which had the goal of turning the [[Athénée de Luxembourg]] into a preparatory school for German universities, and abolished the academic courses that had existed there since 1817, depriving Luxembourg of its embryo of higher education.&lt;ref name="Elz"&gt;Elz, Marco. [http://www.onsstad.lu/uploads/media/ons_stad_92-2009_44-49.pdf "Les débuts de l'enseignement du Luxembourg."] {{fr}} ''Ons Stad'', No. 92, 2009. p. 44-49&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

When the country became independent in 1839 (while remaining under personal union with the Dutch king), it needed its own administrative and political institutions: one major problem was the education of future elites, who would replace the foreign functionaries and play a key role in society. William I's measures of 1835 and 1837 had oriented the education system towards Germany, but the specific geographical nature of the country also required links with French-speaking countries. The professors of the Athénée demanded a reform of secondary education and the re-establishment of the academic courses.&lt;ref name=Elz /&gt;{{rp|44}}

William II came to the throne in 1840, ending his father's policies of reaction and Germanisation. The Constitution of 1841 allowed a free choice of universities, and laid the foundation for an education policy that took account of the specificities of the country. The coming reform was supported by the liberals, but opposed by the advocates of the Friedemann reform. While it was generally agreed that establishing a fully-fledged university in the Grand-Duchy was not viable, the question of how to organise higher education was a divisive one. As in other areas, the Luxembourgers examined the neighbouring countries's systems to determine the best course to follow. The clerical faction was in support of the German system, while the Belgian model had liberal support. This latter system entrusted university examinations to a jury of professors as well as learned and reputable men drawn from different parts of society, and this was the system eventually chosen by Luxembourg. It was clear that, far from just being a demonstration of academic knowledge, degrees were seen as a test of one's ability to exercise public office, and therefore it was only fitting that they should be brought under tight state control. For the government, academic examinations were a matter of national sovereignty, which could not be entrusted to foreign universities. Automatically recognising foreign diplomas was out of the question.&lt;ref name=Elz /&gt;

The authorities decided, as a minimum, to re-establish the ''cours supérieurs'' at the Athénée, which were, however, just a pale imitation of higher education. The Luxembourgish state thereby gave itself the prerogative to confer academic degrees.&lt;ref name=Elz /&gt;

===Organic law of 1848===
The system of academic degrees and the ''cours supérieurs'' was organised in the organic law of 23 July 1848: the Athénée would provide ''cours supérieurs'', preparing for the degree of ''candidat'' (obtainable after only one year) in physical sciences and mathematics on the one hand, and in philosophy and letters on the other. Degrees were to be awarded by examination juries in Luxembourg. Qualifications obtained elsewhere were not recognised in the Grand Duchy. The law did, however, oblige students to take courses at foreign universities, the contents of which would be tested by Luxembourgish juries. The law of 1848 was continually adapted over the next half-century. These changes, accompanied by passionate debates, concerned the subject matter to be examined, the creation of new degrees for certain professions, and an adaptation to the realities of university education: there were cases where the state prescribed the attendance of courses that were no longer offered anywhere.&lt;ref name=Elz /&gt; From 1882, the need to reform secondary education set off an argument over the nature, and indeed the purpose, of the ''cours supérieurs''. The [[Council of State of Luxembourg|Council of State]] was against abolishing them, as this would entail a reform of the law on academic awards. The debate was to flare up again in the early 20th century, but national sentiment prevailed: abandoning the ''cours supérieurs'', and the end of awarding degrees, would mean abandoning a part of the Luxembourgish nation's independence.&lt;ref name=Elz /&gt;{{rp|45}}

===Cours supérieurs and examination juries===
Those graduating from the last year of gymnasium in the Athénée mostly went on to attend the ''cours supérieurs''. The familiar atmosphere and the money saved were the reasons behind this, as well as the fact that these professors would be on the examination juries. Until 1884, the letters section was predominant, attended by students preparing for law, philology or theology. Towards the end of the century, interest in the science section increased, with young adults devoting themselves to the hard sciences, pharmaceutics, and industrial studies.&lt;ref name="Elz" /&gt;

====Criticism====
The controversy over the ''cours supérieurs'' was partly due to their confusing nature. Accessible after an entrance exam, they took place in the building of the Athénée, a secondary school, and led to the award of certain degrees. But it was unclear whether these were an extension of secondary education, or the early stage of higher education. Even legislators and legal experts of the day had no definitive answer. They were described in 1882 by the Athénée's director as a "hybrid institution" between secondary and tertiary education; twenty years later, the jury for pharmacy termed them a "mockery, a caricature of university courses."&lt;ref name="Elz" /&gt;{{rp|46}} The courses' practical organisation was partly to blame. After 1848, the Athénée consisted of three establishments: the ''cours supérieurs'', the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], and the industrial school. But this was only a nominal division: the science section of the ''cours supérieurs'', for example, often consisted of lessons combined with the two highest years of the industrial school. There was barely a consensus on whether there was one or two ''cours supérieurs''. The Chamber of Deputies debated this in 1892, and decided in the end that there was one set of ''cours supérieurs'': the letters section of the ''cours supérieurs'' was taught by professors of the gymnasium, the science section by those of the industrial school. While many refused to admit it, these courses hardly fulfilled the requirements of university studies.&lt;ref name="Elz" /&gt;

The professors' training was not necessarily of a higher standard. The degree of ''candidat'' was sufficient to teach until 1857, when a doctorate became a requirement for many teaching posts, and demanded by law from 1874. The professors' pay, on the other hand, did not increase. No special compensation was offered for those teaching ''cours supérieurs''.&lt;ref name="Elz" /&gt;

The failure rates in the exams by the Luxembourgish juries was relatively low in the beginning, but increased steadily to reach 50% in 1901-1902. Results did not improve over the next few years. Some contemporaries saw this as a result of inherent flaws in the Luxembourgish system: the exams did not take into account the subject matter taught in the universities, and the examiners themselves were not up to speed with the latest research. The composition of the exam juries was problematic: without a university, the country did not have enough qualified teachers of an academic calibre. Their qualifications were questioned: a letter written to the ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]'' claimed that most examiners would not be able to pass their own exams. The problem was most serious for the subjects not taught in the ''cours supérieurs'', such as law, medecine, the profession of notary, pharmacy, and veterinary studies. To resolve this issue, professional persons were appointed to juries: high-ranking state functionaries, practising doctors, and notables.&lt;ref name="Elz" /&gt;

===Reform around the turn of the 20th century===
The period both before and after the turn of the 20th century saw education reform. In the late 19th century, the political class became aware that the traditional system of education was not well-adapted to the needs of an industrial society. Economic developments had created new social and professional classes. A middle class of employees and civil servants emerged from the growth of state services and administration. Artisanship and trade were transformed by industrial and commercial progress.

The government of Baron [[Félix de Blochausen]] (1874-1885) enacted a decisive reform of primary education when it introduced obligatory schooling over the opposition of conservative deputies. School absenteeism was particularly widespread in rural areas, where the children helped on the fields. The "loi Kirpach" of 10 April 1881 (named after Henri Kirpach, the Director-General for the Interior) made school attendance mandatory between the ages of 6 and 12.&lt;ref name="Thewes"&gt;Thewes, Guy. "Le gouvernement de Blochausen", "Le gouvernement Werner/Cravatte", "Le gouvernement Werner-Schaus II", "Le gouvernement Werner-Thorn-Flesch", "Le gouvernement Juncker-Polfer", "Le gouvernement Juncker-Asselborn I". In: Ibid., ''[http://www.gouvernement.lu/1828371/Gouvernements_depuis_1848-version_2011.pdf Les gouvernements du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg depuis 1848]''. Service Information et Presse, 2011. pp. 42-47, 52-63, 160-171, 172-181, 192-203, 232-241, 242-255&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} This reform provoked bitter debates over the role of the state in society and the relations between church and state. The law also provided for a single system of public schools, and made it the state's duty to organise education. At the same time, however, the church remained involved, since the local parish priest was an ''ex officio'' member of the local commune's school commission, and the schoolteacher was under his supervision.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt;{{rp|44–45}}

Through a far-reaching reform of the education system, the government of [[Paul Eyschen]] (1888-1915) attempted to respond to the changes in society. Eyschen was an advocate of the idea of specialisation of schools: the Athénée de Luxembourg for those intending to later pursue university studies, an industrial school for those destined for a technical occupation, an agriculture school for farmers' sons, and a craftwork school for the sons of craftsmen. Particular attention was given to vocational education.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt;

The law of 1892 split off the industrial and commercial school from the Athénée and added to it a commercial section. In 1908, it moved to [[Limpertsberg]], to later become the Lycée des Garçons de Luxembourg. The law of 1896 created an artisanal school. These efforts were accompanied by an increase in students attending secondary school under the Eyschen government: 875 in 1879-1880 compared to 2500 in 1919-1920.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt; In 1891, the ''Soeurs de la Doctrine Chrétienne'' had responded to the government's invitation by opening a domestic agricultural school for young girls.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Echternach and Diekirch had each received a so-called "pro-gymnasium", which operated under the supervision of the headteacher of the Athénée. Later, these too became autonomous institutions, and the Athénée lost its tight grip on secondary and higher education in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name="Kolleisch" /&gt;

Eyschen's government also tackled primary education through the [[Education Law of 1912]]. This abolished school fees, and made school mandatory for 7 years. Most controversially, it rolled back the Church's position in schools: teachers no longer needed a certificate of morality from their priest to be employed, and were no longer obliged to teach religious education. The law of 1912 was the subject of bitter arguments between the [[Left Bloc (Luxembourg)|Left Bloc]] (socialists and liberals) and the clerical Right.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt;

While in the rest of Europe, universities were opening their doors to women, Luxembourg was a late-comer in this regard. The establishment of two ''Lycées'' for young girls in 1909 and 1911 revealed the government's preoccupation with denying girls access to the Latin section, which granted sole access to universities. It was not until after the [[First World War]], when they received the right to vote, that the first women attended exams for academic awards.&lt;ref name="Elz" /&gt;{{rp|46–47}}

===Religious influence===
The state and the middle-class liberals who ran the government steadfastly refused to allow the opening of non-state schools, as demanded by the Church. At the same time, they allowed the clergy a lot of influence in teaching. The liberal Deputy [[Robert Brasseur]] complained of a "clericalisation of education". Around 20% of the secondary school professors were clerics, and this did not include the lay members of the Jesuits (''Jésuites en courte robe'') alleged by Brasseur. Students in the ''cours supérieurs'' were obliged to participate in religious processions, and to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[Confession (religion)|confession]] every Sunday and Thursday. Some criticised the philosophy lessons, firmly in the hands of the philosopher-preachers, as being a "theology course in disguise." In 1903 the Athénée's director tried to forbid students from attending a conference on the subject of the formation of the world, given by a Brussels professor. To some, it appeared that maintaining the ''cours supérieurs'' was a means of keeping a check on the students' ideology, whereas those who studied abroad might pick up foreign, radical ideas.&lt;ref name="Elz" /&gt;

====Catholic university====
Until 1881, the Church still had plans for establishing a [[Catholic university]] in Luxembourg. In 1867, the General Assembly of Catholic Associations in Germany was looking for a location for a new free Catholic university—that is to say, one run by the Church. Luxembourgish priests campaigned for this to be in Luxembourg, emphasing the benefits this would bring to the country, and the government pledged its help, but the Chamber of Deputies was opposed. In any case, the new university was established in Fribourg in Switzerland instead. In 1881, Luxembourgish priests attempted to establish a university run by the Jesuits, who had been expelled from France. Neighbouring countries, however, were against the Jesuits setting up in the Grand Duchy, and the project was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Elz" /&gt;

===1968 reforms===
The [[Werner-Cravatte government]] (1964-1969) once again saw an urgent need to reform the education system, due to economic and social changes. The government attempted to respond by diversifying the types of Lycées in existence. 1965 saw the creation of middle schools (''écoles moyennes''): these were intended to cater to young people not quite suited for a university education, in order to prepare them for mid-level careers in the administration or the private sector, and to take the weight off the over-crowded Lycées. May 1968 also saw unrest in Luxembourg: the students of the ''cours supérieurs'' went on strike, demanding a reform of higher education and the awarding of academic degrees.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt; The Werner-Cravatte government drafted a law which would not, however, come to a vote until the next government was in office.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt; The Werner-Cravatte Ministry did introduce changes in the secondary education system: it aligned girls' education—previously in separate Lycées—with that of boys, and introduced co-education. Secondary education (as opposed to technical secondary education) was unified: two streams could be chosen, "classical" with Latin, and "modern", without Latin. For the upper school years, four sections were introduced.&lt;ref name="Kolleisch" /&gt;

It was under the [[second Werner-Schaus ministry]] that the system of academic awards dating back to 1848 was finally abolished, fulfilling the demands of the 1968 students. The law of 18 June 1969 stipulated that instead, degrees from other countries would be certified in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt;

===Current system===
In 1970, the ''cours supérieurs'' were integrated into the new "Centre universitaire de Luxembourg".

The [[Werner-Flesch government]] (1980-1984) introduced a move that harmonised public and private secondary schools: the law of 31 May 1982 provided for state subsidies for private schools, in return for allowing the state to supervise their curricula and their teachers' qualifications.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt;{{Rp|202}}

The initial idea of creating a Luxembourgish university was raised in a debate in the Chamber in 1993. In 2000, the government introduced a white paper on the matter. The law creating a University of Luxembourg was approved by the Chamber on 17 July 2003.

The [[Juncker-Polfer government]] also introduced further changes in secondary education. Tests conducted for the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) ranked Luxembourgish students 30th out of 32 countries. The government therefore launched a "back to basics" programme.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt;{{rp|239}} The conservative-socialist government from 2004 to 2009 also set up several new schools outside of the mainstream system, with innovative teaching methods: the "Neie Lycée" (now "Lycée Ermesinde"), "Eis Schoul", the "École de la 2e chance," and the Deutsch-Luxemburgisches Schengen-Lyzeum Perl.&lt;ref name="Thewes" /&gt;{{rp|251}}

'''Educational music,'''  is a genre of music in which songs, lyrics, or other musical elements are used as a method of teaching and/or learning. It has been shown in research to promote learning.{{ref|songsforteaching}}{{ref|SmartSongs}} Additionally, music study in general has been shown to improve academic performance of students.{{ref|Standley2008}}{{ref|musichelps1}}{{ref|musichelps2}} &lt;br /&gt; 

Music used for learning can be in many formats, including video recordings, audio recordings, [[sheet music]], and [[improvised music]]. Most of the time, music is added to an existing lesson plan or story. Songs are usually easy to sing and catchy, so that they can be repeated for later learning. Some [[children's music]] is considered Educational, and, historically, most educational music is geared towards children. Prominent examples include songs from [[LazyTown]], ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', [[Smart Songs]]' educational rap videos on YouTube, and [[Tom Lehrer]]'s songs for the [[PBS]] show ''[[The Electric Company]]''.

Recent developments have extended music's use to secondary and collegiate education, with [[Cornel West]] breaking new ground in this regard.{{ref|Cornish2001}}

== Forms ==
=== Video ===
Video recordings are the most use of educational music. Television shows, DVDs, and even some movies use music to teach the viewer, whether it be a moral lesson or a scholastic lesson. [[Sesame Street]] and [[Schoolhouse Rock]] are examples of shows that use music to teach topics like math, science, and government. Things like counting, the names of the planets, or the law making process are put to music with simple lyrics to aid in retention of information.

Shows such as [[Little Einsteins]] use music as a story aid to teach decision-making and music recognition. [[Instrumental music]] represents different objects, people, animals, or actions to help the viewer distinguish between various options.

Shows such as [[Veggie Tales]] use a story as well as music to teach biblical and moral lessons to its viewers. This form uses songs  to tie the story together and help the viewer remember important aspects of the story.

=== Audio ===
Audio music recordings are also used prominently as a form of education. The website Songs for Teaching&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songsforteaching.com/ songsforteaching.com]&lt;/ref&gt; has many songs for teachers to use to help kids learn. Baby Genius is a very popular company that produces educational music CDs for children. 
The European Union funded an education project to encourage early language learning called Lullabies of Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://lullabies-of-europe.org/ lullabies-of-europe.org]&lt;/ref&gt; that gathered and recorded lullabies in 7 European languages. Some Television shows and DVD series also make Audio recordings of their songs to further learning. 
*'''Sheet Music''' is sometimes used to aid in teaching when a song is new and the student can read music. Sheet music is usually used in conjunction with a CD or instrumentation.

=== Improvised ===
Improvisation is used in educational music in a few settings. Teachers might make up a song for times tables and teach it to the students, perhaps having students add parts. Some people also make up songs to remember things or to study for a test.

=== Hip hop ===
[[Hip-hop]] demonstrates increasing relevance and success as a pedagogical tool in primary and secondary education.  [[Flocabulary]] and Defined Mind,{{ref|Monitor}} focusing primarily on vocabulary building for [[SAT]] and [[ACT_(examination)]] tests, have established a Web presence in addition to their textbooks.  [[Smart Songs]],{{ref|Providence}} concentrating on middle school, offers amusing and pertinent music video. [[Rhythm, Rhyme, Results]] uses [[hip hop]] music to help students learn lessons ranging from economics to photosynthesis.{{ref|phoenix}} MC SKULE (Rohen Shah) of the non-profit SKULE.org makes parody music videos of popular songs where the lyrics teach math.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/section/news/daily-educational-rap-video-encourages-students-enjoy-math|title=On the Daily: Educational rapper gives math a new beat|work=The Michigan Daily|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Kajitani]], the 2009 California State Teacher of the Year, created original middle school math songs as the Rappin' Mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nnstoy.org/stoy/alex-kajitani/|title=Alex Kajitani, California State Teacher of the Year 2009 - National Network of State Teachers of the Year|work=National Network of State Teachers of the Year|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs that integrate music with education ==
=== Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA)===
Some schools integrate music with other subjects in the hope that the music and the other subjects enhance each other. With this mutual growth, educators hope to improve the overall quality and experiences of education.

One program that integrates music in education is the Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA) program, which is done through the [[Kennedy Center]]. CETA is a partnership between the Kennedy Center and eight arts focus schools in the [[Washington D.C.]] area. They work together to produce staff that can integrate the arts across the curriculum. CETA aims to integrate music and other arts, such as dance and visual arts, into other scholastic areas, such as math and science "...to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.”{{ref|CETA}}

The objectives of CETA are to:
# Develop the knowledge, skills, and beliefs in the arts among individual teachers so they can integrate the arts across the curriculum to enhance student learning 
# Purposefully network these individuals in their own schools and with teachers in participating schools to develop their understanding and confidence in integrating the arts across the curriculum 
# Provide an extensive system of internal and external support and resources to the teachers, schools, and the network
# Share knowledge and experiences with other educators and arts organizations both locally and nationally{{ref|CETA}}

=== Arts Horizons ===
Arts Horizons is an arts in education organization that serves schools in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. They integrate music, as well as other arts, into learning to help children gain appreciation for the arts as well as stimulate children “through the arts to improve their proficiency in reading, writing and math.”{{ref|ArtsHorizons}}

Arts Horizons has a variety of programs, including:
* Interactive live performances by professional artists from Broadway, Lincoln Center and around the world 
* Artist in residence programs, custom-designed for your school, that make connections between the arts and the classroom curriculum 
* Three	Professional development inspires teachers to introduce innovative, creative approaches in the classroom and implement state learning standards.{{ref|ArtsHorizons}}

An example of an assembly provided by Arts Horizons is the Peter and the Wolf program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artshorizons.org/programs/images/wolf.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725014759/http://artshorizons.org/programs/images/wolf.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, an actor tells the tale of Peter and the Wolf while a woodwind quintet plays the music of Prokofiev to bring the story to life. After the story, students have a chance to learn about the woodwind instruments that were used in the story, as well as other woodwind instruments, and hear other folk tales.{{ref|ArtsHorizons}}

== Effects of music on education ==
CETA has concrete evidence on the following:
* Rising student test scores on the state exams.  For example, Fort Hunt Elementary progressed from “not being accredited” to being “provisionally accredited” to being “fully accredited” within the course of three years.  
* Fewer student disciplinary referrals to the office.
* Higher attendance rates.
* Anecdotes by teachers about student learning in the arts and other subject areas.{{ref|CETA}}

There have been many studies on the use of music to aid in teaching, as well as how an individual who plays music fares in their education. Results show that using music when teaching children to read, for example, can help children learn how to read and give lasting results.{{ref|Standley2008}} A study on elementary students even showed that students with music training have overall better verbal memory, compared to the memory of those students of the same demographic without music training.{{ref|Chan2003}}

[[File:Erasmus Smith 1611-1691 by John Michael Wright.jpg|thumb|Erasmus Smith, attributed to the circle of [[John Michael Wright]]|alt=Portrait of a man in 17th-century clothing]]
'''Erasmus Smith''' (1611&amp;nbsp;– 1691) was an English merchant and a landowner with possessions in England and Ireland. Having acquired significant wealth through trade and land transactions, he became a [[philanthropist]] in the sphere of education, treading a path between idealism and self-interest during a period of political and religious turbulence. His true motivations remain unclear.

Smith's family owned [[manor]]s in [[Leicestershire]] and held [[Protestant]] beliefs. He became a merchant, supplying provisions to the armies of the [[Puritan]] [[Oliver Cromwell]]&amp;nbsp;– during Cromwell's [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|suppression of rebellion in Ireland]]&amp;nbsp;— and an [[alderman]] of the [[City of London]]. His financial and landowning status was greatly enhanced by benefiting from his father's subscription to the [[Adventurers' Act]] from which he gained extensive landholdings in Ireland as a reward, and from his own speculative practice of buying additional subscriptions from other investors. 

During the period of [[Commonwealth of England|Cromwell's rule]] and the subsequent [[The Restoration|Restoration]], Smith manoeuvred to protect his position and to further his essentially [[Puritan]] religious stance, which he modified to suit the religious sensibilities of the new Royalist regime. He achieved this in part by creating an eponymous [[trust law|trust]] whereby some of his Irish property was used for the purpose of financing the education of children and provided [[scholarship]]s for the most promising of those to continue their studies at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily to protect his interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law.

==Background==
[[File:St Michael and All Angels, Edmondthorpe, Leics - Monument - geograph.org.uk - 385086.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Sir Roger Smith at the church of St Michael and All Angels, [[Edmondthorpe]]. The figures to either side are his two sons, and the two figures reclining with him are his two wives.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=16|ps=}}|alt=Photograph of a tomb]]

Erasmus Smith was born in 1611 and baptised on 8 April of that year at [[Husbands Bosworth]], Leicestershire. He was the second son of Roger Smith and his second wife, Anna (née Goodman). The family had changed their name to Smith from Heriz (or Harris) when they inherited the manor of [[Edmondthorpe]] during the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and it was Erasmus's paternal grandfather, also called Erasmus, who had bought the manor of Husbands Bosworth in 1565.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=13|ps=}}{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}} [[Henry Smith (preacher)|Henry "Silver-tongued" Smith]], the [[Puritan]] preacher, was an uncle of Erasmus, and his maternal grandfather, Thomas Goodman, was a wealthy London merchant.{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}}

The contacts of Thomas Goodman enabled Erasmus to serve a seven-year [[apprenticeship]] in London with a poultry merchant, John Saunders, and he was made a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] of the [[Grocers' Company]] on 10 February 1635.{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}} By 1631 Roger Smith had become an alderman of the City of London and in 1635 he was knighted; Erasmus followed in his father's footsteps, being elected an alderman in 1657,{{sfnp|Beavan|1908|ps=}}{{efn|Smith was elected alderman for the [[Billingsgate]] ward of the City of London.{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}}}} but preferred to pay a fine of £420 in order to be released from the duties of office. In these early years he was also unwilling to have much involvement in the business of the Grocers' Company, although this changed later in life: the cause of his initial reluctance may have been his preference to concentrate on acquiring his wealth.{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}} According to the records of the Aldermen of the City of London, Erasmus was [[Irish House of Commons|Member of Parliament]] for [[Ardee (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Ardee]] in [[County Louth]] between 1665 and 1666.{{sfnp|Beavan|1908|ps=}}{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|pp=13, 22–23|ps=}}

==Acquisition of lands in Ireland==
In July 1642 Roger Smith subscribed £225 under the terms of the Adventurers' Act of 1641, whereby money loaned to the government of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] for the purpose of suppressing the Irish rebellion was secured by lands to be confiscated in that country. The lands had been confiscated in law but it would require the overthrow of the rebels in order to realise those property assets. The subsequent Doubling Ordinance of 1643 allowed those who had subscribed to receive twice the amount of land if they added a further 25 per cent of their initial financial aid: Roger Smith accepted those terms, contributing a further £75 in July 1643 and then two more payments of £75 in August and in October of that year.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=15|ps=}}{{efn|Another amendment caused the land grants to be made in [[Irish acre]]s rather than [[Acre|statute acre]]s, which boosted the area of land eventually obtained by 62%.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=15|ps=}} {{convert|1.000|Irish acre|acre}}.}}

Erasmus Smith had become a "Turkey merchant".{{efn|The phrase ''[[Levant Company|Turkey merchant]]'' is used by the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' and by Michael Quane, the historian, among others.{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}}{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}} There is some ambiguity regarding its meaning. Given his apprenticeship in the poultry business, it may refer to trade in [[domesticated turkey|the bird]] but according to Trinity College, Dublin it refers to trade with [[Turkey|the country]] of that name.{{sfnp|Trinity College|2006|ps=}} Wallace is silent on the issue, referring to Smith simply as a "merchant".{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=15|ps=}} &lt;!--note that Wikipedia has a redirect for "[[Turkey Merchant]]; it most likely refers to trade with the country--&gt;}} He was a Protestant and, like his father, by 1650 he was supplying foodstuffs{{efn|The precise foodstuffs supplied is uncertain. For example, Champion refers to "cheese, oats and flour",{{sfnp|Champion|2002|ps=}} Wallace says wheat, rye and oatmeal,{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=15|ps=}} and the 1897 edition of the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' states oatmeal, wheat and cheese.{{sfnp|Gordon|1897|ps=}}}} to Oliver Cromwell's armies in the civil wars of that time. This applied in particular to military activities in Ireland, where the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|rebellion of 1641]] was believed by him and others to have resulted in part from a failure of education in that country.{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}}{{sfnp|Trinity College|2006|ps=}}{{sfnp|Champion|2002|ps=}}

W. J. R. Wallace, in his history of Smith and the eponymous Trust, notes that the first record of Erasmus being in Ireland is from 1648 and that {{quote|Erasmus was clearly a businessman first and foremost; any attempt to put him into a political stereotype as a Roundhead and then accuse him of political double-dealing seems inaccurate.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=17|ps=}}}}

By the time that the rebellion was suppressed in 1653, and just prior to the first assignments of land under the terms of the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Settlement of Ireland Act, 1652]], Roger had registered the transfer of his investment to Erasmus.{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}}{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=15|ps=}}{{efn|Historian Michael Quane dismisses earlier claims that Erasmus Smith had personal experience of military service and that he was one of the original Adventurers. He does, however, claim that the transfer of entitlements from Roger to his son took place in 1643.{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}}}} Erasmus had speculated by buying out the interests of other subscribers, who had tired of the delay in seeing a reward from their investment; and he was also entitled to further land grants in payment for his supplies to the army. What began as a grant of {{convert|666|acres|ha}} eventually became&amp;nbsp;— by the 1680s, after various wranglings and adjustments&amp;nbsp;— over {{convert|46,000|acres|ha}} situated in nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]],{{sfnp|Gordon|1897|ps=}} and Erasmus had an estimated worth of £120,000.{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}}{{sfnp|Trinity College|2006|ps=}}{{sfnp|Champion|2002|ps=}}{{efn|The varied location of the lands was in part a consequence of allocations being made by the drawing of [[Sortition|lots]]; the final determination took some years because of various legal challenges, including from people who had been dispossessed.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=17-19|ps=}} By 1669 he had possession of over {{convert|37,000|acres|ha}}.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=27|ps=}} In addition to the £375 of debentures given by his father, he had spent £13,082. Many soldiers were entitled to land but, because they were poor and illiterate, it was possible to buy up interests for as little as 20 per cent of face value.{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}} Although Robert Smith had spent £450 on the debentures, only £375 were transferred because one receipt for £75 was mislaid.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=15|ps=}}}} Some of these lands, notably those in [[Connacht|Connaught]], may have been obtained fraudulently by Erasmus, who together with his nephew [[Edward Smith (judge)|Edward Smith]], sat on the committee based at Grocers' Hall whose purpose was the allocation of lots for the distribution of land between the [[debenture]] holders. Edward Smith was subsequently appointed to a Court of Claims in [[Dublin]], where he may also have favoured his uncle Erasmus in his applications for land.{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}}

==Philanthropy==
===Ireland===
Although Smith visited [[Dublin]] while overseeing his land purchases,{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}} he had no desire actually to live in Ireland. In 1655&amp;nbsp;– the year that his father died&amp;nbsp;– he proposed that some of the profits from his Irish lands should be used to support five Protestant schools for boys. A Trust was established for this purpose in 1657, in relation to which Smith and the Grocers' Company had various powers of oversight. There were 18 trustees, the principal of whom was [[Henry Jones (bishop)|Henry Jones]], who was soon to become Protestant [[Bishop of Meath]].{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}}{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}}{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=19|ps=}} There have been various suggestions since at least the 19th century that creating the trust may not have been an altruistic act but rather one intended to curry favour and counter any possible legal challenges to holdings over which he had a tenuous claim, such as those obtained in Connaught.{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}} Writing in 1824, Hely Dutton said in his ''Statistical Survey of County Galway'' that {{quote|Well knowing that his titles and tenures were very precarious, and liable at a future period to be litigated, he very cunningly made a grant of lands for the founding and endowment of Protestant schools, and other charitable purposes, for which he [later, in 1669] obtained a Charter&amp;nbsp;... appointing the bench of bishops, the lord chancellor, the judges, the great law officers, all for the time being, governors and trustees; well knowing that if any flaw should ever appear in the patents, titles or tenures, under which he got the estates, the law officers would always protect and make the title good to his heirs.{{sfnp|Quane|1964|ps=}}}}

The Trust initially encompassed {{convert|3381|acres|ha}} of his land. In keeping with his religious views, the schools were to teach their pupils "fear of God and good literature and to speak the English tongue", and both prayers and [[catechism]] (in the style of the [[Presbyterian]] [[Assembly of Divines]]) were compulsory. Those pupils who showed particular promise were to have the opportunity of taking up scholarships at Trinity College, Dublin.{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}}{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=19|ps=}}

His plans for the Trust were, however, overtaken by events. Cromwell died in 1658 and Smith's arrangements were not entirely acceptable to the new regime.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=23|ps=}}{{efn|One particular issue was the composition of the board of trustees, which included many people whose religious sentiment was not in accord with the changed environment, especially with the restoration of the [[Church of Ireland]] as the [[Established Church]] in January 1661.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=23|ps=}}}} The [[Restoration (England)|Restoration period]], which began around 1660 and saw Charles II become king, was not sympathetic to the Puritan beliefs of the [[Interregnum (England)|Cromwellian Interregnum]]. Nonetheless, Smith's venture was able to survive the political upheaval and change in moral tone, albeit in modified form. That it did so was largely due to his wealth and connections, but also because the educational purpose for which his lands were being used was clearly beneficial and because he engaged in many lawsuits in order to protect both his own interests and those of family and friends. Referred to by his enemies as "pious Erasmus with the golden purse", Smith came to an arrangement in 1667 which reduced the number of schools to three and required that he give £100 annually to one of Charles's favourite institutes, [[Christ's Hospital]].{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}} The terms stipulated that although the schools were to be for the free education of children of Smith's tenants, they should each provide education on similar terms to a further 20 children from poor families, and that additional children could be schooled at a charge not to exceed two [[shillings]].{{sfn|Ancestry Ireland|ps=}}

[[File:Erasmus Smith (1611–1691), by George White (ca. 1684–1732).jpg|thumb|Erasmus Smith (1611–1691), by George White (ca. 1684–1732), after an earlier [[mezzotint]] picture|alt=Portrait of a man in 17th-century clothing]]

Wallace argues that Smith {{quote|adapted to the different versions of Protestantism which were favoured by successive governments during the Commonwealth and the Restoration. Since these did not involve denial of any of the fundamentals of his faith, the changes were probably not too painful. He retained his sympathy for the Puritan divines of his youth to the end of his life, as witnessed by some of the bequests in his will.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=11|ps=}}}}

A [[Royal Charter]] was granted to the Trust in 1669. This stipulated its name to be ''The Governors of the Schools Founded by Erasmus Smith, Esq.'' and provided for a seal bearing the words "We are faithful to our Trust".{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=28|ps=}} By 1675, the new board of 32 trustees had around £600 per annum available to them from the landholdings; by the first quarter of the 18th century this had risen to £1100. Free schools were established in [[Templemore]], [[Galway]] and [[Drogheda]]. Funding was also given to another school, in Dublin: the recently founded [[King's Hospital School]] benefited from the trust's interest by being provided with twenty scholarships at Trinity College and also apprenticeships. The trust also funded a lectureship in [[Hebrew]] at the College,{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}} and arrangements were in place to that any surplus funds generated were used for purposes such as clothing the poor children in the grammar schools and arranging apprenticeships.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=29|ps=}}

===England===
During his lifetime, the Irish schools were not as successful as Smith had anticipated. He and others attributed this to the resentment shown by Catholics, and there was also resentment from those charged with sending Irish rent money to England's Christ's Hospital.{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}}

The arrangement by which an annual grant was given to Christ's Hospital corresponded with Smith's own interests in that institution. The Hospital had for many years enjoyed close links with various Livery Companies and Smith had become a Governor there in 1658. The aftermath of the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, as a consequence of which the Hospital was destroyed, demonstrated his interest. He wrote that {{quote|Providence sometime after the fire directed me to view the Hospital which with grief I beheld in its ashes. The consideration of the many children that had their habitation there but then scattered abroad, made me resolve to encourage others with myself to raise the foundation.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=30|ps=}}}}

Smith was a benefactor during the period of reconstruction. He became frustrated that, during a time when the Hospital was so clearly in need of financial assistance, the trustees of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=30|ps=}} By the mid-1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him under the terms of the Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital,{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=31|ps=}} and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was [[John Temple (Irish politician)|Sir John Temple]], the [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]], who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of its responsibilities in Ireland under the terms of the Charter.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|pp=34–35|ps=}}

Various parties then engaged in legal actions and in petitions to both Charles II and his successor from 1685, [[James II of England|James II]]. With the added complication of James II being overthrown by [[William III of England|William of Orange]], the dispute remained unresolved at the time of Smith's death.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=37|ps=}}

==Death and legacy==
Smith had married Mary Hare, the 20-year-old daughter of [[Bruce Castle#17th century: the Hare family|Hugh Hare, the 1st Baron Coleraine]], in 1670 when he was 59. The couple had nine children, five of whom were baptised in [[Clerkenwell]], where he had lived at St John's Court for many years.{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}}{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=23|ps=}}

In 1683 he bought the manor of [[Hamerton]], [[Huntingdonshire]], in the parish church of which he was buried, next to his wife, upon his death some time between 25 August and 9 October 1691.{{efn|On 25 August 1691 Smith added a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to his will of 6 May 1690. This very detailed document is discussed by Wallace at some length.{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=38|ps=}}}} He had also bought [[Weald Hall]] in 1685.{{sfnp|Barnard|2004|ps=}}{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=38|ps=}}{{sfnp|Page|Proby|Ladds|1936|pp=66–69|ps=}}

Smith's six sons and three daughters mostly died young. One, Hugh Smith, inherited Weald and Hamerton from his older siblings in 1732 and appointed his two daughters as co-heirs. One of those daughters, Lucy, married into the Stanley family. Her husband changed his surname to become [[James Smith-Stanley, Lord Strange]], and the couple were the parents of [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby]].{{sfnp|Page|Proby|Ladds|1936|pp=66–69|ps=}}{{sfnp|Wallace|2004|p=39|ps=}}

{{as of|2016}}, the Erasmus Smith Trust continues to operate.{{sfnp|High School, Dublin|2016|ps=}}

==Recognition==

'''ISO 27001 Lead Implementer''' is a professional certification for professionals specializing in [[information security management system]]s (ISMS) based on the [[ISO/IEC 27001]] standard. This [[professional certification]] is intended for [[information security]] professionals wanting to understand the steps required to implement the ISO 27001 standard (as opposed to the [[ISO 27001 Lead Auditor]] certification which is intended for an auditor wanting to [[audit]] and [[certify]] a system to the ISO 27001 standard).

This certification is provided by numerous organizations. Some are currently not certified by any personnel certification body while others are certified by accredited certification bodies. Certified ISO 27001 implementation courses should be accredited to the [[ISO/IEC 17024]] standard.

The '''Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore''' was founded by [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman|C. V. Raman]], and was registered as a Society on 24 April 1934. Inaugurated on 31 July 1934, it began with 65 founding fellows. The first general meeting of Fellows, held on the same day, elected Raman as President, and adopted the constitution of the Academy.&lt;ref name="BurmaChakravorty2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D. P. Burma|author2=Maharani Chakravorty|title=From Physiology and Chemistry to Biochemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CaQ3-x3LXMC&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-3220-5|pages=169–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
The aims of the Academy are to:

* Promote progress in pure and applied branches of science.
* Encourage important research in various branches of science.
* Represent the scientific work of India internationally.
* Publish work relating to scientific research initiated by the Academy, Provincial Academies, Universities and Government Scientific Institutions.
* Organise meetings of Committees and Conferences to discuss papers submitted to the Academy.
* Advise Government and other bodies on scientific and other matters referred to the Academy.

== Publications ==
The first issue of the Academy Proceedings appeared in two sections in July 1934. They were split into two in July 1935 - one part devoted to physical sciences and the other to life sciences.&lt;ref name="BurmaChakravorty2011" /&gt; In 1973 the Academy's publications were further split into several journals aimed as specific scientific disciplines.

The Academy publishes a monthly journal called ''Resonance'' since January 1996. Aimed generally at under-graduates, it also contains some material for junior and senior academic levels. Each issue focuses on the life and work of a famous scientist. It incorporates articles reviewing new books and classics. The Editorial Board comprises 40 scientists from across the country.

The Academy also publishes a monthly research journal called ''Sadhana - Academy Proceedings in Engineering Sciences'' since 1978. The journal covers all branches of Engineering Science. Sadhana is distributed in print outside India and online worldwide by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]].

== Project Lifescape ==
Aimed at enriching scientific education, the Academy launched ''Project Lifescape'' in collaboration with the [[Centre for Ecological Sciences]] at the [[Indian Institute of Science]] to spread biodiversity literacy. It aims to involve school and college students in obtaining first hand information on the status of, and ongoing changes in, ecological habitats of a set of species of considerable human significance. An objective of the project is to publish illustrated accounts of 1500 Indian species of micro-organisms, plants and animals. The accounts would also include ancillary information on the distribution, ecology and behaviour of the species.

The project has published three books, ''Butterflies of Peninsular India'', ''Freshwater Fishes of Peninsular India'', and ''Amphibians of Peninsular India''. A fourth, ''Dragonflies and Damselflies of Peninsular India'' is available in electronic format, freely downloadable from the project website.

== The Raman Chair ==
The Government of India instituted the ''Raman Chair'' in 1972 to commemorate the memory of the founder of the Academy. Eminent scientists are invited by the Council of the Academy to occupy the Chair, for periods of between six weeks and six months.

== Other work ==
The Academy sponsors and conducts two week Refresher Courses for selected teachers from across India. It awards annual Summer Fellowships to some of the brightest and talented teachers and students to work with Academy Fellows on research-oriented projects in various research centres across India including IISc, Bangalore. It conducts Lecture Programmes at schools and universities on appropriate research topics.

[[File:IAESTE letter.png|thumb|Letter from [[United Nations]] General Secretary [[Ban Ki-moon]].]]
The '''International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience''' commonly referred to as IAESTE (pronounced i-a-es-te or ai-es-te) is an international organization exchanging students for technical work experience abroad. Students gain relevant technical [[training]] lasting from 4 weeks to 18 months. IAESTE includes committees representing more than 80 countries, with the potential of accepting new countries into the organization every year. At the general conference 2005 held in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], the statute and by-laws of IAESTE a.s.b.l. were established, making IAESTE a registered "associacion sans but lucratif" ([[non-profit organization]]), with the centre in [[Luxembourg]]. The current President is prof. Bernard Baeyens from [[Colombia]]. IAESTE's motto is "Work, Experience, Discover". IAESTE's aims are to connect students with employers in foreign countries, provide university students with technical experience, and culturally enrich students and their host communities.

==History==
IAESTE was founded in 1948 at [[Imperial College]], [[London]]. The Imperial College Vacation Work Committee headed by Mr. James Newby initiated a meeting with national organizations from 10 European countries in a [[Effects of World War II#A New Europe|post war]] effort to promote better understanding between countries and cultures.

Since 1948, the association has grown to include more than 80 countries worldwide and has exchanged in excess of 300,000 students. IAESTE exchanges around 7000 students annually playing an important role in giving technical undergraduates practical work experience and a global perspective.

==Organization structure==

===International organization structure===
The IAESTE Association is a confederation of National Committees representing academic, industrial, and student interests. Coordinating the daily administration of the association is the responsibility of the President. The President is elected for two years and is responsible for the General Conference or the GC as it is called in IAESTE. The GC makes the formal decisions in IAESTE and is composed of one delegate (National Secretary) from each country. The GC meets every year in January and is a forum for discussion.

The Board is an elected body which prepares the work of the General Conference and advises the President. It is composed of four elected members and the President.

The GC is the most important event of IAESTE each year. Here every country brings job offers they have obtained in their own country. Every job is written on a standardized form stating where and when the job is, who is eligible for the job and which qualifications (language, skills, etc.) are required. The jobs are traded during the ''Exchange Sessions''. During these sessions, countries meet and try to get the best possible jobs to bring back home. This is very hectic as countries try to get the best jobs. These jobs either have to fit pre-selected students or are open for applications from students back home.

One other notable event at the GC is the "International Party". At this party, every member country brings a national dish, drinks and clothes.

The international work is funded by member fees based on [[GDP per capita]] and the number of students sent abroad and is paid by the National Committees.

===National organization structure===
The National Committees represent the member countries and are composed of persons representing academic, industrial and student interests.  Every full member of the IAESTE has one vote at the GC. The National Secretary is normally the person with the formal vote, even though the decisions are often made by the whole National Committee.

Each National Committee is responsible for the administration of the exchange in its own country. Membership is given after the establishment of a National Committee in accordance with the statutes of IAESTE, together with a responsible permanent secretariat. The type of secretariat which administers the exchange varies according to each country's national structure, educational system, and funding policies. The essential requirement is that the national secretariat, whatever its organization and status, should have competent permanent staff.

Every country has their own way of organizing the work of IAESTE, but the National Committee can mainly be classified into four categories:
* Student driven - The National Secretary is a student, normally serving for one to two years. Often there is one employed administrative staff for paperwork and keeping contact with other national committees, but the students are making decisions, organizing trainees and even raising funds. Examples are Norway, Denmark, Austria, Slovakia or Croatia (see [[#CEC|CEC]]).
* Academically - The National Secretary is a professor or employed by a university to front IAESTE on the behalf of the university or the country. Usually, they have students to welcome trainees, but students are not involved in the decision-making. Examples are Turkey, Portugal.
* Governmental - An employee of a governmental international work exchange organization is the National Secretary. Usually the organization is responsible for several exchange programs and is quite professional. They also often employ students to welcome incoming students. Examples are Finland, Switzerland and UK.
* Other - Non-profit organizations funded by various sources (students, companies, government) but not affiliated with a single institution. Examples are China, USA.

IAESTE varies a lot from country to country and even within countries there can be a big difference from one city to another. Traineeships also vary a lot: some countries have extended programmes with students employed to help and organize events,&lt;ref&gt;[http://iaeste.no/nyweb/modules/content/index.php?id=78 Example from Norway of the social part of being a trainee]&lt;/ref&gt; while in other places arriving trainees organize events themselves.

==Annual Conference (AC)==
The most important international event that connects IAESTE leaders from all over the world. Next AC will be held by IAESTE Cyprus. It will host the 72nd IAESTE Annual Conference in January 2019 (18 January to 24 January 2019 in Limassol). More information you can find [http://web.cut.ac.cy/iaeste-cy2019/ here].
73rd AC will be held by IAESTE Slovakia in January 2020.

==The IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN)==
The Friends of IAESTE Network (FoIN) was founded 1996 in Denmark as the official Alumni branch of IAESTE, with the goal of helping former IAESTE trainees and members keep in touch.

In 2010, FoIN was re-branded as the IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN) and an Alumni Relations Manager was appointed to oversee all activities. The current holder of this position is Bruce Wicks from the [[United Kingdom]]. In 2011, IAN launched a new, online network which currently has over 10,000 members.

==IAESTE Day==
In 2005, an international IAESTE Day was created, for the purpose of global promotion of the organization as well as the celebration of its aims and goals. Starting with 6 countries, IAESTE Day was celebrated in 28 of its member countries in 2007. IAESTE Day is held on 20 October every year.

==JUMP==
Join Us to Motivate People (JUMP) is the "Motivation and Training Seminar" of IAESTE. JUMP was founded in 1995 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] on the initiative of Martin Klaus, former National Secretary of IAESTE Austria. Martin became co-ordinator of JUMP, later this role was taken over by Adrian Keller from IAESTE Switzerland, and in 2009 by Tomasz (Tomek) Pawliszyn from IAESTE Poland.
JUMP is aimed to young members of IAESTE who want to explore more the organisation and meet other members of IAESTE.

Primarily new members of IAESTE meet in a different European city each year during four days in September or October for training sessions and discussion groups. An important component is cultural exchange with corporate tours, cultural events and tours and social events incorporating local cuisine and customs.  The theme song for the seminar is [[Jump (For My Love)]] by the [[Pointer Sisters]].

Usually 40 - 70 participants take part in the event. Each JUMP is combined of six workshop sessions, led by experienced members, that cover the essence of IAESTE activities:
*Introduction to IAESTE
*Administration
*Company Marketing and Fundraising
*Job-Raising
*Local Committee Management
*Student Marketing and Member-Raising
Additionally all participants visit various information boots on the topics of summer reception, career fairs, career websites, etc. All together combined with IAESTE related games, international evening, sightseeing trip and company presentation to show that IAESTE is much more than the exchange of job offers. One of the other highlights are motivation speeches by invited guests.

==CEC==
The '''Central European Convention''' is a group of several [[IAESTE]] member countries in the specific geographic region. Those are all "student-run" countries, so students are in the decision making positions (contrary to academic or professional-run countries).

Those countries agree to meet twice a year and hold working and discussion groups. At the same time, they get to know the culture of the hosting country.

===Goals===

* Motivation
* Education
* Developing IAESTE
* Improve the situation of student run countries

===History===
The Central European Convention (CEC) was founded in May 1998 in [[Tuheljske Toplice]], [[Croatia]], on the initiative of Thomas Haim, former National Secretary IAESTE AUSTRIA, and Mario Kauzlaric, former National Secretary IAESTE CROATIA. Because of the great success, the CEC is held 2 times a year.

[[File:Iranian Musician Keyvan Saket joke with Motzart music with his instrument Tar.webm|thumb|Keivan Sake jokes with Mozart musci on his tar]]
'''Keivan Saket''' ({{lang-fa|کیوان ساکت}}) (born 1961 in Mashhad) is an Iranian composer and university professor and Tar and [[Setar]] Player, and author of 12 books for Tar and Setar.

== Early life ==

Keivan Saket was born in 1961 to a family in [[Mashhad]]. He began music and painting from childhood with the support of his parents. He was a pupil of painting masters such as Sadegh Pour in drawing, Master Pirasteh in coloration and Master Davvalo in [[watercolor]].

His first music lessons came from his uncle, Manochehr Zamanian, in Children and Teenagers’ Music Workshop founded in Mashhad by National Broadcasting Organization under the management of Morteza Delshab. After a short time Manochehr Zamanian left Mashhad in order to pursue his education. Some time later, his townsman and his uncle’s friend [[Hamid Motabassem]], came to Mashhad and started teaching in the same workshop. He had taught music in Arts Academy of [[Tehran]], and for two successive summers before the Islamic Revolution he continued teaching there. After the Islamic Revolution Motabassem moved to Mashhad and became friends with Saket. After some time he returned to Tehran and then went overseas.

== Career ==

Keivan Saket founded the Vaziri Band in 1996 and performed many works with this band. In 1990 he was invited as a musician and a soloist to Aref band by [[Parviz Meshkatian]]. The result of this cooperation is works like Afshari Morakkab, Ofoqe Mehr, Vatan Man sung by [[Iraj Bastami]], and Magham-e Sabr composed by Master [[Meshkatian]] with Saket's tar and setar solo.

Concerts inside and outside of [[Iran]] were among Saket’s activities. He founded The Big Orchestra of Keivan Saket with more than 60 musicians and singers. The group had many successful concerts in Tehran.

'''Kurt Vonnegut Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɒ|n|ə|ɡ|ə|t}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bookbrowse.com/authors/author_pronunciations/detail/index.cfm/author_number/386/kurt-vonnegut|title=How to pronounce Kurt Vonnegut|website=Bookbrowse.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; November 11, 1922{{spaced ndash}}April 11, 2007) was an American writer. In a career spanning over 50 years, Vonnegut published 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five works of non-fiction. He is most famous for his darkly satirical, best-selling novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969).

Born and raised in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, Vonnegut attended [[Cornell University]] but dropped out in January 1943 and enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) and the [[University of Tennessee]]. He was then deployed to Europe to fight in World War II and was captured by the Germans during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. He was interned in [[Dresden]] and survived the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Allied bombing of the city]] by taking refuge in a meat locker of the slaughterhouse where he was imprisoned. After the war, Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, with whom he had three children. He later adopted his sister's three sons, after she died of cancer and her husband was killed in a train accident.

Vonnegut published his first novel, ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'', in 1952. The novel was reviewed positively but was not commercially successful. In the nearly 20 years that followed, Vonnegut published several novels that were only marginally successful, such as ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' (1963) and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' (1964). Vonnegut's breakthrough was his commercially and critically successful sixth novel, ''Slaughterhouse-Five''. The book's anti-war sentiment resonated with its readers amidst the ongoing [[Vietnam War]] and its reviews were generally positive. After its release, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' went to the top of [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], thrusting Vonnegut into fame. He was invited to give speeches, lectures and [[commencement address]]es around the country and received many awards and honors.

Later in his career, Vonnegut published several autobiographical essays and short-story collections, including ''[[Fates Worse Than Death]]'' (1991), and ''[[A Man Without a Country]]'' (2005). After his death, he was hailed as a morbidly comical commentator on the society in which he lived and as one of the most important contemporary writers. Vonnegut's son [[Mark Vonnegut|Mark]] published a compilation of his father's unpublished compositions, titled ''[[Armageddon in Retrospect]]''. In 2017, [[Seven Stories Press]] published [[Complete Stories (Vonnegut)|''Complete Stories'',]] a collection of Vonnegut's short fiction including 5 previously unpublished stories. ''Complete Stories'' was collected and introduced by Vonnegut friends and scholars Jerome Klinkowitz and [[Dan Wakefield]]. Numerous scholarly works have examined Vonnegut's writing and humor.

== Biography ==

=== Family and early life ===
Kurt Vonnegut Jr. was born on November 11, 1922, in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. He was the youngest of three children of [[Kurt Vonnegut Sr.]] and his wife Edith (born Lieber). His older siblings were [[Bernard Vonnegut|Bernard]] (born 1914) and Alice (born 1917). Vonnegut was descended from German immigrants who settled in the United States in the mid-19th century; his patrilineal great-grandfather, [[Clemens Vonnegut]] of [[Westphalia]], Germany, settled in Indianapolis and founded the [[Vonnegut Hardware Company]]. Kurt's father, and his father before him, [[Bernard Vonnegut I|Bernard]], were architects; the architecture firm under Kurt Sr. designed such buildings as [[Athenæum (Das Deutsche Haus)|Das Deutsche Haus]] (now called "The Athenæum"), the Indiana headquarters of the [[Bell Telephone Company]], and the [[Fletcher Trust Building]].&lt;ref name="BoomhowerFarrell4-5" /&gt; Vonnegut's mother was born into Indianapolis high society, as her family, the Liebers, were among the wealthiest in the city, their fortune derived from ownership of a successful brewery.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=2}}

Although both of Vonnegut's parents were fluent German speakers, the ill feeling toward that country during and after World War I caused the Vonneguts to abandon that culture to show their American patriotism. Thus, they did not teach their youngest son German or introduce him to German literature and tradition, leaving him feeling "ignorant and rootless."&lt;ref name="Sharp1360"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|2006|p=1360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marvin2Farrell3-4"&gt;{{harvnb|Marvin|2002|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut later credited Ida Young, his family's [[African-American]] cook and housekeeper for the first 10 years of his life, for raising him and giving him values. "[She] gave me decent moral instruction and was exceedingly nice to me. So she was as great an influence on me as anybody." Vonnegut described Young as "humane and wise", adding that "the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [his] beliefs" came from her.&lt;ref name="Marvin4"&gt;{{harvnb|Marvin|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial security and social prosperity that the Vonneguts once enjoyed were destroyed in a matter of years. The Liebers's brewery was closed in 1921 after the advent of [[Prohibition in the United States]]. When the [[Great Depression]] hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt Sr.'s architectural firm to become scarce.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1360}} Vonnegut's brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in [[private school]]s, but Vonnegut was placed in a [[state school|public school]], called Public School No. 43, now known as the James Whitcomb Riley School.&lt;ref name="Boomhower"&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not bothered by this,{{efn|In fact, Vonnegut often described himself as a "child of the Great Depression". He also stated the Depression and its effects incited pessimism towards the validity of the [[American Dream]].&lt;ref name="Sumner"&gt;{{harvnb|Sumner|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} but both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a "dreamy artist".&lt;ref name="Sharp1360Marvin2-3"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|2006|p=1360}}; {{harvnb|Marvin|2002|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family's wealth and status, and Vonnegut said she expressed hatred "as corrosive as hydrochloric acid" for her husband.&lt;ref name="Marvin2-3"&gt;{{harvnb|Marvin|2002|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Vonnegut forayed into writing and tried to sell short stories to magazines like ''[[Collier's]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' with no success.&lt;ref name="Sharp1360" /&gt;

=== High school and Cornell ===
[[File:Kurt Vonnegut - High School Yearbook.PNG|thumb|upright|Vonnegut in his 1940 [[Shortridge High School]] yearbook]]
Vonnegut enrolled at [[Shortridge High School]] in Indianapolis in 1936. While there, he played [[clarinet]] in the school band and became a co-editor (along with [[Madelyn Pugh]]) for the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper, ''The Shortridge Echo''. Vonnegut said his tenure with the ''Echo'' allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience he said was "fun and easy".&lt;ref name="BoomhowerFarrell4-5" /&gt; "It just turned out that I could write better than a lot of other people", Vonnegut observed. "Each person has something he can do easily and can't imagine why everybody else has so much trouble doing it."&lt;ref name="Boomhower" /&gt;

After graduating from Shortridge in 1940, Vonnegut enrolled at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]]. He wanted to study the [[humanities]] or become an architect like his father, but his father{{efn|Kurt Sr. was embittered by his lack of work as an architect during the Great Depression, and feared a similar fate for his son. He dismissed his son's desired areas of study as "junk jewellery", and persuaded his son against following in his footsteps.&lt;ref name="Farrell5Boomhower" /&gt;}} and brother, a scientist, urged him to study a "useful" discipline.&lt;ref name="BoomhowerFarrell4-5"&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Vonnegut majored in [[biochemistry]], but he had little proficiency in the area and was indifferent towards his studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sumner|2014}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his father had been a member at [[MIT]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut was entitled to join the [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity, and did.&lt;ref name="Lowery2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowery|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He overcame stiff competition for a place at the university's independent newspaper, ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'', first serving as a [[staff writer]], then as an editor.&lt;ref name="Farrell5"&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his freshman year, he was writing a column titled "Innocents Abroad" which reused jokes from other publications. He later penned a piece, "Well All Right", focusing on [[pacifism]], a cause he strongly supported,&lt;ref name="Boomhower" /&gt; arguing against U.S. intervention in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Kurt-Vonnegut-US-Army-portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Vonnegut in [[Uniforms of the United States Army|U.S. Army uniform]] between 1943 and 1945]]
The [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] brought the U.S. into the war. Vonnegut was a member of [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]], but poor grades and a satirical article in Cornell's newspaper cost him his place there. He was placed on [[academic probation]] in May 1942 and dropped out the following January. No longer eligible for a [[student deferment]], he faced likely [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] into the [[United States Army]]. Instead of waiting to be drafted, he enlisted in the army and in March 1943 reported to [[Fort Bragg]], North Carolina, for basic training.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut was trained to fire and maintain [[howitzer]]s and later received instruction in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of Tennessee]] as part of the [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP).&lt;ref name="Farrell5Boomhower"&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1944, the ASTP was canceled due to the Army's need for soldiers to support [[Operation Overlord|the D-Day invasion]], and Vonnegut was ordered to an infantry battalion at [[Camp Atterbury]], south of Indianapolis in [[Edinburgh, Indiana]], where he trained as a scout.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived so close to his home that he was "able to sleep in [his] own bedroom and use the family car on weekends".{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=6}} On May 14, 1944, Vonnegut returned home on leave for [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]] weekend to discover that his mother had committed suicide the previous night by [[drug overdose|overdosing on sleeping pills]].&lt;ref name="Farrell6"&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Marvin|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible factors that contributed to Edith Vonnegut's suicide include the family's loss of wealth and status, Vonnegut's forthcoming deployment overseas, and her own lack of success as a writer. She was [[drunk|inebriated]] at the time and under the influence of prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="Farrell6" /&gt;

Three months after his mother's suicide, Vonnegut was sent to Europe as an intelligence scout with the [[106th Infantry Division (United States)|106th Infantry Division]]. In December 1944, he fought in the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the final German offensive of the war.&lt;ref name="Farrell6" /&gt; During the battle, the 106th Infantry Division, which had only recently reached the front and was assigned to a "quiet" sector due to its inexperience, was overrun by advancing German armored forces. Over 500 members of the division were killed and over 6,000 were captured.

On December 22, Vonnegut was captured with about 50 other American soldiers.&lt;ref name="Sharp1363Farrell6"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|2006|p=1363}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut was taken by [[boxcar]] to a prison camp south of [[Dresden]], in [[Saxony]]. During the journey, the Royal Air Force bombed the prisoner trains and killed about 150 men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Vonnegut|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut was sent to Dresden, the "first fancy city [he had] ever seen". He lived in a slaughterhouse when he got to the city, and worked in a factory that made [[malt syrup]] for pregnant women. Vonnegut recalled the sirens going off whenever another city was bombed. The Germans did not expect Dresden to get bombed, Vonnegut said. "There were very few air-raid shelters in town and no war industries, just cigarette factories, hospitals, clarinet factories."&lt;ref name="TheParisReview"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayman|Michaelis|Plimpton|Rhodes|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z0309-310, Zerstörtes Dresden.jpg|thumb|right|Dresden, 1945; over ninety percent of the city's center was destroyed.]]
On February 13, 1945, Dresden became the target of [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]]. In the hours and days that followed, the Allies engaged in a fierce [[bombing of Dresden|firebombing of the city]].&lt;ref name="Farrell6" /&gt; The offensive subsided on February 15, with around 25,000 civilians killed in the bombing. Vonnegut marveled at the level of both the destruction in Dresden and the secrecy that attended it. He had survived by taking refuge in a meat locker three stories underground.&lt;ref name="Boomhower" /&gt; "It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around", Vonnegut said. "When we came up the city was gone&amp;nbsp;... They burnt the whole damn town down."&lt;ref name="TheParisReview" /&gt; Vonnegut and other American prisoners were put to work immediately after the bombing, excavating bodies from the rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He described the activity as a "terribly elaborate Easter-egg hunt".&lt;ref name="TheParisReview" /&gt;

The American [[prisoners of war]] were evacuated on foot to the border of Saxony and [[Czechoslovakia]] after General [[George S. Patton]] captured [[Leipzig]]. With the captives abandoned by their guards, Vonnegut reached a prisoner-of-war repatriation camp in [[Le Havre]], France, before the end of May 1945, with the aid of the Soviets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He returned to the United States and continued to serve in the Army, stationed at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]], typing discharge papers for other soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Vonnegut |first=Kurt |subject-link=|interviewer=[[Michael Silverblatt]] |title="Kurt Vonnegut" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=538&amp;v=4bclBnx4cpk |publisher=KCRW |location=Santa Monica, California|date=April 6, 2006 |work=Bookworm |access-date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after he was awarded a [[Purple Heart]] about which he remarked "I myself was awarded my country's second-lowest decoration, a Purple Heart for frost-bite."&lt;ref name="DaltonSEP"&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged from the U.S. Army and returned to Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|2006|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=80–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage, University of Chicago, and early employment ===
After he returned to the United States, 22-year-old Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, his high school girlfriend and classmate since kindergarten, on September 1, 1945. The pair relocated to Chicago; there, Vonnegut enrolled in the [[University of Chicago]] on the [[G.I. Bill]], as an [[anthropology]] student in an unusual five-year joint undergraduate/graduate program that conferred a [[master's degree]]. He augmented his income by working as a reporter for the [[City News Bureau of Chicago]] at night. Jane accepted a scholarship from the university to study [[Russian literature]] as a graduate student. Jane dropped out of the program after becoming pregnant with the couple's first child, [[Mark Vonnegut|Mark]] (born May 1947), while Kurt also left the University without any degree (despite having completed his undergraduate education) when his master's thesis on the [[Ghost Dance]] religious movement was unanimously rejected by the department.{{efn|Vonnegut received his graduate degree in anthropology 25 years after he left, when the University accepted his novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' in lieu of his master's thesis.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=7}}}}

Shortly thereafter, [[General Electric]] (GE) hired Vonnegut as a publicist for the company's [[Schenectady, New York]], research laboratory. Although the job required a college degree, Vonnegut was hired after claiming to hold a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Chicago. His brother Bernard had worked at GE since 1945, contributing significantly to an [[iodine]]-based [[cloud seeding]] project. In 1949, Kurt and Jane had a daughter named [[Edith Vonnegut|Edith]]. Still working for GE, Vonnegut had his first piece, titled "Report on the Barnhouse Effect", published in the February 11, 1950 issue of ''Collier's'', for which he received $750.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Sumner|2014}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut wrote another story, after being coached by the fiction editor at ''Collier's'', Knox Burger, and again sold it to the magazine, this time for $950. Burger suggested he quit GE, a course he had contemplated before. Vonnegut moved with his family to [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]] to write full-time, and left GE in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Hayman|Michaelis|Plimpton|Rhodes|1977}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First novel ===
On Cape Cod, Vonnegut made most of his money writing pieces for magazines such as ''Collier's'', ''The Saturday Evening Post'', and [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|''Cosmopolitan'']]. He also did a stint as an English teacher, [[copy (written)|wrote copy]] for an advertising agency, and opened the first USA [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] dealership, which eventually failed. In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'', was published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]. The novel has a post-Third World War setting, in which factory workers have been replaced by machines.&lt;ref name = "player" /&gt;

''Player Piano'' draws upon Vonnegut's experience as an employee at GE. He satirizes the drive to climb the corporate ladder, one that in ''Player Piano'' is rapidly disappearing as automation increases, putting even executives out of work. His central character, Paul Proteus, has an ambitious wife, a backstabbing assistant, and a feeling of empathy for the poor. Sent by his boss, Kroner, as a double agent among the poor (who have all the material goods they want, but little sense of purpose), he leads them in a machine-smashing, museum-burning revolution.&lt;ref name = "playerp" /&gt; ''Player Piano'' expresses Vonnegut's opposition to [[McCarthyism]], something made clear when the Ghost Shirts, the revolutionary organization Paul penetrates and eventually leads, is referred to by one character as "[[fellow travelers]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Player Piano'', Vonnegut originates many of the techniques he would use in his later works. The comic, heavy-drinking Shah of Bratpuhr, an outsider to this dystopian corporate United States, is able to ask many questions that an insider would not think to ask, or would cause offense by doing so. For example, when taken to see the artificially intelligent supercomputer EPICAC, the Shah asks it "what are people for?" and receives no answer. Speaking for Vonnegut, he dismisses it as a "false god". This type of alien visitor would recur throughout Vonnegut's literature.&lt;ref name="playerp"&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|pp = 20–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' writer and critic [[Granville Hicks]] gave ''Player Piano'' a positive review, favorably comparing it to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Hicks called Vonnegut a "sharp-eyed satirist". None of the reviewers considered the novel particularly important. Several editions were printed—one by [[Bantam Books|Bantam]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; with the title ''Utopia 14'', and another by the [[Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club]]—whereby Vonnegut gained the repute of a [[science fiction]] writer, a genre held in disdain by writers at that time. He defended the genre, and deplored a perceived sentiment that "no one can simultaneously be a respectable writer and understand how a refrigerator works."&lt;ref name = "player"&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=8–9}}; {{harvnb|Marvin|2002|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Struggling writer ===
[[File:Kurt Vonnegut and his family, 1955.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Vonnegut with his wife Jane, and children (from left to right): Mark, Edith and Nanette, in 1955]]

After ''Player Piano'', Vonnegut continued to sell short stories to various magazines. In 1954 the couple had a third child, Nanette. With a growing family and no financially successful novels yet, Vonnegut's short stories sustained the family. In 1958, his sister, Alice, died of cancer two days after her husband, James Carmalt Adams, was killed in [[Newark Bay rail accident|a train accident]]. Vonnegut adopted Alice's three young sons—James, Steven, and Kurt, aged 14, 11, and 9, respectively.&lt;ref name="Farrell9"&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grappling with family challenges, Vonnegut continued to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar in terms of plot. ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp that allows him to appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet [[Tralfamadore]], who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as [[the Kremlin]], are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach's]] opera ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumfoord, who is based on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], also physically resembles the former president. Rumfoord is described, "he put a cigarette in a long, bone cigarette holder, lighted it. He thrust out his jaw. The cigarette holder pointed straight up."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Rodney Allen]], in his guide to Vonnegut's works, stated that Rumfoord foreshadowed the fictional political figures who would play major roles in ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' and ''Jailbird''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mother Night]]'', published in 1961, received little attention at the time of its publication. Howard W. Campbell Jr., Vonnegut's protagonist, is an American who goes to Nazi Germany during the war as a double agent for the U.S. [[Office of Strategic Services]], and rises to the regime's highest ranks as a radio propagandist. After the war, the spy agency refuses to clear his name and he is eventually imprisoned by the Israelis in the same cell block as [[Adolf Eichmann]], and later commits suicide. Vonnegut wrote in a foreword to a later edition, "we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic Lawrence Berkove considered the novel, like [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', to illustrate the tendency for "impersonators to get carried away by their impersonations, to become what they impersonate and therefore to live in a world of illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morse|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also published in 1961 was Vonnegut's short story, "[[Harrison Bergeron]]", set in a dystopic future where all are equal, even if that means disfiguring beautiful people and forcing the strong or intelligent to wear devices that negate their advantages. Fourteen-year-old Harrison is a genius and athlete forced to wear record-level "handicaps" and imprisoned for attempting to overthrow the government. He escapes to a television studio, tears away his handicaps, and frees a ballerina from her lead weights. As they dance, they are killed by the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers.{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=46}} Vonnegut, in a later letter, suggested that "Harrison Bergeron" might have sprung from his envy and self-pity as a high school misfit. In his 1976 biography of Vonnegut, Stanley Schatt suggested that the short story shows "in any leveling process, what really is lost, according to Vonnegut, is beauty, grace, and wisdom".{{sfn|Hattenhauer|1998|p=387}} Darryl Hattenhauer, in his 1998 journal article on "Harrison Bergeron", theorized that the story was a satire on American Cold War misunderstandings of communism and socialism.{{sfn|Hattenhauer|1998|p=387}}

With ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' (1963), Allen wrote, "Vonnegut hit full stride for the first time".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator, John, intends to write of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the fictional fathers of the atomic bomb, seeking to cover the scientist's human side. Hoenikker, in addition to the bomb, has developed another threat to mankind, ice-9, solid water stable at room temperature, and if a particle of it is dropped in water, all of it becomes ice-9. Much of the second half of the book is spent on the fictional Caribbean island of San Lorenzo, where John explores a religion called [[Bokononism]], whose holy books (excerpts from which are quoted), give the novel the moral core science does not supply. After the oceans are converted to ice-9, wiping out most of humankind, John wanders the frozen surface, seeking to have himself and his story survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|pp=54–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morse|2003|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vonnegut based the title character of ''God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater'' (1964), on an accountant he knew on Cape Cod, who specialized in clients in trouble and often had to comfort them. Eliot Rosewater, the wealthy son of a Republican senator, seeks to atone for his wartime killing of noncombatant firefighters by serving in a [[volunteer fire department]], and by giving away money to those in trouble or need. Stress from a battle for control of his charitable foundation pushes him over the edge, and he is placed in a mental hospital. He recovers, and ends the financial battle by declaring the children of his county to be his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen deemed ''God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater'' more "a cry from the heart than a novel under its author's full intellectual control", that reflected family and emotional stresses Vonnegut was going through at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' ===
After spending almost two years at [[Iowa Writers' Workshop|the writer's workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]], teaching one course each term, Vonnegut was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for research in Germany. By the time he won it, in March 1967, he was becoming a well-known writer. He used the funds to travel in Eastern Europe, including to Dresden, where he found many prominent buildings still in ruins. At the time of the bombing, Vonnegut had not appreciated the sheer scale of destruction in Dresden; his enlightenment came only slowly as information dribbled out, and based on early figures he came to believe that 135,000 had died there.{{sfn|Shields|2011|pp=219–228}}{{efn|A 2010 report commissioned by the German government estimated the toll at up to 25,000.{{sfn|BBC|2010}}}}

Vonnegut had been writing about his war experiences at Dresden ever since he returned from the war, but had never been able to write anything acceptable to himself or his publishers—Chapter 1 of ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' tells of his difficulties.{{sfn|Allen|pp=82–85}} Released in 1969, the novel rocketed Vonnegut to fame.{{sfn|Shields|2011|pp=248–249}} It tells of the life of Billy Pilgrim, who like Vonnegut was born in 1922 and survives the bombing of Dresden. The story is told in a non-linear fashion, with many of the story's climaxes—Billy's death in 1976, his kidnapping by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore nine years earlier, and the execution of Billy's friend Edgar Derby in the ashes of Dresden for stealing a teapot—disclosed in the story's first pages.{{sfn|Allen|pp=82–85}} In 1970, he was also a correspondent in [[Biafra]] during the [[Nigerian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKdcCgk_FowC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=|page=12|title=Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five|series=Bloom's Guides|author=[[Harold Bloom]]|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-1-438-1270-95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_T6j421tM4C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=|title=Kurt Vonnegut's America|author=Jerome Klinkowitz|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-570-0382-66|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Slaughterhouse-Five'' received generally positive reviews, with [[Michael Crichton]] writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', "he writes about the most excruciatingly painful things. His novels have attacked our deepest fears of automation and the bomb, our deepest political guilts, our fiercest hatreds and loves. No one else writes books on these subjects; they are inaccessible to normal novelists."{{sfn|Shields|2011|p=254}} The book went immediately to the top of [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. Vonnegut's earlier works had appealed strongly to many college students, and the antiwar message of ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' resonated with a generation marked by the [[Vietnam War]]. He later stated that the loss of confidence in government that Vietnam caused finally allowed for an honest conversation regarding events like Dresden.{{sfn|Shields|2011|pp=248–249}}

=== Later career and events ===
After ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' was published, Vonnegut embraced the fame and financial security that attended its release. He was hailed as a hero of the burgeoning anti-war movement in the United States, was invited to speak at numerous rallies, and gave college [[commencement address]]es around the country.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=10}} In addition to briefly teaching at [[Harvard University]] as a lecturer in [[creative writing]] in 1970, Vonnegut taught at the [[City College of New York]] as a distinguished professor during the 1973–1974 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002675801|title=Marquis Biographies Online|website=Search.marquiswhoswho.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later elected vice president of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]], and given honorary degrees by, among others, [[Indiana University]] and [[Bennington College]]. Vonnegut also wrote a play called ''[[Happy Birthday, Wanda June]]'', which opened on October 7, 1970, at New York's [[Theatre de Lys]]. Receiving mixed reviews, it closed on March 14, 1971. In 1972, [[Universal Pictures]] adapted ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' into [[Slaughterhouse-Five (film)|a film]] which the author said was "flawless".{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=11}}

Meanwhile, Vonnegut's personal life was disintegrating. His wife Jane had embraced Christianity, which was contrary to Vonnegut's atheistic beliefs, and with five of their six children having left home, Vonnegut said the two were forced to find "other sorts of seemingly important work to do." The couple battled over their differing beliefs until Vonnegut moved from their Cape Cod home to New York in 1971. Vonnegut called the disagreements "painful", and said the resulting split was a "terrible, unavoidable accident that we were ill-equipped to understand."{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=10}} The couple divorced and they remained friends until Jane's death in late 1986.{{sfn|Wolff|1987}}{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=10}} Beyond his marriage, he was deeply affected when his son Mark suffered a [[mental breakdown]] in 1972, which exacerbated Vonnegut's chronic depression, and led him to take [[Ritalin]]. When he stopped taking the drug in the mid-1970s, he began to see a psychologist weekly.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=11}}

|salign=right|source=–Kurt Vonnegut, &lt;small&gt;''[[A Man Without a Country]]'', 2005&lt;/small&gt;}}

Vonnegut's difficulties materialized in numerous ways; most distinctly though, was the painfully slow progress he was making on his next novel, the darkly comical ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]''. In 1971, Vonnegut stopped writing the novel altogether.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=11}} When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak's book ''American Literature on Stage and Screen'', ''Breakfast of Champions'' was called "funny and outlandish", but reviewers noted that it "lacks substance and seems to be an exercise in literary playfulness."{{sfn|Hischak|2012|p=31}} Vonnegut's 1976 novel ''[[Slapstick (novel)|Slapstick]]'', which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In ''The New York Times''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s review of ''Slapstick'', [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] said Vonnegut "seems to be putting less effort into [storytelling] than ever before", and that "it still seems as if he has given up storytelling after all."{{sfn|Lehmann-Haupt|1976}} At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors' complaints.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=11}}

In 1979, Vonnegut married [[Jill Krementz]], a photographer whom he met while she was working on a series about writers in the early 1970s. With Jill, he adopted a daughter, Lily, when the baby was three days old.{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=451}} In subsequent years, his popularity resurged as he published several satirical books, including ''[[Jailbird]]'' (1979), ''[[Deadeye Dick]]'' (1982), ''[[Galápagos (novel)|Galápagos]]'' (1985), ''[[Bluebeard (Vonnegut novel)|Bluebeard]]'' (1987), and ''[[Hocus Pocus (novel)|Hocus Pocus]]'' (1990).{{sfn|Sumner|2014}} Although he remained a prolific writer in the 1980s Vonnegut struggled with depression and attempted suicide in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Vonnegut|title=Kurt Vonnegut {{!}} Biography, Facts, &amp; Books|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Vonnegut was seen by a younger generation when he played himself in [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s film ''[[Back to School]]''.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=12}} The last of Vonnegut's fourteen novels, ''[[Timequake]]'' (1997), was, as [[University of Detroit]] history professor and Vonnegut biographer [[Gregory Sumner]] said, "a reflection of an aging man facing mortality and testimony to an embattled faith in the resilience of human awareness and agency."{{sfn|Sumner|2014}} Vonnegut's final book, a collection of essays entitled ''[[A Man Without a Country]]'' (2005), became a bestseller.{{sfn|Smith|2007}}

=== Death and legacy ===
{{quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=Vonnegut's sincerity, his willingness to scoff at received wisdom, is such that reading his work for the first time gives one the sense that everything else is rank hypocrisy. His opinion of human nature was low, and that low opinion applied to his heroes and his villains alike — he was endlessly disappointed in humanity and in himself, and he expressed that disappointment in a mixture of tar-black humor and deep despair. He could easily have become a crank, but he was too smart; he could have become a cynic, but there was something tender in his nature that he could never quite suppress; he could have become a bore, but even at his most despairing he had an endless willingness to entertain his readers: with drawings, jokes, sex, bizarre plot twists, science fiction, whatever it took.{{sfn|Grossman|2007}}|source=–[[Lev Grossman]], &lt;small&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 2007&lt;/small&gt;}}

In a 2006 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, Vonnegut sardonically stated that he would sue the [[Brown &amp; Williamson]] tobacco company, the maker of the [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]]-branded cigarettes he had been smoking since he was twelve or fourteen years old, for false advertising. "And do you know why?" he said. "Because I'm 83 years old. The lying bastards! On the package Brown &amp; Williamson promised to kill me."{{sfn|Grossman|2007}} He died on the night of April 11, 2007 in [[Manhattan]], as a result of brain injuries incurred several weeks prior from a fall at his New York [[brownstone]] home.{{sfn|Smith|2007}}{{sfn|Allen}} His death was reported by his wife Jill. Vonnegut was 84 years old.{{sfn|Smith|2007}} At the time of his death, Vonnegut had written fourteen novels, three short story collections, five plays and five non-fiction books.{{sfn|Grossman|2007}} A book composed of Vonnegut's unpublished pieces, ''[[Armageddon in Retrospect]]'', was compiled and posthumously published by Vonnegut's son Mark in 2008.{{sfn|Blount|2008}}

When asked about the impact Vonnegut had on his work, author [[Josip Novakovich]] stated that he has "much to learn from Vonnegut—how to compress things and yet not compromise them, how to digress into history, quote from various historical accounts, and not stifle the narrative. The ease with which he writes is sheerly masterly, Mozartian."{{sfn|Banach|2013}} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist Gregory Rodriguez said that the author will "rightly be remembered as a darkly humorous social critic and the premier novelist of the counterculture",{{sfn|Rodriguez|2007}} and Dinitia Smith of ''The New York Times'' dubbed Vonnegut the "[[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]'s novelist."{{sfn|Smith|2007}}

Vonnegut has inspired numerous posthumous tributes and works. In 2008, the Kurt Vonnegut Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cofc.edu/vonnegut/|title=The Kurt Vonnegut Society – Promoting the Scholarly Study of Kurt Vonnegut, his Life, and Works|website=Blogs.cofc.edu|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established, and in November 2010, the [[Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library]] was opened in Vonnegut's hometown of Indianapolis. The [[Library of America]] published a compendium of Vonnegut's compositions between 1963 and 1973 the following April, and another compendium of his earlier works in 2012. Late 2011 saw the release of two Vonnegut biographies, Gregory Sumner's ''Unstuck in Time'' and [[Charles J. Shields]]'s ''And So It Goes''.{{sfn|Kunze|Tally|2012|p=7}} Shields's biography of Vonnegut created some controversy. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the book portrays Vonnegut as distant, cruel and nasty. "Cruel, nasty and scary are the adjectives commonly used to describe him by the friends, colleagues, and relatives Shields quotes", said ''[[The Daily Beast]]''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s Wendy Smith. "Towards the end he was very feeble, very depressed and almost morose", said Jerome Klinkowitz of the [[University of Northern Iowa]], who has examined Vonnegut in depth.{{sfn|Harris|2011}}

{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=Like Mark Twain, Mr. Vonnegut used humor to tackle the basic questions of human existence: Why are we in this world? Is there a presiding figure to make sense of all this, a god who in the end, despite making people suffer, wishes them well?{{sfn|Smith|2007}}|source=–Dinitia Smith, &lt;small&gt;''The New York Times'', 2007&lt;/small&gt;}}

Vonnegut's works have evoked ire on several occasions. His most prominent novel, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'', has been objected to or removed at various institutions in at least 18 instances.{{sfn|Morais|2011}} In the case of ''[[Island Trees School District v. Pico]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that [[Island Trees Union Free School District|a school district's]] ban on ''Slaughterhouse-Five''—which the board had called "anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy"—and eight other novels was unconstitutional. When a school board in [[Republic, Missouri]] decided to withdraw Vonnegut's novel from its libraries, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library offered a free copy to all the students of the district.{{sfn|Morais|2011}}

Tally, writing in 2013, suggests that Vonnegut has only recently become the subject of serious study rather than fan adulation, and much is yet to be written about him. "The time for scholars to say 'Here's why Vonnegut is worth reading' has definitively ended, thank goodness. We know he's worth reading. Now tell us things we don't know."{{sfn|Tally|2013|pp=14–15}} Todd F. Davis notes that Vonnegut's work is kept alive by his loyal readers, who have "significant influence as they continue to purchase Vonnegut's work, passing it on to subsequent generations and keeping his entire canon in print—an impressive list of more than twenty books that [Dell Publishing] has continued to refurbish and hawk with new cover designs."{{sfn|Davis|2006|p=2}} Donald E. Morse notes that Vonnegut, "is now firmly, if somewhat controversially, ensconced in the American and world literary canon as well as in high school, college and graduate curricula".{{sfn|Morse|2013|p=56}} Tally writes of Vonnegut's work:

{{quote|Vonnegut's 14 novels, while each does its own thing, together are nevertheless experiments in the same overall project. Experimenting with the form of the American novel itself, Vonnegut engages in a broadly modernist attempt to apprehend and depict the fragmented, unstable, and distressing bizarreries of postmodern American experience&amp;nbsp;... That he does not actually succeed in representing the shifting multiplicities of that social experience is beside the point. What matters is the attempt, and the recognition that&amp;nbsp;... we must try to map this unstable and perilous terrain, even if we know in advance that our efforts are doomed.{{sfn|Tally|2011|p=158}}}}

=== War ===
In the introduction to ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' Vonnegut recounts meeting filmmaker Harrison Starr at a party who asked him whether his forthcoming book was an anti-war novel — "I guess" replied Vonnegut. Starr responded "Why don't you write an anti-glacier novel?". This underlined Vonnegut's belief that wars were, unfortunately, inevitable, but that it was important to ensure the wars one fought were just wars.

In 2011, [[NPR]] wrote, "Kurt Vonnegut's blend of anti-war sentiment and satire made him one of the most popular writers of the 1960s." Vonnegut stated in a 1987 interview that, "my own feeling is that civilization ended in [[World War I]], and we're still trying to recover from that", and that he wanted to write war-focused works without glamorizing war itself.{{sfn|NPR|2011}} Vonnegut had not intended to publish again, but his anger against the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] led him to write ''A Man Without a Country''.{{sfn|Daily Telegraph 2007}}

''Slaughterhouse-Five'' is the Vonnegut novel best known for its antiwar themes, but the author expressed his beliefs in ways beyond the depiction of the destruction of Dresden. He has one character, Mary O'Hare, opine that "wars were partly encouraged by books and movies", made by "[[Frank Sinatra]] or [[John Wayne]] or some of those other glamorous, war-loving, dirty old men".{{sfn|Freese|2013|p=101}} Vonnegut made a number of comparisons between Dresden and the [[bombing of Hiroshima]] in ''Slaughterhouse-Five''{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=2}} and wrote in ''Palm Sunday'' (1991) that "I learned how vile that religion of mine could be when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima".{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=68}}

[[Nuclear war]], or at least deployed [[nuclear arms]], is mentioned in almost all of Vonnegut's novels. In ''Player Piano'', the computer EPICAC is given control of the nuclear arsenal, and is charged with deciding whether to use high-explosive or nuclear arms. In ''Cat's Cradle'', John's original purpose in setting pen to paper was to write an account of what prominent Americans had been doing as Hiroshima was bombed.{{sfn|Leeds|1995|pp=1–2}}

=== Religion ===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Some of you may know that I am neither Christian nor Jewish nor Buddhist, nor a conventionally religious person of any sort. I am a humanist, which means, in part, that I have tried to behave decently without any expectation of rewards or punishments after I'm dead. ... I myself have written, "If it weren't for the message of mercy and pity in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, I wouldn't want to be a human being. I would just as soon be a rattlesnake."{{sfn|Vonnegut|1999|loc=introduction}}|source=–Kurt Vonnegut, &lt;small&gt;''[[God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian]]'', 1999&lt;/small&gt;}}

Vonnegut was an [[atheist]] and a [[Humanism|humanist]], serving as the honorary president of the [[American Humanist Association]].{{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|pp=177, 185, 191}}{{sfn|Niose|2007}} In an interview for ''[[Playboy]]'', he stated that his forebears who came to the United States did not believe in God, and he learned his atheism from his parents.{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=480}} He did not however disdain those who seek the comfort of religion, hailing church associations as a type of extended family.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}} Like his great-grandfather Clemens, Vonnegut was a [[Freethought|freethinker]].{{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|p=177}} He occasionally attended a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church, but with little consistency. 
"According to Vonnegut,he continued to say he was Unitarian Universalist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uudb.org/articles/kurtvonnegut.html|title=Kurt Vonnegut|website=uudb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiographical work ''Palm Sunday'', Vonnegut says he is a "Christ-worshipping agnostic";.{{sfn|Vonnegut|1982|p=327}} "In his 1984" (Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA)) "Ware Lecture, "Vonnegut described his connection to Unitarian Universalism with characteristic sarcasm: "In order not to seem [spiritually inept] to strangers trying to get a fix on me, I sometimes say I'm a Unitarian Universalist. So that denomination claims me as one of their own."" "Despite his blasé view of religious affiliation, Vonnegut was a deeply grounded person whose life was indeed an expression of UU values.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/biographies-new/vonnegut-kurt-jr-1922-2007/|title=Vonnegut, Kurt, Jr. (1922-2007)|date=2 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was keen to stress that he was not a Christian.&lt;ref name=image&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wakefield|first1=Dan|authorlink=Dan Wakefield|date=2014|title=Kurt Vonnegut, Christ-Loving Atheist|url= https://www.imagejournal.org/article/kurt-vonnegut/|journal=[[Image (journal)|Image]]|issue=82|pages=67–75|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vonnegut was an admirer of Jesus' [[Sermon on the Mount]], particularly the [[Beatitudes]], and incorporated it into his own doctrines.{{sfn|Davis|2006|p=142}} He also referred to it in many of his works.{{sfn|Vonnegut|2006b}} In his 1991 book ''Fates Worse than Death'', Vonnegut suggests that during the Reagan administration, "anything that sounded like the Sermon on the Mount was socialistic or communistic, and therefore anti-American".{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=525}} In ''Palm Sunday'', he wrote that "the Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade."{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=525}} However, Vonnegut had a deep dislike for certain aspects of Christianity, often reminding his readers of the bloody history of the Crusades and other religion-inspired violence. He despised the [[televangelist]]s of the late 20th century, feeling that their thinking was narrow-minded.{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=141}}

Religion features frequently in Vonnegut's work, both in his novels and elsewhere. He laced a number of his speeches with religion-focused rhetoric,{{sfn|Vonnegut|1999|loc=introduction}}{{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|pp=177, 185, 191}} and was prone to using such expressions as "God forbid" and "thank God".{{sfn|Niose|2007}}{{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|p=191}} He once wrote his own version of the [[Requiem Mass]], which he then had translated into Latin and set to music.&lt;ref name=image/&gt; In ''[[God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian]]'', Vonnegut goes to heaven after he is [[euthanasia|euthanized]] by Dr. [[Jack Kevorkian]]. Once in heaven, he interviews 21 deceased celebrities, including [[Isaac Asimov]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Kilgore Trout]]—the last a fictional character from several of his novels.{{sfn|Kohn|2001}} Vonnegut's works are filled with characters founding new faiths,{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=141}} and religion often serves as a major plot device, for example in ''Player Piano'', ''The Sirens of Titan'' and ''Cat's Cradle''. In ''The Sirens of Titan'', Rumfoord proclaims The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent. ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' sees Billy Pilgrim, lacking religion himself, nevertheless become a chaplain's assistant in the military and display a large crucifix on his bedroom wall.{{sfn|Leeds|1995|pp=477–479}} In ''Cat's Cradle'', Vonnegut invented the religion of [[Bokononism]].{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=78}}

=== Politics ===
Vonnegut did not particularly sympathize with [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]], and mused on the specious simplicity of American politics. "If you want to take my guns away from me, and you're all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other ... you're a liberal. If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you're a conservative. What could be simpler?"{{sfn|Zinn|Arnove|2009|p=620}} Regarding political parties, Vonnegut said, "The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers. The people don't acknowledge this. They claim membership in two imaginary parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, instead."{{sfn|Vonnegut|2006a|loc="In a Manner that Must Shame God Himself"}}

Vonnegut disregarded more mainstream political ideologies in favor of [[socialism]], which he thought could provide a valuable substitute for what he saw as [[social Darwinism]] and a spirit of "[[survival of the fittest]]" in American society,{{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1364–1365}} believing that "socialism would be a good for the common man".{{sfn|Gannon|Taylor|2013}} Vonnegut would often return to a quote by socialist and five-time presidential candidate [[Eugene V. Debs]]: "As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I'm of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free."{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}}{{sfn|Zinn|Arnove|2009|p=618}} Vonnegut expressed disappointment that [[communism]] and socialism seemed to be unsavory topics to the average American, and believed that they may offer beneficial substitutes to contemporary social and economic systems.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1365}}

== Writing ==
[[File:VonnegutLibrary.jpg|thumb|[[Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library]] in Indianapolis]]

=== Influences ===
Vonnegut's writing was inspired by an eclectic mix of sources. When he was younger, Vonnegut stated that he read works of [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], science fiction, fantasy, and action-adventure. He also read the [[Classics]], like those of [[Aristophanes]]. Aristophanes, like Vonnegut, wrote humorous critiques of contemporary society.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=17–18}} Vonnegut's life and work also share similarities with that of ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' writer Mark Twain. Both shared pessimistic outlooks on humanity, and a skeptical take on religion, and, as Vonnegut put it, were both "associated with the enemy in a major war", as Twain briefly enlisted in the South's cause during the [[American Civil War]], and Vonnegut's German name and ancestry connected him with the United States' enemy in both world wars.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=18}}

Vonnegut called [[George Orwell]] his favorite writer, and admitted that he tried to emulate Orwell. "I like his concern for the poor, I like his socialism, I like his simplicity", Vonnegut said.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=19}} Vonnegut also said that Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', and ''Brave New World'' by Aldous Huxley, heavily influenced his [[debut novel]], ''Player Piano'', in 1952. Vonnegut commented that [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s stories were emblems of thoughtfully put together works that he tried to mimic in his own compositions.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}} Vonnegut also hailed playwright and socialist [[George Bernard Shaw]] as "a hero of [his]", and an "enormous influence."{{sfn|Barsamian|2004|p=15}} Within his own family, Vonnegut stated that his mother, Edith, had the greatest influence on him. "[My] mother thought she might make a new fortune by writing for the slick magazines. She took short-story courses at night. She studied magazines the way gamblers study racing forms."{{sfn|Hayman|Michaelis|Plimpton|Rhodes|1977}}

Early on in his career, Vonnegut decided to model his style after [[Henry David Thoreau]], who wrote as if from the perspective of a child, allowing Thoreau's works to be more widely comprehensible.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=18}} Using a youthful narrative voice allowed Vonnegut to deliver concepts in a modest and straightforward way.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=18–19}} Other influences on Vonnegut include ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' author [[H. G. Wells]], and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]]. Vonnegut credited newspaper magnate [[H. L. Mencken]] for inspiring him to become a journalist.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}}

=== Style and technique ===
{{quote box|width=36%|align=right|quote=I've heard the Vonnegut voice described as "manic depressive", and there's certainly something to this. It has an incredible amount of energy married to a very deep and dark sense of despair. It's frequently over-the-top, and scathingly satirical, but it never strays too far from pathos – from an immense sympathy for society's vulnerable, oppressed and powerless. But, then, it also contains a huge allotment of warmth. Most of the time, reading Kurt Vonnegut feels more like being spoken to by a very close friend. There's an inclusiveness to his writing that draws you in, and his narrative voice is seldom absent from the story for any length of time. Usually, it's right there in the foreground – direct, involving and extremely idiosyncratic.{{sfn|Extence|2013}}|source=–[[Gavin Extence]], &lt;small&gt;''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 2013&lt;/small&gt;}}

In his book ''Popular Contemporary Writers'', Michael D. Sharp describes Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}} Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter in a way that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations.{{sfn|Extence|2013}}{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}} Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' and ''Slapstick''.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1363–1364}}

Vonnegut believed that ideas, and the convincing communication of those ideas to the reader, were vital to literary art. He did not always sugarcoat his points: much of ''Player Piano'' leads up to the moment when Paul, on trial and hooked up to a lie detector, is asked to tell a falsehood, and states, "every new piece of scientific knowledge is a good thing for humanity".{{sfn|Davis|2006|pp=45–46}} Robert T. Tally Jr., in his volume on Vonnegut's novels, wrote, "rather than tearing down and destroying the icons of twentieth-century, middle-class American life, Vonnegut gently reveals their basic flimsiness."{{sfn|Tally|2011|p=157}} Vonnegut did not simply propose utopian solutions to the ills of American society, but showed how such schemes would not allow ordinary people to live lives free from want and anxiety. The large artificial families that the U.S. population is formed into in ''Slapstick'' soon serve as an excuse for tribalism, with people giving no help to those not part of their group, and with the extended family's place in the social hierarchy becoming vital.{{sfn|Tally|2011|pp=103–105}}

In the introduction to their essay "Kurt Vonnegut and Humor", Tally and Peter C. Kunze suggest that Vonnegut was not a "[[Black comedy|black humorist]]", but a "frustrated idealist" who used "comic parables" to teach the reader absurd, bitter or hopeless truths, with his grim witticisms serving to make the reader laugh rather than cry. "Vonnegut makes sense through humor, which is, in the author's view, as valid a means of mapping this crazy world as any other strategies."{{sfn|Kunze|Tally|2012|loc=introduction}} Vonnegut resented being called a black humorist, feeling that, as with many literary labels, it allows readers to disregard aspects of a writer's work that do not fit the label's stereotype.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=16}}

Vonnegut's works have, at various times, been labeled science fiction, [[satire]] and [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]].{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=13}} He also resisted such labels, but his works do contain common [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] that are often associated with those genres. In several of his books, Vonnegut imagines alien societies and civilizations, as is common in works of science fiction. Vonnegut does this to emphasize or exaggerate absurdities and idiosyncrasies in our own world.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=14–15}} Furthermore, Vonnegut often humorizes the problems that plague societies, as is done in satirical works. However, literary theorist [[Robert Scholes]] noted in ''Fabulation and Metafiction'' that Vonnegut "reject[s] the traditional satirist's faith in the efficacy of satire as a reforming instrument. [He has] a more subtle faith in the humanizing value of laughter."{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=15}} Examples of [[postmodernism]] may also be found in Vonnegut's works. Postmodernism often entails a response to the theory that the truths of the world will be discovered through science.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=16}} Postmodernists contend that truth is subjective, rather than objective, as it is biased towards each individual's beliefs and outlook on the world. They often use [[unreliable narrator|unreliable]], [[first-person narration]], and narrative [[Postmodern literature#Fragmentation|fragmentation]]. One critic has argued that Vonnegut's most famous novel, ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', features a [[metafiction]]al, [[Janus|Janus-headed]] outlook as it seeks both to represent actual historical events while problematizing the very notion of doing exactly that. This is encapsulated in the opening lines of the novel: "All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true." This bombastic opening – "All this happened" – "reads like a declaration of complete mimesis" which is radically called into question in the rest of the quote and "[t]his creates an integrated perspective that seeks out extratextual themes [like war and trauma] while thematizing the novel's textuality and inherent constructedness at one and the same time."{{sfn|Jensen|2016|pp=8–11}} While Vonnegut does use elements as fragmentation and metafictional elements, in some of his works, he more distinctly focuses on the peril posed by individuals who find subjective truths, mistake them for objective truths, then proceed to impose these truths on others.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=16–17}}

=== Themes ===
Vonnegut was a vocal critic of the society in which he lived, and this was reflected in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society. In ''The Sirens of Titan'', the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to one of [[Saturn]]'s moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], as a result of his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=19, 44–45}} In ''God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater'', readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances as the lives of both groups' members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=19}} Further, in ''Hocus Pocus'', the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}} In ''Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion'', Thomas F. Marvin states: "Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States." Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate what happens when a "hereditary aristocracy" develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=19}} Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism, and a "survival of the fittest" view of society. He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because "they deserve their fate".{{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1364–1365}} Vonnegut also confronts the idea of [[free will]] in a number of his pieces. In ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' and ''Timequake'' the characters have no choice in what they do; in ''Breakfast of Champions'', characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in ''Cat's Cradle'', Bokononism views free will as [[heresy|heretical]].{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}}

The majority of Vonnegut's characters are estranged from their actual families and seek to build replacement or extended families. For example, the engineers in ''Player Piano'' called their manager's spouse "Mom". In ''Cat's Cradle'', Vonnegut devises two separate methods for loneliness to be combated: A "karass", which is a group of individuals appointed by God to do his will, and a "[[granfalloon]]", defined by Marvin as a "meaningless association of people, such as a fraternal group or a nation".{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=20}} Similarly, in ''Slapstick'', the U.S. government codifies that all Americans are a part of large extended families.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1365}}

Fear of the loss of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut witnessed machines being built to take the place of human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, ''Player Piano'', where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in ''Galápagos'', where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in ''Timequake'', where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1365–1366}}

Suicide by fire is another common theme in Vonnegut's works; the author often returns to the theory that "many people are not fond of life." He uses this as an explanation for why humans have so severely damaged their environments, and made devices such as [[nuclear weapon]]s that can make their creators extinct.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1365}} In ''Deadeye Dick'', Vonnegut features the [[neutron bomb]], which he claims is designed to kill people, but leave buildings and structures untouched. He also uses this theme to demonstrate the recklessness of those who put powerful, apocalypse-inducing devices at the disposal of politicians.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=21}}

"What is the point of life?" is a question Vonnegut often pondered in his works. When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question "What is the purpose of life?" written in a bathroom, his response is, "To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool." Marvin finds Trout's theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, "[as] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could stand by and do nothing while such reports come in." In the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to ''Bluebeard'', Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: "We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is."{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=20}}

The '''Lambda 10 Project''' is a national [[wikt:clearing house|clearinghouse]] of information pertaining to [[LGBT]] issues in [[United States|American]] [[fraternities and sororities]]. The [[organization]] works to heighten the visibility of [[Coming out|out]] members (chiefly [[university]] [[student]]s), and offers educational resources related to [[sexual orientation]] and the fraternity/sorority experience.&lt;ref name="glbtq"&gt;{{Cite web | last =Kaczorowski | first =Craig | title =Fraternities and Sororities | work =glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture | publisher =glbtq, Inc. | date =2004-02-12| url =http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/fraternities,2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lambda 10 Project was founded in the autumn of 1995 at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]; it is currently [[Headquarters|headquartered]] in the University's Office of Student Ethics and Anti-harassment Programs.

Among the organization's offerings are an index of [[lecture]]rs available for events; lists of [[Internet forum|forum]]s concerning LGBT "[[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]]"; and a repository of [[magazine]] articles, [[website]]s, and pertinent [[news]] stories. Working with the renowned LGBT [[publisher]] [[Alyson Publications]], '''Lambda 10''' also compiled and released three [[Anthology|anthologies]] of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] students' Greek experiences: ''Out on Fraternity Row: Personal Accounts of Being Gay in a College Fraternity'' (1998), ''Secret Sisters: Stories of Being Lesbian and Bisexual in a College Sorority'' (2001) and ''Brotherhood: Gay Life in College Fraternities'' (2005).&lt;ref name="Lambda 10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambda10.org|work=Lambda 10 Project |publisher=Campus Pride, Inc.|accessdate=2009-12-03 |title=National Clearinghouse for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Fraternity &amp; Sorority Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambda 10 Project is an educational initiative of [[Campus Pride]], an [[United States|American]] national [[nonprofit]] [[501(c)(3)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] organization which serves [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) and [[straight ally|ally]] [[student]] leaders and/or [[student society|campus organization]].  It is an associate member of the [[Association of Fraternity Advisors]] and serves as a resource for the leaders of numerous national and international fraternities and sororities.

The Project created an educational resource titled Out on Fraternity Row: Personal Accounts of Being Gay in a College Fraternity released by Alyson Publications, Inc in 1998, Secret Sisters: Stories of Being Lesbian &amp; Bisexual in a College Sorority released by Alyson Publications, Inc. in 2001 and recently Brotherhood: Gay Life in College Fraternities released by Alyson Publications, Inc. in October 2005.

The following is a '''list of female action heroes villains''' who appear in [[action film]]s, television shows, comic books, and video games and who are "thrust into a series of challenges requiring physical feats, extended fights, extensive stunts and frenetic chases."&lt;ref name=am&gt;{{cite web

The '''Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine''' (LCSB) is one of two interdisciplinary research centres at the [[University of Luxembourg]]. Since September 2011, the LCSB is based on the new university campus [[Belval, Luxembourg|Esch-Belval]].

==Research==

The [http://uni.lu/lcsb/ LCSB] was founded in 2009 as the first biomedical research centre of the University of Luxembourg by the founding director [http://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/people/rudi_balling Prof. Dr. Rudi Balling]. The main goal of the LCSB is to accelerate biomedical research by closing the link between systems biology and medical research.

The LCSB currently counts about 230 employees and 15 research groups in the areas of experimental neurobiology, cell metabolism, computational biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, eco-systems biology, and translational medicine.  Collaboration between biologists, medical doctors, computer scientists, physicists and mathematicians is offering new insights into complex systems like cells, organs and whole organisms in both health and disease states. These findings are essential for understanding principal mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and for developing new tools in diagnostics and therapy.

Close collaboration with clinicians and patients are of utmost importance to the LCSB. Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease and description of diseases as networks are at the focus of the LCSB’s research. It aims to contribute to earlier diagnosis and personalized treatment, for instance through its coordinating role in the recently established [http://parkinson.lu/ National Centre of Excellence in Research on Parkinson’s Disease]. 

The LCSB also hosts the Luxembourgish node of ELIXIR, the European infrastructure for life science information. [http://elixir-luxembourg.org/ ELIXIR Luxembourg] (ELIXIR-LU) focuses on long-term sustainability of tools and data for Translational Medicine. Translational Medicine data integrate clinical information with molecular and cellular data for a better understanding of diseases. They bridge the gap between the molecular level, findings from the laboratory, and the clinical observations and applications. ELIXIR-LU aims to facilitate long-term access to those research data and to tools for scientists in both academia and industry. This will allow the reuse of previously generated translational data to address new research questions and dramatically save time and cost.

The Centre has established strategic partnerships with leading biomedical laboratories worldwide and with all major biological and medical research units in Luxembourg. The LCSB fosters collaboration with industrial partners and accelerates the translation of fundamental research results into (clinical) applications.

The '''National Admissions Test for Law''', or '''LNAT''', is an admissions aptitude test that was adopted in 2004 by eight [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[university]] law programmes&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3451897.stm Education: New entry test for law students], [[BBC News]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as an admissions requirement for home applicants. The test was established at the leading urgency of [[Oxford University]] as an answer to the problem facing universities trying to select from an increasingly competitive pool with similarly high [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]]. With effect from its second year, the LNAT is required for UK and overseas applicants alike. There are now nine participating law schools and hundreds of test centres worldwide.

==Format==
The LNAT is 135 minutes long and consists of two sections. The test taker is allotted 40 minutes to complete the essay and 95 minutes to answer 42 multiple-choice questions aimed at measuring reading comprehension and logical reasoning skills. The reading portion contains twelve short passages, with three or four questions about each passage. The questions typically ask for terms and arguments from the reading to be defined by inference. The essay portion is 40 minutes long and involves the candidate answering one of three available essay questions. The questions are generally open-ended prompts that can focus on any one of a wide variety of issues.&lt;ref name="LNAT Format"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lnat.ac.uk/what-is-lnat/test-format/ | title=Test format – LNAT | publisher=LNAT Consortium Ltd | accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reading section is scored out of 42 and the essays are individually marked by [[proctor]]s at the respective universities.

The universities currently using the LNAT are:&lt;ref name="Why Join LNAT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lnat.ac.uk/why-join-lnat/ | title=Why join LNAT? | publisher=LNAT Consortium Ltd | accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The LNAT was first administered on 3 November 2004.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The average score for the reading portion was 13.16 out of 24.

The LNAT consortium also reported statistically insignificant differences in scores between state and independent students.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Research conducted by the University of Bristol concluded: "the impact of the Lnat both in general and on specific supposedly sensitive [[widening participation]] groups has been negligible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lnat.ac.uk/2010/documents/pressrelease0908.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815232655/http://www.lnat.ac.uk/2010/documents/pressrelease0908.pdf |archivedate=15 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Results ===
In the 2017 National Student Survey, NCH achieved student satisfaction scores above Russell Group universities and London universities, beating London members of the Russell Group in most categories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/2017/08/09/nch-leads-london-institutions-nss-2017/|title=NCH London leads London universities|last=|first=|date=4 December 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014 it was reported that independent research that replicated the annual HEPI academic experience survey showed that the College's academic experience had exceeded the expectations of 63% of its students. This was more than twice the comparative statistic (28%) for [[Russell Group]] university students of humanities and social sciences in the HEPI 2014 annual student experience survey. The same research also showed that NCH students experienced 40% more contact time than their peers at Russell Group universities, that they completed twice as many assignments, and that they received feedback on their assignments in person more than twice as often.

The College's foundation attracted a substantial response in the UK, and a significant amount of adverse publicity, where most higher education institutions are publicly funded.

* "Experiments in Teaching," ''The Times'', 8 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an angry reaction from sections of the academic community.

"AC Grayling: Is it safe to come out now?", ''The Sunday Times'', 12 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and London's mayor, [[Boris Johnson]], called it the boldest experiment in higher education in the UK since the foundation in 1983 of the [[University of Buckingham]], the UK's first private university; he wrote that it showed the way ahead for academics demoralized by government interference with admissions procedures and "scapegoated for the weaknesses of the schools."&lt;ref name=JohnsonJune62011/&gt; ''The Times'' argued that higher education has been a closed shop in the UK for too long, that all over the world there are excellent universities run independently of the state, and that in its conception NCH is teaching by example.&lt;ref&gt;"Experiments in Teaching," ''The Times'', 8 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Economist'' wrote that there is a market for the idea because of the increasing number of qualified British students who fail to get into their university of choice, in part because of pressure on the top universities from the [[Office for Fair Access]] to increase the number of students from state schools; they added that "a 'toffs’ college' of well-heeled Oxbridge near-misses is a provocative concept."&lt;ref name=EconomistJune92011&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/18805758 "One very New College, at a price"], ''The Economist'', 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, one of the college's partners, said he had read the criticism of NCH with incredulity: "Anyone who cares about the humanities will be cheering Anthony Grayling."&lt;ref name=GrimstonJune122011/&gt;

The news triggered accusations of elitism. Literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] called the college "odious," arguing that it was taking advantage of a crumbling university system to make money;&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/06/ac-graylings-new-private-univerity-is-odious "AC Grayling's new private University is odious"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Grayling responded that Eagleton himself teaches a few weeks a year at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in Indiana, USA, a private - though non-profit - university.&lt;ref name=MalikJune92011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110616035525/http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/eagleton/ Terry Eagleton], Excellence in English Distinguished Visitor, [[University of Notre Dame]], June 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyer [[David Allen Green]], writing in the ''New Statesman'', described NCH as a "sham" and a "branding exercise with purchased celebrity endorsements and a PR-driven website."&lt;ref name="GreenJune72011"&gt;Green, David Allen. [http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/06/college-humanities-students "Grayling's Folly is falling down"], ''New Statesman'', 7 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Several academics complained in a letter to ''The Guardian'' that its creation was a setback for the campaign against the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|current government's]] policy of commercializing education, and were joined by 34 of Grayling's former colleagues at Birkbeck, who questioned how much teaching the college's 14 academic partners would actually do.&lt;ref&gt;For the letter, see [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/07/new-college-humanities-gated-intellectual-community "The shame of this 'gated intellectual community'"], Letters to the editor, ''The Guardian'', 7 June 2011.
* For the 34 former colleagues, see [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/14/birkbeck-academics-oppose-grayling-college "Why we Birkbeck Academics oppose Grayling's New College"], ''The Guardian'', 15 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terence Kealey]], then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Buckingham,  suggested it was dangerous to have a university funded by private equity, citing the possible collapse in 2011 of [[Southern Cross Healthcare (United Kingdom)|Southern Cross]] private nursing homes.&lt;ref&gt;Kealey, Terence. [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3054167.ece "Don't call these people Ivy League pioneers"], ''The Times'', 7 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toby Young]] argued in ''The Daily Telegraph'' that the reaction was part of a left-wing campaign to retain state control over education, involving, he wrote, public sector unions, university lecturers, and the Socialist Workers Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100091198/welcome-to-the-fight-professor-grayling/ "Welcome to the fight, Professor Grayling"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 8 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Jenkins]] wrote that the country's professors, lecturers and student trade unionists were "united in arms against what they most hate and fear: academic celebrity, student fees, profit and loss, one-to-one tutorials and America."&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Simon. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/ac-grayling-caricatured-british-university-fuming "AC Grayling has caricatured British universities. No wonder they're fuming"], ''The Guardian'', 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grayling responded to the criticism by arguing that NCH is trying to keep humanities teaching alive. He said he felt persecuted by the negative reaction: "My whole record, everything I have written, is turned on its head. Now I am a bastard capitalist. It is really upsetting. ... Education is a public good and we should be spending more on it and it shouldn't be necessary to do this, but standing on the sidelines moaning and wailing is not an option."&lt;ref name="VasagarBoothJune72011"&gt;Vasagar, Jeevan and Booth, Robert. [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/06/ac-grayling-private-university-syllabus "AC Grayling's private university accused of copying syllabuses"], ''The Guardian'', 7 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 interview, Grayling also responded to claims that the college was "elitist": "There is nothing wrong with being elite as long as you are not exclusive. You want your surgeon or airline pilot to have been trained at an elite institution."&lt;ref name="NewHumanist"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/2859/saving-our-universities-new-humanist-interviews-ac-grayling|title=Saving our universities? New Humanist interviews AC Grayling|first=Caspar|last=Melville|publisher=New Humanist|volume=127|number=5|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dozen protesters heckled Grayling at [[Foyles]] bookshop in London on 7 June 2011 during a debate about cuts to arts funding, one of them shouting that he had "no right to speak." A protester let off a smoke bomb, and 100 people were evacuated from the store.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8562531/AC-Grayling-forced-to-flee-smoke-bomb-protest-at-Foyles-debate-on-private-university.html "AC Grayling forced to flee smoke bomb protest at Foyles debate on private university"],  Andrew Hough, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the week police removed protesters from a [[British Humanist Association]] talk by Richard Dawkins at the [[Institute of Education]].&lt;ref name=GrimstonJune122011/&gt;

In January 2012, the [[United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office|UK's Intellectual Property Office]] objected to the college name being registered as a trademark because of possible confusion with [[New College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name ="BBC 2012 01 23"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16681870 Private college faces objection in trade mark bid], BBC News, 23 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philadelphia Society for the Preservation of Landmarks''' (aka '''Landmarks''') founded in 1931, maintains and preserves four historic house museums in the region around [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. These are:

* [[Grumblethorpe]]
* [[Hill–Physick–Keith House|Hill-Physick-Keith House]]
* [[Powel House]]
* [[Waynesborough]]

These are open for the education and enjoyment of the public and its members.

==History==

The Philadelphia Society for the Preservation of Landmarks has played a significant role in the historic preservation movement in Philadelphia by restoring, furnishing and presenting to the public its distinguished house museums.

Landmarks has an interesting history of its own. In 1931, roused by the news that the historic Powel House was to be demolished in six weeks, [[Frances Anne Wister]] and [[Sophia Cadwalader]] and a group of strong supporters (including famous names like Biddle, Barnes, Curtis and Lippincott) founded Landmarks to save the house. The newly formed Landmarks was successful despite the economic depression of the time and within another ten years had acquired [[Grumblethorpe]] in [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]]. In the late 1960s, Ambassador and Mrs. [[Walter Annenberg]] restored the stately [[Hill-Physick-Keith House]] and then donated the house to Landmarks. In 1981, Landmarks entered into an agreement with Easttown Township in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]] to administer Historic Waynesborough.

Today, Landmarks carries on the vision of Miss Wister by managing the four house museums and bringing thousands of visitors and schoolchildren each year to learn about [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia's history]].

For the last decade Landmarks has served as the sponsor in the Philadelphia Region for the world-renowned Road Scholar program (formerly known as ''Elderhostel''). On average each year, Landmarks Road Scholar Program attracts over 2,000 visitors to the Philadelphia Region to enjoy its many historical and cultural resources. Landmarks Road Scholar ranks 20th out of a total of 638 sponsors around the world. Landmarks is a major supporter of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], [[Philadelphia Flower Show]] and The Barnes Foundation among others through its purchase of admission tickets to these fine organizations. Accounting for over $500,000 in purchases of hotel rooms and services throughout the region, Landmarks Road Scholar plays a significant role in the Philadelphia Region's tourism economy.

==Landmarks Contemporary Projects==
For over eighty years, the Philadelphia Society for the Preservation of Landmarks has played a significant role in the historic preservation movement in Philadelphia by restoring, furnishing and presenting to the public its four distinguished house museums: Grumblethorpe, Physick House, Powel House and Waynesborough. While remaining committed to preserving and interpreting the past, Landmarks is moving into the future with a renewed mission to expand beyond business-as-usual, explore new conceptual territories, create new collaborations and make its houses relevant to today's audiences. To that end, working with founding curator [[Robert Wuilfe]], the organization in 2006 created a new program called [[Landmarks Contemporary Projects]].

[[Landmarks Contemporary Projects]] is a program of exhibitions, residencies, screenings, lectures, performances and educational strategies that is bringing new and experimental contemporary culture from Philadelphia and beyond to historic sites. Landmarks Contemporary Projects tries to provide a thoughtful alternative for audiences, creative opportunities for artists and new partnerships with other organizations. The core of the program is an exhibition/residency program in which Landmarks invites artists to explore and react to its  properties and collections and create site-specific installations. By providing an experimental atmosphere in which artists are free to create new work and question basic assumptions of historical preservation, Landmarks hopes to stimulate discourse and challenge accepted approaches to both house-museums and contemporary art.

To date, Landmarks Contemporary Projects has offered opportunities to a wide range of emerging and established artists. Projects thus far have included:
*[[Megawords]]
*[[Candy Depew]]
*An ongoing partnership with Bowerbird
*[[David Gatten]]
*[[Roxana Perez-Mendez]]
*[[Karen Kilimnik]]
*[[Caitlin Perkins]]
*[[Zoe Cohen]]
*[[Virginia Maksymowicz]]
*[[Michelle Wilson]]
*[[Caroline Lathan-Stiefel]]
*[[Phuong X. Pham]]
*[[Marie H. Elcin]]
*[[J. Makary]]
*[[Nadia Hironaka and Matthew Suib]]

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}

In [[astronomy]], a '''planisphere''' is a [[star chart]] [[Analog computer|analog computing instrument]] in the form of two adjustable disks that rotate on a common pivot. It can be adjusted to display the visible stars for any time and date. It is an instrument to assist in learning how to recognize [[star]]s and [[constellation]]s. The [[astrolabe]], an instrument that has its origins in  [[Hellenistic astronomy]], is a predecessor of the modern planisphere.
The term ''planisphere'' contrasts with ''[[armillary sphere]]'', where the [[celestial sphere]] is represented by a three-dimensional framework of rings.

==Description==
A planisphere consists of a circular [[star chart]] attached at its center to an opaque circular overlay that has a clear elliptical window or hole so that only a portion of the sky map will be visible in the window or hole area at any given time. The chart and overlay are mounted so that they are free to rotate about a common pivot point at their centers. The star chart contains the [[brightest stars]], constellations and (possibly) [[deep-sky object]]s visible from a particular latitude on Earth. The night sky that one sees from the Earth depends on whether the observer is in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] or [[southern hemisphere]]s and the latitude. A planisphere window is designed for a particular latitude and will be accurate enough for a certain band either side of that. Planisphere makers will usually offer them in a number of versions for different latitudes. Planispheres only show the stars visible from the observer's [[latitude]]; stars below the horizon are not included.

A complete twenty-four-hour time cycle is marked on the rim of the overlay. A full twelve months of [[calendar]] dates are marked on the rim of the starchart. The window is marked to show the direction of the eastern and western horizons. The disk and overlay are adjusted so that the observer's local time of day on the overlay corresponds to that day's date on the star chart disc. The portion of the star chart visible in the window then represents (with a distortion because it is a flat surface representing a spherical volume) the distribution of stars in the sky at that moment for the planisphere's designed location. Users hold the planisphere above their head with the eastern and western horizons correctly aligned to match the chart to actual star positions.

==History==
[[File:F10.v. Drawing of planisphere NLW MS 735C.png|thumb|Medieval planisphere,c.1000. [[National Library of Wales]] MS 735C, [[Aberystwyth]].]]
The word planisphere (Latin ''planisphaerium'') was originally used in the second century by [[Ptolemy]] to describe the representation of a spherical Earth by a map drawn in the plane.
This usage continued into the Renaissance: for example [[Gerardus Mercator]] described his [[Mercator 1569 world map|1569 world map]] as a planisphere.

In this article the word describes the representation of the star-filled celestial sphere on the plane.
The first star chart to have the name "planisphere" was made in 1624 by [[Jacob Bartsch]].
Bartsch was the son-in-law of [[Johannes Kepler]], discoverer of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].

==The star chart==
[[File:Philips Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|Philips' Planisphere, ca. 1900]]
Since the planisphere shows the celestial sphere in a printed flat, there is always considerable distortion. Planispheres, like all charts, are made using a certain projection method. For planispheres there are two major methods in use, leaving the choice with the designer. One such method is the [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|polar azimuthal equidistant projection]]. Using this projection the sky is charted centered on one of the celestial poles (polar), while circles of equal declination (for instance 60°, 30°, 0° (the celestial equator), -30°, and -60°) lie equidistant from each other and from the poles (equidistant). The shapes of the constellations are proportionally correct in a straight line from the centre outwards, but at right angles to this direction (parallel to the declination circles) there is considerable distortion. That distortion will be worse as the distance to the pole gets greater. If we study the famous constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] in this projection and compare this to the real Orion, we can clearly see this distortion. One notable planisphere using azimuthal equidistant projection addresses this issue by printing a northern view on one side and the southern view on the other, thus reducing the distance charted from the center outward.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidchandler.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[stereographic projection]] solves this problem while introducing another. Using this projection the distances between the declination circles are enlarged in such a way that the shapes of the constellations remain correct. Naturally in this projection the constellations on the edge become too large in comparison to constellations near the celestial pole: Orion will be twice as high as it should be. (This is the same effect that makes Greenland so huge in Mercator charts.) Another disadvantage is that, with more space for constellations near the edge of the planisphere, the space for the constellations around the celestial pole in question will be less than they deserve. For observers at moderate latitudes, who can see the sky near the celestial pole of their hemisphere better than that nearer the horizon, this may be a good reason to prefer a planisphere made with the polar azimuthal equidistant projection method.

==The upper disc==
The upper disc contains a "horizon", that defines the visible part of the sky at any given moment, which is naturally half of the total starry sky. That horizon line is most of the time also distorted, for the same reason the constellations are distorted.
The horizon line on a stereographic projection is a perfect circle.
The horizon line on other projections is a kind of "collapsed" oval.
The horizon is designed for a particular latitude and thus determines the area for which a planisphere is meant. Some more expensive planispheres have several upper discs that can be exchanged, or have an upper disc with more horizon-lines, for different latitudes.

When a planisphere is used in a latitude zone other than the zone for which it was designed, the user will either see stars that are not in the planisphere, or the planisphere will show stars that are not visible in that latitude zone's sky. To study the starry sky thoroughly it may be necessary to buy a planisphere particularly for the area in question.

However, most of the time the part of the sky near the horizon will not show many stars, due to hills, woods, buildings or just because of the thickness of the atmosphere we look through. The lower 5° above the horizon in particular hardly shows any stars (let alone objects) except under the very best conditions. Therefore, a planisphere can fairly accurately be used from +5° to -5° of the design latitude. For example, a planisphere for 40° north can be used between 35° and 45° north.

==Coordinates==
Accurate planispheres  represent the [[celestial coordinates]]: [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]. The changing positions of planets, asteroids or comets in terms of these coordinates can be looked up in annual astronomical guides, and these enable planisphere users to find them in the sky.

Some planispheres use a separate pointer for the declination, using the same pivot point as the upper disc. Some planispheres have a declination feature printed on the upper disc, along the line connecting north and south on the horizon. Right ascension is represented on the edge, where the dates with which to set the planisphere are also found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28927">The relationship between the level of '''religiosity''' and the level of '''education''' has been studied since the second half of the 20th century.

The parameters of the two components diverse: the "level of [[religiosity]]" remains a concept which is difficult to differentiate [[Scientifically based research|scientifically]], while the "[[International Standard Classification of Education|level of education]]" is easier to compile, such as [[Educational measurement|official data]] on this topic, because data on education is publicly accessible in many countries.

Different studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether "religiosity" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt; Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Souls" /&gt;

In terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities, were religious.&lt;ref name=gross2009 /&gt;

==Studies==

===Global studies===

A [[Pew Center]] study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that [[Jews]] are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling;&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jews]] also have the highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita (61%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Based on the study data, [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Christians]] ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Christians]] were found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the study, Christians in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

The [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]]—which includes [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Buddhists]] have an average of 7.9 years of schooling, and around 12% of Buddhists have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their [[Christian]] counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the [[Christian school|educational facilities]] that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

According to a 2015 global survey by [[WIN/GIA|Gallup International]], the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

In one analysis of [[World Values Survey]] data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; They concluded that "these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, "education raises religious attendance at individual level," while "at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere." The authors suggest that "this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief," causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/glaeser/files/w8080.pdf |title= Education and Religion |last1= Sacerdote |first1= Bruce |last2= Glaeser|first2= Edward L.|work= |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research|page=29|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical analysis of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prizes]] awarded between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of [[List of Christian Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates were Christians]], over 20% were Jewish, and 10.5% were atheists, agnostics, or freethinkers.&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;Baruch A.

==By country==
===Britain===

Research in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David Voas and Siobhan McAndrew|editor1-last=Arweck|editor1-first=Elisabeth|editor2-last=Bullivant|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=Lois|title=Secularity and Non-religion|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415710442|chapter=Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===India===

A survey conducted by the ''Times of India'' revealed that 22% of [[IIT Bombay]] graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know.&lt;ref name=toi2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Less than half of passing IIT batch believes in God’s existence|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Less-than-half-of-passing-IIT-batch-believes-in-Gods-existence/articleshow/46938504.cms|publisher= Times Of India|accessdate=29 September 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the non-religious have a greater level of education than the general population.&lt;ref name=Census.ie&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile 7 – Religion, Ethnicity and Irish Travellers|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile7/Profile%207%20Education%20Ethnicity%20and%20Irish%20Traveller%20entire%20doc.pdf|publisher=Census Statistics Office|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

In 1980, a study was conducted in Spain that showed that many educated people were Catholic.&lt;ref name= "congress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scofield|first=James|title=Spain: Religion|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0062)|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

According to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%.

Sociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. "The irony" he states "is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education."

He found that [[Hindus]], [[Jews]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|title=US Religious Landscape Survey: Diverse and Dynamic|format=PDF|publisher=The Pew Forum|page=85|publication-date=February 2008|accessdate=2012-09-17|ref=refEducationLevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/|title=Faith, Education and Income|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 13, 2011|first=David|last=Leonhardt|date=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]], [[Buddhists]], and [[Orthodox Christians]]&lt;ref name="Faith, Education and Income"&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/?_r=1 Faith, Education and Income]&lt;/ref&gt; have the highest levels of education.

They found that the religiously undermining effect of higher education on recent generation of youth disappeared.

But many studies more recently have shown that conventional wisdom about baby boomers does not apply to today's youth. Higher education no longer seem to diminish religion in emerging adults." "In every case, emerging adults are slightly more religious than those who are not in college, although only the differences in overall religiousness and service attendance are statistically significant. In short, if anything, it is ''not'' attending college that is associated with lower levels of religious practice, though those differences are slight.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'s 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winseman|first1=Albert L.|title=Does More Educated Really = Less Religious?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/7729/does-more-educated-really-less-religious.aspx|website=Gallup Poll|date=February 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher "public religiosity" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less "belief." Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers.&lt;ref name="Post ARIS 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kosmin|first=Barry|title=Religion and the Intelligentsia: Post-graduate Educated Americans 1990-2008|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/religion-and-the-intelligentsia-post-graduate-educated-americans-1990-2008/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews — Religious, Secular, and Spiritual — and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided).&lt;ref name="Kosmin keysar College"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kosmin|first1=Barry|last2=Keysar|first2=Ariela|title=Religious, Spiritual and Secular: The emergence of three distinct worldviews among American college students|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/isssc/Documents/ARIS_2013_College%20Students_Sept_25_final_draft.pdf|publisher=Trinity College|pages=8–9|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At "elite" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, "religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities."&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

[[Frank Sulloway]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Michael Shermer]] of the [[California State University]] conducted a study that found in their polling sample of "credentialed" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a [[correlation]] indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox said that people with less education have decreased in religiosity in America. Their views on family and work have been associated with this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Daniel|title=Less-educated Americans turning their backs on religion|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-08/asa-lea081511.php|work=American Sociological Association|publisher=Eureka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on secularity has noted that, in America, agnostics have significant levels of education, while atheists have relatively low levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. ''Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives''. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than [[mainline Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226764192|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt;

Sociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education "positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of "exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effects of Education on Americans’ Religious Practices, Beliefs, and Affiliations|last=Schwadel|first=Philip|year=2011|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume=53|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s13644-011-0007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|author=Jim Kavanagh|date=11 August 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|quote=With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God,’” he said. “But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cross-national sociological research by Norris and Inglehart notes a positive correlation between religious attendance among the more educated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Pippa|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-64837-1|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Inglehart |pages=267–268|quote= The effects of income become insignificant, however, the impact of education actually reverses in the United States: ''it is the more educated who attend church most frequently.''

According to a [[Pew Center]] study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American [[Hindus]] have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree, followed by [[Unitarian Universalists]] (67%), [[Jews]] (59%), [[Anglican]] (59%), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] (56%) and [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] (47%) and [[United Church of Christ]] (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cording to the same study about (43%) of American [[atheists]], and (42%) [[agnostics]], and (24%) of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree.

==In specific religious denominations==

===Mormons===
Studies of [[Mormons]] in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending [[Church service|church]] regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Stan L. Albrecht, "The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity" Latter-Day Saint Social Life, Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members (Provo, Utah: BYU [[Religious Studies Center]], 1998), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical groups===
Edward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge —  factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutton|first=Edward|title=Why does Jesus go to Oxford University? Conversion Experience, Creativity and Intelligence|url=http://www.jirrs.org/jirrs_nr_6/3-jirrs6-dutton.pdf|publisher=Journal for Interdisciplinary Research on Religion and Science|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that "Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics." He used [[SAT]] scores as a measure of intelligence for this study.&lt;ref&gt;

===Christian fundamentalists===
Contrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and [[Christian fundamentalism]] was found by Burton et al. (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Burton; Stephen Johnson; Joseph Tamney, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3511296 Education and Fundamentalism], ''Review of Religious Research'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, [[Protestant]] residents of [[Delaware County, Indiana]].

The '''Ruston Academy''' was a bilingual American school founded in [[Havana, Cuba]], in 1920.

==History==
Opened in September 1920 in [[Havana]] by educator Hiram Ruston, The Ruston Academy was considered the premiere American school in Latin America. Originally focused on providing an English college-preparatory education for the children of American expatriates in Cuba, it quickly grew into a bilingual academy with a multinational student body. In the 1940s, Ruston expanded to include an elementary school, business preparatory program, basic English classes for Cuban students, and a boarding school, with enrollment measuring at roughly 750 students. In 1955 Ruston moved to a new, larger campus in Havana.&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;

The school was founded by retired English teacher Hiram Hall Ruston and his sister Martha Ruston, of Princeton, Indiana. Mr. Ruston served as headmaster from 1920 to his death in 1946, after which James Baker took over the school's administration. James and his wife Sibyl inherited ownership of the school and converted it into an educational non-profit foundation. Ruston Academy was closed down by the Castro government in 1961. Its former location was used as a public school, storage facility, homeless shelter, and military intelligence facility by the Cuban government.&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;

The Ruston-Baker Educational Institution (RBEI) was founded in 1992 by James Baker and former members of the Ruston Academy Board of Directors, with the goal of reopening Ruston Academy following the collapse of the Castro government. The RBEI maintains a network of alumni located across the globe. Sibyl Baker died in 1993 and James Baker died in 2001.&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;

'''Secular education''' is a system of public education in countries with a [[secular]] government or [[separation of church and state|separation]] between [[religion]] and [[Sovereign state|state]].

An example of a secular educational system would be the [[Education in France|French public educational system]], where [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|conspicuous religious symbols]] have been banned in schools. 
While some religious groups are hostile to secularism and see such measures as promoting [[atheism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionislam.com/homed/response.htm The Islamic Response to the Secular Educational System]&lt;/ref&gt; other citizens claim that the display of any religious symbol constitutes an infringement of the [[separation of church and state]] and a discrimination against atheist, agnostic and non-religious people.

==Actions and controversies==

'''Social Purpose Education''' was developed at [[Northern College for Residential and Community Adult Education|The Northern College for Residential and Community Adult Education]] by Lou Mycroft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashmore|first1=Lyn|last2=Robinson|first2=Denise|title=Learning, Teaching and Development|date=2014|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd.|location=London|isbn=1446282120|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daley|first1=Maire|last2=Orr|first2=Kevin|last3=Petrie|first3=Joel|title=Further Education and the Twelve Dancing Princesses|date=2015|publisher=Trentham Books|location=London|isbn=1858566401|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the TeachNorthern teacher education team in 2010.  The [[Workers Educational Association]] also use the term to describe a similar, empowerment approach to adult education.

Social Purpose Education as a [[pedagogy]] is concerned with social change via the growth in confidence, agency and self-belief of individuals.  As such, it can be said to be in the tradition of [[transformational leadership]], rather than the [[transformational learning]] of [[Jack Mezirow]], as the desired impact is intended to be on communities, rather than remaining within the individual. This makes it a particularly effective pedagogy for [[workforce development]] programmes.  Social Purpose Education combines [[pro-social]] pedagogies such as [[Thinking Environment|The Thinking Environment]], [[Restorative practices|Restorative Practice]], [[Philosophy for Children|Community Philosophy]] and [[Nonviolent Communication|Non-Violent Communication]] with open digital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=David|title=Open: how we'll work, live and learn in the future|date=2013|publisher=Crux Publishing|location=London|isbn=1909979015|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; approaches, designed to build "communities of praxis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daley|first1=Maire|last2=Orr|first2=Kevin|last3=Petrie|first3=Joel|title=Further Education and the Twelve Dancing Princesses|date=2015|publisher=Trentham Books|location=London|isbn=1858566401|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;".  It comprises four cornerstones of praxis: [[File:Social Purpose Cornerstones.jpg|thumb|Social Purpose Cornerstones]]

'''1. Teaching (to) Your Values'''
Social Purpose Education is explicitly values-based.  Participants are invited to regularly check in with their personal values and how these connect with practice principles. The language of values continues to be explicated throughout. Values work is the cornerstone of any [[Transformational leadership|transformational education]] programme, such as the [[Thinking Environment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kline|first1=Nancy|title=More Time to Think|date=2009|publisher=Fisher King|location=Burley in Wharfedale|isbn=1906377103|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training for Transformation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hope|first1=Anne|last2=Kimmel|first2=Sally|title=Training for Transformation in Practice|date=2014|publisher=Practical Action Publishing|location=London|isbn=1853398322|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Freirean based education (see, for example, the Paulo Freire Institute and [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Center]]).

'''2.  Reflexive Practice'''
Reflexion is defined as a broader practice than the commonly understood [[Human self-reflection|practice reflection]]. Introspection is cut with making connections with theory and with the experience of other participants (students, colleagues), leading to an experience of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] which avoids [[solipsism]] and connects with broader social, political and economic factors. In this way, it leans towards the 'Four Lenses' work of [[Stephen Brookfield]].

'''3.  Win/Win/Win'''
Inspired by Nigel Cutts’s leadership handbook ‘Love at Work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cutts|first1=Nigel|title=Love at Work|date=2011|publisher=Fisher King|location=Burley in Wharfedale|isbn=190637712X|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;', which is in turn inspired by the [[Thinking Environment]], Win/Win/Win refers to the impact of social purpose education on the teacher, the student and the wider communities of both.  It is an element of what [[Hannah Arendt]] called '''vita activa''', or the active life.

'''4.  Embedding Diversity'''
An assumption of social purpose education is that it has a responsibility to challenge the social, political and economic ''status quo'', by using a [[posthuman]] approach to challenge [[axiomatic]] thinking.  [[Gramsci]] and others wrote about ‘''[[hegemony]]''’ – a difficult word to say, spell or understand but one which has no equal in explicating the cultural blindness of contexts and organisations which, without even realising, can exclude diversity by assuming we are all the same.

'''Subway Academy II''' is a [[Public school (government funded)|public]] [[alternative school|alternative]] [[high school]] in [[Downtown Toronto|downtown]] [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is located on the third floor of Beverley Street Public School, an elementary school for disabled children. Subway II (as it is referred to by many students) offers an unconventional approach to schooling, with a more flexible schedule, and one on one sessions with teachers. The school received its name from [[Subway Academy I]], as it was an offshoot of that school. Despite the name, it is not accessible by the [[Toronto subway and RT|subway]], and most students take the [[510 Spadina|Spadina streetcar]] via the Nassau Street stop to get to school. Nearby landmarks include [[Kensington Market]], the [[University of Toronto]], and the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]].

==School &amp; School Day==
Students arrive between 9:00 and 11:00. When they arrive, they sign in on a whiteboard. Teachers then see students on a first-come-first-served basis. Consequentially, students who arrive at 9:00 may be finished for the day by 9:30, while students who show up closer to 11:00 may have to wait until well into the afternoon to be seen. During a typical meeting, the student will hand in completed assignments, discuss projects, work on new ideas and concepts, then pick up new assignments. Almost all work is done independently. Students are only scheduled to attend three days per week, but they are allowed to attend all five if they like.

The school environment includes a half-dozen computers, a blackboard for group collaboration, a VCR/DVD player, a full kitchen, and a sizable lending library. Subway II is a very small school, and the lack of a science lab or gymnasium limits course offerings. However, Subway does offer a number of higher-level philosophy, sociology and law courses—as well as hands-on courses like parenting and nutrition—that many mainstream high schools are unable to provide.

==Student body==
The flexible nature of Subway II's teaching has attracted a wide and eclectic student body despite its incredibly small size. Subway II is multicultural and has students from every walk of life. 49% of the student population is female, while 51% is male. 31% have a first language other than English. Subway II's style of teaching makes it uniquely well-suited to students who are involved with acting, professional sports, artistic endeavours or other time-consuming activities that would make mainstream schooling difficult.

Subway II has relatively few extracurricular activities, largely due to the combination of an absence of pre-defined "extracurricular time" (i.e.: there isn't a pre-defined and universal "lunch hour" when extra-curriculars can be scheduled) as well as the small number of students (no more than 80 at any given time) and the fact that only two thirds of the students are required to be present on any given day of the week. Subway attempts to address this with guest speakers and field trips, both of which are typically open to anyone wishing to attend, though it should noted that many of Subway II's students have a distaste for "mainstream" high schools, and this often carries over into distaste for extracurricular activities, and even a distaste for showing up when not required to.

Subway II currently has four teachers, for a teacher-to-student ratio of 1:20.

'''Supplemental Instruction''' ('''SI''') is an academic support model developed by Dr. Deanna Martin&lt;ref&gt;Burmeister, S. L. (1996). Supplemental Instruction: An interview with Deanna Martin. Journal of Developmental Education, 20(1), 22-24, 26&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] (UMKC) in 1973 that uses peer-assisted study sessions to improve student [[University student retention|retention]] and success within targeted historically difficult courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/cad/SI/overview.shtml|title=Supplemental Instruction - Overview|date=9 February 2010|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209183416/http://www.umkc.edu/cad/SI/overview.shtml|archivedate=9 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SI program provides [[peer support]] by having students who succeeded in traditionally difficult academic courses (e.g., Organic Chemistry, Biology 101, Logic) help other students complete these courses. SI is a non-remedial approach that provides regular review sessions outside of class in which students work collaboratively by discussing readings, comparing notes, working together to predict test items, and sharing ideas for improving class material. Courses selected for SI tend to be “gatekeeper” courses for first and second year students—generally those classes that have a 30% or higher proportion of students who receive a “D”, fail, or withdraw (the ''DFW'' rate) from the course. Out-of-class review sessions are led by “SI leaders,” students who took the class already and did well. SI leaders attend all class lectures, take notes, and act as models to those currently taking the course. The SI model is used for selected courses at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional school levels, and has been adopted by colleges and universities in the United States and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/cad/SI/programs.shtml|title=SI - Other Programs|date=7 February 2010|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207170740/http://www.umkc.edu/cad/SI/programs.shtml|archivedate=7 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of the SI model==
The SI model is based on a collection of learning theories. SI borrows from behavioral learning principles from [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]], [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]], [[David Ausubel|Ausubel]], and [[Herbart]]; from cognitive development principles from [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]], [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], and [[Writing process#Cognitive process theory of writing (Flower-Hayes Model)|Flower and Hayes]]; from social interdependence principles from [[Geertz]], [[Vygotsky]], [[Bakhtin]], and [[Erik Erikson|Erickson]]; and from interpretive-critical principles from [[Paulo Freire|Freire]], [[Michael Apple|Apple]], and [[Kozol]].

==Effectiveness of the SI model==
In the early 1990s the U.S. Department of Education validated three specific claims about the effectiveness of SI:&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Students participating in SI within the targeted high-risk courses earn higher mean final course grades than students who do not participate in SI. This finding is still true when analyses control for ethnicity and prior academic achievement.
#Despite ethnicity and prior academic achievement, students participating in SI within targeted high-risk courses succeed at a higher rate (withdraw at a lower rate and receive a lower percentage of [fail] final course grades) than those who do not participate in SI.
#Students participating in SI persist at the institution (reenroll and graduate) at higher rates than students who do not participate in SI&lt;ref name="Dawson et al systematic review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawson|first1=Phillip|last2=van der Meer|first2=Jacques|last3=Skalicky|first3=Jane|last4=Cowley|first4=Kym|title=On the Effectiveness of Supplemental Instruction A Systematic Review of Supplemental Instruction and Peer-Assisted Study Sessions Literature Between 2001 and 2010|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=2014|volume=84|issue=4|pages=609–639|doi=10.3102/0034654314540007|url=http://rer.sagepub.com/content/84/4/609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A more recent review of all published SI research between 2001 and 2010 found studies in support of all three of these claims, and no studies contradicting them.&lt;ref name="Dawson et al systematic review" /&gt;

==Dissemination of SI model==
The International Center for SI&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/si/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located at the University of Missouri-Kansas City in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]] within the Center for Academic Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/cad/ |title=Academic Support and Mentoring &amp;#124; Home |website=Umkc.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Center for SI hosts and conducts regular trainings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/si/training-in-kansas-city/ |title=Training in Kansas City &amp;#124; si |website=Info.umkc.edu |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the SI model and has trained people in over 2,000 institutions in more than 29 countries.

There are national centers for SI at the [[University of Wollongong]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uow.edu.au/student/services/pass/index.html |title=Pass @ Uow |website=Uow.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]], the [[University of Guelph]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Canada]], [[Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]], [[South Africa]], [[Lund University]],&lt;ref&gt; and [https://web.archive.org/web/20031124224515/http://www.si-mentor.lth.se/SI_eng/index_eng.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sweden]]. Outside of the [[United States]], SI is also known as PASS (Peer Assisted Study Sessions) and PAL (Peer Assisted Learning).  Each national center is responsible for supervision and training interested institutions in their areas the SI model.

==Conferences==
Every two years, the International Center for SI&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; hosts a conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/cad/SI/ic2010/index.shtml|title=2010 International Conference on SI|date=7 February 2010|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207170735/http://www.umkc.edu/cad/SI/ic2010/index.shtml|archivedate=7 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/si/2016-2/ |title=2016 &amp;#124; si |website=Info.umkc.edu |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; where administrators, educators, SI leaders, and students gather to share new research and ideas that pertain to SI.

Trained facilitators, using the recorded lectures and the SI model, guide students through the learning process while emphasizing critical thinking and study skills. Assessment is provided by the professor keeping the facilitator in the role as a [[peer supporter]] and not an evaluator.

'''Susan Goldin-Meadow''' is the Beardsley Ruml Distinguished Service Professor in the Departments of Psychology, Comparative Human Development, the College, and the Committee on Education at the [[University of Chicago]].  She is the [[principal investigator]] of a 10-year program project grant, funded by the [[National institute of child health and human development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]], designed to explore the impact of environmental and biological variation on language growth.  She is also a co-PI of the Spatial Intelligence and Learning Center (SILC), one of six Science of Learning Centers funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] to explore learning in an interdisciplinary framework with an eye toward theory and application.  She is the founding editor of ''Language Learning and Development'', the official journal of the Society for Language Development.  She was President of the International Society for Gesture Studies from 2007–2012.

==Background==
Goldin-Meadow got her Ph.D. in developmental psychology from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] where she studied with [[Rochel Gelman]] and [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]].  Before coming to Penn and while an undergraduate at [[Smith College]], she spent a year spent at the Piagetian Institute in Geneva, where she conducted research with [[Bärbel Inhelder|Barbel Inhelder]] and Hermine Sinclair and took courses with [[Jean Piaget]].  After Penn, she moved to the University of Chicago.

In addition to serving as the editor of ''Language Learning and Development'' for eight years, Goldin-Meadow was an Associate Editor of ''[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]], [[Cognitive Science (journal)|Cognitive Science]]'', and the journal ''Gesture''. She has also served as president of the Society for Cognitive Development and the International Society for Gesture Studies and is the chair-elect for the [[Cognitive Science Society]].  She was the chair of the Section on Linguistics and Language Sciences for the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]], and a member-at-large of the Psychology Section and the Linguistics and Language Science Section of the AAAS.  She has served a member of the Governing Board of the Cognitive Science Society and the Board of Directors of the [[Association for Psychological Science]].  She is currently a member of the Foundation Board of the Federation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences (FABBS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fabbs.org/|title=FABBS – Federation of Associations in Behavioral &amp; Brain Sciences|website=fabbs.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldin-Meadow served on the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] Study Section (Language and Communication) and the Advisory Council of the National Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health.  In addition, she was a member of the Committee on Integrating the Science of Early Childhood Development, sponsored by the Board on Children, Youth, and Families of the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine––the product of this committee was Neurons to Neighborhoods, published by the [[National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Science]].  Goldin-Meadow also served as a member of the committee appointed by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel|Israeli Council for Higher Education]] to evaluate the field of psychology and behavioral sciences in Israel, and a member of a Blue Ribbon Panel to advise Qatar on developing Behavioral and Social Sciences (Enhancing Qatar's National Research Enterprise:  A review of the Qatar National Research Strategy).

==Awards==
Goldin-Meadow was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and is a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[Association for Psychological Science]], the [[American Psychological Association]] (in Developmental Psychology and Experimental Psychology), the Cognitive Science Society, and the [[Linguistic Society of America]].  She received the Ten Outstanding Young Citizens Award for Professional Achievement presented by the Chicago Junior Association of Commerce and Industry, and was awarded a John Simon [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellows|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/results?query=goldin-meadow&amp;lower_bound=1925&amp;upper_bound=2012&amp;competition=ALL&amp;fellowship_category=ALL&amp;x=27&amp;y=12|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415025927/http://www.gf.org/fellows/results?query=goldin-meadow&amp;lower_bound=1925&amp;upper_bound=2012&amp;competition=ALL&amp;fellowship_category=ALL&amp;x=27&amp;y=12|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 April 2013|publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a James McKeen Cattell Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James McKeen Cattell Fund Fellowship Recipients|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/members/awards-and-honors/cattell-fund/fellowship-recipients|publisher=Association for Psychological Science (APS)|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldin-Meadow has also received a number of teaching awards, at the undergraduate level (Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching at the University of Chicago) and the graduate level (Burlington Northern Faculty Achievement Award for Graduate Teaching at the University of Chicago), and has also received a Mentor Award from the American Psychological Association (Division 7).

Her book, ''Hearing Gesture: How Our Hands Help Us Think'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52134892|title=Hearing gesture : how our hands help us think|last=Susan.|first=Goldin-Meadow,|date=2003|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674018372|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=52134892}}&lt;/ref&gt; received the Cognitive Development Society book award.

Goldin-Meadow presented the Nijmegen Lectures at the [[Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics]] in the Netherlands, and has served as an APA Distinguished Scientist Lecturer, an APS William James Distinguished Lecturer, and an APA Master Lecturer.  She has given a number of named lectures––the Boyd McCandless Lecture, the James and Eleanor Gibson Lecture, the Hersh Leibowitz Lecture, the Spiker Memorial Lecture, and the J. R. Kantor Lecture.

==Research interests==
Goldin-Meadow’s experience at the Piagetian Institute in Geneva piqued her interest in the relation between language and thought.  This interest continues to energize her research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in mind: Advances in the study of language and thought|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262571630|pages=538|editor=Dedre Gentner and Susan Goldin-Meadow}}&lt;/ref&gt; which exploits the gestures that we produce with our hands to explore two fundamental questions.

# Which properties of language are so fundamental to human language that they will appear in a communication system developed by a child who does not have access to linguistic input?  Goldin-Meadow studies this question by observing the home-made gestures, called ''homesigns'', that profoundly deaf children create when they are not exposed to sign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldin-Meadow|first=S|author2=Feldman, H |title=The development of language-like communication without a language model.|journal=Science|date=Jul 22, 1977|volume=197|issue=4301|pages=401–3|pmid=877567|doi=10.1126/science.877567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldin-Meadow|first=S|author2=Mylander, C |title=Gestural communication in deaf children: noneffect of parental input on language development|journal=Science|date=22 July 1983|volume=221|issue=4608|pages=372–374|doi=10.1126/science.6867713}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldin-Meadow|first=S|author2=Mylander, C |title=Spontaneous sign systems created by deaf children in two cultures.|journal=Nature|date=Jan 15, 1998|volume=391|issue=6664|pages=279–81|pmid=9440690|doi=10.1038/34646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldin-Meadow|first=Susan|title=The resilience of language : what gesture creation in deaf children can tell us about how all children learn language|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=1-84169-026-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homesign offers insight into the linguistic properties that are at the core of human language––properties that children are able to invent on their own, and that conventional sign languages are likely to have contained at the earliest stages of their creation.
# Can the gestures that hearing speakers produce when they talk play a role in learning, in particular, in the transition from an understanding that is grounded in movements in space to an understanding that is abstract and generalizable?  The gestures that hearing speakers produce when they talk are robust––they appear in congenitally blind individuals, even when they talk to other blind individuals and even though they have never seen anyone gesture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iverson|first=Jana M.|author2=Goldin-Meadow, Susan|date=19 November 1998|title=Why people gesture when they speak|url=|journal=Nature|volume=396|issue=6708|pages=228–228|doi=10.1038/24300|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in deaf children who use sign language as their primary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldin-Meadow|first=Susan|author2=Shield, Aaron |author3=Lenzen, Daniel |author4=Herzig, Melissa |author5= Padden, Carol |title=The gestures ASL signers use tell us when they are ready to learn math|journal=Cognition|volume=123|issue=3|pages=448–453|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.02.006 |pmid=22421166 |pmc=3594696}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These co-speech gestures reflect a speaker’s thoughts, often thoughts that don’t appear in the speaker’s language (either sign or speech) and that the speaker doesn’t even know she has.  But gesture can do more than reflect thought––it can play a role in changing thought, as part of the language learning process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=M.

'''Technasium''' is a stream in the secondary educational system of the Netherlands. It can be chosen by [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] and [[HAVO]] students. Scientific subjects form the basis of this teaching method. It can be compared to grammar school, which includes the subjects Latin and Greek. Technasium, however, includes the examination subject “Research and Design” (Dutch: "Onderzoeken en Ontwerpen"). Students can start this course from the first year to the fourth year of high school. Schools are recommended to schedule about 4–6 hours of Research and Design class a week, but this may vary among different high schools. In the first three years, the course is optional and is an addition to the standard curriculum. To prevent the students from having too many study-hours, the schools are free to drop certain other subjects. After the third form, Research and Design becomes a supplementary course,  which students can choose within their study program.

==History==

Technasium was started as a project in 2004 by Judith Lechner and Boris Wanders at five different schools in the Dutch province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. Due to a lot of interest from other schools in the Netherlands, this project has developed into a form of education. Technasium can be attended in around sixty schools in the Netherlands, and is still developing, especially the subject Onderzoeken en Ontwerpen.

==Research and Design==

A part of Technasium is the subject Research and Design. This subject can be taught starting from the first class of pre-university education or HAVO (higher general continued education). It is possible to start the course at a later stage, when choosing the courses to follow in the last three years of high school. A couple of projects are done each year within the O&amp;O course. The Technasium education course mostly works with practical assignments, commissioned by real companies. These companies ask the students to design something, to do research on a certain topic or to think of solutions for problems they are struggling with. The students present their findings at the end of the project.
Often, these projects are composed for a group of students. The number of students depends on the assignment and varies, but is mostly from two to four students. It is up to the teacher to decide who forms the groups. It’s either the teacher himself who does, or the students can try to form groups with their classmates. Working together in a team is of major importance and the students learn to do this from the start.
 
In the first three years, four technasium projects are done each year. An assignment has to be finished in 7 or 8 weeks, with 5 to 6 hours of O&amp;O a week. In the pre-senior year, students get to choose two projects. They look for a company or institution which wants them to undertake a project from within the company. In the final year, the students will take their Mastertest. The students can once again decide what kind of project they like to do. Students have to spend 40 hours of work on a normal project, and 200 hours on the Mastertest.

==TTA: Technasium Top Award==

Each year, a national project for the second-year students is launched, with which they can win a big prize. This competition is called the Technasium Top Award.
The event is hosted once a year and can be watched live on-stream. Each group of students gets to show and present their design. The jury decides which design wins the competition at the end of the day.
A lot of technical systems and designs are on show during the day.
The Idea of the Technasium Top Award is to activate children’s interest in science. Their mindset is as following: “Participating is always more important than winning”.
In 2013 the subject of the competition was “saving time in case of fire”. The aim was to think of ways to make escaping from fire easier for the disabled.
In 2014, the assignment was to design and build an energy neutral building in [[Dronten]]. In 2015, CAH Vilentum demands an energy-producing building in [[Almere]]. They want the students to base their ideas on the solutions nature has been giving for millions of year, the [[biomimicry]]. Another goal they would like to achieve is getting the building to be a part of a cradle to cradle system. This means that every part of the building can, and probably will be, recycled in the future.
Winners of the Technasium Top Award 2015:
1.    Calandlyceum, [[Amsterdam]]
2.    Melanchthon, [[Bergschenhoek]]
3.    Cals College, [[Nieuwegein]]

The '''Tunku Abdul Rahman Foundation''' ({{lang-ms|Yayasan Tunku Abdul Rahman}}) is a [[not-for-profit organization|non-profit]] public [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] incorporated by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1966. The primary aim of the foundation is to recognise and encourage the development of youths who show excellence in both [[academic]] and [[extra-curricular]] pursuits through the provision of [[scholarships]] for [[higher education]].

The current Chief Executive of the foundation is [[Tengku Abdul Aziz Tengku Zainal]].

==History==
On the occasion of the 63rd birthday of the first [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], on February 8, 1966, the [[Malay language]] newspaper, [[Utusan Melayu]], launched a fund-raising exercise to set up a proposed education fund to provide for the higher education of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] youths. Initially named the '''Tunku Abdul Rahman Education Fund''' ({{lang-ms|Tabung Pendidikan Tunku Abdul Rahman}}), it gained the support of a broad segment of Malaysian society.

As a result, the federal government of Malaysia decided to formally establish a national foundation and open the fund to Malaysian applicants regardless of their ethnicity or creed. This was made possible with the passage of the ''Tunku Abdul Rahman Foundation Fund Act 1966'' &lt;ref&gt;Attorney General's Chambers: [http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%208/Act%20389.pdf Tunku Abdul Rahman Foundation Fund Act 1966]&lt;/ref&gt; by Parliament on July 28, 1966.

[[Mohd Khir Johari]] was appointed as the first chairman of the board of trustees upon the establishment of the foundation. On April 16, 1974, the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|cabinet]] decided that the seat of the chairman would be held by the office of the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Minister of Education]]. On March 26, 2004 the jurisdiction of the foundation was transferred from the Ministry of Education to the newly devolved [[Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Yayasan Tunku Abdul Rahman: [http://www.yayasantar.org.my/ Latar Belakang] (in Malay)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disbursements, awards and prizes==

===Tunku Abdul Rahman Foundation Scholarship===
The scholarship (not to be mistaken with other Tunku Abdul Rahman scholarships) was established in 2006 to replace a previous financial aid program that was in the form of a loan.&lt;ref&gt;The Star: [http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/6/28/nation/18152282&amp;sec=nation Tunku scholarships increased to 50]&lt;/ref&gt;

The awarding of the scholarship is the main endowment by the foundation and is open for applications annually. Applications for the scholarship is open to academically outstanding Malaysian undergraduates below 25 years of age who meet specific criteria set by the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Yayasan Tunku Abdul Rahman [http://yayasantar.org.my/index/Biasiswa_BTAR.html] (in Malay)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients of this scholarship are known as '''Tunku Scholars'''.&lt;ref&gt;List of Tunku Scholars [http://yayasantar.org.my/index/TS_TunkuScholarsList.htm] (in Malay)&lt;/ref&gt;

After several batch of scholarship recipients, '''Tunku Scholars Association Malaysia''' was established in fostering network and bonding among current scholarship recipients and alumni. More information can be found on the Association's official website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tunkuscholars.org/ Tunku Scholars Association Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tunku Abdul Rahman Chair of International Law===
On January 5, 1985, the foundation gave an endowment of [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]] 1,000,000 to the [[University of Malaya]] to establish an [[Chair (academic)|academic chair]] in the Faculty of Law. This became known as the '''Tunku Abdul Rahman Chair of International Law'''. In June 1985, the Senate of the University of Malaya appointed Ian Campbell MacGibbon as the first holder of the chair.&lt;ref&gt;Yayasan Tunku Abdul Rahman: [http://www.yayasantar.org.my/kursi.html Kursi Tunku Abdul Rahman] (in Malay)&lt;/ref&gt; The current Tunku Abdul Rahman Professor of International Law is Herbert Victor Morais.&lt;ref&gt;The Star: [http://thestar.com.my/education/story.asp?file=/2007/7/22/education/18361562 Big boost for brain gain]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Understanding Comics'' received praise from notable comic and [[graphic novel]] authors such as [[Art Spiegelman]], [[Will Eisner]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Neil Gaiman]], and [[Garry Trudeau]] (who reviewed the book for the ''[[New York Times]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, Garry. "Understanding Comics—Scott McCloud," ''New York Times Book Review'' (Feb. 13, 1994), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the book has prompted debate over many of McCloud’s conclusions,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dylan Horrocks|Horrocks, Dylan]].

=== Sequels ===
McCloud has followed up ''Understanding Comics'' with ''[[Reinventing Comics]]'' (2000), in which he suggested ways for the medium to change and grow; and ''[[Making Comics]]'' (2006), a study of methods of constructing comics.

== Summary ==
''Understanding Comics'' is a wide-ranging exploration of the definition, history, vocabulary, and methods of the medium of comics. An attempt to formalize the study of comics, it is itself in comics form.

The book's overarching argument is that comics are defined by the primacy of sequences of images.{{sfn|Thomas|2010|pp=157, 170}} McCloud also introduced the concept of "closure," to refer to a reader's role in closing narrative gaps between comics panels.{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=70}} The book argues that comics employ [[nonlinear narrative]]s because they rely on the reader's choices and interactions.

The book begins with a discussion of the concept of [[visual literacy]] and a history of narrative in visual media. McCloud mentions, among other early works of graphic narrative, the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], as an antecedent to comics. ''Understanding Comics'' posits Swiss [[caricaturist]] [[Rodolphe Töpffer]] as in many ways "the father of the modern comic." McCloud emphasizes Töpffer's use of "cartooning and panel borders" along with "the first interdependent combination of words and pictures seen in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott McCloud|McCloud, Scott]], ''Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art''. New York: Harper Collins &amp; Kitchen Sink Press. 1994. {{ISBN|0-06-097625-X}}, pg 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCloud also highlights the differences between iconic and realistic figures. Iconic figures can be compared to your standard cartoon, while realistic figures focus more on photo-quality in terms of detail. He states that our culture is captivated by iconic images more so due to their simplicity. He provides a full comparison and breakdown of iconic and realistic images and gives an interesting explanation of his reasoning behind this statement.

One of the book's key concepts is that of "[[Masking (illustration)|masking]]," a [[Style (aesthetics)|visual style]], [[dramatic convention]], and [[literary technique]] described in the chapter on [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. It is the use of simplistic, [[Archetype|archetypal]], [[narrator|narrative]] [[Character (arts)|character]]s, even if [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtaposed]] with detailed, [[Photorealism|photographic]], [[Verisimilitude (literature)|verisimilar]], [[Spectacle|spectacular]] [[Background artist|background]]s. This may function, McCloud infers, as a [[mask]], a form of [[projective identification]]. His explanation is that a [[intimate relationship|familiar]] and [[minimalism|minimally]] detailed character allows for a stronger [[emotion]]al connection and for viewers to [[Identification (literature)|identify]] more easily.

One of the book's concepts is "The Big Triangle," a tool for thinking about different styles of comics art. McCloud places the realistic representation in the bottom left corner, with iconic representation, or cartoony art, in the bottom right, and a third identifier, [[abstraction (art)|abstraction]] of image, at the apex of the triangle. This allows placement and grouping of artists by [[triangulation]].

==Awards and honors==
''Understanding Comics'' won multiple [[Harvey Award]]s in 1994 for Best Graphic Album/Original Material&lt;ref name=Harvey1994/&gt; and Best Biographical, Historical or Journalistic Presentation.&lt;ref name=Harvey1994/&gt; In addition, McCloud won the 1994 Harvey Award for Best Writer.&lt;ref name=Harvey1994&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/harvey94.php "1994 Harvey Award Nominees and Winners"]. Hahn Library Comic Book Awards Almanac. Retrieved November 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Understanding Comics'' won the 1994 [[Eisner Award]] for Best Comics-Related Book.&lt;ref name=Eisners1994&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner94.php "1994 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees"]. Hahn Library Comic Book Awards Almanac. November 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author McCloud won the 1994 [[Adamson Award]] for Best International Comic-Strip [or comic book] Cartoonist. The book was a finalist for the 1994 [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book|Best Non-Fiction Book]].

The Swedish translation of the book, ''Serier: Den Osynliga Konsten'', published in 1995 by Häftad, was awarded the 1996 [[Urhunden Prize]].

The French translation of the book, titled ''L'Art invisible'' and published by Vertige Graphic, won the [[Prix Bloody Mary]] at the 2000 [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]]. In addition, it was nominated for that year's [[Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Album]].

==Legacy==
Along with [[Will Eisner]]'s ''Comics and Sequential Art'', ''Understanding Comics'' is considered to form the foundations for formal [[comics studies]] in English.{{sfnm|1a1=Heer|1a2=Worcester|1y=2009|1p=xiv|2a1=Holston|2y=2010|2p=16}}

The book was called "one of the most insightful books about designing [[graphic user interface]]s ever written" by [[Apple Macintosh]] co-creator [[Andy Hertzfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.differnet.com/Books/#6|title=Recommended Computer Books|website=www.differnet.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{undue weight inline|date=June 2014}}

== Parodies ==
''Understanding Comics'' was parodied by Dylan Sisson in his ''Filibusting Comics: The Next Chapter'', published by [[Fantagraphics]] in 1995, and later translated into Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, Trisha. [http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=912&amp;issue=2016-01-18 "Filibusting Comics #1,"] ''Sequential Tart'' (July 1, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was parodied again, in  Tim Heiderich and Mike Rosen's ''Misunderstanding Comics'', self-published via [[Kickstarter]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Rich. [http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/07/30/kickstart-from-the-heart-misunderstanding-comics-with-tim-heiderich/ "Kickstart From The Heart – Misunderstanding Comics,"] ''Bleeding Cool'' (July 30, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

It gained largely by the fruitful cooperation with the National Centre for Reading Education and Research at the [[University of Stavanger]] in Norway as a partner for the accomplishment of the project "La joie de lire". This transfer of competence made it possible for Vakoka Vakiteny to develop quality books for Malagasy children.

==Main Activities==
The main activities of Vakoka Vakiteny are to develop, produce and edit quality literature in Malagasy for Malagasy children and youth, to promote the joy of reading and to develop the understanding for literature and art in a modern Malagasy environment. Malagasy writers and illustrators shal be stimulated to creativity and the publishing of their products shal be supported. It is intended to promote the extent of literature in Malagasy, to strengthen the use of the Malagasy language in all contexts and to form a forum for modern Malagasy literature and illustration.

'''William Douglas Simpson''' [[CBE]] (2 August 1896 &amp;ndash; 9 October 1968) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] academic and writer who focused on the study of medieval [[architecture]] and [[archaeology]].

==Career==
Simpson was appointed Assistant in History at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1919, before becoming Lecturer in British History in 1920. He was appointed librarian at Aberdeen University in 1926, a post he held for forty years. Simpson later held the honorary positions of [[Rhind Lecturer]] in Archaeology (1941) and Dalrymple Lecturer in Archaeology (1950) at the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/GB-231/type/fa/id/gb231-ms2229_SEMICOLON_ms2230_SEMICOLON_ms2285_SEMICOLON_ms2398_SEMICOLON_ms2498_SEMICOLON_ms2729_SEMICOLON_ms2818_SEMICOLON_ms2968_SEMICOLON_ms3042_SEMICOLON_ms3442|title=Papers of William Douglas Simpson (1896-1968) historian and archaeologist|website=Archives Portal Europe|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although not a trained archaeologist, he directed excavations at [[Kildrummy Castle]], [[Coull Castle]], [[Kindrochit Castle]], [[Doune of Invernochty]], [[Esslemont Castle]], [[Dundarg Castle]] and [[Finavon Castle]]. Although his archaeological findings have been superseded, his detailed studies of buildings and structures remain key documents.

He wrote numerous books and articles based on this and other research, through which he became well known as an authority on the castellated architecture of Scotland and [[Scandinavia]]. He held several appointments in relation to this work, including chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland and membership of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]]. He was a member of the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] Advisory Board and Scottish Records Advisory Council.

W. Douglas Simpson was the author of a wide range of publications on architectural matters, from academic papers to general guides aimed at the tourist. Several of his guidebooks remain in print by [[Historic Scotland]]. His lectures and talks were hugely successful and well attended not just by students but a more general audience. He was a Commissioner at the [[RCAHMS]].

==Personal life==
Simpson was born in Aberdeen, one of four children of H.F. Morland Simpson (1859-1920), an antiquarian and Rector of [[Aberdeen Grammar School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/b3605556-4192-3e38-94d3-2493f7020725|title=Papers of Henry Fife Morland Simpson, antiquarian and Rector, Aberdeen Grammar School|website=ArchivesHub|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his German wife, Jenny Friderike Dohm (ca. 1866-1949). He joined the 4th [[Gordon Highlanders]] in 1913, but was discharged on medical grounds in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allardyce|first1=Mabel Desborough|title=Roll of service in the great war, 1914-1919|date=1921|publisher=Abeedeen University Press|location=Aberdeen|page=372|url=https://archive.org/stream/rollofserviceing00univrich#page/372/mode/2up|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carried out work for the Admiralty in Scotland from 1915 to 1918. He graduated from the University of Aberdeen with a first class honours MA in 1919, and a D.Litt. in 1924. 

Simpson was appointed OBE in 1954 and CBE in 1962. He was appointed Commander of the [[Order of St. Olav|Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]]. He is buried in Springbank Cemetery, Countesswells Road, Aberdeen; his wife, Ellen Dorothy Simpson (née Mason), whom he married in 1935, died in 1984 and was buried with him in the same grave.
