Of Acadian and Dutch descent, Gallant practised as a lawyer before winning the Liberal leadership in October 2012, securing the riding of Kent in a by-election on April 15, 2013, shortly followed by his swearing in as [[Leader of the Opposition (New Brunswick)|Leader of the Opposition]]. After the [[New Brunswick general election, 2014|2014 election]], in which the [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[David Alward]] was defeated, Gallant represents the riding of [[Shediac Bay-Dieppe]].

Gallant announced, on November 15, 2018, that he will be stepping down as Liberal leader as soon as a leadership election is held to choose his successor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.pe.ca/news/regional/brian-gallant-to-make-resignation-announcement-official-at-news-conference-today-259584/&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 32, he was the second youngest Premier of [[New Brunswick]] to assume office ([[George Edwin King]] became premier at age 30 in 1870.) When Gallant left office at age 36, he was the youngest premier in [[Canada]].
==Early life==
Gallant was born in [[Shediac Bridge-Shediac River|Shediac Bridge]]. His [[Acadians|Acadian]] father, Pierre, was the youngest of seven children, while his mother, Marilyn (born Scholten), was the child of Dutch immigrants who arrived in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=MLAbio&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Gallant|url=http://www1.gnb.ca/legis/bios1/bio-e.asp?IDNo=244&amp;version=e&amp;legisNO=57|publisher=Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|accessdate=24 September 2014|date=1 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006111458/http://www1.gnb.ca/legis/bios1/bio-e.asp?IDNo=244&amp;version=e&amp;legisNO=57|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also has two siblings, Melissa and Pierre.  In his youth, he was educated at a variety of schools across New Brunswick; he ascribed his many moves to his parents' search for work, labouring at minimum wage jobs in convenience stores and fast food restaurants, eventually having to move the family into the small home of Gallant's grandparents.&lt;ref name=NBLAbio&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Brian|url=http://nbliberal.ca/meet-brian/|publisher=New Brunswick Liberal Association|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He ended up graduating from [[Polyvalente Louis-J.-Robichaud]] back in [[Shediac]] - his principal recalled telling Gallant he predicted he would one day be Premier, saying, "You have all the qualities of being a future premier here in New Brunswick."&lt;ref name=GNbio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Erika|title=Who is New Brunswick Premier-designate Brian Gallant?|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1578233/who-is-new-brunswick-premier-designate-brian-gallant/|accessdate=24 September 2014|publisher=Global News|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gallant says his interest in politics started when, with nobody else offering, he became vice president of his grade 5 class, and by the end of his teenage years he decided he would pursue a political career.&lt;ref name=GNbio/&gt;

In order to pay his way through university, he started and ran two small companies, eventually allowing him to graduate from the [[Université de Moncton]] with both a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Business Administration and a Bachelor of Laws degree, later receiving a Master's in Law from [[McGill University]].&lt;ref name=MLAbio/&gt;  Whilst at Moncton, he was made president of the student federation.&lt;ref name=NBLAbio/&gt;  Afterwards, he practised corporate and commercial law with the firm Stewart McKelvey, and then became a partner at Veritas Law in [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]].

==Early political career==
His first foray into provincial politics was an ambitious one as, at 24, he secured the Liberal nomination to run against Premier [[Bernard Lord]] in the [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservative]]'s riding of [[Moncton East (1974-2014 electoral district)|Moncton East]] for the [[New Brunswick general election, 2006|2006 election]].&lt;ref name=GNbio/&gt;  Although in the end Lord held his seat, the election was far from being a runaway. The campaign against a sitting premier gave added exposure to Gallant.

When the Liberal government of [[Shawn Graham]] was [[New Brunswick general election, 2010|defeated in 2010]], Gallant authored a paper on reforming the Liberal Party, to make it more accessible for new members and a new generation of leaders to emerge; many of its recommendations were reportedly adopted.  After Graham's resignation as leader of the party, Gallant put himself forward to succeed him, winning against former justice minister [[Mike Murphy (New Brunswick politician)|Mike Murphy]] and dairy farmer Nick Duivenvorden in its [[New Brunswick Liberal Association leadership election, 2012|2012 leadership election]].&lt;ref name=NBLAbio/&gt;  After a successful by-election run in Graham's former riding of [[Kent (provincial electoral district)|Kent]], where he gained a commanding lead, Gallant was sworn into the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|Legislative Assembly]] on April 30, 2013, making him [[Leader of the Opposition (New Brunswick)|Leader of the Opposition]] to [[David Alward]]'s PC government.&lt;ref name=MLAbio/&gt;

==Leader of the Opposition==
Heading into the [[New Brunswick general election, 2014|2014 election]] campaign, Gallant pushed a $900 million package of infrastructure spending over six years as a way to create 1,700 jobs for a province with one of the country's worst unemployment rates. He also campaigned on a tax rise for some of the province's biggest earners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-votes-2014/brian-gallant-defends-tax-plan-on-richest-new-brunswickers-1.2764461|title=Brian Gallant defends tax plan on richest New Brunswickers - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on removing property tax breaks for businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbliberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014-Liberal-Platform.pdf nbliberal.ca: "2014 New Brunswick Liberal Party Platform"], Sep 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal platform also promised a rise in the minimum wage, from $10 per hour, to $10.30 per hour by the end of 2014, and to $11 by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-votes-2014/david-alward-s-pcs-pitch-tourism-marketing-fund-1.2753006 cbc.ca: "David Alward's PCs pitch tourism marketing fund"], 2 Sep 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premier==

On an election night marred by technical glitches with the voting tabulators, the Liberals won a majority and formed the government in the [[58th New Brunswick Legislature]] with Gallant as Premier on October 7, 2014.  Gallant's first cabinet, of 13 members, was less numerous than the outgoing cabinet.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brian-gallant-s-smaller-cabinet-faces-long-list-of-demands-1.2789864 cbc.ca: "Brian Gallant's smaller cabinet faces long list of demands"], 7 Oct 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2015, the Gallant government opened the legislature's second session with a promise to "get tough" on the province's tattered finances. The speech from the throne documented how the province had accumulated a debt of $12.4 billion by failing to produce a balanced budget since 2007. The province spent more on interest payments than it did on post-secondary education, and the consultation of citizens called the "Strategic Program Review" had all but concluded. The province said its credit rating was at risk, and the costs to service the debt if the rating were downgraded would then rise.  The projected deficit for the 2015-16 budget was at the time $453 million. A report issued the previous Friday had calculated at $300 million the benefit to the government of a two-percent rise of the [[Harmonized sales tax|Harmonised Sales Tax]] from 13% to 15%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/new-brunswick-speech-from-the-throne-warns-of-looming-get-tough-budget/article27553200/ G+M: "New Brunswick throne speech warns of looming get-tough budget"], 1 Dec 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Brunswick general election, 2018|2018 provincial election]] resulted in Gallant's Liberals winning only 21 seats compared to [[Blaine Higgs]] and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick]] who won 22. Gallant vowed to attempt to remain in power with a [[minority government]] and hoped to retain the [[confidence and supply|confidence]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] either on a vote-by-vote basis or with the agreement of the smaller parties, the [[Green Party of New Brunswick]] and the [[People's Alliance of New Brunswick]], each of which won 3 seats in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-new-brunswicks-peoples-alliance-ready-to-talk-with-liberals-prcs-to/|title=Alliances start to form in wake of N.B. election|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4482802/n-b-election-results/|title=PCs win most seats in N.B. election, Liberals vow to maintain power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2018 Gallant's Liberal minority government was defeated by a [[Motion of no confidence|confidence vote]] on its [[throne speech]] by a margin of 25 to 23 with the opposition Progressive Conservatives and People's Alliance voting against the government and the Greens voting with the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-confidence-vote-liberals-gallant-1.4888347 Brian Gallant's minority government defeated after losing confidence vote]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallant resigned as premier on November 9, 2018. [[Blaine Higgs]] was appointed in his place.

'''Carlos Miguel Gutierrez''' (originally '''Gutiérrez'''; born November 4, 1953) is an American former CEO and former [[United States Secretary of Commerce]]. He is currently a Co-Chair of [[Albright Stonebridge Group]], a strategic advisory firm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.albrightstonebridge.com/team/carlos-m-gutierrez|title=About Us Carlos M. Gutierrez |publisher=[[Albright Stonebridge Group]]  |accessdate=June 30, 2015}} and serves on the board of [[Time Warner]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutierrez is a former Chairman of the Board and [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of the [[Kellogg Company]].&lt;ref name=lbc&gt;[http://www.latinbusinesschronicle.com/app/article.aspx?id=3112 Strong Praise for Carlos Gutierrez] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218091624/http://www.latinbusinesschronicle.com/app/article.aspx?id=3112 |date=February 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the 35th U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 2005 to 2009.

==Early life and education==
Gutierrez is of Spanish descent. He was born in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], the son of a [[pineapple]] [[plantation]] owner. As a successful businessman, his father was deemed an enemy of the state by [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime.&lt;ref name=kelloggfix/&gt; Faced with the expropriation of their property following the [[Cuban Revolution]], Gutierrez's family fled for the [[United States]] in 1960, when he was six years old, settling in [[Miami]].

When it became apparent they would not be returning to Cuba, Gutierrez's father accepted a position with the [[H. J. Heinz Company]] in [[Mexico]] and later started his own business.&lt;ref name=Answers&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/carlos-gutierrez Answers.Com]&lt;/ref&gt; Gutierrez learned his first words of [[English language|English]] from the bellhop at the hotel where they initially stayed and, some years later, he and his family acquired [[United States citizen]]ship.&lt;ref name=commerce1&gt;[http://www.commerce.gov/CommerceSecretary/index.htm Official biography at the Department of Commerce] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028010914/http://www.commerce.gov/CommerceSecretary/index.htm |date=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutierrez studied business administration at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] campus in [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]] but never received a degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/02/11/meet-the-gops-pro-immigration-moneyman/|title=Meet the GOP's pro-immigration moneyman|author=Suzy Khimm|date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the most recent U.S. Cabinet member without a college degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quiznox.com/2017/01/23/how-educated-is-trumps-cabinet/#FN5|title=How educated is Trump's Cabinet?|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kellogg Company==
Gutierrez joined Kellogg's in Mexico in 1975, at the age of 22, as a sales representative and management trainee. One of his early assignments was driving a delivery-truck route around local stores.

Gutierrez rose through the management ranks. In January 1990 he was promoted to corporate vice president of product development at the company's headquarters in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], and in July of that year, he became executive vice president of Kellogg USA. In January 1999, he was elected to the company's board of directors. In April he was appointed president and CEO, becoming the only Latino CEO of a Fortune 500 company.&lt;ref name=kell&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PCH/is_6_4/ai_113053399/ From Exile to Corporate Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt; Gutierrez was also the youngest CEO in the company’s nearly 100-year history.&lt;ref name=commerce1/&gt;

In 1999, Kellogg faced a global decline or stagnation in cereal sales. Gutierrez's strategy, known as "Volume to Value," was to increase sales by focusing resources on higher-margin products. Higher-margin products targeted specific markets and included products such as [[Special K]], [[Kashi (company)|Kashi]], and [[Nutri-Grain]] bars. Extra income would fund advertising, promotions, and R&amp;D, which would encourage further high-margin sales growth. "Volume is a means to an end--not an end," he said. "What counts is dollars."&lt;ref name=kelloggfix&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/09/06/380333/index.htm The Man Who Fixed Kellogg]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, Fortune Magazine dubbed Gutierrez as "The Man Who Fixed Kellogg", and attributed his success to "taking the slick salesmanship, financial discipline, and marketing savvy that he learned in his youth and blending it with disarming charisma, steely resolve, and an utter lack of pretension that you wouldn't expect in one so nattily dressed." The magazine also added that, "He even makes golf shirts look debonair."&lt;ref name=fortune&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/09/06/380333/index.htm |publisher=Fortune Magazine |title=The Man Who Fixed Kellogg |date=September 6, 2004 |last=Boyle |first=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secretary of Commerce==
[[File:Carlos Gutierrez and Micheál Martin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[US Secretary of Commerce]] Carlos Gutierrez with then [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish Foreign Minister]] [[Micheál Martin]].]]On November 29, 2004, Gutierrez was chosen by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to become Secretary of Commerce, succeeding [[Donald Evans]]. On the same day, Kellogg's board of directors accepted Gutierrez's resignation as chairman of the board and CEO, to be effective upon his confirmation by the Senate and swearing-in. On January 24, 2005, Gutierrez was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate; he was sworn in on February 7, 2005.&lt;ref name=commerce2&gt;[http://www.commerce.gov/opa/press/Secretary_Gutierrez/2005_Releases/February/07_Gutierrez_Sworn_in.htm Gutierrez Sworn In] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050715085444/http://www.commerce.gov/opa/press/Secretary_Gutierrez/2005_Releases/February/07_Gutierrez_Sworn_in.htm |date=July 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wh&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/11/20041129-2.html Official White House announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Secretary of Commerce, Gutierrez also served as co-chair of the U.S. [[Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba]].&lt;ref name=assistance&gt;[http://utc.com/utc/Governance/Carlos_Gutierrez.html U.S Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207132302/http://utc.com/utc/Governance/Carlos_Gutierrez.html |date=December 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary Gutierrez was actively involved in U.S.-Cuba policy alongside Co-Chair Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Gutierrez was also one of the President’s point men working with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation, an issue he sees as one of the greatest domestic social issues of our time. He believes a successful immigration solution must focus first on securing our borders, but must also address immigrants' contribution to our economy and the importance of American unity.&lt;ref name=commerce1/&gt;

Gutierrez played a key role in the passage of [[Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement|CAFTA-DR]], a landmark trade agreement that expanded opportunities for U.S. exports throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=gpsbio&gt;[http://www.globalpoliticalstrategies.com/bios/Carlos_Gutierrez.html GPS Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328092425/http://www.globalpoliticalstrategies.com/bios/Carlos_Gutierrez.html |date=2010-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutierrez was also instrumental in promoting the [[United States–Colombia Free Trade Agreement|Colombia Free Trade Agreement]]. In 2006 Gutierrez called for Congress to “work with us and pass the pending Free Trade Agreements with Colombia, Korea and Panama, so we can have fair, two-way trade with our allies and friends.”&lt;ref name=FTAs&gt;[http://www.commerce.gov/NewsRoom/PressReleases_FactSheets/PROD01_006784 Commerce Department Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113042302/http://www.commerce.gov/NewsRoom/PressReleases_FactSheets/PROD01_006784 |date=November 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also led the first-ever domestic trade mission to the Gulf region in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name=commerceblog&gt;[http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2010/07/23/secretary-locke-unveils-official-portrait-former-secretary-carlos-m-gutierrez Secretary Locke Unveils Official Portrait of Former Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, [[Ken Silverstein]], the Washington editor of [[Harper's Magazine]], reported that Gutierrez had [[Adnan Oktar]]'s ''[[Atlas of Creation]]'', a book that advocates [[Islamic creationism]] and blames [[Charles Darwin]] for modern terrorism, including the [[9/11 attacks]], for display on a stand at the entrance to his U.S. government office. Gutierrez's office did not respond when asked whether the book had been purchased or mailed unsolicited to his office.&lt;ref name=harpers&gt;{{cite web| url=harpers.org/archive/2007/12/hbc-90001865 |publisher=Harper's Magazine|title=New Theory Uncovered in Commerce Secretary Gutierrez’s waiting room: Darwin behind 9/11|date=December 6, 2007|last=Silverstein |first=Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Bush administration==
Gutierrez was the founder and Chairman of [[Global Political Strategies]] (GPS), an international strategic consulting service and a division of [[APCO Worldwide]], a Washington-based global communications firm.&lt;ref name=gps&gt;[http://www.azdailysun.com/news/opinion/columnists/article_6f45946d-4cb4-553f-b3e9-5d22e9c355c0.html Global Political Strategies]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Gutierrez was named a Scholar at the [[University of Miami]]’s Institute For Cuban And Cuban American Studies.&lt;ref name=scholar&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1,1770,2593-1;65917-3,00.html The University of Miami's Institute for Cuban and Cuban American Studies]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503001303/http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1%2C1770%2C2593-1%3B65917-3%2C00.html |date=May 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, he joined the university's board of trustees.&lt;ref name=trustee&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100121224921/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUS205209+27-Apr-2009+BW20090427 National Trustee to the University of Miami]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Meridian International Center,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meridian.org/board/&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a member of the Board of Trustees of the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]&lt;ref name=Woodrow&gt;[http://utc.com/utc/Governance/Carlos_Gutierrez.html Board of Trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207132302/http://utc.com/utc/Governance/Carlos_Gutierrez.html |date=December 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bipartisan Debt Reduction Task Force.&lt;ref name=commerceblog /&gt;

On February 21, 2009, the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that Gutierrez remained unemployed, along with a significant majority of George W. Bush's 3,000 political appointees who were seeking full-time employment.&lt;ref name=busact/&gt;&lt;ref name=busact2&gt;[http://www.ockhamresearch.com/Financial-News/Closing-Bell/Recap/2009-Mar-19 CNBC]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article, 25% to 30% of those officials had found new jobs, a statistic notably lower than when [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H.W. Bush]], and [[Bill Clinton]] left the White House. The article notes that "at least half those presidents' senior staffers landed employment within a month after the administration ended." Gutierrez commented that, "This is not a great time for anyone to be job hunting, including numerous former political appointees." He added that he hopes to run a company like Kellogg again because "I have a lot of energy."&lt;ref name=wsj223&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123518630430139343?mod=igoogle_wsj_gadgv1&amp; Jobs Still Elude Some Bush Ex-Officials]&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a press release from [[United Technologies Corporation]],&lt;ref name=busact&gt;[http://www.utc.com/utc/news/News_Details/2009/2009-02-09a.html?page=1&amp;year=0 Carlos M.

Baker has two brothers and three sisters.

After completing his elementary education in Haiti, he traveled to the United States. In 1972 he graduated from [[Redondo Union High School]] in [[Redondo Beach, California]]. He later attended [[Saint Leo University]] in Florida, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration in 1976. In 1975, he married Marie Florence Apaid, sister of [[André Apaid]]. He has four children and seven grandchildren.&lt;ref name="charleshenribaker.com"&gt;http://charleshenribaker.com/about/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

Baker began his business career as a manager at the age 21 in his family-owned and operated supermarket chain. When his father became ill, he took over the family-owned 90-acre farm Habitation Dujour, which grew sugarcane, banana, and tobacco. Eventually, the land expanded another 120 acres which made it the largest flue-cured tobacco farm in Haiti, with more than 200 acres. Simultaneously, from 1982 to 1985 he worked with the tobacco growers of Haiti through the [[Comme il faut]] Company, where he held the position of Assistant to the Leaf Growing Manager.&lt;ref name="charleshenribaker.com"/&gt;

Beginning in the late 1980s, Baker purchased a garment factory, Pantalon Boucanier S.A.. This factory, which is monitored by Betterworks an affiliate of OIT, adheres to strict international standards. It employs hundreds of Haitians who are paid the minimum salary required by Haitian law. It has set up an incentive program which permits workers to make 50% more than the minimum salary while getting the 25% benefits required by Haitian law. Baker sells the garments produced in these factories to major corporations such as [[Walmart]] and [[K-Mart]].

In 2000, he joined the Association des Industries d’Haïti as a member and a year later became its vice president.&lt;ref name="charleshenribaker.com"/&gt;

Baker was a prominent member of the [[Group of 184]] (G 184), a coalition of Haitian organizations opposing Haitian President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. The group's actions contributed to the [[US]] orchestrated coup d'état against Aristide in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/03/01/haitian-election-aftermath/ The Puzzling Alliance of Chavannes Jean-Baptiste and Charles Henri Baker, CounterPunch, March 1, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|right|thumb|300px|An example of a charter ([[Magna Carta]]).]]
A '''charter''' is  the grant of [[authority]] or [[rights]], stating that the granter formally recognizes the [[prerogative]] of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or [[sovereignty]]), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and that sense is retained in modern usage of the term.

The word entered the [[English language]] from the [[Old French]] ''charte'', via [[Latin]] ''charta'', and ultimately from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] χάρτης (''khartes'', meaning "layer of papyrus"). It has come to be synonymous with a document that sets out a grant of rights or privileges.

== Colloquial usages ==
The term is used for a special case (or as an exception) to an institutional '''charter'''. A  [[charter school]], for example, is one that has different rules, regulations, and statutes from a state school.

'''Charter''' is sometimes used as a synonym for "tool" or "lease", as in the "charter" of a [[charter bus|bus]] or [[charter boat|boat]] or [[charter plane|plane]] by an organization, intended for a similar group destination.

A '''charter member''' of an organization is an original member; that is, one who became a member when the organization received its charter.

==Different types of charters==
===Anglo-Saxon charters===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon charters}}
[[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] charters are documents from the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|early medieval period]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] which typically make a grant of [[Real Estate|land]] or record a privilege. They are usually written on [[parchment]], in [[Latin]] but often with sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s; the oldest surviving charters granted land to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], but from the 8th century surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to [[lay person|lay people]].

===Charter colony===
{{main|Charter colony}}
The [[British Empire]] used three main types of colonies as it sought to expand its territory to distant parts of the earth. These three types were royal colonies, [[proprietary colonies]], and corporate colonies. A charter colony by definition is a "colony chartered to an individual, trading company, etc., by the [[British crown]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/charter%20colony charter colony - Definitions from Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Although charter colonies were not the most prevalent of the three types of colonies in the British Empire, they were by no means insignificant.

===Congressional charter===
{{main|Congressional charter}}
A '''congressional charter''' is a law passed by the [[United States Congress]] that states the mission, authority, and activities of a group. Congress issued federal charters from 1791 until 1992 under [[Title 36 of the United States Code]].

===Municipal charter===
{{main|Municipal charter}}
A '''municipal corporation''' is the legal term for a [[local government|local governing body]], including (but not necessarily limited to) [[city|cities]], [[county|counties]], [[town]]s, [[township]]s, [[charter township]]s, [[village]]s, and [[borough]]s. '''Municipal incorporation''' occurs when such [[municipality|municipalities]] become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a municipal charter.

=== Order charter ===
Charters for [[chivalric order]]s and other orders, such as the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].

===Project charter===
{{main|Project charter}}
In [[project management]], a '''project charter''' or '''project definition''' (sometimes called the [[terms of reference]]) is a statement of the scope, objectives and participants in a project. It provides a preliminary delineation of roles and responsibilities, outlines the project objectives, identifies the main stakeholders, and defines the authority of the project manager.  It serves as a reference of authority for the future of the project.

===Royal charter===
{{main|Royal charter}}
In medieval Europe, royal charters were used to create cities (i.e., localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter was granted is considered to be when a city was "founded", regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled.

At one time a royal charter was the only way in which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for [[limited company|limited companies]]) are generally now used instead.

===Inspeximus charter===
A charter of "Inspeximus" (Latin, literally "We have inspected") is frequently a royal charter, by which an earlier charter or series of charters relating to a particular foundation (such as a monastery or a guild) was recited and incorporated into a new charter, usually in order to confirm and renew its validity under present authority. Where the original documents are lost, an inspeximus charter may sometimes preserve their texts and lists of witnesses.

Garnica attended Instituto Antonia Mayllen, a private [[Catholic school]] in the [[Historic district|historic center]] of León.&lt;ref name="MKrusePolitico03192015"/&gt;

Columba Bush has been active in promoting the arts. In 1999, she worked with Arts for a Complete Education/Florida Alliance for Arts Education (ACE/FAAE) to create ''Arts for Life!'', a program devoted to increasing the importance of art in the education system.&lt;ref name="laopinion"/&gt;

As First Lady she put together various art exhibitions focusing on [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Diego Rivera]], and [[Frida Kahlo]], and Florida artists.&lt;ref name="HRosinAtlanticJun2015"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14685">'''Configuration Lifecycle Management (CLM)''' is the management of all [[Knowledge-based configuration|product configuration definitions]] and configurations across all involved [[business process]]es applied throughout the lifecycle of a product.&lt;ref name="Configit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Configit|title=Configit|url=http://www.configit.com|website=Configit|publisher=Configit|accessdate=12 December 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the concept of CLM has been prompted by the proliferation of configuration capabilities in different [[enterprise system]]s and a subsequent need to establish a master system of records for product definition logic and configurations, especially for [[manufacturing]] companies that rely on [[business process]]es related to [[Build to order|assemble-to-order]] or [[mass customization]].&lt;ref name="Batchelor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batchelor|first1=Joy|last2=Andersen|first2=Henrik Reif|title=Bridging the Product Configuration Gap Between PLM and ERP – An Automotive Case Study|journal=Bridging the Product Configuration Gap Between PLM and ERP – An Automotive Case Study, University of Manchester, U.K.|date=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CLM differs from other business disciplines as it focuses on cross functional use of information of configurable products.&lt;ref name="Configit" /&gt; This entails that users of CLM include both back-office [[engineer]]s, [[Comptroller|financial controllers]] among others, and [[marketing]], sales and customers.&lt;ref name=Stjepandic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stjepandić|first1=J.|last2=Wognum|first2=N.|last3=Verhagen|first3=J.

The Concept of Configuration Lifecycle Management (CLM) was introduced in 2012 by Joy Batchelor and Henrik Reif Andersen following [[Tata Motors|TATA Motors’]] acquisition of the [[Automotive industry|automotive]] [[Manufacturing|manufacturer]] [[Jaguar Land Rover]] (JLR)&lt;ref name=Batchelor /&gt; and JLR’s subsequent search for a future platform to handle configuration of vehicles throughout the enterprise.

Following an evaluation and decision to deploy a new [[Enterprise resource planning|Enterprise Resource Planning]] system and a [[Product lifecycle|Product Lifecycle Management]] system, both of which have rule authoring and configuration capabilities each developed for different purposes, JLR saw an opportunity to introduce a new rule authoring and configuration management system to avoid unnecessary duplication of configuration activities and subsequent errors due to misaligned configuration rules.&lt;ref name=Configit /&gt;

[[File:Signed CLM-Declatation.png|framed|right|Figure 1: Signed CLM Declaration&lt;ref name=CLMDeclaration /&gt;]]

The ''CLM Summit'' hosted by the company ''Configit'' for [[Automotive]] and [[Industrial machinery|Industrial Machinery]] in 2015 identified a general need to change the current disconnected way of defining product configuration logic and issued the so-called ''2015 CLM Declaration''&lt;ref name="CLMDeclaration"&gt;{{cite web|title=CLM Declaration|url=http://clmsummit.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CLM_Declaration_2015.pdf|website=CLM Summit Web Site|publisher=CLM Summit|accessdate=Oct 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a non-scientific paper reflecting a common agreement of the summit participants on CLM.

== Challenges addressed by CLM ==

According to the CLM Declaration, CLM should address the following complex configuration challenges:
* Provides a Single Source of Truth for Configurable [[Data]]: structures and stores information as one valid data source
* Administers [[Analytics]] and Planning: supports product rationalization and creates transparency in the supply chain
* Streamlines [[Project portfolio management|Product Portfolios]]: defines variety and feature options of global product presentation to regional markets in an efficient and effective manner
* Maintains an Enterprise Platform for Data Sharing: delivers an integrated and seamless flow between multiple connecting systems
* Implements Process Standardization: eliminates the loss of information between business sectors and ensures common process success and alignment
* Manages Complexity and Scale: handles the ever increasing complexity of configurable products
* Enables Validation of Products: confirms configurations are valid for any particular purpose
* Enhances User Experience: presents accurate and timely information and guidance
* Change and Release Management: controls product changes and updates throughout the entire product lifecycle and ensures relevant updated information is distributed to proper channels	

== Integration with relating business disciplines and systems ==

[[File:CLM System Chart.png|framed|right|Figure 1. A CLM system is the master system of record for configuration logic thus integrating traditional enterprise systems such as ERP, CRM and PLM.]]

Without a CLM approach integrating configuration capabilities available in different enterprise systems is problematic due to the differences in configuration paradigms used to solve different types of specific configuration problems.&lt;ref name=Timmermans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timmermans|first1=P.|title=The Business Challenge of Configuration|journal=AAAI Technical Report|date=May 1999|volume=WS-99-05|url=https://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/1999/WS-99-05/WS99-05-022.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When applying a CLM approach to this challenge a configuration management system that is agnostic to the format of rules from different systems interprets the outcome of these rules and translates, enriches and exports these rules to other systems in the organization.&lt;ref name=Batchelor /&gt;

In the automotive industry a practice has developed over the last 30 years in which aspects of vehicles are modelled using an abstract notion of a ''feature''. A feature is an abstraction used to represent an aspect of a product. It is identified by a feature code and an associated feature description. Features can be commercial features capturing an aspect of relevance to a customer, for instance, the color of the vehicle, whether it is a diesel or petrol engine and whether it has a manual or automatic gearbox. Features can also be technical features of relevance to manufacturing but less so for a customer. Examples are, the frequency to be used for keyless entry, the variant of the exhaust system needed for a particular configuration of the vehicle and the emission standard to be fulfilled by the vehicle.

[[File:CLM Models.png|framed|right|Figure 2. Configuration lifecycle managed through models composed of features that are an abstraction from the physical data layers.]]

In CLM features are used as an abstraction layer between the CLM-system and subscribing systems. A ''feature string'' is a valid (as determined by the definitions in the CLM system) complete or partial selection of features that define a product. The feature string acts as a product’s DNA that is shared by all subscribing systems and processes.&lt;ref name=Batchelor /&gt;

Any CLM solution needs a powerful configuration engine to support creation and validation of feature strings. Historically, there are three generations of configuration engines:

# The first generation of engines were launched back in the late 1970s based on results in Artificial Intelligence going back to the 1960s. These engines are ''rule-based truth-maintenance'' systems. They were pioneered in the Digital Equipment Corporation’s system R1 (internally known as [[Xcon|XCON]]) which was a ''production-rule-based system'' to support the sales configuration of VAX micro-computers. First generation configuration engines are still in use as in for instance SAP’s Variant Configuration module in SAP ERP.&lt;ref name=Marin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blumöhr|first1=Uwe|last2=Münch|first2=Manfred|last3=Ukalovic|first3=Marin|title=Variant Configuration with SAP|date=2011|isbn=978-1592294008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The second generation of engines flourished in the 1990s. They are ''constraint solvers'' using constraint propagation and search techniques developed in the Artificial Intelligence domain. They are the dominant technology still in use commercially. An overview can be found in Knowledge-Based Configuration – From Research to Business Cases.&lt;ref name="Felfernig 2014" /&gt; 
# The third generation of engines have arrived after 2000. They use a ''compiled approach'' in which the full solution space is represented in a compact format. They were pioneered by Array Technology (a spin-off from Beologic) and Configit.

=== Phases in the Configuration Lifecycle ===

[[File:Passenger Car CLM Example.png|framed|right|Figure 3. A passenger car example of a CLM platform where market and engineering configuration definitions guides the customer to generate a valid and complete Feature String which then drives subsequent processes.]]

[[File:7 Process CLM.png|framed|Figure 4. Example of different business processes depending on configuration lifecycle management]]

Behind the seemingly simple process of configuring and ordering a configurable product, such as a car, lie several business processes of which configuration is an essential part:

====Develop====
When developing a new product that is designed to be customized, allowable variants and options must be defined.

====Price====
Pricing of customizable products must account for market acceptability and costs based on calculations of all the possible configurations

====Market====
Market demands and local regulation are expressed as rules enabling enterprises to meet demands in a global market

====Sell====
Customizing to the specific wants and needs of the individual customer resulting in a valid order to be fed into downstream systems

====Source====
Parts and assemblies from sub-suppliers are sourced to fit in the sequence of the assembly line.

====Build====
The configuration determines how the product is built. Invalid configurations can cause the production line to stop and erroneous products, placing a huge importance on eliminating errors before this phase.

====Maintain/Service/Operate====
The phase of the lifecycle known in e.g. Automotive as [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]]. In CLM the configuration of the product is updated, elements and components are replaced in a way that ensures that these activities are compliant with the configuration.&lt;ref name=Batchelor /&gt;

====Dispose====
Once the product has reached end of life and is to be disposed, depending on the materials used in the product, disposal requirements may apply. These requirements are usually reflected by laws (e.g. [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]]). In order to enable disposal of the product in conformance to these disposal requirements, the composition of the product must be documented, available and up to date - i.e. the complete configuration lifecycle information must be available.

== Mass Customization ==

[[File:CLM Many Variants High Volume.png|framed|right|CLM - many variants, high volume]]

When moving towards [[mass customization]],&lt;ref name=Pine&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=B. Joseph|title=Mass Customization: The New Frontier on Business Competition|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost every business process from development, manufacturing through to the delivery of configurable products needs to be adapted to ensure both accuracy and efficiency. The creation of configuration capabilities in today’s market means that configuration data is increasingly likely to be distributed across multiple applications throughout an enterprise system.&lt;ref name=Evens&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evens|first1=Freek|last2=Verhulst|first2=Karel|title=Architecture for product families|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; CLM software supplies the needed functionality for a lifecycle approach to product configuration.&lt;ref name=Batchelor /&gt;	

== Further development ==

CLM Summit is a forum established to further develop CLM as a discipline.&lt;ref name=CLMSummit&gt;{{cite web|title=CLM Summit|url=http://clmsummit.com/|website=CLM Summit Website|publisher=CLM Summit|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Inaugural CLM Summit was held in September 2015 at Lake Lanier, Georgia with participants from various industrial and educational organizations.  The direct outcome of this summit was the CLM declaration, co-authored and signed by participants of the summit.&lt;ref name=CLMDeclaration /&gt;
The date for next CLM Summit is yet to be published at [http://clmsummit.com/ CLMSummit.com].

'''Dance Number''' (foaled March 28, 1979 in Kentucky) was an American [[Thoroughbred]] [[Glossary of North American horse racing|racemare]] who retired having equaled or broken three [[Glossary of North American horse racing|track records]] for breeder and owner [[Ogden Phipps]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedigreequery.com/dance+number Dance Number's pedigree]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racing career==
Trained by [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Angel Penna, Sr.]],  on October 29, 1982 the three-year-old Dance Number equaled the [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] track record for 6½ [[furlong]]s on dirt in the High Voltage Stakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/30/sports/dance-number-ties-track-mark.html New York Times - October 30, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; As a three-year-old, on May 21, 1983, Dance Number won the Grade 2 [[Shuvee Handicap]] with another track record equaling run, this time at a mile and 1/16 on dirt.

'''David Mor''' ({{lang-he|דוד מור}}, born 21 September 1941) is an [[Israel]]i businessman and former politician who briefly served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Likud]] in 1988.

==Biography==
During the 1980s he was chairman of the board of directors of the government development company, Shikun VePituah. He won on the Likud list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984 elections]], but failed to win a seat. However, he entered the Knesset on 27 October 1988, replacing [[Michael Reisser]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexbyknesset_eng.asp?knesset=11 Knesset Members in the Eleventh Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; who had been killed in a car crash. However, he lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|November elections]].

Today he lives in [[Savyon]] and is married with three children. He is the father-in-law of [[Amos Mansdorf]].

The company has been criticized for encouraging the practice of "out-of-network billing", which causes patients to be billed directly and at a much higher rate for medical services. This practice is particularly frequent in emergency room visits, in which the patient has little to no ability to choose their doctors. Researchers found that in half of 16 hospitals that used EmCare's services, out-of-network billing rose quickly and precipitously, and in the other half the out-of-network was already near 100% and did not decrease. In a larger sample of 194 hospitals in which EmCare handled billing, the average out-of-network billing rate was 62 percent, far higher than the national average. In contrast, when Emcare competitor TeamHealth took over billing in other hospitals, there was a much smaller increase in out-of-network billing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/upshot/the-company-behind-many-surprise-emergency-room-bills.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nber.org/papers/w23623&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethel Veronica Mars''' (1884 – December 25, 1945) was an American businesswoman and racehorse owner. She was Ethel Veronica Healy prior to her marriage in 1910 to [[Franklin Clarence Mars]], the founder of the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars Candy]] company.

In 1930, she and her husband purchased a 2,800 acre property in [[Giles County, Tennessee]] where they built [[Milky Way Farm]]. There, they raised [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle as well as bred [[Thoroughbred]] racehorses which were trained on a racetrack built on the property.

==Milky Way Farm Stable==
The [[Thoroughbred racing]] stable of Ethel and Franklin Mars began competing at major eastern United States racetracks in 1934 and following her husband's death that year, Ethel Mars took charge of all operations. Wanting to expand her racing and develop her [[thoroughbred|bloodstock]], from 1935 through 1942 she was a major spender for well-bred yearlings at the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] spring sales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t_EuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1tsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1765,3320123&amp;dq=ethel-mars+saratoga+sale&amp;hl=en ''Ottawa Citizen'' - August 17, 1938]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cesiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-3MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5679,2349730&amp;dq=ethel-mars&amp;hl=en ''The New London Day'' (Connecticut) - July 30, 1942]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, her Milky Way Farm stable's race winnings totaled $206,450, making the Milky Way Farm stable the year's most successful owner on the United States thoroughbred racing circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762342,00.html Sport: Luck and Mrs. Mars], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', January 4, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, her filly [[Forever Yours (horse)|Forever Yours]], trained by Robert McGarvey was voted [[American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly]]. In 1937, her filly Mars Shield won the [[Kentucky Oaks]]. Then on May 4, 1940, Ethel Mars had her greatest single achievement in racing with her colt [[Gallahadion]]. Trained by [[Roy Waldron]] and ridden by [[Carroll Bierman]], Gallahadion won the [[Kentucky Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.kentuckyderby.com/sites/kentuckyderby.com/files/charts/1940.pdf Churchill Downs Inc. - 1940 Kentucky Derby charts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Declining health in the years following her Kentucky Derby win saw Ethel Mars wind down her racing and operations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SopJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EAwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1269,4445359&amp;dq=ethel-mars+milky+way+farm&amp;hl=en  The Charleston, South Carolina ''News and Courier'' - July 16, 1943]&lt;/ref&gt; A resident of [[River Forest, Illinois]], Ethel Mars died at age sixty-one on [[Christmas Day]] 1945 in [[La Jolla, California]] where she had been visiting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1684636322.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+26%2C+1945&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Sun+(1837-1985)&amp;desc=Mrs.+Ethel+Mars%2C+Milky+Way+Farm%27s+Owner%2C+Dies+On+Coast&amp;pqatl=google ''Baltimore Sun'' - Dec 26, 1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George M. Averoff''' (15 August 1815, [[Metsovo]] – 15 July 1899, [[Alexandria]]), alternately '''Georgios Averof''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]]: Γεώργιος  Αβέρωφ), was a [[Greece|Greek]]&lt;ref&gt;Brownell, S., 2005. The view from Greece: questioning Eurocentrism in the history of the Olympic Games. Journal of Sport History, 32(2), p.203.&lt;/ref&gt; businessman and philanthropist. He is one of the great national benefactors of Greece. Born in the town of [[Metsovo]] ([[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], Greece, then [[Ottoman Empire]]) Averoff moved to [[Alexandria]] while still young.  He was known through most of his life for founding numerous schools in both [[Egypt]] and Greece.

==Biography==
George Averoff was of  [[Aromanians|Aromanian]]-[[Greece|Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Richard Clogg |title=A Short History of Modern Greece|url=https://books.google.al/books?id=iuo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=George+Averoff+vlach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAGoVChMIqvLDt6K4xwIV6pbbCh2ilAz1#v=onepage&amp;q=George%20Averoff%20vlach&amp;f=false|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Cairo, Egypt, in 1837 to work in a shop run by his brother, Anastasios. Thanks to his bold tactics and business activities he became the biggest merchant in Egypt. At the same time he participated in banking and real estate (buying and leasing land) while, thanks to his many riverboats travelling up and down the Nile, he managed to dominate Egypt’s domestic and foreign trade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The Greek historian Antonios Chaldeos, who has written his PhD thesis about the history of the [[Greeks in Sudan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ujcontent.uj.ac.za/vital/access/services/Download/uj:22966/SOURCE1|title=The Greek communities in Sudan (19th -21st c.)|last=Chaldaios|first=Antonios|publisher=University of Johannesburg|year=2016|isbn=|location=Johannesburg|pages=|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;, suggests that based on local histories in [[Sudan]] that Averoff was heavily involved in [[Slavery in Africa|slave-trade]] there. In fact, the [[Omdurman]] quarter of "Abu Ruf", where historically the slave-market was situated, is still today named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaldeos|first=Antonios|date=2017|title=Sudanese toponyms related to Greek entrepreneurial activity|url=http://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/djns/vol4/iss1/4/|journal=Dotawo: A Journal of Nubian Studies|volume=Vol. 4, Article 4|pages=|via=DigitalCommons@Fairfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His business activities resulted his accumulating vast wealth, which he used to donate to charity and common good purposes. His charity work included significant donations for the development of educational and other infrastructure projects for the Greek communities of Alexandria, Metsovo, Athens and for the Greek state in general. Among them, the most notable ones were the founding of the School of Agriculture in Larisa, the construction of the Evelpidon Military Academy, the donation to the Athens Conservatory, the donation for the refurbishment of the [[Panathinaiko Stadium|Panathenian Stadium]] (raised by another two Aromanian benefactors), where the first modern Olympic Games were held, the completion of the [[National Technical University of Athens]] and the donation for building of the namesake flagship of the Greek Navy.

The restoration of the [[Panathinaiko Stadium|Panathenian Stadium]] for the [[1896 Summer Olympics]] was done at the request of [[Constantine I of Greece|Crown Prince Constantine]].  The stadium was refurbished in 1895, its second refurbishment in the 19th century, using white marble from Mount [[Penteli]] pursuant to Averoff's request. The cost was initially estimated at 585,000 [[drachma]]s but eventually reached 920,000 drachmas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Modern Olympics: A Struggle for Revival'', by David C. Young, p. 128. The Johns Hopkins University Press. 1996. {{ISBN|0-8018-5374-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Averoff also served as a member of the reception committee for the foreign competitors at the [[Olympic Games|Games]].[[File:Cruiser Averof lithograph by Christidis.jpg|thumb|Cruiser Averof lithograph by Christidis]]

Averoff died in Alexandria in 1899. In gratitude for his generous donations and services, the Greek state declared him a Major National Benefactor and commissioned a marble statue of him which was placed in front of the Panathenian Stadium. It remains there today. On 12 March 1910, the armoured cruiser flagship of the [[Hellenic Navy]], ''RHNS Georgios Averof'', was named in his honour, thanks to a bequest of 300,000 GBP (2,500,000 [[Gold franc]]s) left to the navy by the terms of his Will &amp; Testament.

{{Competition law}}
The '''International Competition Network''' is an informal, virtual network that seeks to facilitate cooperation between [[competition law]] authorities globally. It was established in 2001 after the publication of a ''Final Report of the International Competition Policy Advisory Committee to the US Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust'' (or the ''ICPAC report'', for short). [[Competition law]] experts in the US recommended that increased collaboration with overseas authorities could contribute to the coordination of enforcement and sharing of information on competition policy globally. It comprised 132 member states from 120 competition jurisdiction exclusively devoted to international competition enforcement.

Its first annual conference was held in [[Naples|Naples, Italy]] in September 2002, with representatives from 59 countries and NGOs. The second conference was in June 2003 in [[Merida, Mexico]]. Working groups review different policy areas, such as mergers, or competition advocacy. The last annual conference was hosted by Competition Commission of Singapore in April 2016. The upcoming annual conference will be hosted by Portuguese Competition Authority in May 2017. It will be hosted by Competition Commission of India in March - April 2018 at New Delhi.

The '''International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds''' ('''IFSWF''') is a nonprofit international group of [[sovereign wealth funds]] managers which was established in 2009. It is based in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"/&gt;

==History==

In 2009, a group of 23 leading state-owned international investors from around the world established the IFSWF’s precursor, the International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds, following discussions with global groups such as the [[G20]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[U.S. Department of Treasury]] in 2007 and 2008. The Working Group created a set of Generally Accepted Principles and Practices, better known as the "[[Santiago Principles]]", for sovereign wealth funds’ institutional governance and risk-management frameworks. Following the Kuwait Declaration in 2009, the International Working Group became the IFSWF with the mandate of helping members implement the Principles.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.ifswf.org/about-us|website=IFSWF |accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

As of February 2018 IFSWF had 32 members, including some of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, like the [[China Investment Corporation]], [[Kuwait Investment Authority]], and the [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]].&lt;ref name="IFSWF003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifswf.org/our-members |title=Our Members  |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=9  February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was set up by the funds, so they could come together and create an organisation to promote [[best practice]] within their field. Its focus is "to exchange views on issues of common interest and to facilitate an understanding of sovereign wealth funds' activities and of the [[Santiago Principles]]".&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifswf.org/about-us |title=About us |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=27  September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 24 [[Santiago Principles]] are a voluntary standard of best practice principles and practices endorsed by the IFSWF members for the management of the Sovereign Wealth Funds.&lt;ref name="IFSWF002"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifswf.org/santiago-principles |title=Santiago Principles  |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its member funds collectively have about $5.5 trillion under management, representing 80% of assets managed by sovereign funds globally.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"/&gt;

When established the IFSWF formalized a limited number of partnerships with world-leading financial and academic partners.&lt;ref name="YF001"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-appointed-international-forum-133300959.html |title=State Street Appointed by the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds as an Official Research Partner |author=Yahoo Finance |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural meeting of IFSWF was held in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], and it was hosted by the [[State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan]] and the government of [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="SOFRoA001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilfund.az/en_US/about_found/suveren-fondlarin-beynelxalq-forumu.asp |title=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |publisher=State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan |website=oilfund.az |accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the IFSWF and [[Hedge Fund Standards Board|Standards Board for Alternative Investments]] establish a mutual observer relationship to share knowledge and experience with the objective to raise Standards in the financial industry.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hedgeweek.com/2016/04/04/238050/international-forum-sovereign-wealth-funds-ifswf-and-hedge-fund-standards-board-hf |title=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) and Hedge Fund Standards Board (HFSB) establish Mutual Observer relationship |author=Hedge Fund Standards Board |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the most recently published accounts at [[Companies House]], IFSWF Limited made a [[Net profit]] of £176,758 [[Pound sterling|GBP]] as of December 31, 2015. This included a nonrefundable capital transfer form the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] in relation to accumulated membership fees of £884,194 GBP. The accounts are generated in accordance with the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].&lt;ref name="2015Accounts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09060589/filing-history |title=IFSWF Limited |website=companieshouse.gov.uk |publisher=Companies House - UK Government |date=3 Oct 2016 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberty Accounts''' is an integrated online [[accounting]] and payroll system designed specifically for [[small and medium enterprises]] in the UK. Also described as a [[software as a service]] or SaaS [[cloud computing]] application, Liberty is available to both business owners and accountants.&lt;ref name="Head in the Clouds 2.0"&gt;[http://www.nigellockett.com/?cat=3 Head in the Clouds 2.0], Prof Nigel Lockett FRSA (23 May 2011), retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For accountancy firms it is available as a co-branded solution, including the firm's own visual identity and availability form their website.&lt;ref name="The beancounter's guide to internet accounting"&gt;[http://www.businesscloud9.com/news_analysis/beancounters-guide-internet-accounting The beancounter's guide to internet accounting], John Stokdyk (20 January 2009), retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

A second-generation online accounting system, Liberty was developed by Athene Systems Limited, along with Neil Chadwick — former Marketing Director of Easycounting.&lt;ref name="Cloud Accounting's Pioneers: Where are they now?"&gt;[http://www.businesscloud9.com/news_analysis/cloud-accountings-pioneers-where-are-they-now Cloud Accounting's Pioneers: Where are they now?], John Stokdyk (4 December 2008). retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW), "This independent technology company has been coming up with innovative software solutions for business processes since 1996. Members of the team have worked for [[American Express]], [[Black &amp; Decker]] and [[Ernst &amp; Young]], and they been involved in offering online accounting solutions to accountants since the earliest days of the market."&lt;ref name=Meall&gt;Meall, Lesley (October 2010), ''Online Accounting Software: Chartech Software Product Guide'' p.13. Published by ICAEW.&lt;/ref&gt;

Athene Systems Limited was founded in 1996 by Alan Wright and Paul Taylor, who realised the potential of the internet as a means of collaboration between accountants and their clients. Development work on Liberty Accounts started in 2001, with the initial launch in 2003. Neil Chadwick joined Alan and Paul in 2006.&lt;ref name=Salter&gt;Salter, Kevin. (November 2009), ''ICAEW Accreditation Scheme Financial Accounting Software Evaluation: Athene Systems Limited''  p.4. Published by ICAEW.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004/05 the system has linked directly to the [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) portal for online filing of [[PAYE]] and [[P11D]],&lt;ref name="Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Online — software and online forms"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/efiling/paye/paye_software_forms.htm Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Online — software and online forms], retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as facilitating IR35 income and expense association with contracts and employees.&lt;ref name=Meall/&gt;

In 2009, Liberty Accounts was accredited by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).&lt;ref name=Meall/&gt;

== Technical details ==

The Liberty Accounts system uses industry standard Oracle and [[Java (programming language)]] technologies. It delivers [[HTML]] in a cross-platform [[web browser]] environment, hosted in the UK in a secure data centre.&lt;ref name=Salter/&gt;

=== Management tools ===

Liberty Accounts offers different levels of functionality, depending on the skills and training of the user – meaning that both accountants and their clients can work on the same records, at their own level.&lt;ref name="Leaping into cloud-based accounting and finance systems?"&gt;[http://www.fsn.co.uk/channel_sme_accounting/leaping_into_cloud_based_accounting_and_finance_systems Leaping into cloud-based accounting and finance systems?], Lesley Meall (14 February 2011), retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for closer and more ongoing collaboration between accountants and client businesses. According to accountant Ray Backler, "I work with my clients on a day-to-day basis using the online system and the current financial position of the business is always up-to-date, so it is obvious when additional work is required, and it's easy to make recommendations for additional revenue streams." &lt;ref name="Life on accountancy's online frontier"&gt;[http://www.accountingweb.co.uk/topic/life-accountancys-online-frontier Life on accountancy's online frontier], Lesley Meall (15 June 2009), retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accountants can set up a separate area within Liberty Accounts where they are able to access to cross-client views and a range of reports, as well as highlight key tasks and event dates. "Global account settings can be enforced (for P11D classification, NIC classification, default VAT rates, and nominal codes for export to statutory accounts packages) from this control area, and the system can be tailored with the help of pre-packaged ‘roles’. These help members of the firm to manage their work efficiently, and make it easy for firms to control (and restrict) the menu options and structure available to clients." &lt;ref name=Meall/&gt;

=== Data and functionality ===

Secure transmission of data for online transactions is via a [[Thawte]] SSL web server certificate. The visual treatment is similar to that found in the [[Windows]] environment, featuring a typical management snapshot, lists of outstanding sales and purchase invoices and the current bank balance. "The Windows-style drop down menus mirror desktop accounting packages...Reports are generated as PDFs almost instantly and displayed automatically. The presentation of reports and the range of report options look very much like [[QuickBooks]], so there's instant familiarity for most accountants." &lt;ref name="Online Software Review: Liberty Accounts"&gt;[http://www.accountingweb.co.uk/topic/technology/online-software-review-liberty-accounts-nigel-harris Online Software Review: Liberty Accounts], by Nigel Harris, retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Transactions — such as invoices, bank entries or journals — can be posted singly or in batches.&lt;ref name="Online Software Review: Liberty Accounts" /&gt; "Liberty supports the use of foreign currencies for invoices and customer statements (and can automatically calculate and post exchange rate gains and losses) and as well as having built-in stock control and payroll, it is unusual in offering the tools required for P11D compliance (including section 336 claims)...It captures P11D-related information at a transaction level, pulls the figures together on screen and then produces an HMRC approved facsimile of the P11D form, for ‘one click’ electronic filing." &lt;ref name=Meall/&gt;

=== Value Added Tax ===

Liberty was the first online accounting provider to offer [[VAT]] functionality, including transactions such as [[European Union]] acquisitions, and production of the [[European Community]] Sales List (form VAT 101). Standard and cash accounting VAT schemes are supported, as well as flat-rate VAT (calculated on a transaction basis).&lt;ref name=Meall/&gt; According to David Harbron at the Fenchurch Group of commercial and residential property development companies: "When the UK VAT rate rose to 20% in the New Year, [I] knew that Liberty would immediately be updated to reflect the increase, and that the automatic invoices the Fenchurch Group had set up for its tenants would all go out with the correct VAT rate on." &lt;ref name="Leaping into cloud-based accounting and finance systems?"/&gt;

'''Mirko Hermann''' (5 August 1868 – 2 April 1927) was a [[Croatia]]n industrialist, businessman and member of the [[Freemasonry]] in [[Osijek]], Croatia.

Hermann was born in Osijek on 5 August 1868. He was raised in a Croatian [[Jews|Jewish]] family of David Hermann. Hermann finished elementary and high school in Osijek. He attended and graduated from the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]] and University of [[University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna]]. For a short period of time, after graduation, Hermann worked in [[Lika]] and later moved to [[Čepin]] near Osijek. In 1897 Hermann acquired on lease the agricultural estate "Mihajlović". He was also a renowned art collector and a longtime member of the "First Croatian-Slavonian traded company for the sugar industry" in Osijek. Hermann was one of the key renovators of [[Masonic Lodge|Masonic]] activity in Osijek. From 1903 he was a member of the [[Freemasonry]] lodge "Ljubav bližnjega" (''The Neighbour's Love'') and from 1912 founder and [[Masonic Lodge Officers|Worshipful Master]] of the lodge "Budnost" (''Vigilance''). Due to disagreements with some members and the internal conflicts in the lodge, caused by new political circumstances after the [[World War I]], Hermann retired from a place of Worshipful Master and left the lodge in 1923.&lt;ref name="os"&gt;{{Cite news | language = Croatian | last = Živaković-Kerže  | first = Zlata |author2=Nevenka Drahotuski | title = Osječki spomendan 5. kolovoza | pages= | newspaper = [[Osijek]] | date = 2011-08-04 | url = http://www.osijek.hr/index.php/cro/Osijek/Osjecki-spomendan/Osjecki-spomendan-5.-kolovoza | accessdate = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | language = Croatian | last = Matičić | first = Slaven | title = Masoni u Osijeku: Jedna od najjačih loža u cijeloj regiji | pages =  | newspaper = Kultura u [[Osijek]]u - www.kultura-osijek.com | date = 2012-11-24 | url = http://www.kultura-osijek.com/urbana-kultura-i-stil/masoni-u-osijeku-jedna-od-najjacih-loza-u-cijeloj-regiji | accessdate = 2013-05-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130616154815/http://www.kultura-osijek.com/urbana-kultura-i-stil/masoni-u-osijeku-jedna-od-najjacih-loza-u-cijeloj-regiji | archivedate = 2013-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | language = Croatian | last = | first = | title = Otvorenje izložbe OSTAVŠTINA OSJEČKE SLOBODNOZIDARSKE LOŽE "BUDNOST" u Hrvatskom povijesnom muzeju u Zagrebu | pages= | newspaper = www.culturenet.hr | date = 2004 | url = http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=3932 | accessdate = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | language = Croatian | last =  | first =  | title = Zbirka slikarstva 20. stoljeća, I. polovica | pages =  | newspaper = Galerija likovnih umjetnosti Osijek - www.gluo.hr | date = 2004 | url = http://www.gluo.hr/zs20.html | accessdate = 2013-05-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130616154745/http://www.gluo.hr/zs20.html | archivedate = 2013-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hermann was legal guardian of Terezija Svećenski, mother of [[Louis Svećenski]], until her death.&lt;ref name=essekeri&gt;{{cite news|url=http://essekeri.hr/bio/73-lujo-svecenski|title=Biografija: Lujo Svećenski|publisher=Essekeri|work=essekeri.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Zagreb]] on 2 April 1927 and was buried at the [[Mirogoj Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="os"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Gradska groblja Zagreb: Mirko Hermann, Mirogoj Ž-8-I-61&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammed al Fassi''' (1952 - Dec. 24, 2002), at times referred to as Prince al Fassi, was a [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]]/[[Saudi]] businessman related by marriage to the [[Saudi royal family]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/05/world/mohammed-al-fassi-50-upset-beverly-hills-over-house.html | title=Mohammed al-Fassi, 50; Upset Beverly Hills Over House | work=New York Times | date=January 5, 2003 | accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister was married to Prince[[Turki II bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Turki bin Abdul Aziz]], one of the brothers of Saudi King [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd al Saud]].&lt;ref name=Tele/&gt;

Al Fassi's notoriety stems largely from his 1978 purchase (for $2.4 million in cash)&lt;ref name="Tele" /&gt; of the 38-room white-stucco [[Max Whittier|Whittier Mansion]] on [[Sunset Blvd.]], Beverly Hills, which, soon after its acquisition, he had painted an unpopular shade of green. He further decorated the grounds of his new home by having the publicly visible statuary around the property painted in flesh tones, with pubic hair also colorfully painted,&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; raising the ire of many of his neighbors.&lt;ref name=Tele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Ryon]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-02/realestate/re-15215_1_beverly-hills Article in LA Times], June 2,1985&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979 the mansion was used as a filming location for ''[[The Jerk]]'' starring [[Steve Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank W. Martin,[http://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-jerk-made-detractors-eat-crow-vol-13-no-3/  Article in "People" Jan 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within two years of its purchase, just after midnight on 1/2/81, the house was completely destroyed by a fire which was set by individuals burglarizing the house.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; The crowd that gathered to watch the spectacular fire, was characterized by amazement at how the inside wood, under the copper roof installed by the so-called Sheik, did not allow the Beverly Hills Firefighters to enter from above.  Afterward, when the fire was put down, the mansion was gutted. No one there cheered but may have been relieved that the awful edifice, which had exerted such a poor, kitch influence on the other owners of the nearby homes along Sunset Boulevard, was gone. Eventually in 2010, the home was replaced by two new homes, reflecting the other attractive homes in the area. &lt;I was an eyewitness&gt; which&lt;ref name=Tele&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1418179/Mohammed-al-Fassi.html | title=Mohammed al-Fassi | work=The Telegraph | date=8 Jan 2003 | accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Fassi soon relocated to Miami, joining other members of the Saudi royal family already there, and already provoking notoriety with helicopter commuting and large and unusual charitable contributions.  Among his exploits there were disputes over fencing he erected on city property, the hiring of city police officers to serve as security guards, a lawsuit from a contractor for unpaid bills, and a dust-up over a proposed Big Ben-style clock to be built on [[Star Island (Miami Beach)|Star Island]] in [[Biscayne Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Jaynes, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/27/us/royal-saudi-family-in-miami-shows-it-has-a-gift-for-giving.html?pagewanted=all Article in New York Times], May 27, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Fassi had mixed success as an animal lover; he was known to have adopted scores of stray cats, and to have purchased live birds, fish, and even lobsters in order to set them free, but he was also charged with animal cruelty when investigators from the Greater Miami Humane Society found evidence of neglect.&lt;ref name=Tele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noaki Schwartz, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2003-01-03/news/0301030309_1_al-fassi-sheik-saudi-arabia  Article in Broward County Sun-Sentinel] Jan. 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Al Fassi was arrested in [[Jordan]] and hastily extradited to Saudi Arabia, where he was held without charges until his release to house arrest. His arrest stemmed from his having taken the side of Iraq in the [[Persian Gulf War]].  He made broadcasts from [[Baghdad]] denouncing Saudi Arabia for its participation in the war, for its human rights policies, and calling for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis McLellan,[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/31/local/me-sheik31 Article in LA Times], Dec 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Fassi died Dec. 24, 2002 in Cairo.  According to [[Marvin Mitchelson]], the divorce lawyer for his first wife, Sheika Dena al Fassi, he died of an infected hernia, and was survived by four grown children.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

'''''Nalini by Day, Nancy by Night''''' is a 2005 [[documentary film]] by filmmaker [[Sonali Gulati]].

This film explores [[business process outsourcing in India]]. Told from the perspective of an Indian living in the United States, the film provides us with a glimpse into India’s call centers, 
where telemarketers acquire American names and accents to service the telephone-support industry of the U.S. The film incorporates animation as a way to build in personal narrative in a doodle-like manner. It also includes live action footage which takes the form of cinema verité and innovatively edited interviews, and archival footage that provides contextual analysis to the socio-political history of globalization and capitalism. The film is a commentary on identity in the new millennium that intersects diaspora with global outsourcing. It was first shown at the 2005 [[Margaret Mead Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/programs/mead/films/nalini.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">The '''National Association of Enrolled Agents''' ('''NAEA''') is an organization of [[enrolled agent]]s (EAs) in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1972, it claims a membership of 11,000 EAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=.About NAEA|url=http://www.naea.org/about-naea}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While its mission statement presents itself publicly as an advocate of taxpayer rights, its primary functions are educating tax professionals in best practices for representing taxpayers to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), protecting the interests of the profession, and expanding the role of enrolled agents in both the public and private sectors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Requirements ==
Enrolled Agent status is required for NAEA membership, although EA status does not need to be ''active''. Inactive/retired EA's may retain their membership. NAEA members have slightly higher Continuing Professional Education requirements than is normally required by the IRS to retain EA status.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Continuing professional education ==
NAEA offers [[continuing professional education]] (CPE) webinars and seminars for EAs and presents a professional conference, the NTPI annually. The NTPI (National Tax Practice Institute) is a fellowship of NAEA members that meet very specific educational standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naea.org/events-education/national-tax-practice-institute | title=National Tax Practice Institute | publisher=NAEA | accessdate=November 11, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111034844/http://www.naea.org/events-education/national-tax-practice-institute | archivedate=November 11, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the CE Webinars, NAEA offers continuing education for tax professionals through the EA Journal. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Webinars {{!}} NAEA|url=http://www.naea.org/education-events/ce-webinars-level-1-online|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605233747/http://www.naea.org/education-events/ce-webinars-level-1-online|archivedate=2013-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarships ==
Each year the NAEA offers scholarships through the National Association of Enrolled Agents Education Foundation (NAEA-EF). The exact number and nature of these scholarships varies slightly from year to year but they are available to both practicing Enrolled Agents and tax professionals aspiring to the position. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Organization ==
The NAEA is led by a board comprising two officers and twelve directors. In addition there are twelve independently chaired committees.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

'''Patrick Joseph Kennedy II''' (born July 14, 1967) is an American politician and mental health advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/02/politics/patrick-kennedy-the-axe-files/index.html|title=Patrick Kennedy opens up about addiction|last=Politics|first=Matthew Jaffe, University of Chicago Institute of|website=CNN|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 to 2011, he served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Rhode Island's 1st congressional district]].

==Rhode Island House of Representatives==

While a [[Junior (education)|Junior]] at Providence College, Kennedy defeated five-term incumbent John F. Skeffington Jr. for the Democratic nomination in District 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-15/news/mn-2831_1_patrick-kennedy |title=Campaign '88 : Patrick Kennedy Wins |author=Associated Press |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1988-09-15 |accessdate=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Kennedy became the youngest member of the Kennedy family to hold elected office, when he won election to the [[Rhode Island House of Representatives]] at age 21.

[[File:Representative Patrick J. Kennedy II speaking at a rally for American Indian and tribal unity.jpg|thumb|Kennedy speaking at a rally for American Indian and tribal unity in front of the U.S. Capitol|left]]
In 1994, Kennedy was elected as a Democrat to represent the 1st [[Congressional District]] of Rhode Island. He was re-elected seven times, serving from January 3, 1995, to January 3, 2011 (the [[104th United States Congress|104th]] to [[111th United States Congress|111th]] Congresses).

In the House, Kennedy served on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] and [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|Natural Resources]] Committees before being appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]].

==Political campaigns==
[[File:Patrick J. Kennedy, official Congressional photo.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Earlier official Congressional photo of Kennedy.]]
Kennedy campaigned for the seat being vacated by U.S. Representative [[Ronald Machtley]] (who was retiring) in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994#Rhode Island|1994 Rhode Island 1st&lt;!--cong. dists. are styled "1st"--&gt; congressional district election]]. He won the election, defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Kevin Vigilante. Kennedy was one of four Democrats in the 1994 congressional elections to win a congressional seat that had previously been held by a Republican, while Republicans gained dozens of seats to take over the U.S. House. He was re-elected every two years from 1996 until 2008 and did not run for re-election in 2010.

In 2000, Kennedy considered running against Republican [[Lincoln Chafee]] in the [[United States Senate election in Rhode Island, 2000|U.S. Senate election in Rhode Island]] but instead chose to run for re-election. Kennedy had recently won appointment to the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]], a high-profile assignment that caused him to pass up the Senate race. He again considered running against Chafee in 2006 but instead chose to run for re-election.

Kennedy did not run for re-election in 2010 and completed his final term in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLzr-4MMyDc&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=Rep. Patrick Kennedy: 'Won't Seek Reelection' |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his 8th term at the completion of the [[111th United States Congress]].

==Post-congress advocacy==

Since leaving Congress, Kennedy has written and spoken publicly about his long struggle with bipolar disorder and drug addiction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765622849/Bipolar-and-addicted-Patrick-Kennedy-embodies-mental-health-challenges.html?pg=all|title=Bipolar and addicted, Patrick Kennedy embodies mental health challenges|last=Schulzke|first=Eric|date=2013-02-17|work=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and become a leading advocate for a stronger mental health care system in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.patrickjkennedy.net/|title=Patrick J Kennedy {{!}} The Official Website of Patrick J Kennedy|website=Patrick J Kennedy|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnering with Shari and Garen Staglin in 2011, Kennedy launched One Mind (formerly One Mind for Research) with the intention of promoting the study of brain diseases. One Mind supports better diagnostics and new therapies to advance neuroscience discovery and fills the gaps in research funding by disseminating donor-supported funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onemind.org/|title=Home Page - One Mind|website=One Mind|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy founded The Kennedy Forum in 2013, a behavioral health nonprofit, of which he is [[CEO]], with the mission of leading the national dialogue on transforming mental health and addiction care delivery by uniting mental health advocates, business leaders, and government agencies around a common set of principles, including full implementation of the Federal Parity Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thekennedyforum.org/our-vision/|title=Our Vision {{!}} The Kennedy Forum|website=The Kennedy Forum|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''[[Politico]]'' termed Kennedy "the unlikely go-to player for companies seeking to benefit from the [[Donald Trump|Trump]] administration’s multibillion-dollar response to the opioid crisis". Kennedy sits on the boards of eight corporations involved with the government's response to the drug crisis. He "holds an equity stake in the firms" and "collects director fees" from the latter organizations, many of which "stand to benefit from fresh efforts in Congress and the Trump administration to combat the opioid crisis". As such, Kennedy lobbied "former congressional colleagues to advocate for higher levels of spending".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cancryn|first1=Adam|title=Patrick Kennedy profits from opioid-addiction firms|url=https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2018/04/17/patrick-kennedy-profits-from-opioid-addiction-firms-368780|website=Politico|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he co-authored ''A Common Struggle: A Personal Journey Through the Past and Future of Mental Illness and Addiction'' detailing his journey through mental illness, addiction, and his ongoing political advocacy for federal legislation in support of mental health and addiction health care.

In 2016, Kennedy founded [[Advocates for Opioid Recovery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.opioidrecovery.org/mission/|title=Mission|work=Advocates for Opioid Recovery|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[Van Jones]], a former domestic policy adviser to President Barack Obama.&lt;ref name="usa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/19/he-chairs-trumps-opioid-commission-christie-champions-his-home-state-drug-companies/752822001/|title=As he chairs Trump's opioid commission, Christie champions his home-state drug companies|publisher=USA Today}} October 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also co-founder of [[Smart Approaches to Marijuana]], established in 2013 with [[Kevin Sabet]] and [[David Frum]], an anti-legalization group. Speaking in the context of California's [[Adult Use of Marijuana Act|Proposition 64]], Kennedy argued the legalization movement was "putting our children at risk" and "exposed children from communities of color to more racial discrimination than before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGreevy|first1=Patrick|title=Kennedy group puts $2 million into fight against pot-legalization measures|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-patrick-kennedy-marijuana-legalization-opposition-20160801-snap-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy is a vocal advocate for health care reform. During his tenure in Congress, he joined with U.S. Senator [[Pete Domenici]] (R-[[New Mexico|NM]]) in introducing legislation that places [[mental disorder|mental illness]] under the umbrella of health insurance.

He was a chief sponsor of one of the major pieces of legislation of 2008, the [[Mental Health Parity Act]], a bill requiring most group health plans to provide coverage for the treatment of mental illnesses which is no less restrictive than coverage provided for physical illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rucker |first=Philip |title=Patrick Kennedy discusses leaving Congress after 16 years |date=March 12, 2010 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/11/AR2010031102325_3.html?sid=ST2010031102370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a strong proponent of adding a comprehensive [[prescription drug|prescription-drug]] benefit to the [[Medicare (United States)|U.S. Medicare]] and consistently opposed attempts to [[privatization|privatize]] the Medicare program. Kennedy also made numerous speeches advocating the re-orientation of the U.S. health-care system to [[Preventive medicine|preventive care]]. He has received numerous awards for his health care advocacy, including the [[Lymphoma]] Research Foundation's [[Paul E. Tsongas]] Memorial Award as well as the [[Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society]] Congressional Honors Award.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} He also received the [[Society for Neuroscience]]&amp;nbsp;— Public Service Award (2002), [[Eli Lilly and Company]] 2003 Helping Move Lives Forward Reintegration Award, [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] 2003 President's Award, [[American Psychiatric Association]] Alliance award (2003), and the [[Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Paul Wellstone]] Mental Health Award (2003).

Kennedy was named to the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis signed by Executive order on March 29, 2017. This commission serves the Office of National Drug Control Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/presidents-commission|title=President's Commission {{!}} The White House|work=The White House|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 28, 2008, Kennedy joined his father in endorsing [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], stating that Obama was the "perfect antidote to [[George W. Bush|George Bush]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer |title=Patrick Kennedy to Join Father in Endorsing Obama for President |date=January 28, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/01/28/kennedys_to_endorse_barack_obama_for_president/ |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821211107/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/01/28/kennedys_to_endorse_barack_obama_for_president/ |archivedate=August 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, Kennedy had joined his first cousin [[Timothy Shriver]] in endorsing U.S. Senator [[Christopher Dodd]] from [[Connecticut]].

===Capitol Hill intoxicated-driving accident===
On May 4, 2006, Kennedy crashed his automobile into a barricade on [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] in Washington, D.C., at 2:45&amp;nbsp;a.m.  A [[United States Capitol Police]] official said the congressman had appeared [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] when he crashed his car.

However, the last vote of the night had occurred almost six hours earlier. The standard [[Drunk driving (United States)#Field sobriety tests|field sobriety test]] was not administered, and Kennedy was driven home by an officer.

On May 5, 2006, Kennedy admitted publicly that he had an addiction to prescription medication and announced he would be readmitting himself to a [[drug rehabilitation|drug-rehabilitation]] facility at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Minnesota]] where he had sought treatment for prior addictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miga |first=Andrew |title=Rep.

His father, Massachusetts Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], died on August 25, 2009.

When Kennedy decided not to run for reelection in 2010, he cited his decision on the fact that his life "has taken a new direction". Mark Weiner, a major Democratic party fundraiser in Rhode Island and one of Kennedy's top financial backers, said "It's tough to get up and go to work every day when your partner is not there, I think he just had a broken heart after his father passed away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thursday, February 11, 2010 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/11/patrick-kennedy-wont-seek-re-election/ |title=Patrick Kennedy won't seek re-election |work=Washington Times |date=February 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Capitalism}}
'''Post-capitalism''' includes a number of proposals for a new [[economic system]] to replace [[capitalism]], examine more [[Advanced capitalism|advanced]] forms, or otherwise speculate on the fate of the current form of the social order. According to some [[Classical Marxism|classical Marxist]] and some [[Social evolution|social evolutionary theories]], post-capitalist societies may come about as a result of spontaneous evolution as capitalism becomes obsolete. Others propose models to intentionally replace capitalism. The most notable among them are [[socialism]] and [[anarchism]].

==Transition forces==
In 1993, [[Peter Drucker]] outlined a possible evolution of capitalistic society in his book ''[[Post-Capitalist Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter F.|title=Post-Capitalist Society|date=1993|publisher=HarperInformation|isbn=978-0-7506-0921-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780750609210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book stated that knowledge, rather than capital, land, or labor, is the new basis of wealth. The classes of a fully post-capitalist society are expected to be divided into knowledge workers or service workers, in contrast to the [[Bourgeoisie|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] of a capitalist society. In the book, Drucker estimated the transformation to post-capitalism would be completed in 2010–2020.

Drucker also argued for rethinking the concept of intellectual property by creating a universal licensing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Peter|title=Post-Capitalist|url=https://www.wired.com/1993/03/drucker-2/|accessdate=17 March 2016|work=WIRED|date=1 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers would subscribe, for a cost and producers would assume that everything is reproduced and freely distributed through social networks.

In 2015, according to [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] the rise of income inequality, repeating cycles of unemployment and inflation and capitalism’s contributions to global warming had led both economists and philosophers to begin seriously considering post-capitalistic societies. Post-capitalism is expected to arise with further advances in automation and information sharing – both of which cause production costs to approach zero.&lt;ref name=PostCapMason&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Paul|title=PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future|date=2015|publisher=Allen Lane|isbn=9781846147388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological drivers of post-capitalism==
The emergence of post-capitalist dynamics were made possible through three major changes that were brought by the evolution and increasing sophistication of information technology. A first driver is a new dynamic that information technology brought to the workplace. Through increased connectivity the reachability of employees was improved and the lines between working hours and free time became blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N. Korody|title=Architecture after capitalism, in a world without work|url=http://uk.archinect.com/features/article/149935222/architecture-after-capitalism-in-a-world-without-work?ukredirect|accessdate=25 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the technological era led to an abundance of information that is easily retainable for everyone. While some industries only continued to exist due to information scarcity and secrecy, the market became disrupted by the emergence of new competitors that were able to enter the market and benefit from large sources of publicly-available information. A result of this was the increase in acquisition activities since the early 2000s which tried to counter decreasing margins through consolidation and monopoly building. A third dynamic that emerged from new technology was [[crowd-funding]] and [[crowd-sourcing]]. Crowd-funding led to a new option for corporate finance, which was often achieved for socially-accepted innovations. Crowd-sourcing on the other hand challenged the traditional employee-employer relationship under capitalism as people started to voluntarily contribute to product developments with a distinctive skill, such as programming or designing. A major reward for people engaged in crowd-sourcing is not monetary compensation, but the intrinsic reward of having a stake in an active development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=P. Mason|title=Three dynamics leading to post-capitalism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/17/postcapitalism-end-of-capitalism-begun|accessdate=25 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism==
Socialism often implies public ownership of companies and a planned economy, though it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2017}} whether either are essential features. In his book ''[[PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future]]'', [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] argues that centralized planning, even with the advanced technology of today, is unachievable.&lt;ref name=PostCapMason /&gt; Alternatively, [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]] argue that central planning is key to creating a [[Participatory economics|participatory economy]].

For post-capitalism to come from a socialist standpoint, a political and cultural transformation would need to occur alongside the economic transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Unorthodox Marxism: An Essay on Capitalism, Socialism, and Revolution|date=1978|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896080048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Socialism Today and Tomorrow|date=1981|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896080773}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Marxism and Socialist Theory: Socialism in Theory and Practice|date=1981|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896080765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Robin Hahnel]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hahnel|first1=Robin|title=What Is To Be Done?|url=https://zcomm.org/znetarticle/what-is-to-be-done-by-robin-hahnel-1/|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=Our defense strategy—and we will need one—must be centered on organizing for massive resistance and non-compliance since no elite, no matter how well armed, can rule unless we, the people, carry out their orders.}}

Helpful definitions involving socialism:
* [[Socialism]], an economic system based on public or cooperative ownership of the [[means of production]] where production is carried out to directly produce [[use-value]], that includes a moneyless form of accounting such as [[Calculation in kind|physical resource accounting]] or [[Labour voucher|labor-time]] and based on the direct production of utility rather than on the capitalist laws of accumulation and value. Some models of socialism imply [[economic planning]] for the allocation of the factors of production in place of [[capital market]]s, while other models of socialism retain market-based allocation of capital goods. Some Marxists believe socialism would eventually in turn evolve into [[communism]].
* [[Economic planning|Planned socialism]], a type of socialism where some form of economic planning substitutes markets for allocating the [[factors of production]] and for coordinating the economy. There are various types of planning, including [[central planning]] and [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planning]]; [[material balance planning]], input-output planning and computerized planning.
* [[Market socialism]], a type of socialism based on [[Socialization (economics)|socialization]] and public or cooperative ownership of the means of production, but retains monetary calculation and market competition and utilizes markets as the primary way of allocating the factors of production.
* [[Communalism (political philosophy)|Communalism]], a political theory based on the writings of [[Murray Bookchin]]. Bookchin developed Communalism after he broke with anarchism believing it to be individualist and lifestylist. It is based on [[libertarian municipalism]], [[confederalism]] and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].

==Participatory economy==
{{main|Participatory economy}}
In his book ''Of the People, By the People: The Case for a Participatory Economy'', [[Robin Hahnel]] describes a post-capitalist economy called the [[Participatory economics|participatory economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hahnel|first1=Robert|title=Of the People, By the People: The Case for a Participatory Economy|date=2012|publisher=AK Press Distribution|isbn=0983059764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ends with the proposal of the [[Green New Deal]], a package of policies that address [[climate change]] and [[Financial crisis|financial crises]].

The participatory economy focuses on the participation of all citizens through the creation of worker councils and consumer councils. Hahnel emphasizes the direct participation of worker and consumers rather than appointing representatives. The councils are concerned with large-scale issues of production and consumption and are broken into various bodies tasked with researching future development projects.

In a participatory economy, economic rewards would be offered according to need, the amount of which would be determined democratically by the workers council. Hahnel also calls for "economic justice" by rewarding people for their effort and diligence rather than accomplishments or prior ownership.  A worker’s effort is to be determined by their co-workers. Consumption rights are then rewarded according to the effort ratings. The worker has the choice to decide what they consume using their consumption rights. Hahnel does not address the idea of money, currency, or how consumption rights would be tracked.

Planning in a participatory economy is done through the councils. The process is horizontal across the committees as opposed to vertical. All council members, the workers and consumers, participate directly in planning unlike in Soviet-type economies and other democratic planning proposals in which planning is done by representatives. Planning is an iterative procedure, always being changed and improved upon, that is accomplished at the level of either work or consumption. All information and proposals are freely available to everyone, those inside and outside of the council, so that the social cost of each proposal can be determined and voted on. Long-term plans such as structuring public transportation, residential zones and recreational areas, are to be proposed by delegates and approved by [[direct democracy]] (i.e. voting by the population).

Hahnel argues that a participatory economy will return empathy to our purchasing choices. Capitalism removes the knowledge of how and by whom a product was made: "When we eat a salad the market systematically deletes information about the migrant workers who picked it".&lt;ref name=PP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Participatory Planning|url=http://www.walkingbutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/participatory-planning-michael-albert-robin-hahnel.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the human element from goods, consumers only consider their own satisfaction and need when consuming products. Introducing worker and consumer councils would reintroduce the knowledge of where, how and by whom products were manufactured. A participatory economy is expected to also introduce more socially oriented goods, such as parks, clean air, and public health care, through the interaction of the two councils.

For those that call the participatory economy [[utopia]]n, Albert and Hahnel counter:&lt;ref name=PP/&gt; {{quote|text=Are we being utopian? It is utopian to expect more from a system than it can possibly deliver. To expect equality and justice—or even rationality—from capitalism is utopian. To expect social solidarity from markets, or self-management from central planning, is equally utopian. To argue that competition can yield empathy or that authoritarianism can promote initiative or that keeping most people from decision making can employ human potential most fully: these are utopian fantasies without question. But to recognize human potentials and to seek to embody their development into a set of economic institutions and then to expect those institutions to encourage desirable outcomes is no more than reasonable theorizing. What is utopian is not planting new seeds but expecting flowers from dying weeds.}}

==Anarchism==
* [[Anarchist communism]], a hybrid of [[communism]] and [[anarchism]] advocating (among others) decision making by direct and/or consensus democracy, abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] and abolition of [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]].
* [[Post-scarcity economy|Post-scarcity]] [[anarchism]], an economic system based on [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], [[libertarian municipalism]] and an [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] of fundamental resources.
* [[Anarcho-syndicalism]], an ideology centred on [[Worker's self-management|self-management of labour]], [[socialism]] and [[direct democracy]].

==Other==
* [[Economic democracy]], a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] [[philosophy]] that establishes democratic control of firms by their workers and social control of investment by a network of public banks.&lt;ref name="After Capitalism"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=After Capitalism |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn=0-7425-1299-1 |year=2002 |pages=22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heritage check system, a socioeconomic plan that retains a market economy, but removes fractional reserve lending power from banks and limits government printing of money to offset deflation with money printed being used to buy materials to back the currency, pay for government programs in lieu of taxes, with the remainder to be split evenly among all citizens to stimulate the economy (termed a "heritage check" for which the system is named). As presented by the original author of the idea, [[Robert Heinlein]], in his book ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'', the system would be self-reinforcing and eventually result in a regular heritage checks able to provide a modest living for most citizens.&lt;ref name="For Us, The Living"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heinlein |first=Robert |title=For Us, The Living |publisher=Scribner |isbn=0-7432-5998-X |year=2003 |pages=233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rolf W. Schnyder''' (1935 in Zurich – 2011 in Kuala Lumpur) was a Swiss businessman known for his role as the owner and CEO of watchmaker [[Ulysse Nardin]].

== Biography ==

===The journey of an adventurer===

From the beginning a certain duality inhabited Rolf Schnyder's personality. On one side, his strong organizational skills and sharp analytical mind were typical of a Swiss German upbringing. However, there was also something unerringly romantic, a perpetual inquisitiveness and interest in the world beyond his immediate vicinity.

In 1956, Schnyder moved to Geneva to improve his French. Working in Jaeger-LeCoultre's advertising department on Geneva's historic Tour de L'Ile, Schnyder noticed that people in his office were easily intimidated by orders and correspondence that arrived in English. Realizing the insularity of the Swiss watch industry, Schnyder became determined to explore the world. He arranged to be posted for six months to his company's subsidiary, ‘De Travers' located on Cromwell Road in London. After this attachment he returned to Geneva, but somehow having been exposed to the sprawling universe beyond Switzerland he realized that he had to move again.

Like many young men, Schnyder was infected with wanderlust; he wanted to dive into the rich vivid colors of foreign lands, to eat things with flavors he'd never tasted and to experience new cultures with total immediacy. A newspaper clipping aroused his attention. A Swiss company named Diethelm was distributing a vast array of goods in Thailand and they were searching for a Swiss junior manager. Though only 22 years old, Schnyder instantly responded to the ad and his application was accepted. As he boarded in Genoa the “Asia”, a ship bound for South East Asia, he felt the world opening its infinite golden mysteries to him.

===The stranger in strange lands===

Because of his experience in the Swiss watch industry, Schnyder was immediately put in charge of Diethelm's timepiece division. Schnyder and his sales team would embark on weeklong journeys throughout Thailand trumpeting the merits of Swiss watches. Thus, while the foreign nationals gathered together to eat vague approximations of European fare in their hotels, Schnyder was at street-side restaurants learning the culture and language of his Thai friends. Schnyder's ability to remain objective and not cast a Eurocentric sense of judgment on native behavior allowed him to understand and embrace the culture of the Thai people. Lean and rangy with the rawboned good looks of an American cowboy or a professional skier, Schnyder made friends easily. He began to look forward to these sales trips, as each one offered the opportunity to learn something new about the mysterious country he now inhabited.

Schnyder also had an inborn sense of business acumen. This, combined with fine managerial skills and boundless energy, soon saw him multi-tasking. When Diethelm diversified its activities with a travel agency, Schnyder ended up running the operation. Eager to share his passion for the incredible sights of South East Asia, he initiated charter flights in a leased DC3 from Bangkok to Siem Riep where the ancient Buddhist city of Angkor Wat stood untouched by time.

In 1959 he and his friends took the historic trip down the River Kwai. They made their way through the thick forest from Kanchanaburi, a small town northwest of Bangkok, to the Burmese border. They lashed together a raft from bamboo poles with the help of a local who had plied through the forest to reclaim rails from the death railway built by Allied war prisoners during the Second World War, a task made famous by the movie, “The Bridge on the River Kwai”. From the source of the River Kwai they floated down the river on a handmade raft, capsizing at times on unexpected steep rapids. It was supposed to be a seven-day adventure trip. No one had any idea where exactly they were and how many more days were needed to get back to the office. Being late or absent was a serious offense in a tightly run Swiss office. They got finally back five days late and paid the price – a cut in holidays and bonuses. An image that Rolf Schnyder took during this adventure appeared on the cover of the Swiss magazine, Schweizer Illustrierte. An account of this trip, penned by Schnyder, could be found within its pages. It was the first of many travel reports published in Swiss and other European papers and magazines. In the next few years, Schnyder continued to explore Thailand, Laos, Bali, Cambodia and South Vietnam, where the war had just started.

He also developed a particular fondness for the white beaches around the fishing village of Pattaya which had not yet become part of the tourist track. He invested his first savings in the Nippa Lodge, Pattaya's very first hotel.

===The industrious force===
[[Image:Rolf cresta.jpg|thumb|right|Rolf W. Schnyder on the Cresta Run in St. Moritz]]
Advancing up the chain of command at Diethelm, Schnyder soon found himself in charge of the consumer products division. He was tasked with the distribution of basic goods from companies such as Procter and Gamble and Union Carbide. Ever the keen businessman, he soon realized that it would be more profitable to switch from imports to local manufacture under licence. This time it was his turn to share his culture — he imparted to his factory workers a Swiss sense of education, supervision and the institution of quality control. Schnyder recalls: “I was impressed with how fast the Thai people could learn new skills and how enthusiastic they were about their work. I could also see, in the way that they worked, that there was a high level of manual skill.”

Schnyder also played rugby for the Royal Bangkok Sports Club. During this period, Schnyder learned to run large-scale operations. His boundless energy and his ability to be involved in almost every aspect at the factories as well as his uncanny ability with Thai language abetted his success.

From 1966 to 1968, Schnyder switched gears. He left Thailand for a six-month voyage through the South Sea, sailing from Fiji to Samoa and around the islands of Tahiti and Bora Bora, visited South America and ended up in the head office of Philip Morris in New York where he got an assignment to develop the lucrative cigarette markets of South East Asia. Schnyder returned to Asia, basing himself in Hong Kong during the height of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He applied for a visa to China to record with camera in hand the historical events that took place in the Empire of the Middle Kingdom. Westerners were not particularly welcome at the time. Having a neutral Swiss passport helped. Schnyder practiced reading verses of the Red Book but still got in trouble. On the last day in Guangzhou he was offered some antique gold carvings which Chinese no longer had the right to possess as they had been declared capitalist merchandise. Since no taxis were available, two hotel waiters offered their help to carry these artifacts to the railway station for the trip back to Hong Kong. On the way, the group was stopped by some Red Guards who were omnipresent in town and countryside. They objected to the fact that a Chinese carried goods for a white foreigner. The two waiters had to drop Schnyder's bags instantly and were sent home. Schnyder had to drop his travel bags as well, was taken to a building occupied by the Red Guards and made to quote verses from the Red Book backward and forward all night long. Only next morning was he released, given some tea and a bowl of rice and sent back to the street corner where the bags had been dropped by the waiters and himself the evening before. Nobody had touched them. It took Schnyder two trips on foot of 30 minutes each to get all his luggage to the railway station. He reached the Lo Wu bridge, the border between China and the then- British colony of Hong Kong, one day behind schedule. Nevertheless, Schnyder was met by a large group of journalists who were eager to buy the many photos which he had shot during the previous five days and which were later published in newspapers around the globe and in the important US magazine, “Life”.
[[Image:Rolf W. Schnyder waterskiing, 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Rolf W. Schnyder waterskiing in 2006.]]
Schnyder's job with Philip Morris took him around the world and also back to the Philip Morris European headquarters in Switzerland, where he met Charles and Marcel Stern, the cousins of Philippe Stern, president of Patek Philippe. The cousins' owned one of the best watch dial factories in Switzerland and they invited Schnyder for a guided tour.

As Schnyder watched dials materialize in the skilled hands of factory workers, a blue flash of inspiration blazed through him. He was absolutely certain that Thai workers could learn the trade of dial-making given the opportunity. The vastly lower cost of human labor in the Far East meant that Schnyder could craft watch dials of similar quality at a far lower price per unit which would permit the Swiss watch industry to stay competitive against the lower-priced products emerging from the Japan's Seiko. Charles and Marcel Stern were immediately sold on the idea, but the rigid Swiss syndicate that presided over the Swiss dial manufacturers was more difficult to convince. Finally, in 1968 Schnyder helped forge a joint partnership between Swiss and Asian investors to open the Cosmo dial and watchcase factory in Thailand. Schnyder immediately quit his job with Philip Morris and took the helm of this new enterprise.

Business boomed from the onset with Schnyder and the Cosmo team filling big orders from many Swiss watch companies like Mido, Certina, Rado, Tissot, Camy, Fortis and many others. Eventually even the iconic Swiss brand Omega was unable to disregard the tremendous savings offered. However, as business soared a fractured relationship erupted among the investors. Tiring of the politics involved, Schnyder sold his shares in Cosmo and moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1973.

The Precima factory, which became a key player in manufacturing watch accessories for Swiss watch companies, opened that same year. Aided by a 10- year tax-exempt grace period that allowed Schnyder to import materials tax free, business literally skyrocketed. Schnyder's trajectory of success soared. Soon he diversified to craft other micro-components, including balance springs and sapphire crystals. Business was growing at such a fast rate that Schnyder had to set up offices in Switzerland. These were located in the ASUAG building in the Seevorstadt neighborhood near Bienne. ASUAG owned several watch companies like Longines, Rado and Eterna, and key movement suppliers including ETA.

It was at this location that Schnyder met Pierre Renggli, the general manager of ASUAG, and, through him, Ernst Thomke, who headed ETA. Thomke was fascinated by the opportunities that Schnyder had created in the Far East and assisted in transferring part of the quartz module production to Precima.

===Taking the path less traveled===

In the winter of 1983 Schnyder found his calling, to restore one of the greatest names in high-end watchmaking to its former glory. Why buy a manufacture focused on making mechanical watches at a time when everyone told him this industry was dead? The answer to this question comes from the time Schnyder spent in Asia.

“In China and India, quartz watches were not successful,” relates Schnyder. “That is because watch repairmen would open the case backs and, for them, it was like looking into the back of a radio. In these cultures, the mechanical watch had residual value. Any competent repairman could open a watch up and service or fix it. They could see where the energy came from, they could identify with the mechanical movement. When I saw that these cultures adamantly refused at that time to embrace quartz watches, I knew that one day mechanical watches would come back.

“It is often said, but it is true, that the watch is a man's only piece of jewelry. This personal relationship becomes even stronger when the watch is mechanical. There is a beautiful symbiosis between a man and his mechanical watch. He gives the watch life by winding it and the watch unerringly serves him by providing him time. An almost fierce loyalty develops between a man and his watch.”

===A new era dawns===

In 1983, at 48 years of age, Schnyder returned to St. Moritz, Switzerland to ski and race his beloved skeleton bobsleds, activities that he continues to enjoy today. (He still occasionally wins a race on the Cresta Run, as he did in February 2006.)

“I was on holiday skiing when I read in the papers that Ulysse Nardin had filed for Chapter 11 (deferment of payment) to protect itself from creditors. This was during the Quartz Crisis and many famous companies in Switzerland were folding. Ulysse Nardin had many debts without any real way of paying them off,” says Schnyder. He, like many watch enthusiasts, knew Ulysse Nardin's name well. “I knew of the brand because of the many medals for accuracy and chronometric competitions that it had won. I was immediately interested in purchasing Ulysse Nardin. It was the opportunity to be involved in one of the truly great names in horology.”

However, when Schnyder visited the manufacture, he discovered nothing more than a beautiful carcass housed in the original factory building that was constructed in 1864. There was only one full-time watchmaker named Leopold Berthoud who occupied himself by creating Ulysse Nardin's marine chronometers and deck watches for collectors looking to own an anachronistic but sublimely made piece of naval history. Another person that Schnyder found at the manufacture was Jean-Jacques Haldimann. “It was essentially with these one-and-a-half employees (as Haldimann was not actually on company payroll at that time) that I started at Ulysse Nardin. I realized that if I were to undertake this resurrection, I would have to breathe life back into this carcass based on the strength of our products,” says Schnyder.

His plan for Ulysse Nardin's rebirth was to elevate it to the highest position in watchmaking. “To do this, I knew I had to make a watch that had never been made before,” he explains. Fortunately for Schnyder, the ever-helpful Haldimann was deeply embedded in the Swiss watch industry. He told Schnyder that an independent watchmaker named Jörg Spoering had created a new tourbillon. Rolf was keen to see if Spoering had other ideas for high complications. As soon as he entered Spoering's atelier in Lucerne, a bizarre clock caught his eye. Says Schnyder: “I had only a vague recollection of seeing something like it before, so I asked: ‘Is this what they call an astrolabium?' Spoering said it was and explained that the clock was made by someone named Ludwig Oechslin. He sighed and added: ‘He is supposed to be my apprentice but he is never here.'”
[[File:Oechslin-Schnyder.jpg|thumb|Rolf W. Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin working together.]]

Three weeks later Spoering arranged for Schnyder to meet Oechslin. “I pointed to the Astrolabium clock and asked: ‘Can you make it in wristwatch size?' He puzzled for a moment and answered, genuinely confused: ‘I can, but who would want it so small.'” Rolf Schnyder smiled as he replied: “I do.”

Unveiled in 1985, the Astrolabium Galileo Galilei was a major critical and commercial success. Although the Astrolabium went down in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most complex watch made, its significance was far greater than the sum of its parts. The Astrolabium, a machine powered by human kinetic energy that told time through the ancient poetry of celestial positions, was a sign of things to come and marked “the beginning of a beautiful friendship” between the brilliant leader Schnyder and the poet-philosopher Oechslin. Together, what they would accomplish over the next two-and-a-half decades is, in a word, ‘extraordinary'.

During his years at the helm of Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder has created some of the most original and functionally innovative timepieces in horology. Rather than sticking to ‘tried-and-tested', Ulysse Nardin with the help of Ludwig Oechslin has constantly pushed the boundaries and opened up new worlds of manufacturing techniques and materials ahead of the rest of the watch industry. Ludwig's creative mind worked much faster than the small production team at the disposal of Schnyder. Schnyder followed up his awesome Astrolabium watch with the Planetarium Copernicus, a wristwatch that represents time through the shifting position of the planets in our solar system. In 1989 Ulysse Nardin, in cooperation with Christophe Claret, brought the world the first repeating wristwatch with Jaquemarts. Tiny figures carved in gold move on the dial synchronized in time to the repeater's hammer strikes.

In 1992 the manufacture completed the ‘Trilogy of Time' with the Tellurium Johannes Kepler, a watch that tells time using a stunning interpretation of our constantlyrotating planet. In 1993 Schnyder unveiled the Hourstriker San Marco, the fruit of his collaboration with technical wunderkind Giulio Papi. In 1994 Ulysse Nardin shifted gears and focused on the creation of the world's most functional GMT watch. The GMT ±'s ease of use and pure simple logic has been a revelation to frequent travelers.

Then in 1996, on the 150th anniversary of his manufacture, Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin raised the curtain on the world's most purely functional perpetual calendar. This amazing timepiece has all calendar displays synchronized and adjustable through a single crown. Because of its reliance on special epicyclical gearwheels rather than levers, this incredible watch can be quickly adjusted both forwards and backwards! In 1999 the perpetual calendar received the added GMT ± indicator. Incredibly, all calendar displays were synchronized to this local time indicator. To this day, Ulysse Nardin's perpetual calendars represent the high reference in watchmaking for this complication, a remarkable benchmark that has never been surpassed.

On the first year of the new millennium, Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin created a wristwatch that was irrevocably to change the face of modern horology. Their audacious Freak, a 7-day carrousel tourbillon with no hands or crown, is the world's first example of horological modern art. With its purity of design involving a movement that also gives indications of time, it still stands as the most creative innovation of the 21st century watch world. The Freak single-handedly smashed every convention known to haut de gamme watchmaking and opened the floodgates of creativity. As if this isn't enough, beating within it is the Dual Direct escapement, the first successful implementation of a non-lubricated alternative to the Swiss lever escapement. The Dual Direct escapement's wheels were made in silicium, another historical first in watchmaking history.

In 2002, Schnyder launched the Genghis Khan, the world's first carillon Westminster minute repeater tourbillon with Jaquemarts. In the same year, the Freak won the Watch of the Year award. In 2003, Schnyder and Oechslin once again conspired to change the face of watchmaking with their Sonata, the world's first alarm watch that could be set 24 hours in advance and had a dual time function. Ulysse Nardin in cooperation with GFD developed the first hairspring for the balance wheel in polycrystalline diamond.

In 2005, Ulysse Nardin created an updated version of the Freak, the Freak 28'800 V/h utilizing an updated and improved version of the Dual Direct escapement called the Dual Ulysse escapement. Schnyder also introduced the word's first watch to use diamond micro-components in its escapement, the Freak Diamond Heart.

In 2006, to celebrate the 160th anniversary of the manufacture he has so assuredly led for the last 23 years, Schnyder presents the Caliber 160, Ulysse Nardin's first completely in-house designed and executed automatic caliber. This caliber features the manufacture's Dual Ulysse escapement at its heart. Innovative design allows the plate of the movement to be customized to integrate other signature complications of Ulysse Nardin, creating integrated movements rather than the modular movements that currently dominate the high watchmaking world.

When Schnyder first took the reins of Ulysse Nardin, he inherited the original, then-empty factory first built in 1864 and enlarged in 1895. Today, there are 250 inspired workers and staff at Ulysse Nardin. Moreover, each of these men and women exude a palpable sense of pride that is a singular phenomenon in Swiss watchmaking. With each success, Schnyder has focused on selfinvesting in his manufacture to create greater self-reliance and independence. The living testament to this is a huge two-storey factory plus basement located in La Chaux-de- Fonds. Opened in 2003, this factory of dreams represents the way forward and assures the enduring viable future of one of Swiss watchmaking's greatest names. This production facility, watched over by Ulysse Nardin's immensely capable technical director Pierre Gygax and chief engineer Lucas Humair, offers the manufacture great flexibility in the creation of new products. It also offers Schnyder and his team the psychological comfort of knowing that under this roof they are capable of producing almost anything necessary to the ticking entity known as the mechanical wristwatch.

With his boundless enthusiasm, clarity of vision and the conviction to constantly raise the bar in the industry, Schnyder has done what many didn't feel was possible when he first purchased Ulysse Nardin. Not only did he rescue the manufacture and return it to its former place of glory, but on the strength of his innovations he has enabled Ulysse Nardin to transcend its past and achieve an even higher place in the rarified constellation of watchmaking's legends. In his 23 years at the helm of Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder's personality and that of the manufacture have merged. They have become one. The spirit of the watchmaker Ulysse Nardin has reached out over the great ocean of time to become inextricably intertwined with Schnyder's own great warrior spirit, a spirit that can at once wholeheartedly plunge into the humor of life while taking on and out-swimming life's perilous currents. In the years he has led Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder has fulfilled his fate.

===Family and personal life===

Schnyder often shuttled between Switzerland and Malaysia.  When he was not overseeing business in Le Locle, he was either at his home in Kuala Lumpur or visiting subsidiaries and retailers around the world.  Schnyder shared a tropical home with his wife, and they are the parents of three children.

In recognition of his contributions to watchmaking, Schnyder was awarded the "Spirit of Enterprise" Gaia Award in 2003 by the [[Musee International d'Horlogerie]] for his entrepreneurial achievements and commitments. This award was followed by the bestowment of the "Lifetime Achievement Award" by the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve: Asian Edition in Singapore for his continued contributions towards watch making technology and innovations.

When asked what he wished for when he blew out the 75 candles on his birthday cake, Schnyder commented "If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing"!

On April 14, 2011 Schnyder died at the age of 75 after a short illness. His wife attended the CHT Awards and Ball 2011 to accept the Pursuit of Excellence (Expat) Award on his behalf.

A '''service voucher''' is a financial instrument which allows a public authority to target social services at those it deems in need, and at the same time to promote employment and labour market integration. It effectively boosts demand for certain services which meet social policy objectives.

A voucher scheme will typically start by defining services which are needed in society, but which are being supplied neither by the [[Market (economics)|market]] nor by the [[public sector]]. These might include for example [[home care]], household repairs, [[ironing]], or [[bicycle]] hire and repair. The activities within the scheme will typically be agreed with [[trade union]]s and [[employer]]s' organisations, to avoid concern about the disturbance of [[unfair competition]].

Potential providers of these services are identified, often from among the [[unemployment#Long-term unemployment|long-term unemployed]].

Vouchers are sold to people who want to use the service. The price is subsidised, so that on the one hand the service is affordable - and for instance can compete with informal (illegal) work - and on the other provides decent condition working for the employees (including [[social insurance]] cover, holiday pay etc.). An example of this kind of subsidy regime can be found in [[Belgium]], where service vouchers for house cleaning, laundry, ironing, sewing, cooking, running errands, and transport for people with reduced mobility are sold to people who require these services. Each person residing in Belgium with a National Register Number is entitled to a quota of 500 service vouchers a year, with the first 400 service vouchers sold at a rate of 9 EUR each, and remaining 100 service vouchers sold at a rate of 10 EUR. In addition, each household has a quota of maximum 1000 service vouchers, with exceptions given to single parents and people with disabilities, who may be entitled to 2000 service vouchers, depending on the circumstances. Mothers with their own business who have just given birth are also entitled to 105 extra service vouchers. This initiative was made in order to combat the black market and has resulted in the creation of many jobs. This subsidy scheme allows for domestic workers to be declared and benefit from a legal salary, health insurance, paid holidays, and a pension; benefits that were not all possible when working on the black market. For each service voucher, a domestic servant receives a salary of 22.69 EUR, paid by both the customer and the state. In addition, tax breaks are also given to the first 156 service vouchers purchased yearly, creating another incentive to purchase these services. Similar systems exists in France and in Sweden.

==Analysis of benefits==
Vouchers can be defined as subsidies granting limited purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of services. In the field of personal and household services, their use has been growing in recent years, following successful experiences in some European countries. Vouchers can be seen as tools that would lie between in kind provision of services and cash distribution of income to be used (or not) for these services. Very basically, vouchers are simple means of payment. The payment can be integrally made by the user, or by a public financer, and mixed forms of payment with other actors can be imagined (e.g. companies paying for part of the cost or insurance companies providing some services through this means).

In the field of care policies, the increasing use of vouchers has sometimes been analysed as an element of a current commodification trend that corresponds to an increase in what can be labelled a “social market” logic. Social markets mainly rely on demand-side measures, the aim being to ensure that users or consumers of services are offered more choice and are, financially speaking, able to purchase personal services. The market logic involves developing the demand side with the aim of transforming “latent” demand into effective demand. These social markets thus involve competition between different modes of provision, with the user receiving direct or indirect assistance from public authorities to make their choice.

In the field of “non-care” services, vouchers are being used mostly for the same reasons as those in the care sector, that is for a series of supposed advantages in particular regarding efficiency of public spending, expected impact on undeclared labour but also quality issues (quality of services and quality of jobs). 
# A first advantage is '''freedom of choice'''. Under the logic of social markets, vouchers are supposed to allow for user choice between different types of providers (sometimes including public providers) or simply between providers of one single type (e.g. domestic workers). 
# A second advantage is '''efficiency'''. Vouchers offer less freedom of choice than pure money but their efficiency is linked to the fact that the demand is “channelled”, i.e. that it is oriented towards certain types of services or activities; moreover there is an efficiency for public finances as if not used, the voucher does not represent a cost for authorities. As well it is possible to imagine public policies targeting people with special needs. 
# A third advantage is '''reduction of undeclared labour'''. Vouchers are meant to simplify the administrative procedures when employing someone to outsource housework tasks or care activities. In some cases, the purchase of a voucher does not entail the duty to sign a labour contract between the parties (as in France under specific conditions), which might have a negative impact on working conditions.
# Further, social security contributions are calculated automatically and directly paid. Because they considerably '''reduce administrative burden''', vouchers are supposed to be a significant incentive for the use of declared labour rather than undeclared labour. 
# Fifth, and finally, vouchers might foster '''quality of services'''. The partisans of the market-oriented and purchaser-provider model consider that it encourages innovation, flexibility and quality, as the market should eliminate the bad quality suppliers and encourage a user-oriented approach. As a Eurofound report notes: “The more actively involved service users are in determining the content of care, the more likely it is that care services will be greater suited to the individual’s values, culture, attitudes and circumstances. Empowerment of care recipients enables them to purchase their own care and have the security assurance of contractual rights. This can potentially influence the quality of care, as low standard care services would simply not be ‘bought’. At the same time, care recipients could tailor a care programme to their specific needs, again raising quality and improving delivery”. Voucher schemes could be steered in this direction, according to this report and to certain authors.&lt;ref&gt;Developing personal and household services in the EU - A focus on housework activities, European Commission, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards==
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants began codifying the Statements on Auditing standards semiannually in 1976.  The ''Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards'' is generally issued in January, and the ''U.S. Auditing Standards'' is issued as part of the ''AICPA Professional Standards'' in June of each year. The current [http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/Pages/SAS.aspx U.S. Auditing Standards] are available at the AICPA's Web site.  Below is a list of older codifications from the ''Professional Standards.''

'''''The Cigarette Papers''''' is a 1996 non-fiction book by [[Stanton A. Glantz]] (editor), John Slade (editor), [[Lisa A. Bero]] (editor), Peter Hanauer (editor), Deborah E. Barnes (editor), and [[C. Everett Koop]] (Foreword), analyzing [[Whistleblower|leaked]] documents that for the first time proved "tobacco companies had long known the grave dangers of smoking, and did nothing about it." In May 1994, 4,000 pages of internal tobacco industry documents were sent to the office of Professor Stanton Glantz, a well-known anti-smoking activist, at the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. The source of these "cigarette papers" was identified only as [[Mr. Butts]]. The documents provide an inside look at the internal activities of American tobacco company, [[Brown &amp; Williamson]], over more than 30 years.&lt;ref name="dlib"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november96/11butter.html | title=The Cigarette Papers: Issues in Publishing Materials in Multiple Formats |author1=Karen Butter |author2=Robin Chandler |author3=John Kunze  |last-author-amp=yes | journal=D-Lib Magazine |date=November 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520213722 | title=The Cigarette Papers | publisher=Universityof California Press | accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/smoke/readings/wienerarticle.html | title=The Cigarette Papers | publisher=PBS | date=1 January 1996 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | author=Wiener, Jon}} This is an authorized reprint of an article that appeared in ''[[The Nation]]'' in 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William McReynolds Agee''' (January 5, 1938 – December 20, 2017) was an American business executive. In 1976 at age 38, he was appointed president and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Bendix Corporation]].  From 1988 to 1995, Agee was the chairman, president, and CEO of [[Morrison-Knudsen]].

Agee was a business consultant, [[Private equity#Venture capital|venture capitalist]], and chairman of a [[Foundation (non-profit)|charitable foundation]]. He received six honorary doctorate degrees and sat on the boards of [[Fortune 500]] corporations including [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life]] and [[Dow Jones]] as well as Bendix and Morrison Knudsen. In 1979, Agee was featured in a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine cover story titled "Faces of the Future", and was named ''Finance'' magazine's "Financial Man of the Year" in 1976.

==Early years==
Born as William McReynolds Agee in [[Boise, Idaho]], he was the middle child (and only son) of Harold J. and Suzanne (McReynolds) Agee. Harold, the son of a [[Baptist]] minister, had varied careers: manufacturing executive, dairy farmer, and state legislator.

Harold moved the family to a dairy farm in nearby [[Meridian, Idaho|Meridian]] in 1953, and Bill transferred to [[Meridian High School (Idaho)|Meridian High]] at age 15.  He quickly established himself as a bright and popular student with leadership skills. Agee was elected class president in that first year as a sophomore and again in his senior year. He was a multi-sport varsity athlete and was named one of the two most studious members of his class, which graduated in 1956.&lt;ref name=reffort&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950612&amp;slug=2125987 |newspaper=Seattle Times |last=Hopkins|first=Jim |agency=''(Idaho Statesman)''|title=Reversal of fortune - It took two Agees to tangle with events leading up to MK's near destruction |date=June 12, 1995 |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ybscbc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NnEaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tisEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6763,2158885 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=''(New York Times)'' |title=Youth, bold style characterize Bendix chief |date=October 13, 1980|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
After graduation from Meridian High School in 1956, in Agee attended [[Stanford University]] for one year before dropping out. He enrolled in the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]], where he joined the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity,&lt;ref name=btpwa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1960/199|publisher=''Gem of the Mountains'', University of Idaho yearbook|title=Beta Theta Pi|date=May 1960|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; unusual for a married man. He earned an [[associate's degree]] while working 40 hours per week in [[Albertsons LLC|Albertson]]'s accounting department. Agee was elected senior class president and graduated with highest honors in 1960.&lt;ref name=gem60&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1960/304|publisher=''Gem of the Mountains'', University of Idaho yearbook|title=Top fifteen seniors: William Agee|year=May 1960|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1959, Agee, along with his parents, played the part of the Dixon family in the ephemeral film ''[[Last Clear Chance]]''. Following graduation, Agee worked for the [[Title insurance in the United States|Title Insurance]] Company in Boise. He was promoted to [[comptroller|controller]] and senior escrow officer at the age of 23. Agee enrolled in the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1961 and was awarded a [[Masters in Business Administration]] (MBA), with distinction, in 1963. He became a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) in 1964 and joined the American and Idaho societies of CPAs.

==Boise Cascade==
Agee was hired by [[Boise Cascade Corporation]] at age 25.  Starting as Executive Assistant to CEO Bob Hansberger,&lt;ref name=pfognwpt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AWRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5_EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7290%2C3622758 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |title=Paper firm official gets new post |date=May 25, 1964 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agee was appointed [[Chief Financial Officer]] (CFO) in 1969 at age 31,&lt;ref name=bcvigrwth&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LTkoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NSgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7239%2C3793068 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Boise Cascade's virus is growth |date=February 18, 1970 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senior Vice President in 1971.&lt;ref name=artttwm&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C6RQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_10DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4319%2C3969567 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |agency=Field Newspaper Syndicate |title=Agee's rise to the top was made without serious setbacks |last=Sloan |first=Allan|date=July 5, 1983|page=9B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boise Cascade's stock price rapidly rose to $77 in 1969, then fell to $15 in the fall of 1971.&lt;ref name=bctrtobel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f-0vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j-wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7169%2C4934683 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |agency=''(Los Angeles Times)'' |last=Lawrence |first=John |title=Boise Cascade belatedly tries to re-shape image |date=June 11, 1972 |page=12S }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After nine years, he left Boise in late May 1972,&lt;ref name=bdxnnoff&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a6dYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jfgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5259%2C4790819 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |agency=Associated Press |title=Bendix names new officers |date=May 30, 1972 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stock price was around $14.&lt;ref name=nyse&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m5lRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cxEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2851%2C5102342 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |title=New York Stock Exchange Transactions |agency=Associated Press |date=May 31, 1972|page=10, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bendix==
Agee joined [[Bendix Corporation]], an automobile industry related manufacturer located near [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in May 1972.&lt;ref name=artttwm/&gt; He had been recruited for the post by Bendix's then-CEO, [[W. Michael Blumenthal|Michael Blumenthal]]. Agee became CFO and Executive Vice President,&lt;ref name=bdxnnoff/&gt; and held a seat on the Board of Directors. He was elected President of the company in December 1976 at the age of 38,&lt;ref name=bltkp&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=is8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5_gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3883,1185274 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|last=Ruskin|first=Judith|agency=Associated Press|title=Bendix leader to keep policy|date=December 20, 1976|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elevated to CEO a few weeks later when Blumenthal left Bendix to become the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] in the new Carter Administration.

Agee was recognized in ''Time'' magazine &lt;ref name="autogenerated1982"&gt;Time staff reporter.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953339-1,00.html "Just Friends,"] ''Time,'' February 8, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; for his strategy of bold, selective acquisitions aimed at transforming Bendix from a slow-growth manufacturing company in a mature industry, into a diversified high-tech corporation. Agee's strategy dramatically increased the stock value of Bendix during Agee's tenure despite a recession that afflicted two of its traditionally main businesses, automobile parts and machine tools. While competitors floundered in 1981, Bendix' profits increased 136% and its fiscal year revenues rose to $4.4 billion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1982"/&gt;

Agee was an unorthodox executive for the 1970s, often dressing in [[business casual]] attire years before it was in vogue. He removed the traditional boardroom table, replacing it with large, comfortable chairs to improve communication.&lt;ref&gt;Time staff reporter.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954585,00.html "Business: Bendix Abuzz,"] ''Time'', October 6, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; He abolished reserved parking for top executives, allowing the best parking spots to go to employees who arrived at the office the earliest.

He was known for promoting young employees based upon merit rather than seniority. This practice caused a flurry of media interest in 1980 when he promoted 28-year-old Mary Cunningham, who had been his executive assistant, to the position of vice president for corporate communications and then VP for Strategic Planning.&lt;ref name="amazon1984"&gt;Mary Cunnningham Agee. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671475630 Powerplay – What Really Happened at Bendix], Simon Schuster 1984, {{ISBN|0-671-47563-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A nationally publicized account of an alleged office romance between Agee and Cunningham – which both denied – led to Cunningham’s resignation in October 1980 when she felt she could no longer effectively do her job.&lt;ref name="amazon1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="takeover"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Skow|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20083977,00.html |title=The Takeover Didn't Take, but Bill Agee and Mary Cunningham Made One Merger That Works |publisher=People|date=December 27, 1982|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Agee and Cunningham divorced their spouses and married in June 1982.&lt;ref name="takeover"/&gt;

Agee sought to expand Bendix by launching a takeover bid for rival [[Martin Marietta]]. On August 25, 1982, Bendix announced it had purchased 1.6 million shares of Martin Marietta for $40 million. Martin Marietta fought the [[Hostile takeover#Hostile takeovers|hostile takeover]]&lt;!--Comment: "hostile" is not POV language, it's part of a recognized, common term--&gt; by attempting to acquire Bendix, employing the [[Pac-Man defense]], in which a company that is threatened with a takeover, attempts to turn the tables by acquiring its would-be buyer. At one point, Bendix owned a majority of Martin Marietta shares, while Martin Marietta, in turn owned a majority of Bendix shares. Neither Agee nor Marietta President Thomas Pownall would concede defeat, with Pownall refusing even to meet with Agee. When Marietta enlisted the help of a third company, [[United Technologies Corporation|United Technologies]], Agee sought a partner to fend off the threatened takeover of Bendix. Agee eventually found Edward Hennessy of [[Allied Corporation|Allied Corp.]], who offered a way out of the stand-off: Allied would take possession of Marietta's shares of Bendix in exchange for the return of Bendix's Marietta holdings. In effect, Martin Marietta would remain an independent company while Bendix would become a [[subsidiary]] of Allied. Agee resigned from Bendix following the merger.&lt;ref&gt;Time staff reporter.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950790,00.html "High Noon: Showdown Time for Bendix"],''Time'', September 20, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aqpaba&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gW8aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5CkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6618,4946892|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|agency=''(Los Angeles Times)''|title=Agee quits post at Bendix, Allied|date=February 9, 1983|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morrison Knudsen==
From 1988 to 1995 Agee was Chairman, President and CEO of the construction company, Morrison Knudsen Corporation (MK) in his hometown of Boise.&lt;ref name=mknaceoch88&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fOhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=puEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5406%2C1191736

Agee thwarted the takeover and returned the failing Morrison Knudsen to profitability within one year.&lt;ref name="the wreck"&gt;Time staff reporter. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982764,00.html "The Wreck of Morrison Knudsen"], ''Time'', April 3, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, Agee had made the company highly profitable and it was debt-free.&lt;ref name="the wreck"/&gt;  Agee employed a diversification strategy which changed the company from one which was primarily reliant on heavy construction to one which was involved in railroad remanufacturing, precious minerals, and the transit business.&lt;ref name="Seattle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/obituary-william-agee-business-exec-who-led-morrison-knudsen-to-bankruptcy/|title=William Agee, Business Exec.

He moved out of company headquarters in Boise to run the enterprise from his home in Pebble Beach.
