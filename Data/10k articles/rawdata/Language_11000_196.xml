[[Image:Schriftzug Antiqua.svg|thumb|The unadorned "Latin script" was typified by Antiqua]]
[[Image:Schriftzug Fraktur.svg|thumb|The "German/Gothic script" (blackletter) was embodied by Fraktur]]
The '''Antiqua–Fraktur dispute''' was a [[typography|typographical]] dispute in 19th- and early 20th-century [[Germany]].

In most [[Europe]]an countries, [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s like the German [[Fraktur (typeface)|Fraktur]] were displaced with the creation of the [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces in the 15th and 16th centuries. However, in Germany, both fonts coexisted until the first half of the 20th century.

During that time, both typefaces gained [[ideology|ideological]] connotations in Germany, which led to long and heated disputes on what was the "correct" typeface to use. The eventual outcome was that the Antiqua-type fonts won when the [[Nazi Party]] chose to phase out the more ornate-looking Fraktur.

== Origin ==
[[File:Initialen.jpg|thumb|Two typefaces: the German text uses Fraktur, Latin and French words and numerals are written in Antiqua. 1768]]
Historically, the dispute originates in the differing use of these two typefaces in most intellectual texts—for [[Latin]] texts, Antiqua-type typefaces were normally used, whereas Fraktur was favoured for works written in German. This extended even to English–German dictionaries, for example, where the English words were all written in Antiqua and the German words in Fraktur. Originally this was simply a convention.

== 19th century ==
Conflict over the two typefaces first came to a head after the occupation of Germany and dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Napoleon]] in 1806, which led to a period in the [[history of Germany]] in which nationalists began to attempt to define what cultural values were common to all Germans. There was a massive effort to [[Western canon|canon]]ize the German national literature—for example, the [[Grimm Brothers]]' collection of [[fairy tales]]—and to create a unified German [[grammar]].

In the context of these debates, the two typefaces became increasingly polarized: Antiqua typefaces were seen to be "un-German", and they were seen to represent this by virtue of their connotations as "shallow", "light", and "not serious". In contrast, Fraktur, with its much darker and denser script, was viewed as representing the allegedly German virtues such as depth and sobriety.

During the [[Romanticism|Romantic Era]], in which the [[Middle Ages]] were glorified, the Fraktur typefaces additionally gained the (historically incorrect) interpretation that they represented German [[Gothic art|Gothicism]]. For instance, [[Goethe]]'s mother advised her son, who had taken to the clear Antiqua typefaces, to remain—"for God's sake"—German, even in his letters.

[[Otto von Bismarck]] was a keen supporter of German typefaces. He refused gifts of German books in Antiqua typefaces and returned them to sender with the statement ''{{lang|de|Deutsche Bücher in lateinischen Buchstaben lese ich nicht!}}'' (I don't read German books in Latin letters!).&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Reinecke, ''{{lang|de|Die deutsche Buchstabenschrift: ihre Entstehung und Entwicklung, ihre Zweckmäßigkeit und völkische Bedeutung}}'', Leipzig, Hasert, 1910, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=wzsIUeXuO4aKjAKRloHwDg&amp;id=YP0RAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Reinecke%2C+Die+deutsche+Buchstabenschrift+%22lese+ich+nicht!%22&amp;q=Deutsche+B%C3%BCcher+in+lateinischen+Buchstaben+lese+ich+nicht!#search_anchor p. 79].&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
The dispute between Antiqua and Fraktur continued into the 20th century. The arguments in favour of Fraktur were based not only on historical and cultural perceptions but also on the claim that Fraktur was more suited for printing German and other Germanic languages, being more readable than Antiqua for this purpose.

A 1910 publication by {{lang|de|Adolf Reinecke}}, ''{{lang|de|Die deutsche Buchstabenschrift}}'', claims the following advantages for using Fraktur as the German script:

* German script is a real reading script: it is more readable, i.e. the word images are clearer, than Latin script.&lt;ref&gt;Reinecke, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=wzsIUeXuO4aKjAKRloHwDg&amp;id=YP0RAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Reinecke%2C+Die+deutsche+Buchstabenschrift+%22lese+ich+nicht!%22&amp;q=lesbarer#search_anchor pp. 42, 44].&lt;/ref&gt;
* German script is more compact in printing, which is an advantage for fast recognition of word images while reading.
* German script is more suitable for expressing German language, as it is more adapted to the characteristics of the German language than the Latin script.
* German script does not cause [[myopia|nearsightedness]] and is healthier for the eyes than Latin script.&lt;ref&gt;Reinecke, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=wzsIUeXuO4aKjAKRloHwDg&amp;id=YP0RAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Reinecke%2C+Die+deutsche+Buchstabenschrift+%22lese+ich+nicht!%22&amp;q=Augen#search_anchor pp. 42, 49].&lt;/ref&gt;
* German script is still prone to development; Latin script is set in stone.
* German script can be read and understood all over the world, where it is actually often used as ornamental script.
* German script makes it easier for foreigners to understand the German language.&lt;ref&gt;Reinecke, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=wzsIUeXuO4aKjAKRloHwDg&amp;id=YP0RAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Reinecke%2C+Die+deutsche+Buchstabenschrift+%22lese+ich+nicht!%22&amp;q=Ausl%C3%A4nder#search_anchor pp. 58–59].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Latin script will gradually lose its position as international script through the progress of the Anglo-Saxon world (here the author states that ''Anglo-Saxons in the UK, the United States and Australia are still "Germanic" enough to annihilate the Latin-scriptler's dream of a Latin "world-script"'').&lt;ref&gt;Reinecke, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=wzsIUeXuO4aKjAKRloHwDg&amp;id=YP0RAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Reinecke%2C+Die+deutsche+Buchstabenschrift+%22lese+ich+nicht!%22&amp;q=Australien#search_anchor p. 62].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of Latin script for German language will promote its infestation with foreign words.
* German script does not impede at all the proliferation of German language and German culture in other countries.

On 4 May 1911, a peak in the dispute was reached during a vote in the {{lang|de|[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]}}. The ''{{lang|de|Verein für Altschrift}}'' ("Association for Antiqua") had submitted a proposition to make Antiqua the official typeface (Fraktur had been the official typeface since the foundation of the [[German Empire]]) and no longer teach German {{lang|de|[[Kurrent]]}} (blackletter [[cursive]]) in the schools. After a long and, in places, very emotional debate, the proposition was narrowly rejected 85–82.

The Fraktur typefaces were particularly heavily used during the time of [[Nazism]], when they were initially represented as true German script, the press scolded for its frequent use of "Roman characters" under "Jewish influence" and German émigrés urged to use only "German script".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Michaud, ''The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany'', tr. Janet Lloyd, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|9780804743266}}, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QR_9T_8VLPAC&amp;pg=PA215 215]–16 and [https://books.google.com/books?id=QR_9T_8VLPAC&amp;pg=PA208-IA22 Plate 110].&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1941, Fraktur was banned in a ''{{lang|de|Schrifterlass}}'' (edict on script) signed by [[Martin Bormann]] as so-called ''{{lang|de|Schwabacher Judenlettern}}'' ("{{lang|de|[[Schwabacher]]}} Jewish letters").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]&lt;br/&gt;
The memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.&lt;br/&gt;"For general attention, on behalf of the {{lang|de|Führer}}, I make the following announcement:&lt;br/&gt;It is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of {{lang|de|Schwabach}} Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the {{lang|de|Schwabach}} Jew letters were forcefully introduced.&lt;br/&gt;Today the {{lang|de|Führer}}, talking with {{lang|de|Herr [[Reichsleiter]] [[Max Amann|Amann]]}} and {{lang|de|Herr}} Book Publisher {{lang|de|Adolf Müller}}, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools.&lt;br/&gt;The use of the {{lang|de|Schwabach}} Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.&lt;br/&gt;On behalf of the {{lang|de|Führer}}, {{lang|de|Herr Reichsleiter Amann}} will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script".&lt;/ref&gt;

The edict mentions publications destined for foreign countries, so one possible reason for the reversal of policy was that Antiqua would be more legible to those living in the occupied areas; the impetus for a rapid change in policy probably came from [[Joseph Goebbels]] and his [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, pp. 216–[https://books.google.com/books?id=QR_9T_8VLPAC&amp;pg=PA217 17].&lt;/ref&gt; Readers outside German-speaking countries were largely unfamiliar with Fraktur typefaces. Foreign fonts and machinery could be used for the production of propaganda and other materials in local languages, but not so easily in German as long as the official preference for Fraktur remained.  

In any case, [[Adolf Hitler]] personally disliked the Fraktur typeface, as demonstrated by a declaration made in the {{lang|de|[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]}} in 1934:&lt;ref&gt;from ''{{lang|de|[[Völkischer Beobachter]]}}'' Issue 250, 7 September 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your alleged Gothic internalisation does not fit well in this age of steel and iron, glass and concrete, of womanly beauty and manly strength, of head raised high and intention defiant&amp;nbsp;... In a hundred years, our language will be the European language. The nations of the east, the north and the west will, to communicate with us, learn our language. The prerequisite for this: The script called Gothic is replaced by the script we have called Latin so far&amp;nbsp;...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bormann's edict of 3 January 1941, at first forbade only the use of blackletter typefaces. A second memorandum banned the use of {{lang|de|Kurrent}}, including {{lang|de|[[Sütterlin]]}}, which had only been introduced in the 1920s. From the academic year 1941/42 onwards, only the so-called ''{{lang|de|Normalschrift}}'' ("normal script"), which had hitherto been taught alongside {{lang|de|Sütterlin}} under the name of "Latin script", was allowed to be used and taught. However, {{lang|de|Kurrent}} remained in use until 1945 on SS insignia (names of SS-Divisions, etc.) and in some other cases.

== After the Second World War ==
After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Sütterlin script was once again taught in the schools of some German states as an additional script, but it could not hold for long against the Latin cursive scripts. Since few people remain who can read Kurrent, most old letters, diaries, etc. remain inaccessible for all but the most elderly German speakers. As a consequence, most German-speaking people today find it difficult to decipher their own parents' or grandparents' letters, diaries, or certificates.

The Fraktur script remains present in everyday life in some pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticity and oldness. However, the letterforms used in many of these more recent applications deviate from the traditional letterforms, specifically in the frequent untraditional use of the round ''s'' instead of the [[long s]] (ſ) at the beginning of a syllable, the omission of [[typographical ligature|ligature]]s, and the use of letter-forms more similar to Antiqua for certain especially hard-to-read Fraktur letters such as ''k''. Books wholly written in Fraktur are nowadays read mostly for particular interests. Since many people have difficulty understanding blackletter, they may have trouble accessing older editions of literary works in German.

A few organizations such as the ''{{lang|de|Bund für deutsche Schrift und Sprache}}'' continue to advocate the use of Fraktur typefaces, highlighting their cultural and historical heritage and their advantages when used for printing [[Germanic languages]]. But these organizations are small, somewhat sectarian, and not particularly well known in Germany.

In the United States, Mexico, and Central America, [[Amish|Old Order Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonite]], and [[Old Colony Mennonites|Old Colony Mennonite]] schools still teach the Kurrent handwriting and Fraktur script.  German books printed by Amish and Mennonite printers use the Fraktur script.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3643">An '''Assisting Offender''' is a suspected or convicted criminal in the United Kingdom, who has agreed to assist the investigation or prosecution of other criminals in return for some form of sentence reduction on their own criminal history.

In the United Kingdom the use of Assisting Offenders is enabled by the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] (SOCPA), the relevant sections of which came into force in 2006. The relevant sections are:

== Immunity ==

Section 71&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/71 |title=Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the SOCPA allows a Specified Prosecutor to grant an Assisting Offender [[immunity from prosecution]].

== Restricted Use Undertaking ==

Section 72&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/72 |title=Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the SOCPA allows a Specified Prosecutor to grant an undertaking to an Assisting Offender that information will not be used against that person. It is a form of limited immunity.

== Reduced sentence ==
Section 73&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/73 |title=Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the SOCPA allows a Specified Prosecutor to sign an agreement with the Assisting Offender that the assistance of the offender will be brought to the attention of a Court in order to allow the court to pass a reduced sentence on the Assisting offender.

== Review of sentence ==

Section 74&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/74 |title=Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the SOCPA allows a Specified Prosecutor to seek a review of a previously sentenced prisoner who has entered an agreement to assist the prosecution or investigation of other criminals in exchange for a reduced sentence.

== Use of legislation ==

The 2005 legislation placed the use of so-called '[[Supergrass (informer)|supergrasses]]' onto a statutory footing.

Assisting Offenders have been used in some notable cases with mixed results. In 2007 [[Murder of Rhys Jones|Rhys Jones]] was shot dead in Liverpool as part of a gang related incident. One of the suspects was later arrested in possession of a firearm and became an Assisting Offender giving evidence for the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policespecials.com/forum/index.php/topic/87072-rhys-jones-killers-gang-celebrate-jail-sentence/ |title=Rhys Jones Killer's gang celebrate jail sentence - News - PoliceSpecials.com Forum |publisher=Policespecials.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073656/http://www.policespecials.com/forum/index.php/topic/87072-rhys-jones-killers-gang-celebrate-jail-sentence/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Northern Ireland]] the use of Assisting Offenders was heavily criticised when the trial of 13 men for a range of terrorist crimes ended with only one conviction after a trial that had cost £11.5 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-19907192 |title=BBC News - Mark Haddock UVF supergrass trial cost taxpayers £11.5m |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3205">'''[[Contingent]] [[sovereignty]]''' refers to the new and still evolving theory which challenges the norm of [[non-intervention]] in the internal affairs of countries, commonly associated with the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian doctrine of sovereignty]].

In 2007, Stewart Patrick of the [[United States]] [[State Department]] described the contingent sovereignty as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/p/rem/31299.htm |title=The Role of the U.S. Government in Humanitarian Intervention |accessdate=2007-07-09 |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614080910/http://www.state.gov/s/p/rem/31299.htm |archivedate=2007-06-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Historically, the main obstacle to armed intervention -humanitarian or otherwise- has been the doctrine of sovereignty, which prohibits violating the territorial integrity of another state.  One of the striking developments of the past decade has been an erosion of this non-intervention norm and the rise of a nascent doctrine of “contingent sovereignty.”

This school of thought holds that sovereign rights and immunities are not absolute.  They depend on the observance of fundamental state obligations.  These include the [[responsibility to protect]] the citizens of the state.  When a regime makes war on its people or cannot prevent atrocities against them, it risks forfeiting its claim to non-intervention.  In such circumstances, the responsibility to protect may devolve to the international community.

This emerging consensus reflects the traumas of the twentieth century.  The seminal event was the Holocaust, but it was hardly the last to shock the conscience of humankind.  From the killing fields of Cambodia to the bloody hills of Rwanda, a litany of atrocities has mocked our earnest, repeated pledges of 'Never Again.'

Following the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan described what he termed a "developing international norm ... that massive and systematic violations of human rights wherever they may take place ... should not be allowed to stand."  No longer should frontiers be considered an absolute defense behind which states can commit crimes against humanity with "sovereign impunity."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of contingent sovereignty is evolving and currently not codified in international law.

==Criticism==

Critics argue that the concept of contingent sovereignty allows powerful countries, such as the United States, too much scope to invade other countries based in their own judgements about the [[human rights]] abuses or other wrongdoing of the government of the country concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20040301fareviewessay83212a/g-john-ikenberry/illusions-of-empire-defining-the-new-american-order.html |title=Foreign Affairs - Illusions of Empire: Defining the New American Order - G.

'''Dime''' or '''Dima''' is an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language spoken in the northern part of the [[Selamago]] district in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region]] of [[Ethiopia]], around [[Mount Smith (Ethiopia)|Mount Smith]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Dime divides into at least two dialects, which include Us'a and Gerfa. It has six case suffixes in addition to an unmarked nominative. It is overwhelmingly suffixing, but uses prefixes for demonstratives and reduplication.  Phonologically, it is noteworthy among the [[Omotic languages]] for having velar and uvular fricative phonemes.&lt;ref name=Mulugeta&gt;Mulugeta Seyoum. 2008. [http://www.lotpublications.nl/publish/issues/Seyoum/index.html ''A Grammar of Dime'']. Netherlands Graduate School of Linguistics / Landelijke – LOT. {{ISBN|978-90-78328-52-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic word order is SOV (subject–object–verb), as in other Omotic languages, indeed as in all the languages of the core of the [[Ethiopian Language Area]].

The language, as well as the [[Dime people]] themselves, reportedly decreased in numbers over the 20th century due to predation from their neighbors the [[Bodi people|Bodi]], and both are in danger of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Fleming, "A grammatical sketch of Dime (Dim-af) of the Lower Omo", [https://books.google.com/books?id=dNB4eh67y1wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Omotic Language Studies''], Richard Hayward (editor), p. 495. London: [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ethiopian census figures, the 1994 census reported 6293 speakers of the Dime language in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region]] alone;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/images/documents/pdf_files/regional/SNNPR1.pdf ''1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region'', Vol. 1, part 1], Table 2.14&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2007 census, only 574 speakers were reported for all of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=CSA&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethiopia - Population and Housing Census 2007 Report, National |url= http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/3583/download/50086  |author=Central Statistical Agency |publisher=International Household Survey Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, because the Dime language still lacks a writing system and there are no local schools to promote the use of the language, it is even more threatened.&lt;ref name=Mulugeta/&gt;

'''edding AG''' is a [[Germany|German]] company manufacturing writing and marking tools such as felt-tip pens and [[permanent marker]]s.
The company's products are immensely popular in Europe, leading to the brand name "Edding" being widely used as a generic name for permanent markers.

== History ==
edding AG was founded in 1960 in [[Hamburg]] by Carl-Wilhelm Edding and Volker Detlef Ledermann. At that time they started with a start-up capital of just 500 [[Deutsche Mark]].
In 1965 they established the group brand planMASTER and started to sell products for planning and visual communication.
By the end of 1970, almost 100 million edding felt- and fibre-tipped pens had been sold across the world. Eight years later the Group presented its first ever paint marker with an opaque, which is suitable even on darker surfaces.
Shares have been traded on the stock exchange since 1986. In the same year, Edding Vertrieb GmbH was founded as a distribution and logistics centre for the German market. It is still based in Wunstorf near [[Hannover]] to this day.
In 1992 edding founded V.D. Ledermann &amp; Co. GmbH in [[Bautzen]].
Since 2005 the company is headed by Per Ledermann, the son of the co-founder. In 2008, edding introduces its EcoLine range of products. This series includes permanent markers and board markers with at least 90% of the total plastic used being made from recycled material.

==Brands and Products ==

===edding===
Edding sells paint markers of different line thickness and color. These are mostly made in Japan. Graffiti writers use "Edding" frequently for [[Graffiti terminology|tagging]].

===Legamaster===
Legamaster is the visual communication division of edding AG, the leading manufacturer of high-quality marking and writing instruments. 
Legamaster has been actively adapting its range to the latest communication technology trends and developments for more than 50 years.

== Awards ==
1995: Because of his eminently commitment for environment, co-founder Volker Detlef Ledermann was presented by the B.A.U.M. award.

2000 - 2010: Edding 3000 and Edding 2000 permanent markers voted best marker in the world by Global Consumer Index.

2007: The [[University of St. Gallen]] in Switzerland lists edding AG as one of the top 100 employers among Germans [[small and medium businesses]] sector.

2008: [[Deloitte]] awarded edding AG by "Axia Award 2008" (in small and medium businesses category) for its excellent strategic orientation.

In [[biochemistry]], an '''effector molecule''' is usually a [[small molecule]] that selectively binds to a protein and regulates its biological activity. In this manner, effector molecules act as [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that can increase or decrease [[Allosteric regulation|enzyme activity]], [[gene expression]], or [[cell signaling]]. Effector molecules can also directly regulate the activity of some [[mRNA]] molecules ([[riboswitch]]es).

In some cases, proteins can be considered to function as effector molecules, especially in cellular signal transduction cascades.

The term ''effector'' is used in other fields of biology. For instance, the effector end of a [[neuron]] is the terminus where an axon makes contact with the muscle or organ that it stimulates or suppresses.

==Examples==
'''Allosteric effectors''' can bind to regulatory proteins involved in [[RNA transcription]] in order to change its activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = ((Anthony J.F. Griffiths))|title=Introduction to genetic analysis|publisher=Freeman|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-4292-7634-7|pages=410–411|edition=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way [[Activator (genetics)|activator proteins]] become active to bind to the DNA to promote [[RNA Polymerase]] and [[repressor proteins]] become inactive and RNA polymerase can bind to the DNA.

'''[[Bacterial effector protein|Bacterial effector proteins]]''' are injected by bacterial cells, usually [[pathogen]]s, into the cells of their host. The injection is mediated by specialized secretion systems, e.g. the [[type III secretion system]] (TTSS or T3SS).&lt;ref name="Cambronne"&gt;{{Cite journal

* '''apoplastic effectors''' : proteins which stay into the [[apoplast]], they are translocated and accumulated into a distinct compartment enclosing the growing hypha named the [[EIHM]] (extra-invasive hyphal membrane).
* '''cytoplasmic effectors''' : proteins which enter the host cytoplasm, they are accumulated into a complex plant-derived structure named the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) and they are later translocated across the [[EIHM]] inside the plant cell. It has been shown that cytoplasmic effectors can move through a few layers of plant cells, probably a way to prepare them for hyphal invasion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3817">'''Erdős' conjecture on arithmetic progressions''', often referred to as the '''Erdős–Turán conjecture''', is a [[conjecture]] in [[arithmetic combinatorics]] (not to be confused with the [[Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases]]). It states that if the sum of the reciprocals of the members of a set ''A'' of positive integers diverges, then ''A'' contains arbitrarily long [[arithmetic progression]]s.

Formally, the conjecture states that if

::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n\in A} \frac{1}{n} = \infty &lt;/math&gt;

then ''A'' contains arithmetic progressions of any given length.  (Sets satisfying the hypothesis are called [[small set (combinatorics)|large sets]].)

==History==

In 1936, Erdős and Turán made the weaker conjecture that any set of integers with positive [[natural density]] contains infinitely many 3 term arithmetic progressions.&lt;ref name="erdos turan"&gt;{{citation|authorlink1=Paul Erdős|first1=Paul|last1=Erdős|authorlink2=Pál Turán|first2=Paul|last2=Turán|title=On some sequences of integers|journal=[[Journal of the London Mathematical Society]]|volume=11|issue=4|year=1936|pages=261–264|url=http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1936-05.pdf|doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-11.4.261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was proven by [[Klaus Roth]] in 1952, and generalized to arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions by [[Szemerédi]] in 1975 in what is now known as [[Szemerédi's theorem]]. 

In a 1976 talk titled "To the memory of my lifelong friend and collaborator Paul Turán," [[Paul Erdős]] offered a prize of US$3000 for a proof of this conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;''Problems in number theory and Combinatorics'', in Proceedings of the Sixth Manitoba Conference on Numerical Mathematics (Univ. Manitoba, Winnipeg, Man., 1976), ''Congress. Numer.'' XVIII, 35–58, Utilitas Math., Winnipeg, Man., 1977&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008 the problem is worth US$5000.&lt;ref&gt;p. 354, Soifer, Alexander (2008); The Mathematical Coloring Book: Mathematics of Coloring and the Colorful Life of its Creators; New York: Springer. {{isbn|978-0-387-74640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress and related results==

{{unsolved|mathematics|Does every large set contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions?}}

Erdős' conjecture on arithmetic progressions can be viewed as a stronger version of Szemerédi's theorem.  Because the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, the [[Green&amp;ndash;Tao theorem]] on arithmetic progressions is a special case of the conjecture.

Even the [[Szemerédi's theorem#Quantitative bounds|weaker claim]] that ''A'' must contain at least one arithmetic progression of length 3 is open.  The strongest related result is due to Bloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last=Bloom | first=Thomas F. | title=A quantitative improvement for Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions | arxiv=1405.5800 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5525">'''Eternal September''' or the '''September that never ended'''&lt;ref name="jargon"/&gt; is [[Usenet]] slang for a period beginning in September 1993,&lt;ref name="AutoOO-1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koebler |first=Jason |date=September 30, 2015 |title=It's September, Forever |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nze8nb/its-september-forever |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the month that Internet service provider [[AOL|America Online]] (AOL) began offering Usenet access to its many users, overwhelming the existing culture for online forums. 

Before then, Usenet was largely restricted to colleges and universities. Every September, a large number of incoming [[freshmen]] would acquire access to Usenet for the first time, taking time to become accustomed to Usenet's standards of conduct and "[[netiquette]]". After a month or so, these new users would either learn to comply with the networks' [[social norms]] or tire of using the service.

Whereas the regular September freshman influx would quickly settle down, the influx of new users from AOL did not end and Usenet's existing culture did not have the capacity to integrate the sheer number of new users.&lt;ref name="AutoOO-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3857628/aol-1985-history/|publisher=Time|date=May 22, 2015|title=A Brief Guide to the Tumultuous 30-Year History of AOL|author=Lily Rothman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influx was exacerbated by the aggressive direct mailing campaign by AOL Chief Marketing Officer [[Jan Brandt]], which most notably involved distributing millions of floppy disks and [[CD-ROM]]s with free trials of AOL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegler|first1=MG|title=How Much Did It Cost AOL To Send Us CDs In The 90s? "A Lot!", Says Steve Case|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/27/aol-discs-90s/|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the popularity of the Internet has brought on a constant stream of new users. Hence, from the point of view of the early Usenet, the influx of new users in September 1993 never ended.

Dave Fischer appears to have coined the term in a January 1994 post to alt.folklore.computers: "It's moot now. September 1993 will go down in net history as the September that never ended."&lt;ref name=firstuse/&gt;

== Legacy ==

In homage to the term, one [[news server]], formerly named ''Motzarella.org'',&lt;ref name="freag.net"/&gt; calls itself ''Eternal September'' and gives the date as a running tally of days since September 1993.&lt;ref name="AutoOO-2"/&gt;

A [[tongue-in-cheek]] program called ''sdate'' outputs the current date, formatted using the Eternal September calendar (September ''X'', 1993, with ''X'' an unbounded counter for days since that [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.df7cb.de/projects/sdate/|title=Never Ending September Date - df7cb.de|work=df7cb.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the identically named ''sdate'', one of the sixty [[command (computing)|commands]] that comes with the First Edition of [[Unix]], that is used to set the [[system clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://man.cat-v.org/unix-1st/1/sdate|title=sdate(1) - Unix First Edition Manual Page|work=cat-v.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is alluded to in [[Thomas Pynchon|Thomas Pynchon's]] 2013 novel ''[[Bleeding Edge]]'', centered largely around [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com era]] [[Silicon Alley]], where a "disused techies' [[Saloon bar|saloon]]" is named 'Eternal September'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pynchon|first1=Thomas|title=Bleeding Edge|date=2013|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|isbn=9780224099028|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7358">[[File:Lossow4.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Facesitting, [[Heinrich Lossow]] (1840–1897).]]
'''Facesitting''', also known as '''queening''' or '''kinging''', is a [[sexual practice]] in which one partner sits on or over the other's face, typically to allow or force [[oral sex|oral–genital]] or [[anilingus|oral–anal]] contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Yvonne K. Fulbright|Fulbright]] | first = Yvonne | title = The Best Oral Sex Ever - His Guide to Going down | publisher = Adams Media | location = Holbrook | year = 2011 | isbn = 1-4405-1080-6 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Thomas | title = The Language of Sadomasochism | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-313-26481-3 | page = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to oral-genital and oral-anal contact, the position also leaves the bottom partner's hands free to stimulate other [[erogenous zones]] (e.g., anus, nipples, etc.).  The top partner may be facing either direction in this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I Want to Taste You: Girl to Girl Talk|author=Zoe Jasmine|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for this position to form part of [[BDSM]], involving [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|dominance and submission]], though this need not be the case. Within a BDSM or D/s context, facesitting can be a form of [[erotic humiliation]].

Facesitting is common among [[Dominant (BDSM)|dominant]] and [[Submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] individuals, for demonstrating superiority and for [[sexual gratification]]. Unlike [[erotic asphyxiation|smothering]], in facesitting the bottom partner is not deprived of [[Breathing|air]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The full-weight body-pressure, [[moisture]], [[body odor]]s, and [[darkness]] can be perceived as powerful [[sexual attractions]] or compulsions. The person sat upon may be in [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], sexually [[submissive]], or simply held down by the body-weight of the other person. In some cases, the submissive will consume the dominant's bodily waste(s) ([[urolagnia]] and [[coprophilia]]).

== Furniture ==
[[File:Queening-Stool.jpg|thumb|Face sitting using a Queening Stool. ]]
Sometimes special furniture is used, such as a "queening stool" or "smotherbox".&lt;ref name="Kink"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Kink: Sex Beyond the Missionary|author=Eva Christina|isbn=0399536949|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=465|title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationship Handbook|author=Michael Makai|isbn=1492775975|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''queening stool'' is a low seat which fits over the [[submissive (BDSM)|submissive]]'s face and contains an opening to allow oral-genital and/or oral-anal stimulation of the [[Dominatrix|domme]] while seated. 

The position allows the [[pelvic floor muscles]] (PFM) to relax and therefore partly exposing the [[labia minora]] to intimate touch. The [[gluteus maximus]] and [[levator ani]] muscles, the major muscles of the crotch, can relax and sag allowing easy access to the vagina and anus. Additionally, the stool allows for greater comfort and allows for the activity to be done for a longer period of time. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmv7lhiPpDo&lt;/ref&gt;

A smotherbox (or "smothering box") is a special form of queening stool which also allows the person under the seat to be locked in place, restrained by the [[neck]] as in a set of [[stocks]].&lt;ref name="Kink" /&gt; A smotherbox has two openings. One is in a vertical side of the box for the [[neck]] of the person who has his or her head inside the smotherbox. The other is in the top of the box to expose his or her face. The inside of a smotherbox is often padded to provide support for his or her neck and prevent his or her head from moving. The padding may also muffle noises from the outside, causing a relaxation effect and heightening his or her other senses. Smotherboxes are usually custom made pieces of furniture that may have a special significance for their users. They are sometimes made out of precious woods, with leather used for the seat.

[[File:Smotherbox rendition.jpg|thumb|upright|Different smotherbox designs]]
The smotherbox is placed on a stable surface. The cover (top half of the smotherbox) is open while the submissive lies down on his or her back and places his or her head in the box. When he or she is in position the cover is closed. The cover can have [[hinge]]s or be a separate part. Locks may be used to emphasize the submissive position or the submissive's hands may be fastened above his or her head to the box. Smotherboxes may be more permanently mounted to tables or other stable objects, and the submissive restrained to that surface instead. A Queening Chair or Facesitting Throne is another variation that is popular, designed to emphasize the relative place of the domme and submissive. They can be elegant and more formal than the smotherbox.

==In popular culture of the United Kingdom==
[[File:Michael von Zichy-Liebe,1911-3.jpg|thumb|[[Mihály Zichy]]: ''Making love'' (1911)]]
In 1980, [[Monty Python]] recorded a humorous song, "[[Sit on My Face]]", about the pleasures of facesitting. Written by [[Eric Idle]], the song's lyrics are sung to the [[melody]] of "[[Sing As We Go]]" by [[Gracie Fields]]. The opening gives way to multiple male voices singing "Sit on my face and tell me that you love me." The remaining lyrics contain numerous references to [[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]], such as "when I'm between your thighs you blow me away" and "life can be fine if we both [[69 (sex position)|69]]".

In 2014, the British government announced a ban on the production of [[hardcore pornography]] for the Internet. Ostensibly, the bill sought to protect women from sex acts that were violent or unsafe, and banned a wide variety of sex practices, including facesitting, strangulation and fisting. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nick-clegg-backs-face-sitting-protesters-over-uk-porn-ban-9925991.html|title=Nick Clegg backs face-sitting protesters|author=Andrew Grice|date=15 December 2014|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/europe/uk-porn-protest/|title='Face-sitting' protest over UK porn censorship law - CNN.com|author=Laura Smith-Spark, CNN|date=12 December 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law impacts only the production of pornographic videos as opposed to acts performed privately. Protests against the law were held outside the [[Palace of Westminster]], with protesters saying the law does not reflect the wishes of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/30454773/why-are-people-face-sitting-outside-parliament|title=Why are people face-sitting outside Parliament?|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/11289019/Face-sitting-pornography-protest-QandA-How-where-and-seriously-why.html|title=Face-sitting pornography protest Q&amp;A: How, where, and seriously - why?|date=12 December 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Four discourses''' is a concept developed by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. He argued that there were four fundamental types of '''discourse'''. He defined four discourses, which he called Master, University, Hysteric and Analyst, and suggested that these relate dynamically to one another&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neill|first=Calum|date=2013-06-01|title=Breaking the text: An introduction to Lacanian discourse analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354312473520|journal=Theory &amp; Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1177/0959354312473520|issn=0959-3543}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
*'''Discourse of the University''' – Provision and worship of "objective" knowledge — usually in the unacknowledged service of some external master discourse.
*'''Discourse of the Master''' – Struggle for mastery / domination / penetration.  Based on Hegel's [[master–slave dialectic]]. 
*'''Discourse of the Hysteric''' – Symptoms embodying and revealing resistance to the prevailing master discourse.
*'''Discourse of the Analyst''' – Deliberate subversion of the prevailing master discourse.

Lacan's theory of the four discourses was initially developed in 1969, perhaps in response to the events of social unrest during [[May 1968 in France]], but also through his discovery of what he believed were deficiencies in the orthodox reading of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipus Complex]]. The Four Discourses theory is presented in his seminar ''L'envers de la psychanalyse'' and in ''Radiophonie'', where he starts using "discourse" as a social bond founded in [[intersubjectivity]].  He uses the term discourse to stress the transindividual nature of language: speech always implies another subject.

==Necessity of Formalising Psychoanalysis==

Prior to the development of the Four Discourses, the primary guideline for clinical psychoanalysis was Freud's Oedipus Complex. In Lacan's Seminar of 1969-70, Lacan argues that the terrifying Oedipal father that Freud invoked was already castrated at the point of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=stanford encyclopedia of philosophy |website=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lacan/#sect2.4.1 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castration was symbolic rather than physical. In an effort to stem analysts' tendency to project their own[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] readings and neurotic fantasies onto psychoanalysis, Lacan worked to formalise psychoanalytic theory with mathematical functions with renewed focus on the semiology of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. This would ensure only a minimum of teaching is lost when communicated and also provide the conceptual architecture to limit the [[Free association (psychology)|associations]] of the analyst.

==Structure==

Discourse, in the first place, refers to a point where [[Langue and parole|speech and language]] intersect. The four discourses represent the four possible formulations of the symbolic network which social bonds can take and can be expressed as the permutations of a four-term configuration showing the relative positions — the agent, the other, the product and the truth — of four terms, [[the subject]], the [[master signifier]], [[knowledge]] and [[objet petit a]].

The four positions in each discourse are :

Agent = Upper left. This is the speaker of the discourse

Other = Upper right. This is what the discourse is addressed to

Product = Lower right. This is what the discourse has created

Truth = Lower left. This is what the discourse attempted to express

The four variables which occupy these positions are :

S1 = the master signifier

S2 = knowledge (''le savoir'')

$  = the subject (barred)

a  = the [[objet petit a]] or surplus-''jouissance''

S1 refers to "the marked circle of the field of the Other," it is the Master-Signifier. S2 is the "battery of signifiers, already there" at the place where "one wants to determine the status of a discourse as status of statement," that is knowledge (''savoir''). S1 comes into play in a signifying battery conforming the network of knowledge. $ is the subject, marked by the unbroken line (''trait unaire'') which represents it and is different from the living individual who is not the locus of this subject. Add the ''objet petit a'', the object-waste or the loss of the object that occurred when the originary division of the subject took place — the object that is the cause of desire: the ''plus-de-jouir''.

'''Discourse of the Master''':

It is the basic discourse from which the other three derive. The dominant position is occupied by the master signifier, S1, which represents the subject, S, for all other signifiers: S2. In this signifying operation there is a surplus: ''objet a''. All attempts at totalisation are doomed to fail. This discourse masks the division of the subject, it illustrates the structure of the dialectic of the master and the slave. The master, S1, is the agent who puts the slave, S2, to work: the result is a surplus, ''objet a'', that the master struggles to appropriate.

'''Discourse of the University''':

It is caused by an anticlockwise quarter turn of the previous discourse. The dominant position is occupied by knowledge (''savoir''). An attempt to mastery can be traced behind the endeavors to impart neutral knowledge: domination of the other to whom knowledge is transmitted. This hegemony is visible in modernity with science.

'''Discourse of the Hysteric''':

It is effected by a clockwise quarter turn of the discourse of the master. It is not simply "that which is uttered by the hysteric," but a certain kind of articulation in which any subject may be inscribed. The divided subject, $, the symptom, is in the pole position. This discourse points toward knowledge. "The cure involves the structural introduction of the discourse of the hysteric by way of artificial conditions": the analyst hystericizes the analysand's discourse.

'''Discourse of the Analyst''':

It is produced by a quarter turn of the discourse of the hysteric in the same way as Freud develops psychoanalysis by giving an interpretative turn to the discourse of his hysterical patients. The position of the agent — the analyst — is occupied by ''objet a'': the analyst becomes the cause of the analysand's desire. This discourse being the reverse of the discourse of the master, does it make psychoanalysis an essentially subversive practice which undermines attempts at domination and mastery?

==Relevance for cultural studies==

[[Slavoj Žižek]] uses the theory to explain various cultural artefacts, including ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]''.

'''Jean-François Sudre''' (15 August 1787 –  3 October 1862) was a violinist, composer and music teacher who [[constructed language|invented]] a [[musical language]] called ''la Langue musicale universelle'' or [[Solresol|Solrésol]].

Sudre was born in [[Albi]] in southern France on 15 August 1787. He studied music as a child and, at the age of eighteen, was admitted to the ''[[Conservatoire de Paris]]'' on 12 May 1806, where he studied violin under [[François Habeneck]] and harmony under [[Charles Simon Catel]].

He created a group of musicians who were attempting to develop a way of transmitting language through music. Sudre trained [[Édouard Deldevez]] and Charles Larsonneur to play and interpret his alphabet. A given note would represent a word or a letter of the alphabet. The trio toured France, answering questions from the audience using Sudre's violin. A military application quickly presented itself. A bugler on a battlefield could transmit orders to a regiment by playing an appropriate tune. This promising hypothesis came to nothing because the system was too vulnerable to wind and weather.

Clearly grasping at straws, Sudre then offered the military a set of musical [[canon (music)|canon]]s, but they declined the suggestion. In 1829 Sudre began to develop the system that is now known as the Do Re Mi method of notating music. &lt;ref&gt;Peter Bloom, ''Music in Paris in the eighteen-thirties'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Galoli''', or '''Galolen''', are a people of [[East Timor]] with a population of about 50,000, primarily along the northern coast of the district of [[Manatuto District|Manatuto]]. To the west lies the [[Mambai people (Timor)|Mambai]] people. There is an old colony on the southern coast of [[Wetar]] island, the Talo, who speak the Talur dialect.

Their language, also known as Galoli, is one of the [[Timor–Babar languages|Timor–Babar]] group of [[Austronesian languages]]. It is one of the [[national language]]s designated by the constitution of East Timor. Because the area was used as a trading center for different cultures, there are a large number of foreign loan words in the vocabulary, principally from Moluccan and [[Malay language|Malay]] languages. Although it is not spoken by as many people as other national languages, it was adopted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the district of [[Manatuto District|Manatuto]] and thus has become fixed in grammars and dictionaries.

'''French Guianan Creole''' or '''Guianan Creole''' ('''Creole''' by its speakers, or simply '''Guianan''') is a [[French language|French]]-based [[creole language]] spoken in [[French Guiana]], and to a lesser degree, in [[Suriname]] and [[Guyana]]. It resembles [[Antillean Creole]], but there are some lexical and grammatical differences between them. [[French West Indies|Antilleans]] can generally understand French Guianan Creole, though the notable differences between the French creole of French Guiana and those of the rest of the Atlantic may cause some instances of confusion. The differences consist of more [[French language|French]] and Brazilian [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] influences (due to the proximity of Brazil and Portuguese presence in the country for several years). There are also words of [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian]] and [[African languages|African]] origin. There are Guianan communities in [[Suriname]] and [[Guyana]] who continue to speak Guianan Creole.

It should not be confused with the [[Guyanese Creole language]], based on English, spoken in nearby [[Guyana]].

==History==
Guianan Creole was a language spoken between [[slave]]s and [[settler]]s. But the conditions of Guianan Creole's constitution were quite different from the Creole of the West Indies, on the one hand because of the conflicts between French, English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish, and French dialects such as the Caen Have greatly influenced Guianan Creole, which has made it significantly different from the Creoles of Martinique, Haiti, St. Lucia and Guadeloupe.

There are, therefore, in Guianan Creole a few words in common with the Creoles of the West Indies, however, a number of words differentiate them significantly.

In addition, the Guianan pronounce the letter '' 'r' ''. Whereas in the West Indies the pronunciation of '' 'r' 'tends rather to approximate the semi-vowel ' '' w '' '.

==Orthography and phonology==
Guianan Creole is largely written using the [[French alphabet]], with only a few exceptions. 'Q' and 'X' are replaced by 'k' and 'z' respectively. 'C' is not used apart from in the diagraph, [[Ch (digraph)|ch]], where it stands for {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (the word for horse is ''chouval'', similar to French's ''cheval''). Otherwise, it is replaced by 'k' when it stands for {{IPA|[k]}} (Standard French's ''comment'' (how) is written ''kouman'') and 's', when it stands for {{IPA|[s]}}. Silent 'h' is never written, unlike in Standard French, where it remains for etymological purposes.

He was born at [[Koniuszki, Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Koniuszek]], [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. The first part of his life was full of struggles and hardships. After having associated for many years with the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]], he settled at [[Lemberg]]; and through the efforts of some of his friends, such as [[Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport|Rapoport]], [[Nachman Krochmal|Krochmal]], and others, he obtained pupils whom he instructed in [[Hebrew language]] and other subjects. This comparatively happy state lasted for only three years (1813–16). [[Jacob Orenstein]], chief rabbi of Lemberg, having been apprised of the existence among his flock of a small band occupied with the study of [[secular]] subjects, excommunicated them all. Deprived thus of his pupils, the only means of his subsistence, he settled in the neighboring town of Brody. There he struggled for a while, until he resolved to study [[medicine]].

Erter entered (1825) the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]], where he studied medicine for five years and passed all the prescribed examinations; he then practised his new profession in various Galician towns, including Brody, where he made himself especially popular among the poor and needy, who found in him a kindly benefactor.  He died at Brody.

He composed a number of Hebrew satires, which have procured for him a prominent place among modern Hebrew satirists. For a time he edited a Hebrew periodical entitled "He-Halutz," which was intended chiefly to promote culture and enlightenment among the Galician Jews. The periodical also advocated the establishment in Galicia of agricultural colonies for the employment and benefit of young Jews, and received some support from [[Austrian Empire|Vienna]].

Erter's fame rests chiefly on his satires, published under the title "Ha-Tzofeh le-Bet Yisrael" (Vienna, 1858; ib. 1864), with a biography of the author and introduction by [[Max Letteris]]. They are six in number, and are admirable in form and style. Their titles are: "Mozne Mishqal"; "Ha-Tzofeh be-Shubo mi-[[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]]"; "[[Gilgul]] ha-Nefesh"; "[[Tashlikh]]"; "Telunat Sani we-Sansani we-Samangaluf"; "Ḥasidut we-Ḥokmah." The most attractive of these is "Gilgul ha-Nefesh," the story of the many adventures of a soul during a long earthly career; how it frequently passed from one body into another, and how it had once left the body of an ass for that of a physician. The soul gives the author the following six rules, by observing which he might succeed in his profession:

:''1. Powder your hair white, and keep on the table of your study a human skull and some animal skeletons. Those coming to you for medical advice will then think your hair has turned white through constant study and overwork in your profession.''
:''2. Fill your library with large books, richly bound in red and gold. Though you never even open them people will be impressed with your wisdom.''
:''3. Sell or pawn everything, if that is necessary, to have a carriage of your own.''
:''4. When called to a patient pay less attention to him than to those about him. On leaving the sick-room, assume a grave face, and pronounce the case a most critical one. Should the patient die, you will be understood to have hinted at his death; if, on the other hand, he recovers, his relations and friends will naturally attribute his recovery to your skill.''
:''5. Have as little as possible to do with the poor; as they will only send for you in hopeless and desperate cases you will gain neither honor nor reward by attending them. Let them wait outside your house, that passers may be amazed at the crowd waiting patiently to obtain your services.''
:''6. Consider every medical practitioner as your natural enemy, and speak of him always with the utmost disparagement. If he be young, you must say he has not had sufficient experience; if he be old, you must declare that his eyesight is bad, or that he is more or less crazy, and not to be trusted in important cases. When you take part in a consultation with other physicians, you would act wisely by protesting loudly against the previous treatment of the case by your colleagues. Whatever the issue may be, you will always be on the safe side.''

Erter also wrote some Hebrew verse; but this won little acclaim compared to his prose, which [[Heinrich Grätz]] described as comparable in many points to that of [[Heinrich Heine]].

"Sandel, Yosef." ''Leksikon fun der nayer yiddisher literatur''. New York: Congress for Jewish Culture. vol. 6, columns 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Polish-Jewish art historian and critic, an art dealer and collector, and an advocate on behalf of Jewish artists in postwar [[Poland]].

==Biography==
Sandel was born in Kolomea ([[Kolomyia]], Ukraine), then in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The son of a cap maker, he attended the [[Maurice de Hirsch|Baron Hirsch]] school and then [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]].&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

Around 1920, he moved to [[Dresden]], Germany, where, in 1925, he co-published a short-lived German-language literary and art magazine, ''Mob: Zeitschrift der Jungen'' (Mob: Journal of youths).&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietzel, Thomas, and Hans-Otto Hügel (1988). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=3_-Qc8E4FysC&amp;pg=PA807 Mob]." ''Deutsche literarische Zeitschriften, 1880-1945: Ein Repertorium.'' Munich: Saur. vol. 3, p. 807.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently lived in France, Switzerland, and Austria, before returning to Dresden.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

From 1929 to 1933, he operated an art gallery in [[Dresden]], called ''Galerie junge Kunst'' (Gallery of young art).&lt;ref name="Piatkowska78-79"&gt;Piątkowska, Renata (2008). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1TSi_QnJOIC&amp;pg=PA78 Jewish Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts / Di yidishe gezelshaft tsu farshpreytn kunst: An Attempt at the Continuation of Jewish Artistic Life in Postwar Poland, 1946-1949]." In: Elvira Grözinger and Magdalena Ruta (Eds.), ''Under the Red Banner: Yiddish Culture in the Communist Countries in the Postwar Era''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag. p. 77-96; here p. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; After the rise of the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] regime in Germany, he moved to [[Belgrade]] (then in [[Yugoslavia]]), where he opened another gallery and mounted exhibitions, in 1933-1934.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

In 1935, he moved to Poland; he spent time in [[Vilnius|Vilna]] (Vilnius) and Warsaw, and published articles on art in [[Yiddish | Yiddish-language]] periodicals, including ''Literarishe bleter''.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the Second World War he fled to the Soviet Union, and survived the war in [[Kazakhstan]], where he taught German in a middle school.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

After the war, he returned to Poland and settled in [[Warsaw]], in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; There he became the leader of the Jewish Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts (Polish: Żydowskie Towarzystwo Krzewienia Sztuk Pięknych; Yiddish: Yidishe gezelshaft tsu farshpreytn kunst), or ZTKSP, a revival of an organization that had been active in Poland before the war.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society provided material assistance to Jewish artists, helped to promote their work, and fostered art education for Jewish youth.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 79-83.&lt;/ref&gt; It mounted some 98 exhibitions in Warsaw, and four exhibitions that were presented throughout Poland&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; two devoted to the work of individual artists, [[Rafael Mandelzweig]], in 1946, and [[Lea Grundig]], in 1949; and two, in 1948, in honor of the fifth anniversary of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], featuring works of Jewish artists who were killed in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 77, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the ZTKSP, in September 1949, the art works that Sandel and his colleagues had assembled were integrated into the collections of the [[Jewish Historical Institute]], Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1950 to 1953 the institute operated a Gallery of Jewish Art, with Sandel serving as director.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandel subsequently devoted himself to the writing of several art historical works concerning Jewish artists in Poland. Among his works, all written in Yiddish, is a two-volume biographical reference work on Jewish artists who perished in the Holocaust, ''Umgekumene yidishe kinstler in Poylen'' (Jewish artists in Poland who perished; Warsaw, 1957).&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Sandel married Ernestyna Podhorizer (1903-1984), who was also originally from Galicia and worked for a time as the secretary of the ZTKSP. Sandel-Podhorizer was born in Dembits ([[Dębica]]), and before the war had been a biology teacher in Lemberg ([[Lviv]]); she was later a curator at the museum of the Jewish Historical Institute, and also worked at the Biology Institute in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Elis, Binyamin (1965).

[[File:Ambush.gif|thumb|300px|right|U.S. Army idealized linear [[ambush]] plan showing the kill zone]]
In military tactics, the '''kill zone''', also known as '''killing zone''', is an area entirely covered by direct and effective fire, an element of [[ambush]] within which an approaching enemy force is trapped and destroyed. The objective of the ambush force is to quickly kill or capture all enemy soldiers inside the kill zone. The trapped soldiers may respond by [[counterattack]]ing.

The term is used in the analogous non-lethal sense in [[paintball]] and [[airsoft]] tactics.

==Practice==
===Ambush===
The kill zone is an element of point ambush in which a military unit targets a single area with offensive fire such as mines, demolitions and section-level weapons. The kill zone may be bordered by obstacles, traps or indirect fire (artillery or mortars) to keep the enemy from escaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HC-C7a7YpMAC&amp;pg=SL3-PA8 |page=8 |title=U.S. Army Counterguerrilla Operations Handbook |author=U.S Army |publisher=Globe Pequot |year=2004 |isbn=1-59228-575-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USArmy1981&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OzrBlOOzzkC&amp;pg=SA5-PA35 |pages=35, 43 |title=The infantry platoon and squad (infantry, airborne, air assault, ranger) |publisher=U.S. Army |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an area ambush, related multiple kill zones will be covered by multiple kill teams.&lt;ref name=FM390&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HK6lUBybnHYC&amp;pg=SA5-PA29 |pages=29–30 |title=Army Field Manual FM 3-90 (Tactics) |publisher=U.S. Army |year=2007 |isbn=1-4209-2827-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ranger&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cnu2Jilzz_IC&amp;pg=PA15 |page=15 |title=U.S. Army Ranger Handbook |author=U.S. Department of Defense |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=1-60239-052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons of the kill team are not fired until the majority of the enemy unit is within the kill zone, ideally all of the targeted unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6T0LDe0WyoC&amp;pg=PA165 |pages=164–165 |title=Combat Leader's Field Guide |first=Brett A. |last=Stoneberger |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2005 |isbn=0-8117-3195-2 |edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct and effective fire is initiated by the kill team leader who orders simultaneous targeted firing by all members of the kill team. The attack is often initiated by remote-controlled charges such as [[M18 Claymore mine|Claymore mines]] or other explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRLPt0ayfasC&amp;pg=PA52 |page=52 |title=The US Army in the Vietnam War 1965–73 |first=Gordon L. |last=Rottman |publisher=Osprey Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=1-84603-239-3 |series=Battle Orders |volume=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ambushed unit may be prevented from advancing or retreating by explosions at the front and rear of their column. Individual kill team members are to choose targets within the kill zone using machine gun and small arms fire but may be augmented by indirect fire. Ideally, the action is completed so quickly that the enemy force has no time to report the engagement.&lt;ref name=FM390/&gt; A successful ambush may result in a patrol in the kill zone being destroyed in seconds.&lt;ref name=Vick2000/&gt; The ambush of a kill zone carries high risk in that forces not in the zone may maneuver around the flanks of the attackers, limiting their escape. For this reason a properly executed ambush employs covering teams and relief teams in addition to the kill team(s). Nearby forces may also come to the assistance of those caught in the attack. Therefore, a well-executed attack may be over in under a minute and should rarely extend beyond a few minutes.&lt;ref name=Vick2000/&gt;

===Response===
A military unit that finds itself suddenly under fire in an enemy kill zone must immediately take action against the ambushers. Such action may include soldiers assuming a [[prone position]] to minimize themselves as targets. Prone soldiers will return fire toward the ambushers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mbm7lq7SfdQC&amp;pg=PA25 |page=25 |title=The Patrol Order |last=Davis |first=Tom |publisher=Old Mountain Press |year=1994 |isbn=1-884778-02-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other responses may include the targeted soldiers immediately assaulting suspected defensive positions. Soldiers outside of the kill zone may direct [[suppressive fire]] at the ambushers in support of the assault,&lt;ref name=Ranger/&gt; and they may advance upon the flanks of the ambushers.&lt;ref name=Vick2000&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVrbm6TDeiIC&amp;pg=PA127 |pages=127–128 |title=Aerospace operations in urban environments: exploring new concepts |last=Vick |first=Alan |publisher=Rand Corporation |year=2000 |isbn=0-8330-2851-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vehicles in the kill zone will likely attempt to leave it, while vehicle gunners fire toward the ambushers. Disabled vehicles may create cover for ambushed soldiers. Soldiers able to leave their disabled vehicles are expected to join the assault against the ambushers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VnLz_tHBF0C&amp;pg=SA8-PA12 |page=12 |title=Sh 21-76 Ranger Handbook |author=U.S. Army |publisher=Jeffrey W Bennett |year=2010 |isbn=0-9816206-6-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site selection===
The kill zone should isolate and trap the enemy.&lt;ref name=FM390/&gt; The selection of a likely kill zone involves evaluating the terrain and making up for any inadequacies. First and foremost, the kill zone must be where the enemy is expected to travel, or where the enemy can be attracted with "bait". If the potential kill zone terrain restricts vehicle movement to one vehicle width at a time, then a suddenly disabled vehicle will help to isolate the enemy. Terrain that keeps the enemy from moving out of the kill zone is useful for isolation, otherwise the ambushers will wish to place obstacles or munitions at the borders of the selected area. Especially important is separation between the enemy and the ambushing units, to prevent a counterattack.&lt;ref name=USArmy1981/&gt;

===Avoidance===
Military units on the move are vulnerable to ambush. To avoid the kill zone, a patrol may "fan out" and travel with elements spread out left and right, rather than staying solely on a road or track. Soldiers who [[take point]] must keep an eye out for signs of a kill zone, such as disturbed ground, obstacles and restrictive terrain. [[Night vision]] and [[thermal imaging]] equipment may help to discover hidden weapons, or enemy soldiers under cover.&lt;ref name=Vick2000/&gt;

==Paintball==
The term "kill zone" is used in [[paintball]] tactics to designate an area that is heavily defended by enemy paintball players. Advancing players may know the location of the potential kill zone but be uncertain whether it is well-defended. Responses vary to being caught in a paintball kill zone. If the kill zone is too large and the enemy forces relatively far away, the ambushed players often retreat to cover. If the kill zone is small, the ambushed players are likely to charge forward and assault the defensive players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5ZvC5huZNEC&amp;pg=PA70 |page=70 |title=Paintball and Airsoft Battle Tactics |first1=Christopher E. |last1=Larsen |first2=John T. |last2=Gordon |first3=Hae-jung |last3=Larsen |publisher=Voyageur Press |year=2008 |isbn=0-7603-3063-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow players who are not caught in the kill zone are likely to attack the flanks of the defensive players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChnKZiVyZZcC&amp;pg=PA72 |page=72 |title=Paintball Warrior Tactics |last=Wickes |first=Zack |year=2009 |isbn=1-4421-2543-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kinnauri''', also known as '''Kanauri''', '''Kanor''', '''Koonawur''', or '''Kunawar''', is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] [[dialect cluster]] centered on the [[Kinnaur]] district of the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Himachal Pradesh]].

[[Kaike language|Kaike]], once thought to be Kinnauri, is closer to [[Tamangic languages|Tamangic]]. [[Bhoti Kinnauri language|Bhoti Kinnauri]] and [[Tukpa language|Tukpa]] are Bodish (Lahauli–Spiti).

==Geographical distribution==
''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists the following locations for Kinnauri and related varieties.

'''Kinnauri'''-speaking villages are located in the upper Ropa River valley, from Chauhra to Sangla and north along Satluj river to Morang. This area is located in [[Kinnaur district]] and [[Lahaul and Spiti district]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Kinnauri is also spoken in the [[Shimla district]] and [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]] areas, and in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Kashmir.

'''Chitkuli Kinnauri''' is spoken in the Baspa river area of the Sangla valley in Nichar subdivision, [[Kinnaur district]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] (in Chitkul and Rakchham villages).

'''Jangshung''' is spoken in Morang tahsil, [[Kinnaur district]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] (in Jangi, Lippa, and Asrang villages).

'''Shumcho''' is spoken in Puh tahsil, [[Kinnaur district]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] (in Kanam, Labrang, Spilo, Shyaso, Taling, and Rushkaling villages).

==Phonology==
This description is of the Pangi dialect of Kinnauri.

* CCCVC

==Grammar==

Kinnauri is SOV, V-Auxiliary, Postpositional, and has head-final noun phrases. It shows case marking with an ergative alignment in the past tense, nominative-accusative elsewhere. The ergative case is identical to the instrumental. There is no distinction between accusative and dative, and a genitive is partially syncretic with the accusative/dative. An ablative case is also recognized, normally attached outside the genitive but with different allomorphs for animate and inanimate referents. There is also a locative case, normally used only with inanimate nouns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5073">In [[formal language theory]], a [[formal grammar|grammar]] is in '''Kuroda normal form''' if all production rules are of the form:&lt;ref name="ItoKobayashi2010"/&gt;

:''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' or

where A, B, C and D are [[nonterminal]] symbols and ''a'' is a [[terminal symbol]].&lt;ref name="ItoKobayashi2010"/&gt; Some sources omit the ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' pattern.&lt;ref name="MS190"/&gt;

It is named after [[Sige-Yuki Kuroda]], who originally called it a '''linear bounded grammar'''—a terminology that was also used by a few other authors thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Willem J. M. Levelt|title=An Introduction to the Theory of Formal Languages and Automata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFvtwGYNe7kC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-3250-4|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every grammar in Kuroda normal form is [[noncontracting grammar|noncontracting]], and therefore, generates a [[context-sensitive language]].  Conversely, every context-sensitive language which does not generate the [[empty string]] can be generated by a grammar in Kuroda normal form.&lt;ref name="MS190"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mateescu | first1=Alexandru |last2=Salomaa|first2=Arto |editor1-first=Grzegorz| editor1-last=Rozenberg|editor2-first=Arto| editor2-last=Salomaa |title=Handbook of Formal Languages. Volume I: Word, language, grammar |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 4: Aspects of Classical Language Theory |isbn=3-540-61486-9|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A straightforward technique attributed to György Révész transforms a grammar in Kuroda's form to Chomsky's CSG: ''AB'' &amp;rarr; ''CD'' is replaced by four context-sensitive rules ''AB'' &amp;rarr; ''AZ'', ''AZ'' &amp;rarr; ''WZ'', ''WZ'' &amp;rarr; ''WD'' and ''WD'' &amp;rarr; ''CD''. This technique also proves that every noncontracting grammar is context-sensitive.&lt;ref name="ItoKobayashi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Masami Ito|author2=Yūji Kobayashi|author3=Kunitaka Shoji|title=Automata, Formal Languages and Algebraic Systems: Proceedings of AFLAS 2008, Kyoto, Japan, 20-22 September 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xuaR2bJq0rcC&amp;pg=PA182|year=2010|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4317-60-3|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a similar normal form for [[unrestricted grammar]]s as well, which at least some authors call "Kuroda normal form" too:&lt;ref name="Meduna2000-722"/&gt;
:''AB'' &amp;rarr; ''CD'' or
:''A'' &amp;rarr; ''BC'' or
:''A'' &amp;rarr; ''a'' or
:''A'' &amp;rarr; ''ε''

where ε is the empty string. Every unrestricted grammar is [weakly] equivalent to one using only productions of this form.&lt;ref name="MS190"/&gt;

If the rule AB → CD is eliminated from the above, then one obtains context-free languages.&lt;ref name="Meduna2000-728"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Alexander Meduna]]|title=Automata and Languages: Theory and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7gEErax71cC&amp;pg=PA728|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-85233-074-3|page=728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Penttonen normal form''' (for unrestricted grammars) is a special case where A = C in the first rule above.&lt;ref name="Meduna2000-722"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Alexander Meduna]]|title=Automata and Languages: Theory and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7gEErax71cC&amp;pg=PA722|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-85233-074-3|page=722}}&lt;/ref&gt; For context-sensitive grammars, the Penttonen normal form, also called the '''one-sided normal form''' (following Penttonen's own terminology) is just:&lt;ref name="ItoKobayashi2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MS190"/&gt;

:''AB'' &amp;rarr; ''AD'' or
:''A'' &amp;rarr; ''BC'' or
:''A'' &amp;rarr; ''a''

As the name suggests, for every [[context-sensitive grammar]], there exists a [weakly] equivalent one-sided/Penttonen normal form.&lt;ref name="MS190"/&gt;

'''Lampung''' is the language of the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Lampung]] at the southern tip of [[Sumatra]]. It is a [[dialect cluster]] with two main dialects, perhaps distinct enough to be considered distinct languages: Abung/Pepadun ([[Lampung Nyo]]) and Pesisir/Say Batin ([[Lampung Api]]). A third, Komering, is sometimes considered part of Lampung Api, by others a distinct language. Lampung Api is the prestige variety.

Before the introduction of the Roman script, Lampung was written in a script called "''[[Lampung alphabet|Aksara Lampung]]''" or "''[[Lampung alphabet|Had Lampung]]''", which is a variant of the [[Ulu scripts]] used throughout central and south Sumatra. The script is seldom used today but is taught in schools throughout Lampung as a means of preserving its linguistic history.

Voiceless stops occur in word-initial, word-medial, and word-final position. Word-final stops are generally unreleased. Voiced stops generally do not occur word-finally.
There seems to be only moderate evidence for a phonemic glottal stop.
/r/ has a range of phonetic realizations but is most often a velar or uvular fricative [x],[ɣ], [χ],[ʁ].There is minor disagreement between the two earlier phonologies about /r/, described as an apical trill by Abdurrahman and as a voiceless velar fricative by Walker. Walker  stated  that  this  phoneme  (written  as  /x/  in  1976  and  as  /r/  in  his  1975  word 
lists) occurs in all major environments and is sometimes voiced intervocalically. Walker (1976:3)  noted  that  [r]  (apical  trill)  ‘occurs  in  unassimilated  loanwords’  and  alternates  with [x] in many cases.

The nasals occur in word-initial, word-medial and word-final positions, with the exception of /ɲ/, which does not occur word-finally.
/l/ occurs in word-initial, word-medial, and word-final position.
/w/ and /j/ occur word-initially and word-medially and, depending on one's analysis, word-finally as part of diphthongs discussed below. Both phonemes occur word-medially in positions where they are not considered as transitions from [u] and [i] respectively.

=== Gemination ===
Gemination, particularly consonant gemination, is a prominent feature in Lampung.It  is  not  easy  to  generalize  except  to  say  that  gemination  happens  most  frequently  in Nyo, less so but still frequently in Api, and almost never (at least as we and others have transcribed it) in Komering. Lampung people often did not agree among themselves which  lexemes  exhibit  gemination  but  one  can  see  that  the  phenomenon  as  we  documented it clusters around specific lexemes. Several cases each of gemination are recorded for every consonant in medial only position (either between vowels or as part of a consonant 
cluster) except /ɲ/, /ŋ/, /s/, /w/ and /j/. Gemination is most frequently associated with one  of  two  related  environments:  1)  penultimate  schwa;  and  2)  reduction  of  voiceless nasal-stop clusters to the stop component. In this case other vowels are in some isolects neutralized to schwa. Gemination therefore can be significant for reconstruction.

=== Metathesis ===
Metathesis  seems  to  have  been  a  fairly  common  process  in  Lampungic.  From  the correspondence sets can be counted at least twenty lexemes in which metathesis occurred in one or more of the Lampungic isolects. It most frequently occurred with consonants, 
e.g. *rihuʔ ‘cloud’ → ''hiruk'' and *gǝlar ‘name’ → ''gǝral,'' but also with vowels, often with some fairly complex transformations, e.g. *siwa ‘nine’ → ''suay'' and *lahia ‘ginger’ → ''liha.''

=== Vowels ===

|}
Abdurrahman posits the phoneme /o/ for Komering. However, we submit that most if not all occurrences of [o] in Komering can be more accurately analyzed as allophones of /ə/.

Walker posits the phoneme /e/ in addition to /i/ and /ə/ for Way Lima. However, is to reanalyze most occurrences of [e] as allophones of /i/. Walker apparently did not preserve the distinction between [ə] and [e] in his word lists, as both phones are written using e. In addition, the examples he gives in his phonology for /e/ are likely all borrowed words.
Vowel sequences do occur, but a syllable break always occurs between them in our data. Such sequences are distinguished from the diphthongs /aw/, /ay/, and /uy/.

== Writing system==
{{Main article|Lampung script}}
[[File:Adi adi Ulun Lampung.jpeg|thumb|right|Lampung language in script, Latin and its translation to [[Indonesian language]].]]

The Lampung language is written in an [[abugida]], or alphasyllabary, called ''Aksara Lampung'' or ''Had Lampung''. It has 20 ''induk surat'' (19 consonants and one vowel), and 13 ''anak surat'' (diacritics). Had Lampung has been influenced by the [[Pallava script]] and the [[Arabic script]]. Belonging to the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, it shares similarities with the [[Rejang alphabet]], [[Rencong alphabet]], [[Sundanese alphabet]], and the [[Kawi script]] of Java.

The Lampung script which is used and taught today is the result of a revision of the old Lampung script.

'''Madurese''' is a language of the [[Madurese people]] of [[Madura Island]] and eastern [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]; it is also spoken on the neighbouring small [[Kangean Islands]] and [[Sapudi Islands]], as well as by migrants to other parts of Indonesia, namely the [[eastern salient of Java]] (comprising [[Pasuruan]], [[Surabaya]], [[Malang]] to [[Banyuwangi]]), the [[Masalembu Islands]], and even some on [[Kalimantan]].  The [[Kangean language|Kangean dialect]] may be a separate language. It was traditionally written in the [[Javanese script]], but the [[Latin script]] and the [[Pegon script]] (based on [[Arabic script]]) is now more commonly used. The number of speakers, though shrinking, is estimated to be 8–13 million, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in the country. A variant of Madurese that is [[Bawean]] is also spoken by Baweanese (or Boyan) descendants in Malaysia and Singapore. 

Madurese is a [[Malayo-Sumbawan languages|Malayo-Sumbawan language]] of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language family]], a branch of the larger [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. Thus, despite apparent geographic spread, Madurese is more related to [[Balinese language|Balinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Sasak language|Sasak]], and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], than it is to [[Javanese language|Javanese]], the language right next door.

Links between [[Bali–Sasak languages]] and Madurese are more evident with the "low" form (common form). There are some common words between Madurese and Filipino languages as well as between Madurese and [[Banjar language|Banjar]] (a [[Malayic languages|Malayic language]]).

Madurese has more [[consonant]]s than its neighboring languages due to it having voiceless unaspirated, voiceless [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]], and voiced sounds. Similar to [[Javanese language|Javanese]], it has a contrast between [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (even [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]]) stops

==Morphology==
Madurese nouns are not inflected for gender and are [[plural]]ized via [[reduplication]]. Its basic word order is [[subject–verb–object]]. [[Negation]] is expressed by putting a negative particle before the verb, adjective or [[noun phrase]]. As with other similar languages, there are different negative particles for different kinds of negation.

A '''misnomer''' is a name that is incorrectly applied to a thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged|date=2014|publisher=HarperCollins|edition=12th|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/misnomer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misnomers often arise because something was named long before its correct nature was known, or because an earlier form of something has been replaced by something to which the name no longer applies. A misnomer may also be simply a word that someone uses incorrectly or misleadingly.&lt;ref name= "Garner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Garner's Modern American Usage |last=Garner |first=Bryan |edition=3rd |page=542 |year= 2009 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-538275-4 |page542= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "misnomer" does ''not'' mean "[[Understanding|misunderstanding]]" or "[[List of common misconceptions|popular misconception]]",&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; and a number of misnomers remain in common usage — which is to say, the fact of a word being a misnomer does not necessarily make usage of the word incorrect.

== Sources of misnomers ==
{{unreferencedsection|date=April 2018}}
Some of the sources of misnomers are:

* An older name being retained after the thing named has changed (e.g., [[tin can]], [[mince meat pie]], [[steamroller]], [[tin foil]], [[clothes iron]], [[digital darkroom]]). This is essentially a [[metaphorical extension]] with the older item standing for anything filling its role.&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* Transference of a well-known product brand name into a [[genericized trademark]] (e.g., [[Xerox]] for [[photocopy]], [[Kleenex]] for [[Facial tissue|tissue]] or [[Jell-o]] for [[gelatin dessert]]).&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* An older name being retained even in the face of newer information (e.g. [[Arabic numerals]]).&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* ''[[Pars pro toto]]'', or a name applied to something that covers only part of a region. People often use ''[[Holland]]'' to mean the [[Netherlands]], while it only designates a part of that country. 
* Sometimes people refer to the suburbs of a [[metropolis]] with the name of the biggest city in the metropolis.&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* A name being based on a similarity in a particular aspect (e.g., "shooting stars" look like falling stars but are actually [[meteor]]s).&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* A difference between popular and technical meanings of a term. For example, a [[koala]] "bear" (see below) superficially looks and acts like a [[bear]], but is quite distinct and unrelated. Similarly, [[firefly|fireflies]] fly like [[fly|flies]], and [[Coccinellidae|ladybugs]] look and act like [[hemiptera|bugs]]. Botanically, [[peanut]]s are not [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], even though they look and taste like nuts. The technical sense is often cited as the "correct" sense, but this is a matter of context.&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* Ambiguity (e.g., a [[parkway]] is generally a [[road]] with park-like landscaping, not a place to park). Such a term may confuse those unfamiliar with the language, dialect and/or word.&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* Association of a thing with a place other than one might assume. For example, [[Panama hat]]s originate from [[Ecuador]], but came to be associated with the building of the [[Panama Canal]].&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* Naming particular to the originator's world view.&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* An unfamiliar name (generally foreign) or technical term being re-analyzed as something more familiar (see [[folk etymology]]).&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* [[Anachronism]]s, terms being applied to things that belong to another time, especially much later.
&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;

=== Older name retained ===
&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;
* The "lead" in [[pencil]]s is made of [[graphite]] and [[clay]], not [[lead]]; graphite was originally believed to be lead [[ore]], but this is now known not to be the case. The graphite and clay mix is known as ''plumbago'', meaning "lead ore" in Latin, and is still known as "black lead" in [[Keswick, Cumbria]] and elsewhere.
* [[Blackboard]]s can be black, green, red, blue, or brown. And the sticks of chalk are no longer made of [[chalk]], but of [[gypsum]].
* [[Tin foil]] is almost always [[aluminium]], whereas "[[tin can]]s" made for the storage of food products are made from steel with a thin [[tin]] [[plating]]. In both cases, tin was the original metal.
* Telephone numbers are usually referred to as being "dialed" although [[rotary dial|rotary phone]]s are now rare.
* In [[golf]], the clubs commonly referred to as woods are usually made of metal.  The club heads for "woods" were formerly made predominantly of wood.
&lt;!-- BY CONSENSUS, THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IS LIMITED. DO NOT ADD NEW ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS. --&gt;

{{Anchor|Anachronym}}
The term ''anachronym'' (note well ''-chron-'') as defined in [[Garner's Modern English Usage]]&lt;ref name="Garner_2016_headword_anachronyms"&gt;{{Citation |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |author-link=Bryan A.

Examples cited by Garner include the persistence of the word ''dial'' in its telephoning sense after the [[rotary dial]] era and the persistence of the term ''tin foil'' in the aluminum foil era.&lt;ref name="Garner_2016_headword_anachronyms"/&gt; Anachronyms should not be [[homophone|homophonously]] confused with [[acronym#All-caps style |anacronym]]s (note well ''-acro-''), which are words such as ''[[laser]]'' and ''[[sonar]]'' that have acronymic origin but are generally no longer treated like conventional acronyms (that is, they are used syntactically like any other words, without obligate reference to their original expansions).

{{for|the township in Indiana|Moral Township, Shelby County, Indiana}}

A '''moral''' (from [[Latin]] ''morālis'') is a [[message]] that is conveyed or a lesson to be learned from a [[narrative|story]] or [[wikt:event|event]]. The moral may be left to the hearer, reader, or viewer to determine for themselves, or may be explicitly encapsulated in a [[aphorism|maxim]]. A moral is a lesson in a story or in real life.

==Finding morals==
As an example of an explicit maxim, at the end of [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] of [[the Tortoise and the Hare]], in which the plodding and determined tortoise won a race against the much-faster yet extremely arrogant hare, the stated moral is "slow and steady wins the race". However, other morals can often be taken from the story itself; for instance, that arrogance or overconfidence in one's abilities may lead to failure or the loss of an event, race, or contest.

The use of [[stock character]]s is a means of conveying the moral of the story by eliminating complexity of personality and depicting the issues arising in the interplay between the characters, enables the writer to generate a clear message. With more rounded characters, such as those typically found in [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Play (theatre)|plays]], the moral may be more nuanced but no less present, and the writer may point it out in other ways (see, for example, the [[Prologue]] to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'').

==Arts==
Throughout the history of recorded literature, the majority of fictional writing has served not only to entertain but also to instruct, inform or improve their audiences or readership. In [[Ancient Greek theatre|classical drama]], for example, the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] was to comment on the proceedings and draw out a message for the audience to take away with them; while the [[Charles_Dickens#Novels|novels of Charles Dickens]] are a vehicle for morals regarding the social and economic system of [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] Britain.

Morals have typically been more obvious in [[children's literature]], sometimes even being introduced with the phrase: "The moral of the story is …". Such explicit techniques have grown increasingly out of fashion in modern storytelling, and are now usually only included for [[irony|ironic]] purposes.

Some examples are: "Better to be safe than sorry" ([[precautionary principle]]), "The evil deserves no aid", "Be friends with whom you don't like", "Don't judge people by the way they look", "Slow and steady wins the race", "Once started down the dark path, forever will it hold your destiny", and "Your overconfidence is your weakness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aesop's Fables: Online Collection - Selected Fables|url=http://www.aesopfables.com/aesopsel.html|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aesop's Fables]] are the most famous of stories with strong moral conclusions.

== In moral tales ==
Morals were one of the main purposes of literature during 1780–1830, especially in [[children's literature]]. Part of the reason for this was the writings of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in the 18th century, which brought attention to children as an audience for literature. Following in their line of thought, [[Thomas Day]] (1748–1789) wrote ''[[Sandford and Merton]]'', elevating the outstanding morals of one young boy above the rapscallion nature of another. [[Maria Edgeworth]] (1776–1849) was another prominent author of moral tales, writing about how a wise adult can educate a child; one of her more famous stories is "[[The Purple Jar]]". During this time, the theme of "a young heroine or hero gaining wisdom and maturity was taken up by many other writers" (p.&amp;nbsp;93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children's Literature|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195146565|pages=93–96|author=Dennis Butts|authorlink=Moral Tales|editor=Jack Zipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of children to derive moral lessons from stories and visual media develops around the age of 9 or 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/01/08/375878511/and-the-moral-of-the-story-is-kids-dont-always-understand-the-moral|title=And The Moral Of The Story Is ...

'''Natural predictive dialing''' is a technology that was developed to eliminate the problems that are typically associated with [[Predictive dialer|predictive dialing]].  These problems include abandoned calls, initial call delays, government regular, consumer dissatisfaction, and host of other problems.&lt;ref name="Patent Number 7,734,029"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryskamp|first=Rix|title=Patent Number 7,734,029|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=7,734,029.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7,734,029&amp;RS=PN/7,734,029|publisher=United States Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other types of [[dialer]]s, natural predictive dialers insert agents before the automation component of the dialer (such as call progress analysis) has completed.  For example, a standard [[predictive dialer]] will (1) first determine if a live person has answered the phone call and then (2) transfer that call to an agent that is deemed to be available to take the call.  Conversely, natural predictive dialers connect the agent prior to the completion of the automation process, which allows the agent to hear the called party say "hello" while the automation is still working.

At its core, natural predictive dialing technologies are based on the concept that call automation should work with agents, instead of call automation working before agents are connected, and then agents being connected to calls that have been determined to be 'live' people. In natural predictive dialing the call automation (sometimes called [[Call progress analysis|Call Progress Analysis]] (CPA)) can work before during or after an agent has interfaced with a call.&lt;ref name="Call Progress Analysis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cisco Systems|title=Call Progress Analysis|url=http://www.cisco.com/image/gif/paws/111980/cpa-00.pdf|publisher=Cisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interweaving of automation and human agents provides productivity increases traditionally associated with automation technologies, while working to eliminate the unnatural affect that many call automation technologies have on the human-interaction aspects of the call.&lt;ref name="Call Comparison Video" /&gt;

== Benefits ==
The core benefit of natural predictive dialing is the more pleasant human interactions that occur during calls that are actually being made by an automated system connected to agents.  In natural predictive dialing, the agents hear the called party say "hello" and can respond accordingly.&lt;ref name="How Natural Predictive Works Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Natural Predictive Works Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHd4qKlbSBw&amp;context=C3f84b7cADOEgsToPDskIYYy0zdZfKQqYFHdcnA1v1|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technology works well on small and large scales (one user up to thousands).  Contact centers that require a natural calling experience and wish to also have the productivity benefits associated with predictive dialing can utilize this technology to obtain both benefits.&lt;ref name="Call Comparison Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call Comparison Video|url=http://www.cisco.com/image/gif/paws/111980/cpa-00.pdf|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawbacks ==
The only commercially available natural predictive dialer is provided by a single vendor.&lt;ref name="Natural Contact Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Contact Website|url=http://www.naturalcontact.com|publisher=Transcend Products}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, patents protecting the technology make it more expensive than many other systems, such as those available for free based on the [[Asterisk]] platform.  Many contact centers and other organizations don't necessarily need the 
benefits associated with the natural predictive dialing technology and can save money by using a more inexpensive or less-proprietary system.

'''Ram Vilas Sharma''' (10 October 1912 – 30 May 2000) was an eminent progressive [[literary critic]], [[linguist]], [[poet]] and [[Intellectual|thinker]].&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"&gt;{{cite book

| title = Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature
| publisher = [[Sahitya Akademi]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in ''Unchgaon Sani'', [[Unnao District]], [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt;

He came into the limelight as a critic in 1939 with his scholarly paper on [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']], presented at a session of ''Hindi Sahitya Sammelan''.&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; Ram Vilas Sharma was undisputedly among the most powerful noted [[poets]] of the progressive period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = Sisir Kumar
| last = Das

| publisher = [[Sahitya Akademi]]
| year = 1995
| pages = 908
| isbn = 978-81-7201-798-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early education==
He received his early education in his native village and at [[Jhansi]].&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; For higher studies he went to [[Lucknow]] and did his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[PhD.]] in [[English Literature]].&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt;

==Career==
He started his career as a lecturer at [[Lucknow University]], and then moved to Balwant Rajput College, [[Agra]], as head of the [[English language|English]] department.&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; He retired finally as Director of KM Hindi Institute, [[Agra]].&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; Basically a critic, he gave new dimension to biographical-historical criticism, and analysed [[natural language|linguistic]] and literary issues from a [[Marxist]] viewpoint.&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt;

==Works==
His study of Nirala's ''Ram ki shakti puja'', ''Tulsidas'', ''Saroj-smriti'' and ''parimal'' is a model of creative criticism.&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; He won the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1970 for his ''Nirala ki Sahitya Sadhana'' (in 3 parts).&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; His massive work ''Bharat ke Pracheen bhasha parivar aur Hindi'' won him the first [[Vyas Samman]] (1991) instituted by the [[K. K. Birla Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; He was [[Socialist]] both in thought and deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Hindi]] writers those who impressed him most, besides [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala'|Nirala]] the poet, are [[Acharya Shukla]] the critic, [[Bharatendu Harishchandra|Bhartendu]] the pioneer and [[Premchand]] the novelist.&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; He took them up for detailed study and wrote authentic [[literary criticism]] on them, though from the progressive angle.&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; He analysed their personality and brought out their contribution to [[Hindi literature]].&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt; According to him [[Bhartendu Harishchandra]], [[Premchand]] and [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala'|Nirala]] are outstanding not only as [[litterateur]]s but also as men endowed with magnanimity of soul.&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt;

===Assessment of Acharya Shukla===
In his assessment of [[Acharya Shukla]] (''Acharya Ramchandra Shukla aur Hindi Alochana'') eminent critic Dr. Sharma emphasises the fact that the great writer opposed [[feudal]] and courtly literature as it did not give a true picture of the life of the common people and contemporary society.&lt;ref name="Lal 1992 820"/&gt;

== Biography ==

Rashsundari was born in 1809 in the village of Potajia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her father, Padmalochan Roy, died when Rashsundari was a small child. She never saw her father and was raised by her mother and relatives. She attended a school run by a missionary woman in her father's house, where boys also studied. Rashsundari attended the school for a brief period and learned some [[Bangla language|Bangla]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].

At age 12 she married Sitanath Ray from Ramdia village, Rajbari, [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ফরিদ আহমেদ| title=পিঞ্জরাবদ্ধ এক বিহঙ্গীর ডানা ঝাপটানোর গল্প।|url=http://mukto-mona.com/bangla_blog/?p=37932}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a religious [[Vaishnavite]] by faith. With limited formal schooling, she learned to read driven by [[Bhakti]] (devotion), out of her keen desire to read Valmiki Purana and [[Chaitanya Bhagavata]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} She bore 12 children, of whom 7 died early. Her surviving children were Bepin Behari Sarkar, Dwarka Nath Sarkar, Kishori Lal Sarkar, Pratap Chandra Sarkar and Shyamasundary. Her husband died in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Amin |first=Sonia |year=2003 |chapter=Dasi, Rassundari |chapter-url=http://banglapedia.org/HT/D_0051.HTM |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=First |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316055526/http://banglapedia.org/HT/D_0051.HTM |archive-date=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son Kishori Lal Sarkar became an advocate at [[Calcutta High Court]] and is the author of several noteworthy works.&lt;ref&gt;''Hindu system of moral science'' (1895, 3rd revised and enlarged ed. 1912), ''Hindu system of religious science and art, or the revelations of rationalism and emotionalism'' (1898), ''Hindu system of self-culture of the Patanjala Yoga Shastra'' (1902), ''Mimansa rules of interpretation as applied to Hindu law'' (1909), ''An introduction to the Hindu system of physics, being an exposition of Kanad-Sûtras relating to the subject'' (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; Rassundari died in 1890.

== Writings ==

In 1876 Rassundari's autobiography ''Amar Jiban'' (''My Life'') was published. The book is in two parts, the first of which, consisting of sixteen shorter compositions narrated her autobiography. The second part, published in 1906, contained fifteen shorter compositions, each repceded by a dedicatory poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u297RJP9gvwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=tharu+lalita+women+writing+in+india#v=onepage&amp;q=tharu%20lalita%20women%20writing%20in%20india&amp;f=false|title=Women Writing in India: 600 B.C. to the early twentieth century|last=Tharu|first=Susie J.|last2=Lalita|first2=Ke|date=1991-01-01|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|year=|isbn=9781558610279|location=|pages=191|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jyotirindranath Tagore]] praised the book for the 'wonderful train of events' and its 'simple sweetness' of expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} [[Dinesh Chandra Sen]] called her [[prose]] an 'epitome of simple prose compositions of the bygone era'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dinesh Chandra Sen|title=Vanga Sahitya Parichaya or Selections from the Bengali Literature: Volume II| location=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book was translated into Hindi as ''Mera Jeevan''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16501">A '''scriptment''' is a written work by a movie or television [[screenwriter]] that combines elements of a [[screenplay|script]] and [[Film treatment|treatment]], especially the dialogue elements, which are formatted the same as in a screenplay. It is a more elaborate document than a standard draft treatment. Some films have been shot using only a scriptment.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Origin==
The term "scriptment" was originally coined by filmmaker [[James Cameron]], possibly during his early involvement in the development of the ''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]]'' film series. In that effort, after the success of his 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]'', Cameron wrote a 57-page scriptment for the first proposed ''Spider-Man'' film, which was used by screenwriter [[David Koepp]] to write the first draft, incorporating it nearly word for word.&lt;ref name="TotalFilmJan10"&gt;

}} "After the success of ''The Terminator,'' Cameron was announced as writer and director of a $60 m big-screen adaptation of the comic book classic. But thanks to a tangled web of litigation, studio bankrupticies, and wrangling over screenplay credits, that movie never saw light. . . . What remains, however, is Cameron's tantalising &lt;!-- British spelling --&gt;57-page Spidey 'scriptment', a compacted screenplay-cum-narrative that mapped out his entire film in brief. . . . Koepp's first draft is taken often word-for-word from Cameron's story, though later versions were heavily rewritten by numerous screenwriters. Despite this&amp;#151;and much to Cameron's chagrin&amp;#151; Koepp's name is the only one on the screenplay."&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron's scriptment for ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997) was 131 pages.&lt;ref&gt;

==Elements==
A scriptment borrows characteristics from both a regular [[screenplay]] and a film treatment and is comparable to a [[step outline]]: the main text body is similar to an elaborate draft treatment, while usually only major sequences receive scene location headings ([[Screenplay slug line|slug lines]]), which is different from the extensive slug line formatting in standard screenplays, where every new scene or shot begins with an INT./EXT. DAY/NIGHT slug line set above the description or dialogue. However, just as a treatment can be short or long, a scriptment can exist in various degrees of completion depending on how much time the writer has devoted to it and a more fully developed one could have all slug lines in place, a great deal of dialogue, and only require the producer's (or a writing partner's) okay on the direction the finished script should take before proceeding further.

In a scriptment, scenes and shots may be separated as paragraphs or sentences and, if it is the writer's style, can also include an occasional explanatory note, such as might be important in an adaptation or a sequel. As with standard treatments, much of the dialogue is summarized in action. The longer the scriptment, however, the more likely it contains dialog scenes that are fully developed. Single words or brief phrases of dialogue can be included within the description and lengthier exchanges are formatted exactly as a regular screenplay, which is the main reason for the "script" part of the term.

The longer the scriptment, the more likely it is written shot to shot as opposed to scene by scene; thus, a long, detailed scriptment does not necessarily equate to a longer movie, as a typical 90-120 page screenplay written with master scenes contains many more individual shots than are immediately apparent.

A scriptment can begin with FADE IN: top left and conclude with a centered THE END. It can have a title page like a script and lengthier treatment. It is written single spaced with an empty space between paragraphs and other elements and the pages are numbered in the upper right corner, just as in a screenplay.

==Work-in-progress manuscript==
Directors and screenwriters write scriptments as an intermediate stage in development from the draft treatment to the first draft of the screenplay. Like a draft treatment, a scriptment can be anywhere from 20 to 80 or more pages, while regular presentation treatments or [[Step outline|outline]]s only summarize the plot, typically in not more than 30 pages.

*For the [[Batman]] feature film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008), writer [[David S. Goyer]] and the film's director [[Christopher Nolan]] wrote a scriptment that was then used by Nolan and his brother [[Jonathan Nolan]] to expand further into a finished screenplay. "I wrote what you'd call a 'scriptment' with Chris over an accelerated month long period, and then we handed it off to his brother [Jonathan], who did the first pass," explains Goyer.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''sea captain''', '''ship's captain''', '''captain''', '''master''', or '''shipmaster''', is a high-grade [[licensed mariner]] who holds ultimate command and responsibility of a merchant vessel.&lt;ref name="am3"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The captain is responsible for the safe and efficient operation of the ship and its people and cargo, including its seaworthiness, safety and security, cargo operations, navigation, crew management, and legal compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edumaritime.net/stcw/general-requirements-for-masters IMO STCW Requirements for Masters]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties and functions==
The captain ensures that the ship complies with local and international laws and complies also with company and [[flag state]] policies.&lt;ref name="am3" /&gt; The captain is ultimately responsible, under the law, for aspects of operation such as the safe navigation of the ship,&lt;ref name="am4"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; its cleanliness and seaworthiness,&lt;ref name="am5"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; safe handling of all cargo,&lt;ref name="am7"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; management of all personnel,&lt;ref name="am7-11"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.7-11.&lt;/ref&gt; inventory of ship's cash and stores,&lt;ref name="am11-12"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and maintaining the ship's certificates and documentation.&lt;ref name="am13-15"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of a shipmaster's particularly important duties is to ensure compliance with the vessel's security plan, as required by the [[International Maritime Organization]]'s [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code|ISPS Code]].&lt;ref name="am97"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.97.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, customized to meet the needs of each individual ship, spells out duties including conducting searches and inspections,&lt;ref name="am100-101"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining restricted spaces,&lt;ref name="am100-101"/&gt; and responding to threats from terrorists, hijackers, pirates, and stowaways.&lt;ref name="am103-111"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.103-111.&lt;/ref&gt; The security plan also covers topics such as [[refugee|refugees]] and [[asylum seeker|asylum seekers]], smuggling, and saboteurs.&lt;ref name="am110-114"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.110-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

On ships without a [[purser]], the captain is in charge of the ship's [[accounting]].&lt;ref name="am209"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes ensuring an adequate amount of cash on board,&lt;ref name="am210-211"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.210-211.&lt;/ref&gt; coordinating the ship's payroll (including draws and advances),&lt;ref name="am211-223"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.211-223.&lt;/ref&gt; and managing the ship's slop chest.&lt;ref name="am223-225"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.223-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

On international voyages, the captain is responsible for satisfying requirements of the local [[immigration]] and [[customs]] officials.&lt;ref name="am175-208"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.175-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration issues can include situations such as embarking and disembarking passengers,&lt;ref name="am208"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.208.&lt;/ref&gt; handling crew members who desert the ship,&lt;ref name="am206-207"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.206-207.&lt;/ref&gt; making crew changes in port,&lt;ref name="am207"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.207.&lt;/ref&gt; and making accommodations for foreign crew members.&lt;ref name="am204206208"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.204, 206, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Customs requirements can include the master providing a cargo declaration, a ship's stores declaration, a declaration of crew members' personal effects, crew lists and passenger lists.&lt;ref name="am183-187"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.183-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

The captain has special responsibilities when the ship or its cargo are damaged, when the ship causes damage to other vessels or facilities. The master acts as a liaison to local investigators&lt;ref name="am46-47"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; and is responsible for providing complete and accurate logbooks, reports, statements and evidence to document an incident.&lt;ref name="am47-49"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.47-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific examples of the ship causing external damage include collisions with other ships or with fixed objects, grounding the vessel, and dragging anchor.&lt;ref name="am52-61"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.52-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Some common causes of cargo damage include heavy weather, water damage, pilferage, and damage caused during loading/unloading by the [[stevedore]]s.&lt;ref name="am65-69"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.65-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

All persons on board including public authorities, crew, and passengers are under the captain's authority and are his or her ultimate responsibility, particularly during navigation. In the case of injury or death of a crew member or passenger, the master is responsible to address any medical issues affecting the passengers and crew by providing medical care as possible, cooperating with shore-side medical personnel, and, if necessary, evacuating those who need more assistance than can be provided on board the ship.&lt;ref name="am77-98"&gt;Aragon and Messner, 2001, p.77-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performing marriages ===
There is a common belief that ship captains have historically been, and currently are, able to perform marriages. This depends on the country of registry, however most do not permit performance of a marriage by the master of a ship at sea.

In the [[United States Navy]], a captain’s powers are defined by its 1913 Code of Regulations, specifically stating: "The commanding officer shall not perform a marriage ceremony on board his ship or aircraft. He shall not permit a marriage ceremony to be performed on board when the ship or aircraft is outside the territory of the United States." However, there may be exceptions "in accordance with local laws and the laws of the state, territory, or district in which the parties are domiciled" and "in the presence of a diplomatic or consular official of the United States, who has consented to issue the certificates and make the returns required by the consular regulations."

Furthermore, in the [[United States]], there have been a few contradictory legal precedents: courts did not recognize a shipboard marriage in [[California]]'s 1898 ''Norman v. Norman'' but did in [[New York (state)|New York]]'s 1929 ''Fisher v. Fisher'' (notwithstanding the absence of municipal laws so carried) and in 1933's ''Johnson v. Baker'', an [[Oregon]] court ordered the payment of death benefits to a widow because she had established that her marriage at sea was lawful. However, in ''Fisher v. Fisher'' the involvement of the ship's captain was irrelevant to the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Dickey, "Family Law: Marriage on the High Seas" in ''Australian Law Journal'', Volume 62, p 717.&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]]'s 1919 ''Bolmer v. Edsall'' said a shipboard marriage ceremony is governed by the laws of the nation where ownership of the vessel lies.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the captain of a merchant ship has never been permitted to perform marriages, although from 1854 any which took place had to be reported in the ship's log.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/looking-for-person/bmdatseaorabroad.htm|title=Looking for records of a birth, marriage or death at sea or abroad|publisher=UK National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theshipslist.com/Forms/marriagesatsea.html BT 334/117], Register of marriages at sea (1854-1972), UK Board of Trade, archived at [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C438817 The National Archives, Kew] lists 219 marriages recorded in ship's logbooks, most performed at sea by chaplains or ministers of religion; their legal status nonetheless remains [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/TheShipsList/2002-01/1011884838 uncertain].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philippines|Filipino]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] law, as narrow exceptions, recognise a marriage ''in articulo mortis'' (on the point of death) solemnized by the captain of a ship or chief of an aeroplane during a voyage, or by the commanding officer of a military unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2010/august2010/158298.htm|title=G.R.

Some captains obtain other credentials (such as ordination as ministers of religion or accreditation as notaries public), which allow them to perform marriages in some jurisdictions where they would otherwise not be permitted to do so.&lt;ref name=nytrewrite&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/fashion/weddings/a-marriage-at-sea-get-me-rewrite.html|title=A Marriage at Sea?

In works of fiction, ship captains have performed marriages in various media, including the 1951 film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'', and episodes of ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]], [[The Office (U.S. TV series)]]'' and various ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.&lt;ref name=nytrewrite /&gt;

==Licensing==
{{globalize|section|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
[[File:Usmm-license.jpg|thumb|right|A ship's captain must have a number of qualifications, including a license.]]

To become a ''master of vessels of any gross tons upon oceans'' in the United States, one must first accumulate at least 360 days of service (Recency – 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) while holding a [[chief mate]]'s license.  The chief mate's license, in turn, requires at least 360 days of service (Recency – 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) while holding a [[second mate]]'s license, passing a battery of examinations, and approximately 13 weeks of classes. Similarly, one must have worked as a [[third mate]] for 360 days (Recency – 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) to have become a second mate.

There are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate "sea time" and take a series of training classes and examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3c91d4046f9587b25d46063179b29ec3;rgn=div5;view=text;node=46%3A1.0.1.2.10;idno=46;cc=ecfr#46:1.0.1.2.10.4.7.5|title=U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 46, Part 10, Subpart 407|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153925/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3c91d4046f9587b25d46063179b29ec3;rgn=div5;view=text;node=46:1.0.1.2.10;idno=46;cc=ecfr#46:1.0.1.2.10.4.7.5|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the [[U.S. Merchant Marine Academy]] (deck curriculum), and the six state maritime academies in [[Maine Maritime Academy|Maine]], [[Massachusetts Maritime Academy|Massachusetts]], [[SUNY Maritime College|New York]], [[Texas Maritime Academy|Texas]], or [[California Maritime Academy|California]] or the [[Great Lakes Maritime Academy]], or a three-year apprentice mate training program approved by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. Furthermore, third mate's licenses can be obtained through the [[United States Coast Guard Academy|U.S. Coast Guard Academy]] and the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] with approved courses and requisite sea time as an Officer in Charge of a Navigational Watch.

A seaman may start the process of obtaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as [[able seaman]], [[boatswain]], or [[quartermaster]]. Then the seaman takes required training courses, and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the [[United States Coast Guard]] for a third mate's license.

An alternate method of obtaining a license as a master of vessels of any gross tons upon oceans, without sailing as a third, second, or chief mate, is to obtain one year of sea service as a ''1st class pilot of any gross tons'' or ''mate of vessels of any gross tons upon Great Lakes and inland waters''. Then pass an examination for the license of ''master of vessels of any gross tons upon Great Lakes and inland waters''. A master of vessels of any gross tons upon Great Lakes and inland waters may, without any additional sea service, take the examination for ''master of vessels of any gross tons upon near coastal waters''. If the candidate does not already have sufficient deep sea experience he may with six months of additional sea service, in any licensed capacity, take a partial examination consisting primarily of celestial navigation and have the near coastal restriction removed.
46CFR 11.403

A master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training. A Chief Mate to Master formal training generally takes about 12 weeks and provides the knowledge, skills and other soft skills training to take on the duties and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edumaritime.com/washington/pacific-maritime-institute-seattle|title=Chief Mate Master Training|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various US states require and issue shipmaster or captain licenses in order to be employed in operating a vessel for hire, while navigating within "non-federal" waters. (Such as a lake or river charter boat "skipper"). Most states honor a USCG master's certificate as an alternative to their state licensing. These state licenses certify that the captain has given satisfactory evidence that he/she can safely be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of operating or navigating passenger carrying vessels of the tonnage and upon the waters specified. The state licensed captains command vessels that range from small uninspected vessels to large excursion vessels that carry over 100 passengers, so the licenses are not issued haphazardly. For example, see Washington State's Certification of Charter Boats and Operators licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lni.wa.gov/TradesLicensing/LicensingReq/ChartVes/ |title=Charter Boats |publisher=Lni.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==

===United Kingdom===
As of 2008, the U.K. [[Learning and Skills Council]] lists annual salaries for senior deck officers as ranging from £22,000 to over £50,000 per year.&lt;ref name="lsc"&gt;Learning and Skills Council, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council characterizes job opportunities for senior deck officers as "generally good" and expects a "considerable increase" in the job market over the next few years.&lt;ref name="lsc"/&gt;

===United States===
As of 2013, captains of U.S.-flagged deep sea vessels make up to US$1500 per day, or US$80,000 to US$300,000 per year.&lt;ref name="pel160"&gt;Pelletier, 2007, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; Captains of smaller vessels in the inland and coastal trade earn between US$350 and US$700 per day, or US$65,000 to $180,000 per year.&lt;ref name="pel160"/&gt; Captains of large ferries average US$56,794 annually.&lt;ref name="pel160"/&gt;

In 2005, 3,393 mariners held active unlimited master's licenses.&lt;ref name="pel45"&gt;Pelletier, 2007, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; 87 held near-coastal licenses with unlimited tonnage, 291 held unlimited tonnage master's licenses on inland and Great Lakes waters, while 1,044 held unlimited licenses upon inland waters only.&lt;ref name="pel45"/&gt; Some 47,163 active masters licenses that year had tonnage restrictions, well over half of those being for near-coastal vessels of up to 100 tons [[gross tonnage]].&lt;ref name="pel45"/&gt;

As of 2006, some 34,000 people were employed as captains, mates, and pilots of water vessels in the United States.&lt;ref name="bls4"&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008-2009, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] projects 18% growth in this occupation, expecting demand for 40,000 shipmasters in 2016.&lt;ref name="bls4"/&gt;

==Uniform==
[[File:POL PMW pagon1 kapitan marynarki.svg|thumb|100px|right|A captain's insignia that features the "executive curl."]]

Uniforms are worn aboard many ships, or aboard any vessels of traditional and organized navigation companies, and are required by company regulation on passenger and cruise vessels.

In the passenger-carrying trade a unified corporate image is often desired and it is useful for those unfamiliar with the vessel to be able to identify members of the crew and their function. Some companies and some countries use an [[executive curl]] similar to that of the [[Royal Navy]].

In the United States, and in numerous other maritime countries, captains and officers of shipping companies may wear a [[merchant navy]] or [[merchant marine]] regular uniform in conjunction with their employment.

===Captain's seniority===
In a few countries, such as UK, USA and Italy, some captains with particular experience in navigation and '''command at sea''', may be named [[commodore (rank)|commodore]] or [[senior captain]] or ''shipmaster senior grade''.

===Master===
The term ''master'' is descended from the Latin ''[[wikt:magister#Noun 2|magister]] [[wikt:navis|navis]]'', used during the imperial Roman age to designate the nobleman ([[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]) who was in ultimate authority on board a vessel. The ''magister navis'' had the right to wear the ''[[laurus]]'' or ''corona laurèa'' and the ''corona navalis''. Carrying on this tradition, the modern-day shipmaster of some nations wears [[Gold (color)|golden]] [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] [[leaves]] or [[Gold (color)|golden]] [[oak]] [[leaves]] on the visor of his cap.

===Skipper===
A '''skipper''' is a person who has [[Command and control|command]] of a [[boat]] or [[sea]][[craft]] or [[tug]], more or less equivalent to "captain in charge aboard [[ship]]." At sea, or upon lakes and rivers, the skipper as shipmaster or captain has command over the whole crew. The skipper may or may not be the owner of the boat.

The word is derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''schipper''; ''schip'' is Dutch for "ship". In Dutch ''sch-'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|sx|}} and English-speakers rendered this as {{IPA|[sk]}}.

The word "skipper" is used more than "captain" for some types of craft, for example [[fishing boat]]s.

It is also more frequently used than captain with privately owned noncommercial or semi-commercial vessels, such as small [[yacht]]s and other recreational boats, mostly in cases where the person in command of the boat may not be a licensed or professional captain, suggesting the term is less formal. In the U.S., a "skipper" who is in command of a charter vessel that carries paying passengers must be licensed by a state or the USCG. If the vessel carries over six paying passengers, it must be an "inspected vessel" and a higher class license must be obtained by the skipper/master depending on the vessel's gross tons.

In the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]], [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]], [[U.S. Coast Guard]], and merchant naval slang, it is a term used in reference to the [[commanding officer]] of any ship, base, or other command regardless of rank. It is generally only applied to someone who has earned the speaker's respect, and only used with the permission of the commander/commanding officer in question.

Skipper RNR was an actual rank used in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Naval Reserve]] for skippers of fishing boats who were members of the service. It was equivalent to [[Warrant Officer]]. Skippers could also be promoted to Chief Skipper RNR (equivalent to [[Commissioned Warrant Officer]]) and Skipper [[Lieutenant]] RNR.

'''Shinji''' (Sinji), or '''Yungo''', is a [[Bantu language]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], between Mbangala and Yaka.

According to ''Multitree'', the spellings are Şinji (Shinji) and Nuŋgo, rather than Yungo as in Maho (2009),&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; and mentions of the language in the literature are almost entirely in reference to Guthrie.&lt;ref&gt; [http://multitree.org/codes/none Shinji] at ''[[MultiTree]]'' on [[the Linguist List]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In computing and typesetting, a '''soft hyphen''' (ISO 8859: 0xAD, Unicode {{unichar|00AD|soft hyphen}}, HTML: &amp;amp;#173; &amp;amp;shy;) or '''syllable hyphen''' (EBCDIC: 0xCA), abbreviated '''SHY''', is a code point reserved in some [[coded character set]]s for the purpose of breaking words across lines by inserting visible [[hyphen]]s. Two alternative ways of using the soft hyphen character for this purpose have emerged, depending on whether the encoded text will be broken into lines by its recipient, or has already been preformatted by its originator.&lt;ref name="tut"&gt;{{cite web| title= Soft hyphen (SHY) – a hard problem?|  url= http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/shy.html | author=Jukka Korpela | publisher= [[Tampere University of Technology]] | date= January 2011 | accessdate= 2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuhn"&gt;{{cite web| title= Unicode interpretation of SOFT HYPHEN breaks ISO 8859-1 compatibility|  url= https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2003/03155r-kuhn-soft-hyphen.pdf | author=[[Markus G.

== Text to be formatted by the recipient ==
The use of SHY characters in text that will be broken into lines by the recipient is the application context considered by the post-1999 [[HTML]] and [[Unicode]] specifications, as well as some word-processing file formats. In this context, the soft hyphen may also be called a '''discretionary hyphen''' or '''optional hyphen'''.  It serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a [[Line wrap|line break]] in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after [[word wrapping]] at the end of a line. The soft hyphen's Unicode semantics and HTML implementation are in many ways similar to Unicode's [[zero-width space]], with the exception that the soft hyphen will preserve the [[kerning]] of the characters on either side when not visible. The zero-width space, on the other hand, will not, as it is considered a visible character even if not rendered, thus having its own kerning metrics.

To show the effect of a soft hyphen in HTML, the following words have been separated with soft hyphens:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="background:#f7f7f7; width:70%; margin:auto;"&gt;
Margaret&amp;shy;Are&amp;shy;You&amp;shy;Grieving&amp;shy;Over&amp;shy;Goldengrove&amp;shy;Unleaving&amp;shy;Leaves&amp;shy;Like&amp;shy;The&amp;shy;Things&amp;shy;Of&amp;shy;Man&amp;shy;You&amp;shy;With&amp;shy;Your&amp;shy;Fresh&amp;shy;Thoughts&amp;shy;Care&amp;shy;For&amp;shy;Can&amp;shy;You&amp;shy;Ah&amp;shy;As&amp;shy;The&amp;shy;Heart&amp;shy;Grows&amp;shy;Older&amp;shy;It&amp;shy;Will&amp;shy;Come&amp;shy;To&amp;shy;Such&amp;shy;Sights&amp;shy;Colder&amp;shy;By&amp;shy;And&amp;shy;By&amp;shy;Nor&amp;shy;Spare&amp;shy;A&amp;shy;Sigh&amp;shy;Though&amp;shy;Worlds&amp;shy;Of&amp;shy;Wanwood&amp;shy;Leafmeal&amp;shy;Lie&amp;shy;And&amp;shy;Yet&amp;shy;You&amp;shy;Will&amp;shy;Weep&amp;shy;And&amp;shy;Know&amp;shy;Why&amp;shy;Now&amp;shy;No&amp;shy;Matter&amp;shy;Child&amp;shy;The&amp;shy;Name&amp;shy;Sorrows&amp;shy;Springs&amp;shy;Are&amp;shy;The&amp;shy;Same&amp;shy;Nor&amp;shy;Mouth&amp;shy;Had&amp;shy;No&amp;shy;Nor&amp;shy;Mind&amp;shy;Expressed&amp;shy;What&amp;shy;Heart&amp;shy;Heard&amp;shy;Of&amp;shy;Ghost&amp;shy;Guessed&amp;shy;It&amp;shy;Is&amp;shy;The&amp;shy;Blight&amp;shy;Man&amp;shy;Was&amp;shy;Born&amp;shy;For&amp;shy;It&amp;shy;Is&amp;shy;Margaret&amp;shy;You&amp;shy;Mourn&amp;shy;For
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On HTML browsers supporting soft hyphens, resizing the window will re-break the above text only at word boundaries, and insert a hyphen at the end of each line.

[[HTML4]] describes it as a "hyphenation hint", though it suggests that that interpretation is not universal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#h-9.3.3 | title= 9.3.3 Hyphenation | work= HTML 4.01 Specification | date= 24 December 1999| publisher= [[World Wide Web Consortium]] | accessdate= 2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In HTML, there are two types of hyphens: the plain hyphen and the soft hyphen. The plain hyphen should be interpreted by a [[user agent]] as just another character. The soft hyphen tells the user agent where a line break can occur. Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens must observe the following semantics. If a line is broken at a soft hyphen, a hyphen character must be displayed at the end of the first line. If a line is not broken at a soft hyphen, the user agent must not display a hyphen character. For operations such as searching and sorting, the soft hyphen should always be ignored.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Text preformatted by the originator ==
The SHY character is also used in text where paragraphs have already been broken into lines, such as certain [[plain text]] files, text sent to [[VT100]]-style [[terminal emulator]]s or printers, or pages represented in [[page description language]]s. This is the application context originally considered by the [[EBCDIC]] and [[ISO 8859-1]] standards and implemented in many [[VT100]] [[terminal emulator]]s.&lt;ref name="tut"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kuhn/&gt;

Here, SHY is a visible hyphen that is usually visually indistinguishable from a regular hyphen, but has been inserted solely for the purpose of line breaking. The purpose of the soft hyphen here is to distinguish it from any regular hyphen that might have been part of the original spelling of the word. This distinction helps re-use of already formatted text, when line breaks and soft hyphens inserted during word wrapping have to be removed to convert the text back into its unformatted form. For example, the copy or paste function of a [[terminal emulator]] can offer to replace line breaks with a [[space character]], and remove any soft hyphens including any immediately following [[whitespace character]]s.

An example application that outputs soft hyphens for this reason is the [[groff (software)|groff]] text formatter as used on many Unix/Linux systems to display [[man pages]].

== Encodings and definitions ==
SHY characters in coded characters sets, roughly in chronological order:
* [[EBCDIC]] placed a SHY character (known there as a "syllable hyphen") at position 202 (0xCA [[hexadecimal]]).&lt;ref name="tut"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code - S/390 |url= http://www.comsci.us/datacom/ebcdic3.html | publisher= comsci.us| accessdate= 2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM defined its purpose as a "hyphen used to divide a word at the end of a line [that] may be removed when a program adjusts lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Glossary |url= http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r4/topic/rzaat/rzaats.htm#x2047006 | publisher= [[IBM]] | accessdate= 2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ISO 8859-1]]:1986 (Latin 1) inherited SHY from EBCDIC, but called it "soft hyphen", placed it at position 0xAD (hexadecimal), and stated its purpose as "for use when a line break has been established within a word". Other [[ISO 8859]] parts placed it at the same position, with the exception of [[ISO 8859-11]] (Latin/Thai), which lacks it.
* IBM [[code page 850]] (an [[MS-DOS]] character set covering all ISO 8859-1 characters) placed it at position 240 = 0xF0.
* [[SGML]]'s "Numeric and Special Graphic" (isonum) [[character entity]] set (ISO 8879:1986) includes "&amp;amp;shy;" for the ISO 8859-1 soft hyphen.
* Unicode 1.0 (1991) and ISO 10646 (1993) took the first 256 code positions from ISO 8859-1, resulting in SHY at Unicode code point of U+00AD.
* [[HTML]] 2 (1995) incorporated the "&amp;amp;shy;" character entity from SGML, but explicitly discouraged its use.
* HTML 4 (1999) redefined the purpose of the character as marking a hyphenation opportunity, which only becomes visible as a hyphen at the end of a line after formatting.
* Unicode 4.0 (2002) changed the category of its SHY character from previously "Pd" (punctuation, dash) to "Cf" (other, format), thereby aligning its interpretation of the character with that of HTML 4.

Other commands for marking hyphenation opportunities in text formatting languages (similar to the HTML 4 and Unicode 4.0 interpretation of SHY):
* [[troff]] and [[groff (software)|groff]]: &lt;code&gt;\%&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]]: &lt;code&gt;\-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Commonly Confused Characters | url=http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/reference/characters/#dash | publisher= Greg Baker, [[Simon Fraser University]] | accessdate= 2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security issues==
Soft hyphens have been used to [[Obfuscated code|obscure]] malicious [[domain name|domains]] or [[URL]]s in [[e-mail spam]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title= Spammers Using Soft Hyphen To Hide Malicious URLs |url= http://it.slashdot.org/story/10/10/07/2127241/Spammers-Using-Soft-Hyphen-To-Hide-Malicious-URLs | date= 7 October 2010 | publisher= [[Slashdot]] | accessdate= 2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Soft Hyphen – A New URL Obfuscation Technique |url= http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/soft-hyphen-new-url-obfuscation-technique | publisher= [[Symantec]] | accessdate= 2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''T. R. Subba Rao''' (1920–1984) ('''Taluku Ramaswami Subba Rao''' ({{lang-kn|ತಳುಕು ರಾಮಸ್ವಾಮಿ ಸುಬ್ಬ ರಾವ್}}), popularly known as '''TaRaSu''') was a novelist and a scholar in [[Kannada]] language.&lt;ref name="bk"&gt;Mohan Lal and Others (1992), p4185&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered as a harbinger of the [[Kannada literature#Navya|Navya]] movement of [[Kannada literature]]. He is well known for his novels like ''Durgashtamana'', which won him the [[Sahitya Akademi]] award posthumously in 1985.

==Early life==
TaRaSu was born on 21 April 1920 in [[Malebennur]] in the [[Karnataka]] state of [[India]].&lt;ref name="chi"&gt;http://www.chitharadurga.com/I_Legend.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His father Ramaswamaiah was a lawyer in the town of [[Harihar]] and his mother was Seethamma. His ancestors were from the village of Taluku in the [[Chitradurga district]] of Karnataka. He wrote his first story called ''Puttana Chendu'' (Putta's ball) to win a bet against his uncle [[TS Venkannaiah]] who made self-less contribution to Kannada language through promoting many prominent authors. When he was 17 years old, he joined the [[Indian freedom movement]] and went around the villages in the [[Chitradurga]] district, singing patriotic songs and giving speeches for independence. He was arrested and jailed when he was giving one of the speeches in Bagur village.&lt;ref name="chi"/&gt;

Fearing that his son would lose out on education by joining the freedom movement, Ramaswamaiah admitted his son to the National School in [[Bangalore]]. After completing his secondary education, TaRaSu joined a college in [[Shimoga]]. After completing his junior intermediate education, he joined a college in [[Tumkur]] to complete senior intermediate education. However, the students started boycotting the classes due to the arrest of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and others during the [[Quit India]] movement.&lt;ref name="chi"/&gt; He and his friends started making plans to join the movement. This came to the notice of the police, who arrested TaRaSu and jailed him. He was released in the month of December 1942. He decided that he was not going to study further unless India attains independence.&lt;ref name="chi"/&gt; He was an atheist in early life but converted into a believer in the later stages.

==Family==
TaRaSu's came from a literary family. His niece [[Vishalakshi Dakshinamurthy]], is a notable Kannada Novelist and writer famous for his novel based film [[Jeevana Chaitra]] which starred [[Dr. Rajakumar|Dr.Rajakumar]], well known Kannada Actor. TaSu Sham Rao, was also related to TaRaSu.

==Career==

===As a journalist===
In 1942, TaRaSu went to Bangalore and joined as a sub-editor for the Kannada newspaper, ''VishwaKarnataka'', earning a paltry sum of Rs. 25 as salary per month. During this period, he married ''Ambuja''. He later worked for the ''Prajamatha'', ''Vahini'' and ''Navodaya'' newspapers. His career in journalism also included a stint with ''Prajavani'', ''Mysuru'', ''Kaladoota'' and ''Vicharavani'' newspapers.&lt;ref name="chi"/&gt;

===As a writer===
TaRaSu was initially influenced by the [[Pragatisheela]] writings of the [[Kannada]] scholar [[A. N. Krishna Rao]]. Hence, his initial writings belong to the pragatisheela style and contain novels like ''Purushavatara'' and ''Munjavininda Munjavu''. These writings mainly deal with the issues faced by the downtrodden and the lower caste society.&lt;ref name="bk"/&gt; Occasionally, he also came up with novels that were not of this genre, like ''Chandavalliya Thota'' which was based on a [[Gandhism|Gandhian]] theme of rural life in India.&lt;ref name="bk1"&gt;Yogendra K Malik, p130&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his most celebrated novels include ''Masanada Hoovu'', which talks about the plight of prostitutes and ''[[Hamsa Geethe (Book)|Hamsa Geethe]]'', which talks about the life of a musician in the context of Chitradurga being passed from the hands of the [[Palaiyakkarar]]s to [[Hyder Ali]].&lt;ref name="bk2"&gt;K. M. George (1992), p183&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these novels have been made into films in [[Kannada]]. ''Hamsageethe'' was chosen as a text book for graduation classes and a [[Hindi]] film, [[Basant Bahar (film)|Basant Bahar]], was based on it.

TaRaSu has also written many historical novels, the most famous being [[Durgaastamana]] (fall of the Durga fort), which won him the [[Sahitya Akademi]] award in 1985.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/awa10307.htm#kannada|title=Sahitya Akademi Awards 1955–2007|accessdate=2009-03-14|work=Website of [[Sahitya Akademi]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331234009/http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/awa10307.htm#kannada|archivedate=31 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last novel that he wrote and it talks of the fall of Chitradurga Palaiyakkarars under the hands of Hyder Ali. His another historical novel based on Chitradurga's history is ''Kambaniya Kuyilu'' and its sequels ''Tirugubana'' and ''Raktaratri''. He also wrote a novel called ''Shilpashree'' which is based on [[Chavundaraya]], the person who commissioned the statue of [[Bahubali]] at [[Shravanabelagola]]. For nearly two decades, much of the historical source material for his numerous novels were sufficed by the eminent Indian historian [[S. Srikanta Sastri]]. [[S. Srikanta Sastri]] even wrote an erudite and scholarly foreword to one of Ta. Ra. Su.'s famous novels – "Nrupatunga".&lt;ref name='Preface to "Nrupatunga" by Dr S. Srikanta Sastri' references group="References"&gt;{{cite web|last=S. Srikanta|first=Sastri|title=Preface to "Nrupatunga" by Dr S.

==Later life==
TaRaSu had planned to write many more books but they remained incomplete. This includes his autobiography, ''Hindirugi Nodidaaga'' (As I look back). He died on 10 Apr 1984. The autobiography was completed by his wife and released in 1990.&lt;ref name="chi"/&gt;

The '''Temple Entry Proclamation''' was issued by [[Maharaja]] [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma]] in 1936 and abolished the ban on the so called 'low caste people' or ''[[avarna]]s'' from entering [[Hindu]] temples in the  Princely State of [[Travancore]], now part of [[Kerala]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Religion and Social Conflict in South Asia By Bardwell L. Smith, p42, [https://books.google.com/books?id=07Y3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Temple+Entry+Proclamation Google book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proclamation was a milestone in the history of Travancore and Kerala. Today, Temple Entry Proclamation Day is considered to be a social reformation day by the [[Government of Kerala]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== History ==
Following the campaign to introduce social reform in [[Travancore]] inspired by the teachings of [[Narayana Guru]] and others, a deputation of six leaders appointed by the [[Harijan Sevak Sangh]] toured the princely state to obtain support from caste [[Hinduism|Hindus]] for so called [[dalit|untouchable people]] to be allowed to enter state-operated temples.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Vaikom Satyagraha===
According to historian [[Romila Thapar]], protests in 1924–25 against the prohibition of untouchables using a public road near a temple in [[Vaikom]] were a significant precursor to the temple entry movement. Known as the [[Vaikom Satyagraha]], the protests sought equal rights of access in areas previously restricted to members of upper castes. The protests expanded to become a movement seeking rights of access to the interior of the temples themselves. These peaceful protests inspired the future ''[[satyagraha]]s'' of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extreme injustice led to Vaikom Satyagraha, says Romila Thapar|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/22/stories/2009072256040900.htm|accessdate=17 February 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=22 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128010041/http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/22/stories/2009072256040900.htm|archive-date=28 November 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temple entry committee ==
[[File:Temple entry proclamation 1936 Navayikkulam.jpg|thumb|upright|Proclamation in Thiruvananthapuram district]]

In 1932, [[Chithira Thirunal]] appointed a committee to examine the question of temple entry.{{cn|date=January 2018}} This opened the possibility of reversing the opposition to the practice that had been shown by his predecessors, [[Moolam Thirunal]] and Regent Maharani [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]]. Subsequent to a meeting with Gandhi, Bayi had released those who had been imprisoned by Moolam Thirunal for involvement with the Vaikom Satyagraha and had opened the north, south and west public roads that provided access to [[Vaikom Mahadeva Temple]] to all castes. She refused to open the eastern road to the temple because it was used by [[Brahmins]]. She avoided acting on Gandhi's advice by pointing out that she was a regent for her minor nephew, [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma|Chithira Thirunal]] and so had no power to do so.

Annoyed with this response Gandhi asked the 12-year-old prince, who immediately promised that it would happen during his reign.&lt;ref name="Gandhi Marg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gandhi Smarak Nidhi|first1=Gandhi Peace Foundation (New Delhi, India)|title=Gandhi Marg|publisher=Gandhi Peace Foundation, 2007|location=The University of California|pages=93–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was later quoted by [[K. R. Narayanan]], the former [[President of India]], in his speech referring to the progressive mind of Chithira Thirunal. {{quote|During the Vaikom Sathyagraha, Mahatma Gandhi visited Kerala. At that time, Sree Chithira Thirunal was a young man, and he has not ascended the throne. Gandhiji asked "When you attain majority and when you assume full authority, will you allow Harijans to enter the temple". The twelve-year-old Maharajah said without hesitation "Certainly". This was not the result of anybody's advice. This arose from his own mind; from his own thinking and that is why I say, in spite of all the advice and influences in which he was enveloped, he had a mind and he had a policy of his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=K. R.

The Regent's refusal to act on temple entry rights attracted criticism from people such as [[Mannathu Padmanabhan]], who accused her of being under the influence of the Brahmins and said that her excuse that she had no power to decide was a lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keith E.

== Royal proclamation and its aftermath ==
[[File:Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma.jpg|400x400px|thumbnail|Maharaja Sree Chithira Thirunal in 1931]]

Chithira Thirunal signed the Proclamation on the eve of his 24th birthday in 1936. [[C. P. Ramaswami Aiyer]] said of the decision that: {{quote|The Proclamation is a unique occasion in the history of India and specially of Hinduism. It fell to the lot of His Highness, not as a result of agitation, although some people have claimed to result as due to agitation, but ''suo moto'' and of his own free will, to have made it possible for every Hindu subject to enter the historic temples of this land of faith and bend in adoration before the Supreme. Such an act required a minority vision and usage amidst difficulties and handicaps. when it is remembered that this decision was a purely voluntary act, on the part of sovereign, solicitous for the welfare of this subjects and was not the result of any immediate pressure, the greatness of the achievement becomes even more apparent. This action broke the calamity of Hindu religion and helped to strengthen the Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=inflibnet.ac.in|first1=shodhganga|title=CHAPTER – VI  TEMPLE ENTRY FREEDOM IN KERALA|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/317/12/12_chapter%206.pdf|website=shodhganga|publisher=RESEARCHERS OF MAHATMA GANDHI UTY, KOTTAYAM, KERALA|accessdate=13 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222051158/http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/317/12/12_chapter%206.pdf|archive-date=22 February 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an open letter addressed to the maharajah, Gandhi said: {{quote|People call me "The Mahatma" and I don’t think I deserve it. But in my view, you have in reality become a "Mahatma"(great soul) by your proclamation at this young age, breaking the age-old custom and throwing open the doors of the Temples to our brothers and sisters whom the hateful tradition considered as untouchables.

Historians{{who|date=January 2018}} believe that it was Aiyar's legal skill that overcame the practical difficulties posed by the orthodox Hindus before the proclamation. He foresaw the objections that could be raised against temple entry and dealt with them one by one. He was also able to ensure that the actual declaration was known beforehand to few people.

The Universities of [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] and [[Annamalai University|Annamalai]] conferred D.Litt degrees on the Maharajah and life-size statues of him were erected in Trivandrum and [[Chennai|Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=G.|last=Mahadevan|title=Temple Entry Proclamation the greatest act of moral freedom: Uthradom Tirunal|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/temple-entry-proclamation-the-greatest-act-of-moral-freedom-uthradom-tirunal/article2620727.ece|accessdate=13 June 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030194526/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/temple-entry-proclamation-the-greatest-act-of-moral-freedom-uthradom-tirunal/article2620727.ece|archive-date=30 October 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists{{who|date=January 2018}} believe that the Proclamation struck at the root of caste discrimination in Travancore and that by serving to unite Hindus it prevented further conversions to other religions. The Proclamation was the first of its kind in a princely state as well as in [[British India]]. Even though there were agitations in various parts of India as well as rest of Kerala for temple entry, none managed to achieve their aim.

=== Temple entry in Cochin And Malabar ===
The Travancore Temple Entry Proclamation did not have a serious influence in [[Cochin]] or British [[Malabar region|Malabar]] as the [[Kingdom of Cochin|Maharajah of Cochin]] and the [[Zamorin of Calicut|Zamorin]] were staunch opponents of temple entry for [[dalits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=inflibnet.ac.in|first1=shodhganga|title=CHAPTER – VI  TEMPLE ENTRY FREEDOM IN KERALA|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/317/12/12_chapter%206.pdf|website=shodhganga|publisher=RESEARCHERS OF MAHATMA GANDHI UTY, KOTTAYAM, KERALA|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222051158/http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/317/12/12_chapter%206.pdf|archive-date=22 February 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Casabianca of Travancore | date=26 March 2002 | newspaper=The Hindu | quote=Incidentally it came as a surprise to many at the time that the then Maharaja of adjacent Cochin State who was later applauded by Nehru for being the first princely ruler in 1946 to constitute a responsible government was a staunch opponent of temple entry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cochin Maharajah went to the extent of declaring the whole people of Travancore as [[dalit|untouchables]] and forbade any Travancore citizen from entering temples under the control of the Cochin government. The Cochin ruler even forbade rituals like ''Arattu'' (holy bathing) and ''Para'' (holy procession) in Tripunithura and Chottanikkara temples.

Even when universal temple entry was granted in 1947 the Cochin maharajah made an exemption in the bill so as to keep his family temple, "Sree Poornathrayeesha", out of the purview of temple entry. The Zamorin of Malabar had no wish to change the existing customs and usages in temples; on hearing the news of the Travancore Temple Entry proclamation he said that the Travancore Maharajah had freedom to give temple entry right to his subjects but he was unable to do so as he was only a trustee of the temples which were under the supervision of Hindu Religions Endowment Board. He also sent a memorandum to the authorities claiming no one had the authority to take decisions regarding temple entry as they were private properties. Universal temple entry was only granted in Malabar region in 1947 after India's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Digital Concepts Cochin|first=BeeHive Digital Concepts Cochin for|author2=Mahatma Gandhi University Kottayam|title=TEMPLE ENTRY FREEDOM IN KERALA|journal=Shodhganga.inflibnet.ac|volume=CHAPTER VI|pages=1–46|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/317/12/12_chapter%206.pdf|accessdate=14 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222051158/http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/317/12/12_chapter%206.pdf|archive-date=22 February 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Text to speech in digital television''' refers to [[digital television]] products that use [[speech synthesis]]  (computer generated speech providing a product that “talks” to the end user) to enable access by [[Visual impairment|blind or partially sighted people]]. By combining a digital television solution (a [[television]], [[set-top box]], [[personal video recorder]] or other type of [[Tuner (television)#Television|receiver]]) with a speech synthesis engine, blind and partially sighted people are able to access information that is displayed to other users visually on the screen and therefore can operate the menus and [[electronic program guide]]s of the receiver.

==User need==

Using an audiovisual medium involves obvious problems for certain groups of people with disabilities, notably individuals with sight or hearing loss. These problems can be split between [[User interface|interface]] [[accessibility]] barriers and impediments in using the content itself. [[Text-to-speech]] in television products is a feature that addresses interface accessibility barriers for blind and partially sighted people who are unable to use in the standard visual interface even where this has special features such as large fonts, magnifiers, adjustable colour schemes, etc.

Digital television solutions are often more complicated products compared to their analogue ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/03/red_button_connect_tv_simple.html | title = Me and My TV - How Can we Connect? | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | last = Danker | first = Daniel | date = 2 Mar 2012 | format = PDF | work = BBC Internet Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to navigate many menus, to see on-screen program information and to browse electronic program guides or on-screen content listings to find out what is available to watch – these are all essential to using digital TV.

Policy makers across the world have recognized the importance of access to (digital) television:
* Recital 64 of the EU’s Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU directive | serial = 65 | year = 2007 | date = 11 Dec 2007 | description = on  the  coordination  of  certain  provisions  laid  down  by  law,  regulation  or  administrative  action  in Member  States  concerning  the  provision  of  audiovisual  media  services  (Audiovisual  Media  Services Directive)
| eurlextag = OJ:L:2007:332:0027:01:EN:HTML }}&lt;/ref&gt; states: "''The right of persons with a disability and of the elderly to participate and be integrated in the social and cultural life of the Community is inextricably linked to the provision of accessible audiovisual media services.''"
* The initial report of a European Commission study "Measuring progress of eAccessibility in Europe"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = MeAC - Measuring Progress of eAccessibility in Europe | title = Assessment of the Status of eAccessibility in Europe - Main Report | editor-first = Lutz | editor-last = Kubitschke | editor2-first = Kevin | editor2-last = Cullen | editor-first3 = Ingo | editor-last3 = Meyer | place = Bonn | date = October 2007 | contribution-url = http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/docs/subgroupmtg_jan10/meac_study/meac_report_06_11_final.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to television as one of a set of fields "''that are now essential elements of social and economic life''".
* The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities&lt;ref name='UNCRPD'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml | title = Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | author = United Nations | authorlink = United_nations | year = 2006 | publisher = [[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes specific reference to television access services in Article 30(1) ("Participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport"): "''States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to take part on an equal basis with others in cultural life, and shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities:'' [...] ''b. Enjoy access to television programmes, films, theatre and other cultural activities, in accessible formats''".

==History==
Text-to-speech software has been widely available for desktop computers since the 1990s and [[Moore’s Law]] increases in [[CPU]] and [[Random-access memory|memory]] capabilities have contributed to making their inclusion in software and hardware solutions more feasible. In the wake of these trends in information technology, text-to-speech is finding its way into everyday [[consumer electronics]]. In addition to text-to-speech solutions for computers, there are now talking watches and clocks, calendars, thermometers, kitchen aids and many other products. Talking books have also been around for some time, and GPS navigation systems have become widely used as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rnib.org.uk/shop/Pages/Category.aspx?category=top_ten_talking_products | title = Top ten talking products | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | author = RNIB | authorlink = RNIB | publisher = RNIB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations representing blind and partially sighted people are long-standing supporters of text-to-speech technology in consumer electronics. In the UK, the [[RNIB|Royal National Institute of Blind People]] (RNIB) has been arguing for speaking radio and television products since the early years of the century and has supported manufacturers in creating such solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Digital TV Equipment: Vulnerable Consumer Requirements | title = A Report by the Consumer Expert Group to Government and Digital UK | publisher = Consumer Expert Group | place = London | date = March 2006 | contribution-url = http://www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk/pdf_documents/publications/digtv_equipment-march06.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rnib.org.uk/professionals/solutionsforbusiness/tvradiofilm/Pages/digital_radio_research.aspx | title = Are you really listening? | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | author = RNIB | authorlink = RNIB | date = 6 September 2012 | publisher = RNIB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Digital TV Group]], the UK Industry association for Digital TV, first discussed the topic in 2007 and subsequently brought the industry together to write a technical specification for Text to Speech in the horizontal market in 2009. This formed part of the UK Government [[BERR]] Usability Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk/pdf_documents/publications/2010/DTVUsabilityActionPlanJAN10.pdf | title = Usability Action Plan }}&lt;/ref&gt; When complete, this was submitted to Digital Europe for ETSI standardisation and also published as a White Paper. Subsequently this was incorporated in the U-Book - UK Digital TV Usability and Accessibility Guidelines, including Text to Speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dtg.org.uk/publications/books.html | title = UK Digital TV Usability and Accessibility Guidelines, including Text to Speech }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, two talking products for digital television came onto the market in the UK. The Sky Talker is an add-on for the [[BSkyB|Sky]] set top box. It provides talking features for programme and channel information and play back control. The Sky Talker is operated through the standard Sky remote control. In the same year, the Smart Talk [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] ([[DVB-T|terrestrial digital broadcasting]]) set-top box was also launched onto the UK market. This is a [[Goodmans Industries|Goodmans]] branded Freeview set top box, developed by a partnership between [[Harvard International|Harvard International Ltd]] and the [[RNIB]]. It was the first complete talking solution for digital television in the UK, including speaking of the Electronic Programme Guide, menus and providing spoken assistance during setup.

In Japan, both [[Panasonic]] and [[Mitsubishi Electronics|Mitsubishi Electric]] have been producing television and [[Blu-ray]] products since 2010. According to information compiled by the Japanese blindness organisation Lighthouse for the Blind there are some 70-odd products from Mitsubishi and a similar amount from Panasonic with talking features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iccb.jp/%E5%9C%B0%E3%83%87%E3%82%B8/%E9%9F%B3%E5%A3%B0%E8%AA%AD%E3%81%BF%E4%B8%8A%E3%81%92%E6%A9%9F%E8%83%BD%E4%BB%98%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E3%83%87%E3%82%B8%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%80%80%E5%93%81%E7%95%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88/ | script-title=ja:日本ライトハウス情報文化センター － 音声読み上げ機能付き地デジテレビ　品番リスト |trans-title=A list of models with digital TV and text-to-speech support | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | author = NipponLighthouse | language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2011, in Spain a talking, Linux-based, set-top box solution using the free [[Festival Speech Synthesis System|Festival]] text-to-speech engine, was distributed to blind and visually impaired people free of charge by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade. This product is however no longer available.

In 2012, Panasonic launched its Voice Guidance solution on the UK market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.panasonic.co.uk/html/en_GB/News/Latest+News/Panasonic+Launches+Range+of+Talking+TVs/9505034/index.html | title = Panasonic Launches Range of Talking TVs | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | author = Panasonic | authorlink = Panasonic | date = 27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a set of talking features for their 2012 Viera range (and beyond). Voice Guidance announces on-screen information and the most important menus and has support for reminders, recording and playback functions. It is available for [[Freesat]] and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] receivers. In creating its solution, Panasonic took into account advice from RNIB experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/tvradiofilm/television/access/Pages/panasonic_vg.aspx | title = Panasonic television with Voice Guidance | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | author = RNIB | authorlink = RNIB | date = 10 July 2012 | quote = With advice from RNIB experts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, [[TVonics]], a former UK digital video recorder maker, launched its talking PVR solution, a twin-tuner Freeview [[High-definition television|HD]] recorder based on the [[Ivona]] TTS engine which is widely lauded by disability groups for its high quality voice. The TVonics solution was essentially a software addition for its existing platform and can be deployed as a software upgrade to customers of existing products. TVonics went into administration in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/27/administrator_looking_to_sell_off_tvonics_kit/ | title = Administrator eyes DVR firesale after TVonics collapse - Freeview HD recorder firm founders | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | last = Whitfield | first = Nigel | date = 27 June 2012 | publisher = The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RNIB acquired the core [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] [[Intellectual property|IP]] including the text-to-speech system. The TVonics brand was bought by Peterborough-based [[Pulse-Eight]].

==Features of text-to-speech for television&lt;ref name='IEC 62731:2013'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/Artnum_PK/47506 | title = IEC 62731 ed1.0: Text-to-speech for television - General requirements | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | author = International Electrotechnical Commission | authorlink = International_Electrotechnical_Commission | date = 29 Jan 2013 | publisher = International Electrotechnical Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

As a primary purpose of text-to-speech in television products is to render these accessible to blind and partially sighted people, talking features ideally should cover all television operations, from the initial setup, over basic and advanced receiver functions to programming and playback. In practice, there are significant technical challenges, in particular with regard to dynamic information, interactive applications, catch-up and on-demand functions in [[Connected TV's|Connected TVs]] and dialogue handling that mean that none of the current text-to-speech products cover 100% of all features through their talking interface.

The main principle in developing text-to-speech solutions for digital television products should be to create a talking interface that achieves functional equivalence of what a sighted user can do using the default (visual) interface. Specifically, the intention is that a person operating the solution via the text-to-speech system gets the same feedback and can perform the same tasks as someone doing this via the default interface (commonly the screen in combination with a remote control).

===List of possible text-to-speech enabled features===
* Initial set up and configuration (for Connected TVs this could include the [[Home network|network]] configuration, including [[authentication]] to the home network).
* Power cycle control (on, off, standby).
* Announcing the currently showing channel and programme, plus the list of available channels.
* Assistance and feedback for basic receiver functions such as change channel and volume control.
* Speaking the [[Electronic program guide|Electronic Programme Guide]] (EPG) and assisting the user in navigation of the EPG and other lists of services and content, including browsing on-demand and catch-up content and previously recorded or downloaded content as well as user customisable lists (favourites etc.).
* Spoken feedback for reporting and changing the state of access services (in particular [[Audio description|Audio Description]], see [[#Support for Audio Description/Video Description|Support for Audio Description/Video Description]]).
* Talking features in support of playback and recording, including managing the recording schedule.
* Notification of pay-per-view and other restricted content, restrictions and conditions and control over these functions, including the authorisation mechanism.
* Feedback and control for on-screen information banners, dialogues and menus (including [[Modal window|modal]] and other out-of band prompts).
Interaction with interactive services and [[Software widget|widgets]].
* Customisation of the talking features (see [[#Customisation of talking features|Customisation of talking features]]).
* Speaking of on-screen manuals and help pages.

===Customisation of talking features===

Different consumers have different profiles of abilities and preferences. This is also true for blind and partially sighted people using text-to-speech enabled television products. In addition, novice users tend to require more guidance in the early stages of using a product, whereas more advanced users will prefer to be able to navigate the system as efficiently as possible. Consequently, the text-to-speech part of a talking television solution should allow user control and customisation options over its functions:
* Users should be able to set the volume level of the text-to-speech output independently of the main television sound level.
* Users should also be able to adjust properties such as text-to-speech voice type, pitch and output speed.
* Good implementations also allow the verbosity of what is spoken to be adjusted, from very verbose (usually for novice users) to only the bare essentials (useful for advanced users very familiar with the system).

===Support for Audio Description/Video Description===

As blind and partially sighted users are the main target group for text-to-speech in digital television, particular attention should be given to supporting those features of the product that are of most value to this consumer group.

In particular, the ability to control the [[Audio description|Audio Description/Video Description]] related settings of the product is of great importance to these users in those countries where such services are available. Audio Description/Video Description provides an additional narrative describing visual actions or elements that a blind or partially sighted person would not see, but which are important in order to follow the story. Typically, the narration includes characters, scene changes, on screen text and other visual clues not otherwise included in the default sound stream.

Talking features in the product should support in full the menus and other controls relating to Audio Description/Video Description (which also includes advertising the availability of this access service for content when browsing the Electronic Programme Guide and other content inventories).

==Implementation guidance and standardisation==

An early effort to capture the user requirements and define a functional specification was undertaken by the [[Digital TV Group]] (DTG) in the UK, who published a White Paper on the subject. This White Paper has since been subsumed into the publication UK Digital TV Usability and Accessibility Guidelines&lt;ref name='UG024'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dtg.org.uk/publications/books.html | title = Books and White Papers | accessdate = 2013-02-17 | date = September 2011 | format = PDF | work = UK Digital TV Usability and Accessibility Guidelines, including Text to Speech | publisher = Digital TV Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; (known as the U-Book). The same White Paper was also used as the basis for a discussion between disability user groups and [[DigitalEurope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Industry Self-Commitment | title = To Improve The Accessibility of Digital TV Receiving Equipment sold in The European Union | publisher = DigitalEurope | place = Brussels | date = 30 Nov 2007 | contribution-url = http://www.digitaleurope.org/Portals/0/Documents/TRPG/eInclusion/EICTA%20Digital%20%20TV%20accessibility%20self-commitment%2030-11-07%20final%20(3).pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; a European industry body for manufacturers of consumer equipment, on the topic of text-to-speech for television.
The DigitalEurope work stream led to the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) setting up a project group (IEC 62731) to create an International Standard for text-to-speech in digital television. The first edition of the standard, IEC 62731:2013 was published officially as an International Standard in January 2013.&lt;ref name="IEC 62731:2013"/&gt; The Standard does not dictate implementation, but provides a functional description on how a text-to-speech enabled television product should behave and what should be spoken when.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35142">The '''unconscious mind''' (or '''the unconscious''') consists of the processes in the [[mind]] which occur automatically and are not available to introspection, and include thought processes, memories, interests, and motivations.&lt;ref name="Westen1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Westen |first1=Drew |year=1999 |title=The Scientific Status of Unconscious Processes: Is Freud Really Dead? |journal=Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=1061–1106 |doi=10.1177/000306519904700404 |url=http://apa.sagepub.com/content/47/4/1061 |accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though these processes exist well under the surface of [[Conscious mind|conscious]] awareness they are theorized to exert an impact on behavior. The term was coined by the 18th-century German [[Romantic philosophy|Romantic philosopher]] [[Friedrich Schelling]] and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref name=Macmillan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bynum |author2=Browne |author3=Porter |authorlink3=Roy Porter |title=The Macmillan Dictionary of the History of Science |location=London |year=1981 |page=292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;Christopher John Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004: {{ISBN|1-57958-422-5}}), pp. 1001–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical evidence suggests that unconscious phenomena include repressed feelings, automatic skills, subliminal perceptions, thoughts, habits, and automatic reactions,&lt;ref name="Westen1999" /&gt; and possibly also [[Complex (psychology)|complexes]], hidden phobias and desires.

The concept was popularized by the Austrian neurologist and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]. In [[psychoanalytic theory]], unconscious processes are understood to be directly represented in [[dream]]s, as well as in [[Freudian slip|slips of the tongue]] and [[joke]]s.

Thus the unconscious mind can be seen as the source of dreams and automatic thoughts (those that appear without any apparent cause), the repository of forgotten memories (that may still be accessible to consciousness at some later time), and the locus of implicit knowledge (the things that we have learned so well that we do them without thinking).

It has been argued that [[consciousness]] is influenced by other parts of the [[mind]]. These include unconsciousness as a [[habit (psychology)|personal habit]], [[self-awareness|being unaware]], and [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]. Phenomena related to semi-consciousness include [[awake]]ning, [[implicit memory]], [[subliminal message]]s, [[trance]]s, [[hypnagogia]], and [[hypnosis]]. While [[sleep]], [[sleepwalking]], [[dream]]ing, [[delirium]], and [[coma]]s may signal the presence of unconscious processes, these processes are seen as symptoms rather than the unconscious mind itself.

Some critics have doubted the existence of the unconscious.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stannard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt;

==Historical overview==
The term "unconscious" ({{lang-de|Unbewusste}}) was coined by the 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling (in his ''[[System of Transcendental Idealism]]'', [http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Schelling,+Friedrich+Wilhelm+Joseph/System+des+transzendenten+Idealismus/6.+Hauptabschnitt.+Deduktion+eines+allgemeinen+Organs+der+Philosophie,+oder+Haupts%C3%A4tze+der+Philosophie+der+Kunst+nach+Grunds%C3%A4tzen+des+transzendentalen+Idealismus/%C2%A7+3.+Folges%C3%A4tze ch. 6, § 3]) and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge (in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'').&lt;ref name=Macmillan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray /&gt; Some rare earlier instances of the term "unconsciousness" (''{{lang|De|Unbewußtseyn}}'') can be found in the work of the 18th-century German physician and philosopher [[Ernst Platner]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Platner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4748AAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=Unbewu%C3%9Ftseyn ''Philosophische Aphorismen nebst einigen Anleitungen zur philosophischen Geschichte''], Vol. 1 (Leipzig: Schwickertscher Verlag, 1793 [1776]), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angus Nicholls and Martin Liebscher, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Thinking_the_Unconscious.html?id=MCJzE-SxDUgC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Thinking the Unconscious: Nineteenth-Century German Thought''] (2010), Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influences on thinking that originate from outside of an individual's consciousness were reflected in the ancient ideas of temptation, divine inspiration, and the predominant role of the gods in affecting motives and actions. The idea of internalised unconscious processes in the mind was also instigated in antiquity and has been explored across a wide variety of [[cross-cultural communication|cultures]]. Unconscious aspects of mentality were referred to between 2500 and 600 BC in the Hindu texts known as the [[Vedas]], found today in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. N. 1990.

[[Paracelsus]] is credited as the first to make mention of an unconscious aspect of cognition in his work ''Von den Krankheiten'' (translates as "About illnesses", 1567), and his clinical methodology created a cogent system that is regarded by some as the beginning of modern scientific psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, Ernest., ''Origins of Modern Psychiatry'', Thomas 1967 ASIN: B000NR852U, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare]] explored the role of the unconscious&lt;ref&gt;The Design Within: Psychoanalytic Approaches to Shakespeare: Edited by M.

(1970, p. 205). He also cites with approval Foerster's interesting claim that "no one should deal with psychoanalysis before having thoroughly studied Schopenhauer." (1970, p. 542). In general, he views Schopenhauer as the first and most important of the many nineteenth-century philosophers of the unconscious, and concludes that "there cannot be the slightest doubt that Freud's thought echoes theirs." (1970, p. 542). }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Eduard von Hartmann]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;.Friedrich Nietzsche, preface to the second edition of "[[The Gay Science|The Gay science]]" 1886&lt;/ref&gt; used the word unconscious.

==Psychology==

Psychologist Jacques Van Rillaer points out that, "the unconscious was not discovered by Freud. In 1890, when psychoanalysis was still unheard of, [[William James]], in his monumental treatise on psychology (''[[The Principles of Psychology]]''), examined the way [[Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|von Hartmann]], [[Pierre Janet|Janet]], [[Alfred Binet|Binet]] and others had used the term 'unconscious' and 'subconscious'".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Catherine (edited by). ''Le livre noir de la psychanalyse: Vivre, penser et aller mieux sans Freud''. Paris: Les Arènes, 2005, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of psychology Mark Altschule observes that, "It is difficult—or perhaps impossible—to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious cerebration as not only real but of the highest importance."&lt;ref&gt;Altschule, Mark. ''Origins of Concepts in Human Behavior''. New York: Wiley, 1977, p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Rilliaer could have also mentioned that [[Eduard von Hartmann]] published a book dedicated to this topic, ''Philosophy of the Unconscious,'' in 1869 -- long before anybody else.

Furthermore, 19th century German psychologists, [[Gustav Fechner]] and [[Wilhelm Wundt]], had begun to use the term in their experimental psychology, in the context of manifold, jumbled sense data that the mind organizes at an ''unconscious'' level before revealing it as a cogent totality in conscious form."&lt;ref&gt;Wozniak, Robert H. ''Mind and Body: Rene Déscartes to William James''. Washington DC: American Psychological Association, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Freud's view===
[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|right|240px|An iceberg is often (though misleadingly) used to provide a visual representation of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] theory that most of the human mind operates unconsciously.]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] and his followers developed an account of the unconscious mind. It plays an important role in [[psychoanalysis]].

Freud divided the mind into the conscious mind (or the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]) and the unconscious mind. The latter was then further divided into the [[id, ego and superego|id]] (or [[instinct]]s and drive) and the [[superego]] (or [[conscience]]). In this theory, the unconscious refers to the mental processes of which individuals make themselves unaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geraskov, Emil Asenov |title=The internal contradiction and the unconscious sources of activity |journal=Journal of Psychology |date=November 1, 1994 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16528826.html |quote=This article is an attempt to give new meaning to well-known experimental studies, analysis of which may allow us to discover unconscious behavior that has so far remained unnoticed by researchers. Those studies confirm many of the statements by Freud, but they also reveal new aspects of the unconscious psychic. The first global psychological concept of the internal contradiction as an unconscious factor influencing human behavior was developed by Sigmund Freud. In his opinion, this contradiction is expressed in the struggle between the biological instincts and the self. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425190957/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16528826.html |archivedate=April 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud proposed a vertical and [[hierarchical]] architecture of human consciousness: the [[conscious mind]], the [[preconscious]], and the unconscious [[mind]]—each lying beneath the other. He believed that significant psychic events take place "below the surface" in the unconscious mind,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[dream]]ing: Freud called dream symbols the "royal road to the unconscious"&lt;/ref&gt; like hidden messages from the unconscious. He [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] such events as having both symbolic and actual significance.

In psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, but rather what is actively repressed from conscious thought or what a person is averse to knowing consciously. Freud viewed the unconscious as a repository for socially unacceptable ideas, wishes or desires, traumatic memories, and painful emotions put out of mind by the mechanism of [[psychological repression]]. However, the contents did not necessarily have to be solely negative. In the psychoanalytic view, the unconscious is a force that can only be recognized by its effects—it expresses itself in the [[symptom]]. In a sense, this view places the conscious self as an adversary to its unconscious, warring to keep the unconscious hidden. Unconscious thoughts are not directly accessible to ordinary [[introspection]], but are supposed to be capable of being "tapped" and "interpreted" by special methods and techniques such as meditation, [[free association (psychology)|free association]] (a method largely introduced by Freud), dream analysis, and [[speech communication|verbal]] slips (commonly known as a [[Freudian slip]]), examined and conducted during [[psychoanalysis]]. Seeing as these unconscious thoughts are normally cryptic, psychoanalysts are considered experts in interpreting their messages.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Freud based his concept of the unconscious on a variety of observations. For example, he considered "slips of the tongue" to be related to the unconscious in that they often appeared to show a person's true feelings on a subject. For example, "I decided to take a summer curse". This example shows a slip of the word "course" where the speaker accidentally used the word curse which would show that they have negative feelings about having to do this. Freud noticed that also his patient's dreams expressed important feelings they were unaware of. After these observations, he came to the conclusion that psychological disturbances are largely caused by personal conflicts existing at the unconscious level. His psychoanalytic theory acts to explain personality, motivation and mental disorders by focusing on unconscious determinants of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wnr7vEjB7NAC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=After+these+observations,+he+came+to+the+conclusion+that+psychological+disturbances+are+largely+caused+by+personal+conflicts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NO9hC_TkTb&amp;sig=x-vc5BDhhYll9BZjtd-pCfqhmCo&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1zqjUdmeG-Kn4AT-9IC4CQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20these%20observations%2C%20he%20came%20to%20the%20conclusion%20that%20psychological%20disturbances%20are%20largely%20caused%20by%20personal%20conflicts&amp;f=false | title=Psychology: Themes and Variations | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=Wayne Weiten | year=2011 | pages=6 | isbn=9780495813101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud later used his notion of the unconscious in order to explain certain kinds of [[neurosis|neurotic]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jung, Carl|title=Man and His Symbols |date=1964 |quote=Sigmund Freud was the pioneer who first tried to explore empirically the unconscious background of consciousness. He worked on the general assumption that dreams are not a matter of chance but are associated with conscious thoughts and problems. This assumption was not in the least arbitrary. It was based upon the conclusion of eminent neurologists (for instance, Pierre Janet) that neurotic symptoms are related to some conscious experience. They even appear to be split-off areas of the conscious mind, which, at another time and under different conditions, can be conscious.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the unconscious was substantially transformed by later psychiatrists, among them [[Carl Jung]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].

In his 1932/1933 conferences, Freud "proposes to abandon the notion of the unconscious that ambiguous judge".&lt;ref&gt;'Une histoire des sciences humaines'', sous la direction de J.-F. Dortier, éditions Sciences humaines, 2006, {{ISBN|9782912601360}} - part : 1900-1950 "Le temps des fondations" ; chapter about Freud&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung's view===
{{Main|Carl Jung|Collective unconscious}}
Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss [[psychiatrist]], developed the concept further. He agreed with Freud that the unconscious is a determinant of personality, but he proposed that the unconscious be divided into two layers: the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. The personal unconscious is a reservoir of material that was once conscious but has been forgotten or suppressed, much like Freud's notion. The collective unconscious, however, is the deepest level of the psyche, containing the accumulation of inherited psychic structures and [[archetypal]] experiences. Archetypes are not memories but images with universal meanings that are apparent in the culture's use of symbols. The collective unconscious is therefore said to be inherited and contain material of an entire species rather than of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;"collective unconscious (psychology) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia." Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125572/collective-unconscious&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Every person shares the collective unconscious with the entire human species, as Jung puts it: [the] "whole spiritual heritage of mankind's evolution, born anew in the brain structure of every individual".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. (1971). Hero with a thousand faces. New York, NY: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the structure of the unconscious, Jung differed from Freud in that he did not believe that sexuality was at the base of all unconscious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;"Jung, Carl Gustav." The Columbia encyclopedia. 6th. ed. Columbia: Columbia University Press, 2000. 1490. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The notion that the unconscious mind exists at all has been disputed.

[[Franz Brentano]] rejected the concept of the unconscious in his 1874 book ''[[Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint]]'', although his rejection followed largely from his definitions of consciousness and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Vitz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitz, Paul C. |title=Sigmund Freud's Christian Unconscious |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=59-62;107ff |isbn=0-89862-673-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] offers a critique of Freud's theory of the unconscious in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also argues that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed. Philosopher [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]] argues that Sartre's argument is based on a misunderstanding of Freud.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Baldwin |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=792 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] contends that, "The term 'the unconscious' is actually a mystification (even though one might use it for reasons of convenience, as I am guilty of doing in these pages). There is no such thing as ''the'' unconscious; there are only experiences of which we are aware, and others of which we are not aware, that is, ''of which we are unconscious''. If I hate a man because I am afraid of him, and if I am aware of my hate but not of my fear, we may say that my hate is conscious and that my fear is unconscious; still my fear does not lie in that mysterious place: 'the' unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich. ''Beyond the Chains of Illusion: My Encounter with Marx &amp; Freud''. London: Sphere Books, 1980, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Searle]] has offered a critique of the Freudian unconscious. He argues that the Freudian cases of shallow, consciously held mental states would be best characterized as 'repressed consciousness,' while the idea of more deeply unconscious mental states is more problematic. He contends that the very notion of a collection of "thoughts" that exist in a privileged region of the mind such that they are ''in principle never accessible'' to conscious awareness, is incoherent. This is not to imply that there are not "nonconscious" processes that form the basis of much of conscious life. Rather, Searle simply claims that to posit the existence of something that is like a "thought" in every way except for the fact that no one can ever be aware of it (can never, indeed, "think" it) is an incoherent concept. To speak of "something" as a "thought" either implies that it is being thought by a thinker or that it could be thought by a thinker. Processes that are not causally related to the phenomenon called thinking are more appropriately called the nonconscious processes of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John. ''The Rediscovery of the Mind''. MIT Press, 1994, pp. 151-173&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of the Freudian unconscious include [[David Stannard]],&lt;ref name="Stannard"&gt;See "The Problem of Logic", Chapter 3 of ''Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'', published by Oxford University Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]],&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;See "Exploring the Unconscious: Self-Analysis and Oedipus", Chapter 11 of ''Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis'', published by The Orwell Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethan Watters]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;See "A Profession in Crisis", Chapter 1 of ''Therapy's Delusions: The Myth of the Unconscious and the Exploitation of Today's Walking Worried'', published by Scribner, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Ofshe]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and Eric Thomas Weber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weber ET | year = 2012 | title = James's Critiques of the Freudian Unconscious – 25 Years Earlier | url = http://williamjamesstudies.org/9.1/weber.pdf | format = PDF | journal = William James Studies | volume = 9 | issue =  | pages = 94–119 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928003719/http://williamjamesstudies.org/9.1/weber.pdf | archivedate = 2013-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the lack of evidence for many Freudian hypotheses, some scientific researchers proposed the existence of unconscious mechanisms that are very different from the Freudian ones. They speak of a "cognitive unconscious" ([[John Kihlstrom]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kihlstrom, J.F. |chapter=The unconscious |editor=Ramachandran, V.S. |title=Encyclopedia of the Human Brain |publisher=Academic |location=San Diego CA |year=2002 |pages=635–646 |volume=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kihlstrom, J.F. |author2=Beer, J.S. |author3=Klein, S.B. |chapter=Self and identity as memory |editor1=Leary, M.R. |editor2=Tangney, J. |title=Handbook of self and identity |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=68–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an "adaptive unconscious" ([[Timothy Wilson]]),&lt;ref&gt;Wilson T D Strangers to Ourselves Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious&lt;/ref&gt; or a "dumb unconscious" (Loftus &amp; Klinger),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loftus EF, Klinger MR |title=Is the unconscious smart or dumb? |journal=Am Psychol |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=761–5 |date=June 1992 |pmid=1616173 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/47/6/761 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.6.761}}&lt;/ref&gt; which executes automatic processes but lacks the complex mechanisms of repression and symbolic return of the repressed.

In modern cognitive psychology, many researchers have sought to strip the notion of the unconscious from its Freudian heritage, and alternative terms such as "implicit" or "automatic" have come into currency. These traditions emphasize the degree to which cognitive processing happens outside the scope of cognitive awareness, and show that things we are unaware of can nonetheless influence other cognitive processes as well as behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AG, Draine SC, Abrams RL |title=Three cognitive markers of unconscious semantic activation |journal=Science |volume=273 |issue=5282 |pages=1699–702 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8781230 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/273/5282/1699.long |doi=10.1126/science.273.5282.1699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gaillard R, Del Cul A, Naccache L, Vinckier F, Cohen L, Dehaene S |title=Nonconscious semantic processing of emotional words modulates conscious access |journal=Proc.

==Dreams==

===Freud===
In terms of the unconscious, the purpose of dreams, as stated by [[Freud]], is to fulfill repressed wishes through the process of dreaming, since they cannot be fulfilled in real life. For example, if someone were to rob a store and to feel guilty about it, they might dream about a scenario in which their actions were justified and renders them blameless. Freud asserted that the wish-fulfilling aspect of the dream may be disguised due to the difficulty in distinguishing between manifest content and latent content. The [[Manifest Content and Latent Content|manifest content]] consists of the plot of a dream at the surface level. The [[Manifest Content and Latent Content|latent content]] refers to the hidden or disguised meaning of the events in the plot. The latent content of the dream is what supports the idea of wish fulfillment. It represents the intimate information in the dreamer's current issues and childhood conflict.&lt;ref name=Weiten166&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychology: Themes and Variations | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=Wayne Weiten | year=2011 | pages=166–167 | isbn=9780495813101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposing theories===
In response to Freud's theory on dreams, other psychologists have come up with theories to counter his argument. Theorist Rosalind Cartwright proposed that dreams provide people with the opportunity to act out and work through everyday problems and emotional issues in a non-real setting with no consequences. According to her [[cognitive]] problem solving view, a large amount of continuity exists between our waking thought and the thoughts that exist in dreams. Proponents of this view believe that dreams allow participation in creative thinking and alternate ways to handle situations when dealing with personal issues because dreams are not restrained by logic or realism.&lt;ref name=Weiten166/&gt;

In addition to this, [[Allan Hobson]] and colleagues came up with the [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]] which proposes that dreams are simply the side effects of the neural activity in the brain that produces [[beta brain wave]]s during [[REM sleep]] that are associated with wakefulness. According to this hypothesis, neurons fire periodically during sleep in the lower brain levels and thus send random signals to the [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]. The cortex then synthesizes a dream in reaction to these signals in order to try to make sense of why the brain is sending them. However, the hypothesis does not state that dreams are meaningless, it just downplays the role that emotional factors play in determining dreams.&lt;ref name=Weiten166/&gt;

==Contemporary cognitive psychology==

===Research===
While, historically, the psychoanalytic research tradition was the first to focus on the phenomenon of unconscious mental activity, there is an extensive body of conclusive research and knowledge in contemporary [[cognitive psychology]] devoted to the mental activity that is not mediated by conscious awareness.

Most of that (cognitive) research on unconscious processes has been done in the mainstream, academic tradition of the information processing paradigm. As opposed to the psychoanalytic tradition, driven by the relatively speculative (in the sense of being hard to empirically verify) theoretical concepts such as the [[Oedipus complex]] or [[Electra complex]], the cognitive tradition of research on unconscious processes is based on relatively few theoretical assumptions and is very empirically oriented (i.e., it is mostly data driven). Cognitive research has revealed that automatically, and clearly outside of conscious awareness, individuals register and acquire more information than what they can experience through their conscious thoughts. (See Augusto, 2010, for a recent comprehensive survey.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Augusto, L.M. |title=Unconscious knowledge: A survey |journal=Advances in Cognitive Psychology |volume=6 |pages=116–141 |year=2010 |url=http://www.ac-psych.org/?id=2&amp;rok=2010 |doi=10.2478/v10053-008-0081-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconscious processing of information about frequency===
For example, an extensive line of research conducted by Hasher and Zacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasher L, Zacks RT |title=Automatic processing of fundamental information: the case of frequency of occurrence |journal=Am Psychol |volume=39 |issue=12 |pages=1372–88 |date=December 1984 |pmid=6395744 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.39.12.1372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has demonstrated that individuals register information about the frequency of events automatically (i.e., outside of conscious awareness and without engaging conscious information processing resources). Moreover, perceivers do this unintentionally, truly "automatically," regardless of the instructions they receive, and regardless of the information processing goals they have. The ability to unconsciously and relatively accurately tally the frequency of events appears to have little or no relation to the individual's age,&lt;ref name=Connolly&gt;Connolly, Deborah Ann (1993). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/636/ A developmental evaluation of frequency information in lists, scripts, and stories]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt; education, intelligence, or personality, thus it may represent one of the fundamental building blocks of human orientation in the environment and possibly the acquisition of [[procedural knowledge]] and experience, in general.

A '''volvelle''' or '''wheel chart''' is a type of [[slide chart]], a [[paper]] construction with rotating parts. It is considered an early example of a paper [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nick Kanas|title=VOLVELLES!

Early examples of volvelles are found in the pages of [[astronomy]] books. They can be traced back to "certain [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic treatises on humoral medicine]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Origin of Polyalphabetic Substitution|author=David Kahn|author-link=David Kahn (writer)|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=71|issue=1|date=March 1980|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|pages=122–127 [126]|jstor=230316|doi=10.1086/352410 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Persian astronomer]], [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (c. 1000), who made important contributions to the development of the volvelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=State, Science and Economy in Traditional Societies: Some Problems in Weberian Sociology of Science|author=Bryan S.

In the twentieth century, the volvelle had many diverse uses. In ''Reinventing the Wheel'', author [[Jessica Helfand]] introduces twentieth-century volvelles with this:

{{quote|The twentieth century saw a robust growth in the design, manufacture, and production of a new generation of independent, free-standing volvelles. Categorically, they not only represent an unusually eclectic set of uses, but demonstrate, too, a remarkable range of stylistic, compositional, mechanical, informational, and kinetic conceits. There are volvelles that arrange their data peripherally, centrifugally, and radially; volvelles that use multiple concentric circles with pointers; and volvelles that benefit from the generous use of the die-cut, a particular technological hallmark of modern printing manufacture. Twentieth-century volvelles—often referred to as ''wheel charts''—offer everything from inventory control to color calibration, mileage metering to verb conjugation. They anticipate animal breeding cycles and calculate radiation exposure, measure chocolate consumption and quantify bridge tips, chart bird calls, convert metrics, and calculate taxes. There are fortune-telling wheels and semaphore-charting wheels; emergency first-aid wheels and electronic fix-it wheels; playful wheels that test phonetics and prophylactic wheels that prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reinventing the Wheel|author=[[Jessica Helfand]]|publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]]|date=2002|isbn=978-1-56898-596-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lA26DBJI2YkC&amp;dq=helfand+%22reinventing+the+wheel%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] employed a volvelle in the sleeve design for the album ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' (1970).

Two games from the game company [[Infocom]] included volvelles inside their package as "[[feelie]]s": ''[[Sorcerer (video game)|Sorcerer]]'' (1983) and ''[[A Mind Forever Voyaging]]'' (1985). Both volvelles served to impede copying of the games, because they contained information needed to play the game.

'''Warao''' (also known as '''Guarauno''', '''Guarao''', '''Warrau''') is the native language of the [[Warao people]]. A [[language isolate]], it is spoken by about 33,000 people primarily in northern [[Venezuela]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]]. It is notable for its unusual [[object–subject–verb]] [[word order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.jorojokowarao.de/Doku/Warao3.html | title=Warao | publisher=www.jorojokowarao.de | accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Venezuelan  film ''[[Gone with the River]]'' was spoken in Warao.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Venezuelan-Film-in-Indigenous-Warao-Language-an-Oscar-Hopeful-20150911-0052.html |title=Venezuelan Film in Indigenous Warao Language an Oscar Hopeful |work=telesurtv |date=12 September 2015 |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
The language had an estimated 28,100 speakers in [[Venezuela]] as of 2007. The [[Warao people]] live chiefly in the  [[Orinoco Delta]] region of northeastern Venezuela, with smaller communities in southwestern [[Trinidad]] ([[Trinidad and Tobago]]), western [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=WBA "WARAO: a language of Venezuela"], ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World'', 14th Edition, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The language is considered endangered by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1964.html|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
The language's basic [[word order]] has been analyzed as [[object–subject–verb]], a very rare word order among [[nominative–accusative language]]s such as Warao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384185902815 | doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(85)90281-5 | volume=66 | issue=2–3 | title=OSV as the basic order in Warao | year=1985 | journal=Lingua | pages=115–134 | last1 = Romero-Figueroa | first1 = Andrés}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonology ===
Warao phonology is similar to that of [[Japanese phonology|Japanese]]. The Warao consonant inventory is relatively simple:

==Relatives==
Warao appears to be a [[language isolate]], unrelated to any recorded language in the region or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell &amp; Grondona, 2012, ''The Indigenous Languages of South America: A Comprehensive Guide''&lt;/ref&gt; Terrence Kaufman (1994) included it in his hypothetical [[Macro-Paezan]] family, but the necessary supporting work was never done.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle. (1997). ''American Indian languages: The historical linguistics of Native America. New York: Oxford University Press''. {{ISBN|0-19-509427-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Granberry connected many of the grammatical forms, including nominal and verbal [[suffixes]], of Warao to the [[Timucua language]] of North Florida, also a language isolate.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Granberry, ''A Grammar and Dictionary of the Timucua Language'', pp. 15-32&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has also derives Timucua morphemes from Muskogean, Chibchan, Paezan, Arawakan, and other Amazonian languages, suggesting multi-language [[creolization]] as a possible explanation for these similarities. This notion has met with skepticism and described by [[Lyle Campbell]] as "in no way convincing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/AmericanIndianLanguagesTheHistoricalLinguisticsOfNativeAmerica/American%20Indian%20Languages%20The%20Historical%20Linguistics%20of%20Native%20America_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "American Indian Languages The Historical Linguistics Of Native America"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Granberry also finds "Waroid" vocabulary items in [[Goajiro language|Guajiro]] (from toponymic evidence it seems that the Warao or a related people once occupied Goajiro country) and in [[Taino language|Taino]] (''nuçay/nozay'' [nosái] "gold" in Ciboney — cf. Warao ''naséi símo'' "gold" (lit. "yellow pebble") — and ''duho'' "ceremonial stool" in Classic Taino — cf. Warao ''duhu'' "sit, stool"). Granberry &amp; Vescelius (2004) note that toponymic evidence suggests that the pre-Taino [[Macorix language]] of Hispaniola and [[Guanahatabey language]] of Cuba may have been Waroid languages as well.
