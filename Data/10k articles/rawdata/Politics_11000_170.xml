==NO MORE Celebrity PSA Campaign - Male Survivors==

In 2016, 1in6 partnered with [[Viacom]], NO MORE, and The Joyful Heart Foundation (founded by [[Mariska Hargitay]]) to produce [[public service announcement]]s featuring celebrities and highlighting the prevalence of sexual trauma among males. On March 2, 2016, the broadcast PSAs debuted on Viacom’s networks and in Times Square, during which the PSAs were visible to approximately 21 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/maile-zambuto/its-not-just-a-womens-iss_b_9404818.html|title=It's Not 'Just a Women's Issue.'

Akbayan is noted to be a leading member of the [[Socialism|Democratic Left]] community in the Philippines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com:8080/headlines/790428/llamas-hits-reds-tag-democratic-left|title=Llamas hits Reds' tag on 'democratic left'|work=philstar.com|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Centre-left"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCrTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;|title=Southeast Asia In The New International Era|author1=|author2=|date=2016|accessdate=April 19, 2017|newspaper=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which consists of moderate leftist groups who are not affiliated with the more extremist [[Communist Party of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Centre-left" /&gt;

==History==
{{Socialism sidebar|Organizations}}
The party was founded by Joel Rocamora in the 1990's, after leaving the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) over ideological differences with its founder and leader, [[Jose Maria Sison]]. The CPP leader maintained [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism|Marxist-Leninist-Maoist]] principles, which some members, dubbed "rejectionists" as opposed to CPP's "reaffirmists", disagreed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2012/10/30/861559/clash-between-akbayan-and-anakbayan|title=????????????????????????????????????????  Clash between Akbayan and Anakbayan {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akbayan has been critical of abuses committed by some members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) against fellow activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article5241|title=Akbayan feels Esperon praise a left-handed compliment|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been critical of the Communist Party of the Philippines – [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]] – [[New People's Army]]'s (CPP-NDF-NPA) actions in the countryside especially against peasant groups and communities against the Maoist group's extortion activities. Due to its stance against right-wing extremism (from some elements of the AFP) and from the [[Communism in the Philippines|Extreme Left]]) (CPP-NPA-NDF), Akbayan has been a target by both political groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2007/03/03/18371891.php?show_comments=1|title=Akbayan chides Bayan Muna &amp; affiliates for falling into the AFP's 'divide &amp; rule' strategy : Indybay|work=Indybay|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Akbayan was among the opposition groups which was severely repressed by the government. It was also during this time that because of government intimidation that Akbayan suffered its lowest number of votes in 2007 with just well over 400,000 votes.

[[File:Akbayan_protesting_gma_bail.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Akbayan members protesting granting of bail for former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo for plunder charges]]

In 2009, Akbayan supported the presidential candidacy of then Senator Benigno Simeon Aquino III. Fueled by the popular discontent with the outgoing administration of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Aquino won the presidency by a huge margin. This was also the first time that Akbayan was able to breach the 1 million vote mark, its best performance so far. The votes it garnered was 200,000 votes more than the last time it secured three seats in the House of Representatives. However, it failed to secure three seats owing to a Supreme Court decision which ensured that only the leading partylist (Ako Bicol at that time) in the election would secure three seats.

[[File:Akbayan_anti-china_rally.jpg|300px|thumb|Akbayan mobilization in front of Chinese Consular Office protesting the Chinese's incursions into the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone]]
Akbayan has been noted to oppose the increased incursions of the People's Republic of China (PRC) naval and coast guard vessels into Philippine territorial waters and within the country's 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2011/06/09/18681480.php|title=Philippine Party says China violated its seas : Indybay|work=Indybay|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/79117/are-filipinos-united-against-chinas-invasion-of-ayungin|title=Are Filipinos united against China’s invasion of Ayungin?|author=Rodel Rodis|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, they allied themselves to [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|LP]] and [[Magdalo Group]], supporting Mar Roxas and Leni Robredo's campaign, criticizing other candidates. After the elections, they joined the Magnificent 7, a group of hardcore Liberal Party members and Magdalo members Gary Alejano. They became critical of several issues, like the [[Philippine Drug War]] and [[Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act|TRAIN Law]].

The '''Association of Academies of the Spanish Language''' ({{lang-es|Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española}}, ASALE) is an entity whose end is to work for the unity, integrity, and growth of the [[Spanish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/sites/default/files/Estatutos_ASALE_2007.pdf|title=Estatutos y reglamento de la Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|last=|first=|date=2007|website=ASALE|trans-title=Statutes and regulation of the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063651/http://www.asale.org/sites/default/files/Estatutos_ASALE_2007.pdf|archive-date=18 September 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in [[Mexico]] in 1951 and represents the union of all the separate academies in the Spanish-speaking world. The association publishes reference works on the Spanish language and commemorative editions of Hispanic literature, among other publications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/obras-y-proyectos|title=Obras y proyectos|last=|first=|date=|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171103030927/http://www.asale.org/obras-y-proyectos|archive-date=2017-11-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=Nov 3, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/publicaciones|title=Publicaciones|last=|first=|date=|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171103031646/http://www.asale.org/publicaciones|archive-date=2017-11-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=Nov 3, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Through the initiative of then-president of Mexico [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]], the first congress of academies convened with the purpose of maintaining the integrity of and fostering the further growth of Spanish.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/actividad-institucional/i-congreso-mexico-1951|title=I Congreso (México, 1951)|last=|first=|date=|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171101071759/http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/actividad-institucional/i-congreso-mexico-1951|archive-date=1 November 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was held from 23 April to 6 May 1951 and resulted in the creation of the association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/politica-panhispanica/siglo-xx|title=Siglo XX|last=|first=|date=|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171101072747/http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/politica-panhispanica/siglo-xx|archive-date=1 November 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its permanent commission&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/politica-linguistica-panhispanica/hechos-relevantes|title=Historia|last=|first=|date=|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171101073040/http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/politica-linguistica-panhispanica/hechos-relevantes|archive-date=1 November 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Royal Spanish Academy]] (Spanish: {{lang|es|Real Academia Española}} or {{Lang|es|RAE}}) was not present at the initial meeting but participated in the permanent commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/politica-linguistica-panhispanica/hechos-relevantes|title=Historia|last=|first=|date=|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171101073040/http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/politica-linguistica-panhispanica/hechos-relevantes|archive-date=1 November 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the second congress convened in 1956, the {{Lang|es|RAE}} has been a regular participant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2000 the association organised the School of Hispanic Lexicography and the Carolina Foundation to promote Spanish lexicography{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, and  together with the {{Lang|es|RAE}}, the association earned the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/politica-panhispanica/siglo-xx|title=Siglo XX|last=|first=|date=|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171101072747/http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/politica-panhispanica/siglo-xx|archive-date=1 November 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The collaboration between {{Lang|es|RAE}} and the other academies was expressed in the coauthorship, since the 22nd edition published in 2001, of the Dictionary of the Spanish Language (Spanish: {{lang|es|Diccionario de la Lengua Española}}), and the 1999 edition of the Orthography (Spanish:  {{lang|es|Ortografía}}) was considered a true pan-Hispanic work. Joint projects include the editing of the Grammar (Spanish: {{lang|es|Gramática}}) and the compilation of the Dictionary of Americanisms (Spanish: {{lang|es|Diccionario de americanismos}}).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Organisation==
The association convenes every four years, led by a permanent commission composed of a president ([[Darío Villanueva]] as of October 2017), secretary general ([[Francisco Javier Pérez]] as of October 2017), treasurer, and at least two board members drawn from the associated academies, whose nomination rotate annually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/presentacion/estatutos-y-organizacion|title=Estatutos y organización|last=|first=|date=|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140408043926/http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/presentacion/estatutos-y-organizacion|archive-date=8 April 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/bienvenida/bienvenida-del-presidente|title=Bienvenida del presidente|last=Villanueva|first=Darío|date=30 November 2015|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171102053739/http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/bienvenida/bienvenida-del-presidente|archive-date=2 November 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=2 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/bienvenida/saludo-del-secretario-general|title=Saludo del secretario general|last=Pérez|first=Francisco|date=28 January 2016|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171102054318/http://www.asale.org/la-asociacion/bienvenida/saludo-del-secretario-general|archive-date=2 November 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Third Congress of Academies, held in [[Bogotá, Colombia]], in 1960, an agreement was reached whereby the governments of countries with a member in the association would be obliged to provide financial support to their respective academies and the greater association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/sites/default/files/Convenio_Bogota.pdf|title=Convenio multilateral Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|last=|first=|date=1960|website=Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613235711/http://www.asale.org/sites/default/files/Convenio_Bogota.pdf|archive-date=13 June 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ben Emmerson''', [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (born 10 August 1963)&lt;ref name=telegraph120512&gt;{{cite news|title=Top QC says human rights laws need "serious change"|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9261150/Top-QC-says-human-rights-laws-need-serious-change.html|author=Peter Stanford|date=2012-05-12|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a British lawyer, specialising in [[European Convention on Human Rights|European human rights law]], [[public international law]] and [[international criminal law]]. He was a founder member of [[Matrix Chambers]] and has 25 years’ experience litigating before international courts and tribunals including the [[International Court of Justice]], the [[European Court of Human Rights]], the [[European Court of Justice]], the [[International Criminal Court]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]]. He helped draft the [[Human Rights Act 1998|1998 Human Rights Act]] introduced by [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref name=DailyNews01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2163762/QC-defended-hate-preacher-Abu-Qatada-favourite-Britains-new-judge-Human-Rights-Court.html |title=QC who defended hate preacher Abu Qatada is favourite to be Britain's new judge in Human Rights Court |date=5 August 2017 |accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UK he is a deputy High Court Judge, a Master of the Bench of Middle Temple and an Honorary Fellow of [[Mansfield College, Oxford]].

In 2014 he was appointed Counsel for the [[Independent Panel Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse]] in England and Wales, but was suspended from duty and then resigned in September 2016. In December 2016, Mr. Emmerson was cleared of wrong-doing and IICSA has formally launched a separate, independent examination of the way Emmerson’s resignation was handled. It may now ask why Emmerson was not asked about the now discredited allegation at the time so that he could respond.  The human rights campaigner [[Helena Kennedy]], who has worked with Emmerson, welcomed the independent inquiry’s finding that dismissed the allegations of sexual misconduct. "I have known Ben for many, many years," Lady Kennedy said. "He's a feminist. He lives as he speaks. He had discussed this matter with me. He's not someone who takes liberties with people. I shared his shock when a public allegation was made. I'm satisfied that it was ill-founded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandra Lavelle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/14/ben-emmerson-cleared-of-misconduct-in-child-abuse-inquiry |title=Former child abuse inquiry counsel cleared of wrongdoing |work=The Guardian |date=2016-12-14 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Kent]], his father Brian Emmerson was finance director of the [[Stock Exchange in London]]. He attended [[Douai School]] and [[Bristol University]],&lt;ref name=telegraph120512/&gt; and was [[called to the bar]] in 1986. Until 1999 Emmerson was a member of [[Doughty Street Chambers]],&lt;ref name=lawyer99&gt;{{cite web|author=19 April 1999 |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/the-top-five-criminal-talents/88256.article |title=The top five criminal talents |work=[[The Lawyer]] |date=1999-04-19 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in February 2000 he left to join the new [[Matrix Chambers]] which specialises in human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doughty Street Chambers - Legal Diary|publisher=The Times|date=2000-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2000 he was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]].&lt;ref name=times0400&gt;{{cite news|title=A record 82 people joined the elite ranks ...|publisher=The Times|date=2000-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==
{{Rights}}
===Gay rights===
In the late 1990s, Emmerson represented the [[Bolton 7]], a group of men who had engaged in consensual [[group sex]] but were prosecuted for [[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]] and [[buggery]] under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]]. At the time, it was illegal for men to have sex with each other if more than two men were present, since it was deemed to be a public act; however, group sex was legal for heterosexuals and lesbians. Emmerson argued that the prosecution violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and that, although it had not been incorporated into English law at the time, the judge was obliged to consider it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathy Marks |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/gay-group-sex-ban-to-be-challenged-in-euro-court-1269082.html |title=Gay group sex ban to be challenged in Euro court |work=The Independent |date=1997-04-25 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathy Marks |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/men-in-gay-sex-parties-case-escape-sentences-1145900.html |title=Men in gay sex parties case escape sentences |publisher=The Independent |date=1998-02-21 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 he successfully represented at the ECHR two of four [[Sexual orientation and military service#United Kingdom|homosexual members]] of the [[British Armed Forces]] who had been dismissed for their sexual orientation. The UK government was ordered to pay compensation and decided to put on hold all other investigations into homosexuals that it was conducting. ''The Guardian'' called it an "historic decision",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Norton-Taylor and Clare Dyer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/28/claredyer.richardnortontaylor |title=Historic ruling ends services gay ban |publisher=The Guardian |date=1999-09-28 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[David Pannick]] QC called it "a welcome victory for reason over pure prejudice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why we must not penalise parts of a private personality|author=David Pannick QC|date=1999-10-19|publisher=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of speech===
In 2012, Emmerson represented a man at appeal after he was convicted of sending "a message of a menacing character" under the [[Communications Act 2003]], for [[Twitter Joke Trial|posting a joke on Twitter]] which was interpreted as a threat to blow up an airport. Emmerson argued that the response had been disproportionate, that common sense was required "to avoid the law ending up looking silly" and that the man lacked the ''[[mens rea]]'' (intent) to be menacing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Aston, Jan Colley |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/airport-tweet-made-law-look-silly-6661705.html |title=Airport tweet 'made law look silly' |publisher=The Independent |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Courts===
Emmerson is currently the British judge on the Residual Mechanism of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Terri Judd |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ben-emmerson-qc-the-bte-noire-of-the-right-wing-press-with-a-leviathan-intellect-8061507.html |title=Ben Emmerson QC: The bête noire of the right wing press with a 'leviathan intellect' |publisher=The Independent |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
He has previously acted as Special Adviser to the Prosecutor at the [[International Criminal Court]] and Special Adviser to the international judges of the UN backed [[Khmer Rouge Tribunal]] in Cambodia.
  
In June 2011 he was elected by the [[UN Human Rights Council]] as [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on Counter Terrorism and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-emmerson |title=Ben Emmerson |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity he reports annually to the [[UN General Assembly]], the UN Human Rights Council and relevant entities established by the [[Security Council]]. He also conducts country visits and reports, and provides technical and other advice to states.

===Israeli Killer Robots===
In May 2013 Emmerson was involved in a special investigation for the [[UN General Assembly]] on drone warfare and [[targeted killing]]s.&lt;ref name=timesofisrael&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-killer-robots-could-be-banned-under-un-proposal |title=Israeli killer robots could be banned under UN proposal |date=12 August 2017 |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmerson' report, Israel, as well as US, have developed various types of fully or semi-autonomous weapons. In the report they are called “lethal autonomous robotics” or LARs for short.&lt;ref name=wired.com&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/un-drone-inquiry/|title=U.N. DRONE INVESTIGATOR: IF FACTS LEAD TO U.S. WAR CRIMES, SO BE IT |date=12 August 2017 |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states: “Decisions over life and death in armed conflict may require compassion and intuition. Humans — while they are fallible — at least might possess these qualities, whereas robots definitely do not.”&lt;ref name=timesofisrael/&gt; In his report, Emmerson notes the arguments of robot proponents that death-dealing autonomous weapons “will not be susceptible to some of the human shortcomings that may undermine the protection of life and typically they would not act out of revenge, panic, anger, spite, prejudice or fear."&lt;ref name=una.org.uk&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.una.org.uk/news/un-special-rapporteur-ben-emmerson-qc-killer-robots |title=UN Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson QC on killer robots |date=12 August 2017 |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he report also states that robots could cause intentional suffering on civilian populations, for example through torture.”&lt;ref name=una.org.uk02&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.una.org.uk/campaign-stop-killer-robots?page=1 |title=Over the past decade, the expanded use of unmanned armed vehicles has dramatically changed warfare, bringing with it new humanitarian and legal challenges. Now, rapid advances in technology are resulting in efforts to provide greater combat autonomy to machines. |date=12 August 2017 |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse===
In 2014, Emmerson was appointed Counsel for the [[Independent Panel Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse]] in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://childsexualabuseinquiry.independent.gov.uk/the-panel/  Independent Panel Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse: The Panel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626210949/https://childsexualabuseinquiry.independent.gov.uk/the-panel/ |date=2015-06-26 }}. Retrieved 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 September 2016, he was suspended from duty. The inquiry said it had "become very concerned about aspects" of his leadership of his team.&lt;ref name=bbc290916&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37500878  BBC News, "Child abuse inquiry counsel Ben Emmerson QC suspended", 29 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Emmerson resigned from the position, saying that "it is now time for someone else to take the helm" and denying that his resignation was due to differences of opinion with the Inquiry's chair, [[Alexis Jay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37514864|title=Ben Emmerson QC resigns as lawyer for child abuse inquiry|publisher=BBC News|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that he was forced to resign over an allegation of sexual assault was made against him, but an enquiry by a senior judge ruled that the allegation was unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legalcheek.com/2017/10/matrix-chambers-under-fire-for-its-handling-of-sex-assault-allegation-against-top-qc/|title=Matrix Chambers under fire for its handling of sex assault allegation against top QC|author=Katie King|publisher=Legal Cheek|date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
{{Seealso|Disposition Matrix}}
Emmerson, special investigator for the United Nations Human Rights Council, stated that U.S. [[drone strike]]s may have violated [[international humanitarian law]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/18/drone-strikes-us-violate-law-un Drone strikes by US may violate international law, says UN ]. ''The Guardian.'' 18 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/un-report-independent-investigations-drone-attacks UN report calls for independent investigations of drone attacks]. ''The Guardian.'' 18 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2017 Emmerson visited [[Sri Lanka]], a country that was being criticised by the [[United Nations]] for slow progress in addressing war crimes and past human rights abuses. Emmerson commented that the international community was running out of patience.&lt;ref name=guard09&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/14/torture-by-sri-lankan-police-routine-says-human-rights-lawyer |title=Torture by Sri Lankan police routine, says human rights lawyer |publisher=The Guardian |date=7 August 2017 |accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
Emmerson has accused [[Saudi Arabia]] of [[Human rights in Saudi Arabia|human rights violations]] including detaining and torturing free speech activists. Emmerson was denied access to [[Raif Badawi]] and other Saudi citizens he claimed had been "imprisoned for the exercise of the right to freedom of speech and opinion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/un-scrutinizes-saudi-arabias-anti-terror-laws/a-38706330 UN scrutinizes Saudi Arabia's anti-terror laws]. [[Deutsche Welle]]. 4 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was formerly the editor of the ''European Human Rights Law Review'' and is co-author, with Professor [[Andrew Ashworth]] QC of the leading text on the application of the Convention in criminal cases. Since 1995 he has been human rights editor of ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', the criminal practitioner's bible.

==Recognition==
In 1999, ''[[The Lawyer]]'' listed Emmerson as one of the top five criminal barristers in the UK. He was described as "a goliath in the area of human rights law" and "knowing the law, not just silver-tongued"&lt;ref name=lawyer99/&gt; The same year he was a winner at the [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] Human Rights awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geoffrey Bindman and Ben Emmerson - Legal Diary|publisher=The Times|date=1999-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, ''The Observer'' described Emmerson as one of the "most dynamic group of lawyers working in Britain today".

The '''Caledonian Union''' ({{Lang-fr|Union calédonienne}}, UC) is a [[Secession|pro-independence]] [[political party]] in [[New Caledonia]]. In the latest [[Elections in New Caledonia|legislative elections]] of May 10, 2009, the party won around 11.65% of the popular vote, and 9 out of 54 seats in the [[Territorial Congress of New Caledonia|Territorial Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;In the legislative elections of May 9, 2004, the party won 11.9 % of the popular vote, and 7 out of 54 seats in the Territorial Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Caledonian Union was born as a cross-community (multi-ethnic) autonomist{{elucidate|date=September 2012}} party led by [[Maurice Lenormand]], who was the island's sole representative in the [[National Assembly (France)|French National Assembly]]. There he sat with the [[Popular Republican Movement]], or MRP, and other [[Christian democratic]] parties in France.

The party's first significant success was on February 8, 1953 with the election of 15 members of the Caledonian Union to the 25 seats General Council.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bergès, Maurice Lenormand, Roch Pidjot, Matéo Aripoindi, Raphaël Bouanaoué, Kowi Bouillant, André Caron, Doui Matayo Wetta, Luther Enoka, Louis Eschembrenner, James Haeweng, Michel Kauma, Georges Newland, Elia Thidjine, Marc Tivollier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congres.nc/sites/default/files/pdf/296_1940_1957.pdf Members of "Conseil General" from 1940 to 1957] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022085034/http://www.congres.nc/sites/default/files/pdf/296_1940_1957.pdf |date=2014-10-22 }}, The Congress of New Caledonia (in French), 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the UC opposed to the arrival of [[Gaullist]] centralism in France, which undid most of the autonomist reforms of the [[French Fourth Republic]] (the [[Loi Cadre|Defferre laws]]). The UC grew more and more radical, and started flirting with independence, which eventually led to an outflow of [[Caldoches]] into new loyalist parties, such as the [[Rally for Caledonia in the Republic]]. Combined with corruption scandals, this weakened the party considerably.

In 1977 in [[Bourail]], the UC adopted a nationalist platform, supported by [[Jean-Marie Tjibaou]] (and the rare European nationalists, such as Maurice Lenormand and Pierre Declercq). In 1979, the UC joined with the [[Party of Kanak Liberation]] (FLNKS) and other parties to form the Nationalist Front, which became the [[Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front]] (FLNKS) in 1984.

The UC was the largest faction in the FLNKS, led by Tjibaou. It was largely moderate, as opposed to the more radical Palika. Tjibaou was killed in 1989 by an extremist [[Kanak people|Kanak]] nationalist. In 2001, Roch Wamytan, the moderate leader of the UC, lost an election to Pascal Naouna, a radical. The UC has since broken with Palika within the FLNKS, which has no unitary president and is very divided. [[Charles Pidjot]], Roch Pidjot's nephew, replaced Naouna in 2007. He died in 2012 and was then replaced himself by [[Daniel Goa]]

In the [[New Caledonian legislative election, 2009|2009 provincial elections]], the party won 9 seats in the [[Congress of New Caledonia]] and around 11.65% of the vote. However, in the [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]], the UC ran on a common slate with Palika and won one of the four seats won by that list.

The UC controls the provincial presidency of the [[Loyalty Islands]].

==Ideology==
The UC favour the concept of [[Associated state|independence-association]] similar to the [[Marshall Islands]]. However, the UC has taken a radical stance in favour of strict adherence to the terms of the [[Nouméa Accord]], no talks with the loyalists. For example, the UC boycotted the visit of [[Jacques Chirac]] to the island in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33329">{{for|the conservative Irish political party|Catholic Democrats (Ireland)}}

'''Catholic Democrats''' is an American not-for-profit organization of [[Catholics]], based in [[Boston]], United States. The Catholic Democrats have more than 20,000 members in all 50 American states and [[Puerto Rico]]. It claims no authorization from the Catholic Church, or any Catholic Bishop, Catholic diocese, candidate or candidate committee.&lt;ref name="catholicdemocrats.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicdemocrats.org/about/|title=Catholic Democrats: About|website=www.catholicdemocrats.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was founded in response to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], which, in the view of the group, had witnessed unprecedented attempts to bend [[Catholic Social Teaching]] to accommodate policies which are in conflict with the teaching and values of the Church. It characterizes its membership as people who share an aversion to the kind of abuses of [[U.S. armed forces|U.S. military power]] that led to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]], along with "the exploitation of social issues to advance the economic interests of a few, and the misuse of our Catholic faith for political gain."&lt;ref name="catholicdemocrats.org"/&gt;

The group was angered as well by what it perceived as manipulation of Church teaching to the advantage of conservative and [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] interests: "conservatives have increasingly used Catholic language and Catholic congregations to advance their economic agenda and political interests." particularly its insistence on “a consistent moral framework anchored in the scriptures and expressed in the teachings of the Church.” The group specifies the bishops' call&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrlc.com/1-pfd-files/BulletinInsert.pdf |title=The Challenge of Faithful Citizenship |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819161254/http://www.ncrlc.com/1-pfd-files/BulletinInsert.pdf|archivedate=2006-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a new commitment to advancing public policies that work in the interest of the common good.

Catholic Democrats support Pope Francis's stances on the central issues within Catholic social teaching ("war, poverty, [[unintended pregnancy]], preventable illness, the death penalty, instability of the family, and supporting the dialogue balancing medical advances and the dignity of the individual") which it feels that the Republican Party neglects in favor of others, notably [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]] and [[homosexuality]]. The group's website features the week's [[gospel]] readings, news stories and commentary, [[papal encyclical]]s and resources for adoption.

==Involvement with 2008 presidential election==
During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], the organization launched the Catholics for Obama Web site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicsforobama.org|title= Catholics for Obama Web site|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included a petition of endorsement for Catholics to sign in support of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee [[Barack Obama]]'s candidacy, the Catholic questions and answers on abortion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicdemocrats.org/cfo/abortion.php|title=Catholics for Obama: Catholic Questions and Answers on Abortion|website=www.catholicdemocrats.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a welcome by Catholic actor [[Martin Sheen]].  Additionally, the Web site included links to the book, written by Catholic Democrats President Patrick Whelan with a preface by [[Victoria Reggie Kennedy]], entitled ''The Catholic Case for Obama.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicdemocrats.org/cfo/the_catholic_case_for_obama.php|title=Catholics for Obama: The Catholic Case for Obama|website=www.catholicdemocrats.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group helped articulate a new approach to the abortion problem, also championed by the Obama Campaign, that focused on reduction strategies and emphasized finding common ground solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-op.catholics16nov16,0,1894003.story&lt;/ref&gt;

==President Obama and Catholics in America==
In 2009 the group applauded efforts by the [[Obama Administration]] to reach out to Catholics, particularly in a major policy address President Obama made at [[Georgetown University]] on April 14, 2009, and in his commencement address on May 17, 2009 at the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-oped0515promay15,0,6794007.story |title=Countdown to Sunday: Notre Dame made right decision to invite Obama|work= [[Chicago Tribune]]|date= May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic Democrats later launched a national Letter of Support for President Obama, Notre Dame, and Catholic higher education that was signed by thousands of Catholics across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicdemocrats.org/notredameobamapetition.php|title=Catholic Democrats: Petition to support Notre Dame Welcoming Obama|website=www.catholicdemocrats.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group also launched the website, Catholics for Notre Dame,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsfornotredame.org/|title=Catholics For Notre Dame|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520072233/http://www.catholicsfornotredame.org/|archivedate=2009-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which housed the statement of support, a video called Catholic in America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsfornotredame.org/video|title="Catholic in America"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521221241/http://catholicsfornotredame.org/video|archivedate=2009-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a tool for individuals to send letters to the editor. They helped organize a reunion for the Catholic priests and community organizers who hired President Obama to work in a Catholic church rectory on the South Side of Chicago in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1577125,CST-NWS-priests16.article|title=Priests come to Obama's defense, Chicago Sun-Times, May 15, 2009|publisher=|access-date=2009-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520164506/http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1577125,CST-NWS-priests16.article#|archive-date=2009-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also worked with local Democratic officials in [[South Bend, Indiana]] the weekend of the Notre Dame Commencement to organize a welcome rally for President Obama and a food drive, in the spirit of national service struck at the Inauguration.

In the summer of 2009, Catholic Democrats launched the website, "Pope Greets Hope"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popeandpresident.org/|title=Pope and President|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903050543/http://www.popeandpresident.org/|archivedate=2009-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate President Obama's first meeting with [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on July 11, 2009. Dr. Patrick Whelan, president of Catholic Democrats, blogged from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] during the meeting, which followed the release of the papal encyclical ''[[Caritas in Veritate]]'' and the [[35th G8 summit]] in [[L'Aquila]], Italy, earlier in the week.
In August 2009, the organization paid tribute to the late U.S. Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] (D-Mass.), who had been a great inspiration to the founders of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-08-30/news/0908280094_1_letter-to-pope-catholic-conservatives-senator-kennedy |title=Guided By His Faith|work= [[Baltimore Sun]]|first1= Patrick |last1=Whelan |first2= Kathleen |last2=Kennedy Townsend|date= August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group has more recently paid tribute to [[Sargent Shriver]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-01-23/news/bs-ed-shriver-20110123_1_peace-corps-volunteers-dervish-george-mcgovern|title=Sargent Shriver: Living the faith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of the [[Peace Corps]], and Fr. Thomas Kaminski,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/news/people/chicago-priest-hired-barack-obama-organizer-dies-70|title=Chicago priest, hired Barack Obama as organizer, dies at 70|date=28 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Chicago priest who was president of the community development organization that hired Barack Obama in 1985.

In September 2009, the leadership of Catholic Democrats met with the [[White House]] [[Domestic Policy Council]] in an effort to find creative and constructive solutions to decreasing the number of [[abortion]]s in the United States.

==Catholic Democrats and health care reform==
In 2010, Catholic Democrats president Dr. Patrick Whelan published a study&lt;ref&gt;http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/362/13/e45&lt;/ref&gt; that appeared in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' and asserted that the number of abortions in Massachusetts decreased after the 2006 passage of [[universal health care]] there.  Additionally, national director Steve Krueger wrote a policy paper on health care and abortion.  Catholic Democrats also sent a letter to all Catholic members of the [[U.S. Congress]] asking them to give up divisive partisan rhetoric for [[Lent]] and to pass health care reform by [[Easter]].  Additionally, the organization asked Catholics to sign a petition that called on Congress to pass health care reform.

==Further embracing the cause of poverty and the disparity of wealth in America==
For the 2010 midterm elections, Catholic Democrats issued A Catholic Pledge to America,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acatholicpledgetoamerica.org/pledge.html&lt;/ref&gt; which called on Catholic voters to support candidates whose policies reflect Catholic social justice.  Additionally, the organization issued a voter's guide&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acatholicpledgetoamerica.org/voters_guide.html&lt;/ref&gt; that contrasted the accomplishments of the Democratic Congress with the Republican [[Pledge to America]].  National director Steve Krueger and board member [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend]] appeared on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/october-29-2010/democrats-and-faith-voters-2010/7385/|title=October 29, 2010 ~ Democrats and Faith Voters - October 29, 2010 - Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly - PBS|date=29 October 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, Mr. Krueger became president of Catholic Democrats.

In the fall of 2011 as the presidential primaries approached, Catholic Democrats sent a letter&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicdemocrats.org/BishopsandPoverty.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to then-Archbishop [[Timothy Dolan]], president of the [[USCCB]], detailing the theological flaws in arguments by House Budget Committee Chairman [[Paul Ryan]] (R-WI) in favor of a federal austerity budget that proposed drastic cuts in healthcare, food stamps, and other services for the poor. The organization asked the U.S. bishops to vigorously address the challenges of increased poverty, unemployment and income inequality, and to reaffirm the principles that the U.S. bishops unambiguously laid out in the 1980s and again in the 1990s in their pastoral letter, [[Economic Justice for All]]. Archbishop Dolan replied&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicdemocrats.org/Dolanletter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a letter to the leaders of Catholic Democrats, “One of the reasons defense of religious liberty is such a high priority is because this is necessary to protect our efforts in the promotion of charity, justice, peace, service, and advocacy. Likewise, I worry when any attempt to dialogue with Republicans is interpreted as turning one’s back on the poor. Nevertheless, I very much welcome your comments and have taken them seriously.”

In part because all the Republican presidential candidates opposed the administration's job creation and anti-poverty proposals, and chose to attack expanded healthcare access, Catholic Democrats became deeply involved in the 2012 presidential election. According to Archbishop [[Charles Chaput]] of Philadelphia, responding to a question from Dr. Whelan at a public forum at [[Assumption College]] in Worcester, the US bishops did not have time at their upcoming November 2011 meeting to discuss the plight of the poor and the state of the national economy. But the bishops did spend the majority of that meeting planning and launching a campaign against the Obama Administration centered on the idea that the government was responsible for an attack on religious liberty.

That campaign focused on gay marriage, and later on whether employees of Catholic hospitals and universities should have insurance coverage for contraception. In a February 2012 interview on C-SPAN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?304397-5/-kathleen-kennedy-townsend-contraception-proposal|title=Kathleen Kennedy Townsend Contraception Proposal, Feb 13 2012|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic Democrats Board member [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend]] strongly supported the administration’s efforts to provide wider access to contraceptives, with their potential for decreasing the number of abortions. But in an opinion piece the same week in the Philadelphia Inquirer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-02-12/news/31052361_1_human-services-social-service-public-funding|title=Archives - Philly.com|website=articles.philly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Chaput said that the administration was motivated by “a seemingly deep distrust of the formative role religious faith has on personal and social conduct, and a deep distaste for religion's moral influence on public affairs.” The Inquirer subsequently interviewed Catholic Democrats’ president Steve Krueger, and reported this exchange of views with Archbishop Chaput:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-09-10/news/33714727_1_catholic-colleges-clergy-office-moral-authority|title=Archives - Philly.com|website=articles.philly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
“While there's nothing wrong with a Catholic bishop being a Republican or a Democrat,” Krueger said, “there's something eerily unsettling when the archbishop's political affiliation and the teaching authority he rightfully claims conflate, so that he becomes more of a partisan political figure than a shepherd." Told of Krueger's criticism, Chaput became visibly annoyed and leaned forward in his chair. "Can a group that calls itself 'Catholic Democrats' talk about politicizing things? That's absolutely ridiculous." Asked if he had a preferred candidate in the presidential elections, Chaput allowed a small smile and shook his head. "I don't talk about candidates," he said. "I just talk about the issues.”

Catholic Democrats took to the air on Public Radio, syndicated Spanish-language radio, and the mainstream print media to support the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] decision to provide broader access to contraception. Columnist [[Bill Press]], citing Catholic Democrats’ concerns about the bishops’ neglect for poverty-related issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/18077185/article-Bill-Press--Catholic-bishops-silent-on-issues-affecting-poor?instance=special%20_coverage_right_column# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728212345/http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/18077185/article-Bill-Press--Catholic-bishops-silent-on-issues-affecting-poor?instance=special%20_coverage_right_column# |archive-date=2014-07-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in April 2012, “When I was growing up a Catholic, the nuns had a phrase for those who obeyed some tenets of the Church but not others: ‘Cafeteria Catholics.’ Today, the biggest ‘Cafeteria Catholics’ are Catholic bishops.”

Catholic Democrats opposed the use of churches to support the Republican presidential ticket. In a study of the matter, Catholic Democrats estimated that the commercial communications value of the USCCB's unprecedented "religious liberty" campaign in 2012 was likely to fall between $60 million and $100 million, based on the estimated percentage of partisan homilies heard by the 26 million Catholics attending mass each week. “If the USCCB were a Super PAC, the value of its campaign would likely top the list of independent expenditure organizations,” said Mr. Krueger in the Huffington Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-a-krueger/cardinal-dolan-should-keep-his-distance-from-tampa-and-charlotte_b_1836758.html|title=Cardinal Dolan Should Keep His Distance From Tampa and Charlotte|first=Steven A.|last=Krueger|date=28 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, Catholic Democrats opposed efforts to politicize Catholic parishes by reaching out directly to all the parishes in Governor Romney’s home state of Massachusetts and in the battleground state of Virginia, outlining for pastors the USCCB’s own guidelines forbidding electioneering by political parties in Catholic parishes.

Gov. Romney chose U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a Catholic, as his running mate in August 2012.

Ryan met Vice President [[Joseph Biden]] in a historic televised debate between two Catholic vice presidential candidates, Catholic Democrats hosted debate watch parties across the country preceded by a roundtable conference call discussion featuring Sr. [[Simone Campbell]] of Network, Dean Cafardi, and Dr. Whelan from Catholic Democrats. The focus of that discussion was rising poverty and the differences between the two campaigns on strategies to accelerate the recovery of the U.S. economy.

==“America Undecided: Catholic, Independent and Social Justice Perspectives on Election 2012"==
In the fall of 2012, Dr. Whelan joined forces with two former [[University of Notre Dame]] law professors and law school deans, [[Douglas Kmiec]] and Ed Gaffney, to write the book “America Undecided: Catholic, Independent and Social Justice Perspectives on Election 2012.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicdemocrats.org/cfo/au.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Prof Gaffney is a religious liberty scholar and Prof Kmiec a nationally-known constitutional law expert.  They argued that there was no merit to the idea that the Obama administration was opposed to religious liberty or hostile to Catholicism. The book begins by chronicling the Catholic influence on the early life of President [[Barack Obama]], who attended Catholic school in Jakarta Indonesia as a child. His mother, [[Ann Dunham]], worked collaboratively for 20 years with a Dutch Jesuit in a Catholic vocational school in Jakarta, trying to advance the economic prospects of a population emerging there from colonialism. Dr. Whelan interviewed a group of Catholic priests who had hired Mr. Obama in 1985 to work in Chicago Catholic parishes as a community organizer.

The book goes on to explore the details of the [[USCCB]]’s turnabout on the expansion of health insurance availability, and ultimately their opposition to the historic 2010 [[Affordable Care Act]]. It discusses the role of nuns such as Sr. [[Simone Campbell]] of Network and Sr. [[Carol Keehan]] of the [[Catholic Health Association of the United States]] in ultimately helping pass the legislation, and the subsequent efforts by the Church to censure the nuns. Finally, it explores the details of the Church’s opposition to the contraception mandate, and their mislabeling of some contraceptives as “abortifacients.” They debunk the idea that the government’s efforts to provide contraception coverage to all women, including those who work for Catholic hospitals and universities, constitutes an attack on religious freedom or a violation of the Constitution’s separation of church and state.

A subsequent opinion piece in October 2012 by Dr. Whelan and Catholic Democrats Board member [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend]] explored Governor Romney’s opposition to providing healthcare coverage for all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/bs-ed-security-20121028,0,5556763.story|title=Health security is national security|first=Patrick Whelan and Kathleen Kennedy|last=Townsend|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama and Vice-President Biden prevailed over Gov Romney and Rep Ryan, 51-47%, in the general popular vote. Catholics were as likely as the general population to vote for President Obama, with exit polling showing 51% supporting the Democrats and 48% for the Republican ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/11/07/how-the-faithful-voted-2012-preliminary-exit-poll-analysis/|title=How the Faithful Voted: 2012 Preliminary Analysis|date=7 November 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic majority for Obama was heavily dependent on Latino Catholics, who supported Obama 76-23%. Romney won among non-Hispanic white Catholics 56 to 43%. This contrasted with non-Hispanic white Protestants who favored Romney 69-29%. By comparison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2008/11/05/how-the-faithful-voted/|title=How the Faithful Voted|date=5 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama won the 2008 election with 53% of the general vote, compared with 46% for Senator John McCain. Catholics voted for Obama 54 to 45%, with non-Hispanic white Catholics favoring McCain 52 to 47% and Latino Catholic favoring Obama 72 – 26%. Exit polls have shown a progressive drop in non-Hispanic white Catholics over each of the last four elections as a percentage of those who voted, though the overall percentage of Catholics among voters has held constant at 27%.

==Catholics and racial justice==
In August 2013, Catholic Democrats teamed up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paxchristiusa.org/2013/08/29/press-release-catholics-call-for-national-conversation-on-racial-justice/|title=PRESS RELEASE: Catholics call for national conversation on racial justice|first=|last=paxchristiusa|date=29 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with leaders from the US Bishops’ Office of African American Affairs, the [[Catholic Campaign for Human Development]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington]], and other Catholic organizations to host an event in conjunction with the 50th commemoration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicnewsherald.com/schools/46-news/rokstories-usworld/3992-march-on-washington-anniversary-draws-crowds-to-make-dream-reality?showall=1&amp;limitstart=|title=Catholic News Herald - Catholic News Herald|website=catholicnewsherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] and Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr]]’s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech. An opening mass of celebration featured the Gospel Choir of Holy Redeemer Parish in Washington DC, with a homily by Fr. David Bava surveying the history of Catholic efforts related to slavery and civil rights.  A wide-ranging discussion entitled, “A Catholic Conversation on Race, Religion and the March on Washington” was moderated by Ralph McCloud, the director of the [[USCCB]]'s [[Catholic Campaign for Human Development]]. The discussants included [[United States Secretary of Labor]] [[Thomas Perez]], National [[Pax Christi]] USA President Sr. Patricia Chappell, John Carr (Director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought &amp; Public Life at [[Georgetown University]]), and USCCB Assistant Director for African American Affairs Donna Toliver Grimes.  The event filled Holy Redeemer Church, and was well-received as the only public celebration of the role of Catholics in the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/remembering-march-washington-and-mlk%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98dream%E2%80%99|title=Remembering the March on Washington and M.L.K.’s ‘Dream’|date=10 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic Democrats President Krueger, who conceived the event, was quoted in the [[National Catholic Reporter]], saying it "was intended to be a bridge between Catholic involvement in the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the unfinished business of the 1963 march today based on the Catholic social justice tradition. It is a 'next first step' on a journey that we hope may serve as an impetus for a national conversation on racial justice in parishes, dioceses and faith-based communities across our land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/news/peace-justice/panel-catholics-must-make-better-connections-between-militarism-racism-poverty|title=Panel: Catholics must make better connections between militarism, racism, poverty|date=28 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic Political Involvement==
In 2014, Catholic Democrats conducted a Get Out the Vote (GOTV) campaign asking Catholic voters to consider the moral messages of Pope Francis, and his focus on poverty, as they were preparing to vote in the 2014 midterm elections.  The organization produced radio advertisements featuring James Roosevelt, Jr., the grandson of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, and Martin Sheen.  The radio ads were played on Pandora Internet radio in the states of Kentucky and New Hampshire.  The radio ads were a part of Catholic Democrats' 2014 "Be Connected" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicdemocrats.org/beconnected2014/|title=2014 Midterm Voting Pledge &amp; Radio Ads - Pope Francis - Catholic Democrats|website=Be Connected 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pandora rated these advertisements as among the highest rated political ads for 2014 in terms of listener engagement.

Catholic Democrats hosted a national conference call on the eve of Pope Francis's visit to the United States in September 2015, featuring Sr. Mary Johnson, SND, PhD, Distinguished Prof. of Sociology and Religious Studies at Trinity Washington University, and Fr. Tom Reese SJ, of the National Catholic Reporter.  The group launched a prayer petition for the pope,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honorthepope.org|title=Welcome &amp; Pray for Pope Francis - Catholic Social Justice Tradition|website=Honor the Pope is a project of Catholic Democrats.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President Steve Krueger represented the organization at the White House reception for Pope Francis.

In 2016 Catholic Democrats supported the candidacy of Secretary [[Hillary Clinton]] for President.  Although she appears to have won the overall Catholic vote, according to a research center at [[Georgetown University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2017/04/06/new-data-suggest-clinton-not-trump-won-catholic-vote|title=New data suggest Clinton, not Trump, won Catholic vote|date=6 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; she ended up losing the non-Hispanic white Catholic vote—which may have played a pivotal role in the loss of traditional Democratic Midwestern states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania that have large and older Catholic populations.  Catholics tend to vote in higher numbers than the general population, which may have contributed to an outsized effect of the white Catholic preference for [[Donald J. Trump]].  Professor Thomas Groome of [[Boston College]] published an opinion piece in ''[[The New York Times]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/opinion/to-win-again-democrats-must-stop-being-the-abortion-party.html|title=To Win Again, Democrats Must Stop Being the Abortion Party|first=Thomas|last=Groome|date=27 March 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the Democrats need to reach out to people of faith on the abortion issue by championing their successful efforts to decrease abortions dramatically through the eight years of the 
Obama presidency.  His essay inspired more than 2500 comments, and the Times published a Q&amp;A with responses by Professor Groome and Steven Krueger, president of Catholic Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/opinion/qa-how-democrats-can-stop-being-perceived-as-the-abortion-party.html|title=Q&amp;A: How Democrats Can Stop Being Perceived as the Abortion Party|first1=Thomas|last1=Groome|first2=Steven A.|last2=Krueger|date=11 April 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Catholic Democrats has long championed greater access to health care as a right advocated by Pope Francis and the Catholic [[Social Justice]] tradition, the group mobilized its members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102051919009&amp;ca=35b9c008-7021-4e84-9c01-104590b12f9e|title=ACTION ALERT: Ryan-Trump Health Care Act vote is TODAY! Call Congress NOW and protect the vulnerable|website=campaign.r20.constantcontact.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to Republican efforts to overturn the [[Affordable Care Act]].  The [[American Health Care Act]] (the Ryan-Trump health care bill) was withdrawn from consideration in the House of Representatives on March 24, 2017, preserving health insurance for 24 million people who otherwise would have lost it, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Responding to the child abuse allegations made against Alabama Senate candidate [[Roy Moore]], Catholic Democrats undertook an advertising campaign appealing to Catholics in Alabama to respond forcefully to the lessons learned from the Catholic clergy abuse crisis, and to support Moore's opponent.  On December 12, 2017, former US Attorney [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] won an upset victory over Moore in the special election to fill the seat vacated by US Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]].  This narrowed the Republican Senate majority to a 51-49 margin, effective January 2018, at a time when the Senate is considering tax legislation that would dramatically worsen the disparity of wealth in the United States.

The first conflicts between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Government of Argentina|Argentine government]] can be traced to the ideas of the [[May Revolution]] of 1810. The [[Holy Office|Tribunal of the Inquisition]] was suppressed in the territories of the United Provinces of the River Plate on 1813-03-23, and on 4 June the General Assembly declared the state "independent from any ecclesiastical authorities existing outside its territory".

The framers of the [[Constitution of Argentina|1853 Constitution]], who were in many cases influenced by [[Freemasonry]], found a middle way between an officially Catholic country and a [[secularism|secular]] society, by allowing [[religious freedom]] while keeping economic support for the Church, and employing the [[patronage]] system, by which the [[President of Argentina|President]] selected triplets of [[bishop]] candidates that the [[Pope]] could approve.

This system was abolished in 1966, during the [[dictatorship|dictatorial rule]] of [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], and replaced by a [[Concordat]] which gave the [[Holy See|Vatican]] the attribution of appointing and removing bishops, leaving the President only with the right to object the appointments. In the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|1994 constitutional reform]] the Concordat was awarded the rank of international [[treaty]] and thus given priority over national laws, although [[Argentine National Congress|Congress]] is still allowed to reformulate it. The same reform eliminated the constitutional requirement for the President to be a Roman Catholic.

The protocol of the Argentine government has always been influenced by the Catholic Church. Bishops often have a place along ministers, governors and other officials in patriotic ceremonies. On the celebration of the [[May Revolution]], the president along with his or her spouse and ministers is expected to attend the ''[[Te Deum]]'' celebrated by the [[Archbishop]] of [[Buenos Aires]].

==Early times==
[[Image:BuenosAiresCathedral1.JPG|thumb|260px|[[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral of Buenos Aires]], Argentina.]]
During the first twenty years after the May Revolution, the new state did not establish official diplomatic relations with the Vatican. The Papacy did not wish to create a conflict with the Spanish Crown by showing support for the South American revolution; in 1825, [[Pope Leo XII]] denounced it. During the government of [[Martín Rodríguez (politician)|Martín Rodríguez]] (1820–1824), there was a (failed) project to transfer the clergy to state control and abolish [[tithe|tithing]] in favour of state financial backing for the Church.

[[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] destroyed the possibility of re-establishing relations when, in 1837, he dictated that no civil or ecclesiastic authority in [[Buenos Aires Province]] must acknowledge or obey pontifical documents dated after 1810-05-25 without an authorization granted by the foreign relations department.

After Rosas's fall, [[Justo José de Urquiza]] proposed the Holy See to create a [[diocese]] of the [[littoral]] provinces, to avoid the intervention of the bishopric of Buenos Aires, but the Vatican did not accept the Concordat proposed in 1857.

==1880s==
Possibly the first major conflict between the Argentine State and the Church arose in 1884, when President [[Julio Argentino Roca]] supported [[Argentine Law 1420|Law 1420]], dictating compulsory universal [[secular education]], and the law of civil [[marriage]]. The opposition of the Church led to the expulsion of the [[Nuncio]], the removal of dissident bishops, and a breakup of [[diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with the Vatican, which were re-established during Roca's second term.

The civil marriage law was approved in 1889 under the presidency of [[Miguel Juárez Celman]]. The Archbishop of Buenos Aires, [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/baneiros.htm Federico Aneiros], sent a document to the priests instructing them to explain church attendants that civil marriage was simply [[concubinage]] (in its modern sense, [[cohabitation]]). The Vatican sent instructions to resist the law; the Capitular Vicar of Córdoba told people to ignore the law, and several priests who had administered the sacrament to couples married under the civil law were punished.

==Conservative period==
In October 1934 the [[International Eucharistic Congress]] was held in Buenos Aires. The Papal Legate was the then-Secretary of the Vatican, Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (who would become [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1939). After the Congress, Argentina was granted a cardinal and three new archbishops, which showed the local and Vatican concern about the advancement of [[Nazism|National Socialism]]. With this sensitive topic in hand, the Church pressured the government on the issue of re-establishing the possibility of religious teaching in public schools. The conservative [[Agustín Pedro Justo]] administration lent ears to these requests.

==Peronism==
The government of [[Juan Perón]] (1946–1955) was one of changing relationships between the Church and the State. At first, the new Peronist movement was linked to the Armed Forces. The Army and the Church considered themselves barriers against the ideologies of [[Socialism]] and [[Communism]]. The Church also supported a doctrine of "social justice" that shared with Peronism the idea of a State that mediates in [[social class|class]] conflicts and evens out social inequalities.

However, some factions of the Church objected Perón's "[[statism]]", that is, the intervention of the national government in private society, sometimes invading the sphere of influence of the Church, as in the case of [[welfare state|welfare]] plans and [[public education]], the latter being the most contentious issue. By a law dictated in 1943 during the previous dictatorial government, public schools were forced to provide religious education classes. In 1946, the [[Argentine Senate]] approved a legal re-affirmation of all the decrees passed by the military junta. This law was debated in the less docile [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], and was finally passed thanks to the vote of the Peronists, who submitted to the will of the Executive Branch. The arguments presented were nationalistic and anti-liberal, identifying Argentine nationality with the deep Catholicism of the motherland, Spain, and also emphasizing religion as a means to create a personal conscience and an ordered society.

The religious education law, however, limited the powers of the Church: teachers, curricular contents and textbooks were designated by the State, after consultations with the Church if need be. Besides this, the rest of the school subjects were independent of religious influence, and therefore followed the secular tradition of Argentine education. The Peronist government also introduced subjects such as sports, hygiene and sanitary care, which the Church deemed excessively concerned with bodily matters. Finally, education became a vehicle for quasi-religious propaganda for the [[personality cult]] of the president and his wife [[Eva Perón|Eva]]. In June 1950 Perón appointed Armando Méndez San Martín, an anti-Catholic (accused by the Church of being a Freemason), as Minister of Education.

"Democratic" Catholics were opposed to a full integration of religion and State, but rather preferred a separation between State and Church that granted all schools (public and private, including confessional ones) to receive state funding. These Catholics were in the minority and had no representation before Peronism.

During his second term, Perón resented the Vatican's aspiration to promote the formation of Catholic-based political parties (i. e. Christian Democracy parties). In 1954, out of political rather than ideological reasons, the government suppressed religious education in schools and attempted to legalize [[prostitution]], to pass a divorce law and to promote a constitutional amendment to separate State and Church. Perón publicly accused bishops and priests of sabotaging his government.

On 1955-06-14, during the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] [[procession]], the bishops [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/btato.html Manuel Tato] and Ramón Novoa spoke against Perón, turning the celebration into an anti-government [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]. Perón demanded the removal of the bishops to the Vatican. During the night, violent Peronist groups attacked and burned churches in Buenos Aires.

Anti-Peronists in the military, who were mostly Catholic, and factions of the Church, had been long encouraged by this building tension. On June 16, two days after Corpus Christi, airplanes of the [[Argentine Navy|Navy]] fleet, with the motto ''Cristo vence'' ("Christ wins") painted on them, bombed [[Plaza de Mayo]], killing hundreds of civilians, in the first move towards the [[coup d'état]] which would ultimately depose Perón, the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]''.

==Concordat==
On October 16, 1966, the Argentine Chancellor [[Nicanor Costa Méndez]] signed an agreement with the Vatican, represented by the Nuncio Humberto Mozzoni. By this [[Concordat]], which replaced the old [[Patronage]] system, the Argentine Church would have the right to create or modify [[diocese]]s in the national territory, to directly appoint archbishops and bishops, and to keep correspondence freely with the bishops, the clergy and the Argentine Catholics in general. The Concordat was ratified in the Holy See on January 28, 1967.

==1976-1983==
See [[Dirty War#Alleged participation of members of the Catholic Church]]
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}

==Since the return of democracy (1983)==
President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] (1983–1989) had a rough relationship with the Catholic Church. Before 1987, the [[Civil Code of Argentina|Civil Code]] recognized ''de facto'' separation of husband and wife, but did not allow remarriage. A law of divorce was approved by the Chamber of Deputies in 1986. The Catholic Church pressured the Senate to stop it, threatening to deny the sacraments to those who would vote for it. The Senate finally passed the law on 1987-06-03. During this year the relationship with the Church was also damaged by the call to a new Pedagogical Congress that led the Church to fear a cut on the state subsidies to private schools, and by legislation reforms that equalled legitimate and "natural" (illegitimate) children, which the Church considered to affect the concept of a Christian family.

President [[Carlos Menem]] (1989–1999) was linked to conservative Vatican organizations (such as the [[Opus Dei]]) and was a staunch supporter of the Church's position on [[abortion]], for which he was awarded a special decoration by [[Pope John Paul II]], even while he was heavily criticized by prominent bishops because of the poverty and unemployment caused by [[Economy of Argentina|his economic measures]].

President [[Fernando de la Rúa]] (1999–2001) was also a devout Catholic, and did not have major problems dealing with the Church.

==Kirchner administration==
[[Image:Cristina Fernández de Kirchner recibe al arzobispo Jorge Bergoglio 2007.jpg|thumb|260px|President [[Cristina Kirchner]] receives Cardinal [[Jorge Bergoglio]], now [[Pope Francis]], at the [[Casa Rosada]].]]
President [[Néstor Kirchner]] (elected in 2003), while professing belief in the Catholic faith, has often had a troubled relationship with the hierarchy of the Church. Kirchner belongs to the center-left wing of Peronism and has placed emphasis on certain progressive views that do not go well with the Catholic Church.

===Conflicts on sexual and reproductive rights===
{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}
The Argentine national government passed laws and began a program to the effect of providing assistance on [[sex education]] to all citizens, including the provision of free [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s and [[condom]]s. The Church opposes artificial contraception and has placed conditions on its acceptance of sex education in schools.

At the beginning of 2005, the minister of Health, [[Ginés González García]], made public his support for the legalization of abortion, and Kirchner's silence on the matter angered the Church. The military vicar [[Antonio Baseotto]] expressed his disgust by paraphrasing [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 9:42 (''"And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea"'') and suggesting that González García should be given that treatment. Baseotto was heavily criticized because this "punishment" echoes the infamous ''vuelos de la muerte'' ("flights of death") whereby [[desaparecidos|prisoners]] of the last military regime were thrown into the Atlantic from planes. The conflict escalated and caused the Argentine government to relieve Baseotto from his job as the head of the [[military chaplain]]s. This prompted accusations on the part of Catholic observers (also fueled by right-wing opposition leaders and media) that such actions threatened religious freedom. The government pointed out that Baseotto is still a bishop and may celebrate Mass and perform pastoral duties wherever he chooses — he will simply not be on the payroll of the state.

President Kirchner was also criticized for not attending the funeral of [[Pope John Paul II]] (he did attend the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), which took place when the above conflict was still in the spotlight of the media. On the celebration of the [[May Revolution]] on 2005-05-25, Kirchner chose not to attend the Buenos Aires ''Te Deum'' but the one celebrated in the Cathedral of [[Santiago del Estero]], where other public celebrations of the day were also moved. This absence of the President did not go unnoticed (it was the first such occasion in 175 years), but the government denied a political intention behind it, except the need to "federalize" the celebration.

In October 2005 conflict erupted again as the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] took steps to pass a Sex Education Law that would encompass the whole school system (public and private, including confessional schools), forcing educational establishments to teach students about gender roles and contraception, among other topics. The Archbishop of [[La Plata]], [[Héctor Aguer]], accused the state of "promoting sexual corruption" and "inciting fornication, lust and promiscuity", denouncing that 11- and 12-year-old students in a school already implementing a sex education curriculum had received condoms and contraceptive pills. Upon being termed a "fanatic" by the former Minister González García, Aguer replied that the Minister was "intolerant and a fundamentalist" with regards to his views. The Permanent Secretariat for the Family, an organ of the Argentine Episcopal Conference, passed a declaration asking the representatives of the people not to approve sex education law projects "already rejected by the Argentinians". Soon afterwards, on 6 November, the Archbishop of [[Resistencia, Chaco|Resistencia]], [[Carmelo Giaquinta]], entered the conflict by warning that the state would "lose its reason for existence" if it promoted such laws in the fields of health and education, and announced that he would "encourage Christians to [[civil disobedience]]" in that case.

In 2010 Argentina became the third Catholic country to legalize [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|same-sex marriage]] despite heavy criticism and protests that turned violent between supporters of the traditional Church and advocates of homosexual rights.

===2005 Episcopal Conference document===
On November 12, 2005 the Argentine bishops presided by [[Jorge Bergoglio]], gathered in the 90th Assembly of the [[Argentine Episcopal Conference]], held in [[Pilar, Buenos Aires]], closed the meetings with an official document about pastoral matters that includes, as usual, a critical appraisal of socio-political issues. The document claimed that Argentina suffers "a worrying form of in-solidarity, [which is] the scandalous growth of the [[economic inequality|inequality]] of income distribution". On the following day, the Argentine Head of Cabinet, Alberto Fernández, replied that this "does not correspond with reality" and that the Church had "ignored much data provided by current statistics" which showed a decrease in poverty since the beginning of the Kirchner administration in 2003 ''(see [[Economy of Argentina]])''. The bishops' document also included a controversial admonition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Twenty-two years after the restoration of democracy, it is convenient for us elders to ask ourselves whether we are conveying the young the whole truth about what happened in the 1970s, or if we are offering them a biased portrayal of the facts, which could raise new feuds among Argentinians... [Thus it would be] if we set aside the seriousness of State terror, the means employed and the ensuing crimes against humanity... but the opposite could also happen, that the crimes of the guerilla were silenced or that they may not be duly abhorred.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Fernández called this "an unfortunate revisiting of the [[doctrine of the two demons]]" (purportedly claiming an equal moral ground for guerilla and State terrorism), since "there is nobody in Argentina who exalts the guerilla as the document says". Senator Miguel Ángel Pichetto ([[Justicialist Party|PJ]]) seconded the statement by Fernández, calling the above "a [[coup d'état|coup]]-calling (''golpista'') document that seems to have been written in the 1970s, at the time when some factions [of society] went knocking on [the doors of] military quarters".

President Kirchner himself replied on November 16, commenting that the statements of the Church "look more like those of a political party, more like earthly affairs, than like the task they should be performing", and that the bishops were "absolutely wrong in their diagnosis of the situation of the country". On the issue of the 1970s, Kirchner called attention on the many bishops "who weren't there while children were [[desaparecidos|disappearing]]" and who "gave [the sacrament of] [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to [[torture]]rs" of the [[Dirty War]]. Members of the opposition later qualified Kirchner as "over-generalizing", "unjust" and "intolerant".

=== 2008 Salta Law on Education ===
In December 2008 the legislature of [[Salta Province]] passed a controversial law making the teaching of religion compulsory in both state and private schools. The move sparked outrage among religious [[minority group|minorities]] and [[human rights]] organizations, which called for a [[secular]] educational system.

Governor [[Juan Manuel Urtubey]], the proponent of the law, quickly pointed out that religious lessons would be oriented to all creeds, and that all students would take part, "regardless of their beliefs".

However, doubts remain about the legality of the measure, since it conflicts with the Provincial Constitution itself, which Urtubey helped write, when he was elected conventional constituent in 1998. Article 11º enshrines the secrecy of the citizen's faith, since it clearly states that ''No one must be asked what their religious beliefs are.''  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eft.com.ar/legislac/argentina/salta/salta-constitucion.htm Provincial Constitution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410050612/http://www.eft.com.ar/legislac/argentina/salta/salta-constitucion.htm |date=April 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 28º Section ñ also makes a statement, when it describes the objectives of the law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''to provide religious instruction, which is part of the curriculum, and is to be taught during school time, taking into account parents' and/or tutors' beliefs, who will decide whether their children will attend such classes. ''Contents (to be taught) and teachers' qualifications will require approval by church authorities.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The first version of the ''Communities Directory'' appeared in issue #1 of [[Communities magazine|''Communities'']] magazine&lt;ref name=CommunitiesMagazine&gt;{{cite journal |author=Communities (magazine) |authorlink=Communities (magazine) |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Roth |journal=Communities |publisher=[[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] |location=Rutledge, MO |issn=0199-9346 |oclc=3130385 |url=http://communities.ic.org/ |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |quote=Since 1972, Communities has been the primary resource for information, issues, and ideas about intentional communities in North America – from urban co-ops to cohousing groups to ecovillages to rural communes.

In all, ten versions were published in the magazine over the next 18 years. The [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]]&lt;ref name=FIC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.org/ |title=Intentional Communities – ecovillages, communes, cohousing, coops |author=FIC Web Weavers |authorlink=Fellowship for Intentional Community  |publisher=Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC) |location=Rutledge, Missouri, USA |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |quote=Intentional Community is an inclusive term for ecovillages, cohousing communities, residential land trusts, communes, student co-ops, urban housing cooperatives, intentional living, alternative communities, cooperative living, and other projects where people strive together with a common vision. }}&lt;/ref&gt; became publisher of the magazine in 1989, and in 1990 released the first self-contained book-format edition of the directory (also distributed to magazine subscribers, counted as double issue #77/78). 

The ''Communities Directory'' is now in its 6th edition. Editions were published in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2007. The production cycle has been shortened due to the online collection of data. The 4th edition lists 600 communities in North America and another 130 worldwide. The 5th edition lists almost 1250 communities worldwide.

There is also a companion video ''Visions of Utopia: Experiments in Sustainable Culture'' that outlines the history of intentional shared living and profiles a diverse cross-section of contemporary groups (external link included below).

The Online ''Communities Directory'' database is shared by members of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041130221719/http://directory.ic.org/icdc.php Intentional Community Data Collective] which includes the [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] and [http://directory.cohousing.org Coho/US's Cohousing Directory].

The '''Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India''' is an authority, established by Article 148 of the [[Constitution of India]], which [[audit]]s all [[receipts]] and [[cost|expenditure]] of the [[Government of India]] and the [[states and territories of India|state governments]], including those of bodies and authorities substantially financed by the government. The CAG is also the [[external auditor]] of [[Government-owned corporations]] and conducts supplementary audit of government companies, i.e., any non-banking/ non-insurance company in which Union Government has an equity share of at least 51 per cent or subsidiary companies of existing government companies. The reports of the CAG are taken into consideration by the [[Public Accounts Committee (India)|Public Accounts Committee]]s (PACs) and Committees on Public Undertakings (COPUs), which are special committees in the [[Parliament of India]] and the state legislatures. The CAG is also the head of the Indian Audit and Accounts Department, the affairs of which are managed by officers of [[Indian Audit and Accounts Service]], and has over 58,000 employees across the country.

The CAG is mentioned in the Constitution of India under Article 149 – 151.

=== Suggested reforms ===
In June 2012, [[Lal Krishna Advani]] a veteran Indian politician and former [[Deputy Prime Minister of India]] (as well as former [[Leader of the Opposition (India)|Leader of the Opposition]] in [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members Bioprofile|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Members/Biography.aspx?mpsno=9|publisher=Lok Sabha of India/National Informatics Centre, New Delhi|accessdate=27 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429080434/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Members/Biography.aspx?mpsno=9|archivedate=29 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that CAG's appointment should be made by a [[bipartisan]] [[collegium]] consisting of the prime minister, the [[Chief Justice of India]], the [[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Law Minister]] and the Leaders of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.&lt;ref name="Karunanidhi backs Advani's view on collegium to appoint CAG, EC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Karunanidhi backs Advani's view on collegium to appoint CAG, EC|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-05/india/32055097_1_karunanidhi-backs-collegium-l-k-advani|accessdate=5 October 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunanidhi backs Advani's plea for collegium"&gt;{{cite news|title=Karunanidhi backs Advani's plea for collegium|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3493632.ece|accessdate=5 October 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=5 June 2012|location=Chennai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[M Karunanidhi]], the head of [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) party and five times [[Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmk.in/ |title=DMK's Official Homepage-Chennai-Tamilnadu-India 800x600 screen resolution |publisher=Dmk.in |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported the suggestion.

CPI MP [[Gurudas Dasgupta]] wrote a letter to the PM and demand CAG has appointed by the collegium of consisting the PM, the CJI and the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha but the PM declined.

PMO minister [[V. Narayanasamy|V.Narayanasamy]] in his interview with [[Press Trust of India|PTI]] said Government is considering the Shunglu panel report but PM and Finance Minister declined it.

== Compensation ==
The salary and other conditions of service of the CAG are determined by the [[Parliament of India]] through "The Comptroller and Auditor-General's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971". His salary is same as that of judge of the Supreme court of India. Neither his salary nor rights in respect of leave of absence, pension or age of retirement can be varied to his disadvantage ''after'' his appointment. The CAG is not eligible for further office either under the [[Government of India]] or under the Government of any State after he has ceased to hold his office. These provisions are in order to ensure the ''independence'' of CAG.&lt;ref name="CAG - Article 148 of Constitution of India"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/about_us/mandate/Constitutional/Constitutional.html | title=CAG – Article 148 of Constitution of India | accessdate=6 April 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228082859/http://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/about_us/mandate/Constitutional/Constitutional.html | archivedate=28 December 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter V - Constitution of India"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Chapter V - Constitution of India|encyclopedia=|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V#Chapter_V_.7BComptroller_and_Auditor-General_of_India.7D|accessdate=6 April 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Removal ==
The CAG can be removed only on an address from both houses of parliament on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. The CAG vacates the office on attaining the age of 65 years even without completing the 6 years term by impeachment also.

== Indian Audit and Accounts Service ==
{{Main|Indian Audit and Accounts Service}}
The [[Constitution of India]] [Article 148] provides for an independent office to the CAG of India. He or she is the head of Indian Audit and Accounts Department. He/she has a duty to uphold the Constitution of India and laws of the Parliament to safeguard the interests of the public exchequer. The Indian Audit and Accounts Service aids the CAG in the discharge of his/her functions.

== Scope of audits ==
{{Quote box
 |quote = "CAG is not a munimji or an accountant or something like that... He is a constitutional authority who can examine the revenue allocation and matters relating to the economy.

Audit of government accounts (including the accounts of the state governments) in India is entrusted to the CAG of India who is empowered to audit all expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of the union or state governments, whether incurred within India or outside, all revenue into the Consolidated Funds and all transactions relating to the Public Accounts and the Contingency Funds of the Union and the states. Specifically, audits include:
* [[financial transaction|Transactions]] relating to [[debt]], [[Deposit account|deposit]]s, [[remittances]], Trading, and manufacturing
* [[income statement|Profit and loss accounts]] and [[balance sheet]]s kept under the order of the [[President of India|President]] or [[Governors and Lieutenant-Governors of states of India|Governors]]
* Receipts and stock accounts. CAG also audits the books of accounts of the government companies as per Companies Act.

In addition, the CAG also executes performance and compliance audits of various functions and departments of the government. Recently, the CAG as a part of thematic review on "Introduction of New Trains" is deputing an auditors' team on selected trains, originating and terminating at Sealdah and Howrah stations, to assess the necessity of their introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Comptroller-and-Auditor-General-lens-on-trains-introduced-by-Mamata-Banerjee/articleshow/14829314.cms | title= Comptroller and Auditor General lens on trains introduced by Mamata Banerjee| date= 12 July 2012 | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a path-breaking judgement, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the CAG General could audit private firms in revenue-share deals with government.

== Reforms suggested by former CAG Vinod Rai ==
In November 2009, the CAG requested the government to amend the 1971 Audit Act to bring all private-public partnerships (PPPs), Panchayti Raj Institutions and societies getting government funds within the ambit of the CAG. The amendment further proposes to enhance CAG’s powers to access information under the Audit Act. In the past, almost 30% of the documents demanded by CAG officials have been denied to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1857261/report-four-years-on-upa-govt-yet-to-accept-cag-s-request-for-more-powers Four years on, UPA govt yet to accept CAG's request for more powers | Latest News &amp; Updates at DNAIndia.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The PPP model has become a favourite mode of executing big infrastructure projects worth millions of rupees and these projects may or may not come under the audit purview of the CAG, depending on sources of funds and the nature of revenue sharing agreements between the government and the private entities. Currently, it is estimated that 65 percent of government spending does not come under the scrutiny of the CAG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.oneindia.in/feature/2013/after-shaking-the-govt-cag-vinod-rai-is-retiring-1221390.html After shaking and hurting the govt he is retiring - News Oneindia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent audit reports ==
Following are some of the most debated CAG reports:

=== 2G Spectrum allocation ===
{{main|2G Spectrum case}}

A CAG report on issue of Licences and Allocation of 2G Spectrum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saiindia.gov.in/english/home/Our_Products/Audit_Report/Government_Wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2010_2011/Civil_%20Performance_Audits/Report_no_19/Report_no_19.html|title=Report No. -19 of 2010-11 for the period ended March 2010 Performance Audit of Issue of Licences and Allocation of 2G Spectrum by the Department of Telecommunications ( Ministry of Communications and Information Technology)|publisher=CAG|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129070444/http://www.saiindia.gov.in/english/home/Our_Products/Audit_Report/Government_Wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2010_2011/Civil_%20Performance_Audits/Report_no_19/Report_no_19.html|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a huge controversy. The report estimated that there was a ''presumptive loss'' of {{INRConvert|1766|b}} by the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cag.gov.in/html/reports/civil/2010-11_19PA/Telecommunication%20Report.pdf |title=Performance Audit Report on the Issue of Licences and Allocation of 2G Spectrum |accessdate=5 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321130348/http://cag.gov.in/html/reports/civil/2010-11_19PA/Telecommunication%20Report.pdf |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[chargesheet]] filed on 2 April 2011 by the investigating agency [[Central Bureau of Investigation|Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)]], the agency pegged the loss at {{INRConvert|310|b}}&lt;ref name="Indiatimes 2G loss"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-07/india/30122800_1_spectrum-trai-2g|newspaper=Times of India | title=2G loss? Govt gained over Rs.3,000cr: Trai | date=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the speculations of profit, loss and no-loss were put to rest on 2 February 2012 when the [[Supreme Court of India]] on a [[Public Interest Litigation|public interest litigation (PIL)]] declared allotment of spectrum as ''"unconstitutional and arbitrary"'' and quashed all the 122 licenses issued in 2008 during tenure of [[A. Raja]] (then [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|minister for communications &amp; IT]] in the UPA government) the main accused.&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences"&gt;{{cite news|title=SC quashes 122 licences|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-02/india/31016262_1_spectrum-licences-2g-spectrum-allotment-case|newspaper=Times of India | date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court further said that [[A. Raja]] "wanted to favour some companies at the cost of the public exchequer" and "virtually gifted away important national asset".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2G verdict: A Raja 'virtually gifted away important national asset', says Supreme Court|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2G-verdict-A-Raja-virtually-gifted-away-important-national-asset-says-Supreme-Court/articleshow/11728003.cms|newspaper=Times of India | date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenue loss calculation was further established on 3 August 2012 when according to the directions of the Supreme Court, [[Govt of India]] revised the reserve price for 2G spectrum to {{INRConvert|140|b}}.&lt;ref name="Cabinet sets Rs 14,000 cr as reserve price for 2G spectrum"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabinet sets Rs 14,000 cr as reserve price for 2G spectrum|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/cabinet-sets-rs-14000-cr-as-reserve-price-for-2g-spectrum-404702.html|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Firstpost|date=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cabinet decision on 2G auction price demolishes zero-loss theory"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabinet decision on 2G auction price demolishes zero-loss theory|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3739078.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=8 August 2012|location=Chennai, India|first=Shalini|last=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the special court in New Delhi acquitted all accused in the 2G spectrum case including prime accused A Raja and Kanimozhi on December 21, 2017, the verdict was based on the fact that [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] could not find any evidence against the accused in those 7 years. Per the judgement, "Some people created a scam by artfully arranging a few selected facts and exaggerating things beyond recognition to astronomical levels."

=== Coal mine allocation ===
{{main |Coal Mining Scam}}

A 2012 CAG report on coal mine allocation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saiindia.gov.in/english/home/Our_Products/Audit_Report/Government_Wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html|title=Report No. - 7 of 2012-13 for the period ended March 2012 - Performance Audit of Allocation of Coal Blocks and Augmentation of Coal Production (Ministry of Coal)|publisher=CAG|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224062431/http://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html|archivedate=24 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; received massive media and political reaction as well as public outrage. During the 2012 monsoon session of the Parliament, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] protested the Government's handling of the issue demanding the resignation of the prime minister and refused to have a debate in the Parliament. The deadlock resulted in Parliament functioning only seven of the twenty days of the session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_turmoil-ridden-monsoon-session-of-parliament-ends_1737812|title=Turmoil-ridden Monsoon session of Parliament ends|publisher=DNA|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stalling-Parliament-is-also-part-of-democracy-Sushma-says/articleshow/16296444.cms|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103160326/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stalling-Parliament-is-also-part-of-democracy-Sushma-says/articleshow/16296444.cms|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 January 2013|title=Stalling Parliament is also a part of Democracy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAG report criticised the Government by saying it had the authority to allocate coal blocks by a process of competitive bidding, but chose not to.&lt;ref name="CAG report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/images/4/40/Draft_CAG_report_Pt_1.pdf|title="Draft Performance Audit, Allocation of Coal Blocks and Augmentation of Coal Production by Coal India Limited" Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (Union Government (Commercial))|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General of India (Union Government (Commercial))|accessdate=8 September 2012}} Hereafter Draft CAG Report.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, both [[State-owned enterprise|public sector enterprises]] (PSEs) and private firms paid less than they might have otherwise. In its draft report in March, the CAG estimated that the "windfall gain" to the allocatees was {{INRConvert|10673|b}}.&lt;ref name="CAG report" /&gt; The CAG Final Report tabled in Parliament put the figure at {{INRConvert|1856|b}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/08/27/transcript-prime-minister-singh-counters-coalgate-allegations/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Transcript: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Counters 'Coalgate' Allegations - India Real Time - WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the initial CAG report suggested that coal blocks could have been allocated more efficiently, resulting in more revenue to the government, at no point did it suggest that corruption was involved in the allocation of coal. Over the course of 2012, however, the question of corruption came to dominate the discussion. In response to a complaint by the BJP, the [[Central Vigilance Commission]] (CVC) directed the CBI to investigate the matter. The CBI named a dozen Indian firms in a [[First Information Report]] (FIR), the first step in a criminal investigation. These FIRs accuse them of overstating their net worth, failing to disclose prior coal allocations, and hoarding rather than developing coal allocations.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes.com"&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Firms-hid-earlier-allocations-to-get-new-blocks-says-CBI/Article1-925788.aspx Firms hid earlier allocations to get new blocks, says CBI - Hindustan Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104093339/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Firms-hid-earlier-allocations-to-get-new-blocks-says-CBI/Article1-925788.aspx |date=4 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/coalgate-now-dmk-leader-in-the-dock_798230.html Coalgate: Now, DMK leader in the dock&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The CBI officials investigating the case have speculated that bribery may be involved.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes.com"/&gt;

=== Fodder scam ===
{{main|Fodder scam}}

The scandal was first exposed due to the CAG report in the matter in December 1995. The report alleged of fraudulent withdrawal of government funds worth {{INRConvert|9.5|b}} in the [[Bihar]] animal husbandry department against non-existent supplies of fodder and medicines.&lt;ref name="CBI orders prosecution of Laloo, Mishra in fodder scam"&gt;{{cite news|title=CBI orders prosecution of Laloo, Mishra in fodder scam|url=http://www.rediff.com//news/apr/28bihar.htm|accessdate=1 October 2012|newspaper=Rediff.com|date=April 1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531143055/http://www.rediff.com//news/apr/28bihar.htm|archivedate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, based on [[Patna High Court]]'s orders, CBI investigated the case and registered as many as 63 cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7680">An '''educational consultant''' is an independent [[consultant]] who helps [[parents]]/[[students]] and [[organizations]] with educational planning. They are classed as "educational, vocational, and [[school counselor]]s." Educational consultants, however, are normally [[self-employed]] or employed by consulting firms, while school counselors are employed by [[school]]s.

== Organizational affiliations ==
The majority of educational consultants are located in the [[United States]] and in the [[United Kingdom]]. The two main professional organizations for educational consultants in the United States are the [[Higher Education Consultants Association]] and the [[Independent Educational Consultants Association]]. The Higher Education Consultants Association is a professional association focused exclusively on the practice of [[college admissions]] consulting, while members of the Independent Educational Consultants Association also assist students with consulting specialties that include college admission, [[day school|day]] and [[boarding school]], [[at-risk students]], and [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/06/07/counselors Private Counselors, Policing Themselves], ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Members of both associations work with both American students and students from other countries who are interested in coming to the United States to study. Many educational consultants in the U.S. are also members of other associations, such as the [[National Association for College Admission Counseling]], its regional affiliates, and the [[National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs]].

A huge number of educational consultants are based in the United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, Asia, and South America. The primary association in the UK is the Society of Education Consultants (SEC). Other UK professional associations or bodies to which educational consultants typically seek membership or affiliation include the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]], [[Ofsted]] (The Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills), [[Learning and Skills Council]], [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment]], [[Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal]] and the [[Gilfus Education Group]]

== Variety of consultants ==
While some educational [[consultant]]s are generalists, many specialize in assisting particular kinds of students or particular educational needs. For example, some consultants focus exclusively on assisting students with [[College admissions|college planning and admissions]], some on students seeking a [[Private school|private secondary school]], and yet others specialize in students who are [[Learning disability|learning disabled]] or have behavioral/emotional difficulties. Other consultants provide advising services for college students seeking admission to graduate school. Other educational consultants work to assist high schools and other organizations with educational program planning. Fees for consulting services vary widely.  Some consultants charge an hourly fee, while others offer an "all inclusive" package that may include unlimited hours of service.  Some consultants offer a sliding scale based on family income, or offer ''pro bono'' services to low income students.

Families considering hiring an educational consultant should carefully assess the qualifications and experience of individual consultants. Membership in one or more of the professional organizations described above may also indicate a consultant's dedication to professionalism, since these organizations have specific requirements for the education and experience of their members. In particular, these professional associations prohibit their members from accepting compensation from educational institutions for student referrals.  However, in addition to looking at a consultant's experience and professional affiliations, families should also ask for references from past clients. Consultants should be clear about their fees, counseling process, educational philosophy, and expectations at the beginning of the relationship.

The field of educational consulting has grown considerably in the past decade. Those considering launching an educational consulting practice should begin by assessing their personal qualifications and experiences. Most successful consultants enjoy working with young people and their parents, and get satisfaction from helping students reach their goals. Although a few educational consultants have received media attention for charging large fees, prospective consultants should understand that very few consultants get rich from educational consulting, so the desire to earn a high income should be a secondary consideration. Since competition in the field is growing, prospective consultants should also conduct market research to determine the feasibility of launching a practice in their geographic area. Consultants should plan on being committed to continued professional development, such as attending conferences and regular school visits. Several of the organizations mentioned above hold annual conferences and offer training for those who are new to the field of educational consulting.  Additionally, there are a number of universities and colleges that offer programs where consultants can further their education and knowledge.

== Ethics ==
In the United States, educational consultants are not bound by any particular statutory rules for practitioners.  However, many of the professional organizations listed above have established standards for professional and ethical behavior for educational consultants by which their members pledge to abide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nacacnet.org/advocacy--ethics/statement-of-principles-of-good-practice/|title=National Association for College Admission Counseling- Statement of Principles of Good Practice|website=www.nacacnet.org|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iecaonline.com/pogp.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731141710/http://www.iecaonline.com/pogp.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-07-31|title=Ethical Guidelines for IECA Members {{!}} Principles of Good Practice|website=www.iecaonline.com|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some education agents catering to students applying to foreign universities are known to engage in ethically dubious practices, such as writing essays for applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/the-china-conundrum.html|title=The China Conundrum|date=3 November 2011|author=Tom Barlett|author2=Karin Fischer|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elmer Davis''' (January 13, 1890 – May 18, 1958) was a news reporter, author, the Director of the [[United States Office of War Information]] during [[World War II]] and a [[Peabody Award]] recipient.

==Early life and career==
Davis was born in [[Aurora, Indiana]], the son of a cashier for the First National Bank of Aurora. One of his first professional writing jobs was with the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'', a position he held while attending [[Franklin College (Indiana)|Franklin College]]. A brilliant student, Davis received a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Queen's College, Oxford]] in 1910. His stay in England was cut short when his father fell ill and eventually died. Davis met his wife, Florence, in England.

Upon his return to America, Davis became an editor for the pulp magazine ''[[Adventure (magazine)|Adventure]]'', leaving after a year to work as a reporter and editorial writer for ''[[The New York Times]]''. For the next decade, Davis reported on stories ranging from pugilist [[Jack Dempsey]] to evangelist [[Billy Sunday]]. It was his coverage of Billy Sunday that gained him notoriety. Davis later left ''The New York Times'' and became a freelance writer.

Davis' best-known work is his company history [https://books.google.com/books?id=yyYbAAAAYAAJ ''History of the New York Times. 1851–1921''] (New York: The New York Times, 1921).

In 1928 Davis published his one and only novel ''Giant Killer'', a retelling of the Biblical story of [[David]].

==Radio==
In August 1939, [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]], the news chief at [[CBS]], asked Davis to fill in as a news analyst for [[H. V. Kaltenborn]], who was off in Europe reporting on the increasingly hostile events. Davis became an instant success. [[Edward R. Murrow]] later commented that one reason he believed that Davis was likeable was his [[Hoosier]] accent, which reminded people of a friendly neighbor. By 1941, the audience for Davis' nightly five-minute newscast and comment was 12.5 million.

On June 1, 1941, [[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate-Palmolive-Peet]] began sponsoring seven-days-a-week newscasts by Davis on [[CBS]]. The program was carried on 95 stations from 8:55 to 9 p.m., Eastern Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elmer Davis for C-P-P |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/41-OCR/1941-03-31-BC-OCR-Page-0009.pdf |accessdate=12 August 2015 |agency=Broadcasting |date=March 31, 1941 |page=9 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Office of War Information==
Davis spent two and a half years reporting the news on radio and gaining the trust of the nation. Then, in 1941, his colleagues persuaded President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] to appoint Davis director of the newly created [[United States Office of War Information]], a sprawling organization with over 3,000 employees. Even though Davis was being paid $53,000 per year from CBS, he left the network to work in government during the crisis of [[World War II]].

As Director of the Office of War Information, Davis recommended to President Roosevelt that [[Japanese-Americans]] be permitted to enlist for service in the Army and Navy and urged him to oppose bills in Congress that would deprive [[Nisei]] of citizenship and [[Japanese American internment|intern]] them during the war. He argued that Japanese propaganda proclaiming it a racial war could be combated by deeds that counteracted this.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], ''[[The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945]]'' p 453 Random House New York 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Davis has been termed one of the "unsung forefathers" of the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]], an all-Nisei combat unit in the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.javoice.com/Disunited.pdf Japanese American Voice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627162735/http://www.javoice.com/Disunited.pdf |date=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was also instrumental in loosening censorship rules that forbade the publication of images of dead [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] on the battlefield. Until late 1943, the U.S. [[Office of Censorship]] only permitted the media to publish images of blanket-covered bodies and flag-draped coffins of dead U.S. soldiers,&lt;ref name=chambers&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to American Military History|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0195071986|pages=916|edition=first|editor=John Whiteclay Chambers}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly for fear that Americans would be demoralized if they had any graphic understanding of the human price being paid in the war.&lt;ref name=dunlap&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|title=Photo That Was Hard to Get Published, but Even Harder to Get|url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/a-photo-that-was-hard-to-get-published-but-even-harder-to-get/?_r=0|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=Time|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also restricted what reporters could write, and coverage was generally upbeat and bloodless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sweeney|first=Michael S.|title=Appointment at Hill 1205|url=http://www.texasmilitaryforcesmuseum.org/36division/archives/waskow/sect14.htm |publisher=Texas Military Forces Museum|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis believed that the American public "had a right to be truthfully informed" about the war within the dictates of military security. He asked President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] to lift the ban on publishing photographs of dead GIs on the battlefield on the grounds that the American people needed to appreciate the sacrifices made by their young men.&lt;ref name=miller2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Donald L.|title=D-Days in the Pacific|year=2008|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9781439128817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt agreed. ''Life'' published a photograph taken by [[George Strock]] of three American soldiers who were killed on the beach during the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]], the first photograph published that depicted American soldiers dead on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=three&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Americans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=george%20strock&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=LIFE|date=21 September 1943 | pages= 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Censorship was loosened, but the media was still forbidden from showing the faces of the dead or the insignia of the units they belonged to.&lt;ref name=persico&gt;{{cite book|last=Persico|first=Joseph E.|title=Roosevelt's Centurions FDR and the Commanders He Led to Victory in World War II|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-64543-6|page=353|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2gV4DlvZvIC&amp;pg=PT353|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar career==
Following the war, Davis continued his career in radio, using the platform to criticize Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] for his anti-communist investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otr.com/davis.html Jim Widner's Radio Days]&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was one of the four journalists who portrayed themselves in the 1951 film ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'', and he was the host and narrator of the ABC television series, ''[[Pulitzer Prize Playhouse]]'' (1950–52), which won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.

He was a longstanding member of [[The Baker Street Irregulars]], the literary society dedicated to keeping green the memory of [[Sherlock Holmes]].

On June 29, 1952, the ''Washington Post'' published a two-page essay by Davis, which he opened by questioning "how long will these former Communists and former sympathizers abuse the patience of the vast majority which had sense enough never to be Communists in the first place?"  He cited their "arrogance" as the most "irritating thing" about them.  he specifically mentioned [[Whittaker Chambers]], who at that time were testifying before the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==

Davis died in May 1958 of complications from a [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19580519&amp;id=-S9WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GOcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2861,983544&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Davis was considered to be one of the greatest news reporters of the mid-20th century, on a level with Edward R. Murrow. Among the many awards Davis received were three Peabody Awards, including an award during its inaugural year. Foreign governments also recognized Davis when he was inducted into the Dutch [[Order of Orange Nassau|Order of Orange-Nassau]] and the Czechoslovak [[Order of the White Lion]], among others.

In 1946, Davis received the [[Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award|Alfred I. duPont Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/page/412-past-dupont-award-winners/594 All duPont–Columbia Award Winners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814182043/http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/page/412-past-dupont-award-winners/594 |date=August 14, 2012 }}, [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia Journalism School]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18354">'''Farm to School''' is a program in the United States through which schools buy and feature locally produced, farm-fresh foods such as fruits and vegetables, eggs, honey, meat, and beans on their menus.  Schools also incorporate nutrition-based curriculum and provide students with experiential learning opportunities such as farm visits, [[garden-based learning]], and recycling programs. As a result of Farm to School, students have access to fresh, local foods, and farmers have access to new markets through school sales.  Farmers are also able to participate in programs designed to educate kids about local food and agriculture.

Currently, school lunches are generally designed according to the guidelines put out by the USDA National School Lunch Program (NSLP).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/aboutlunch/NSLPFactSheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  More than half of US children participate daily, which translates to approximately 28 million lunches distributed per day.  The nutritional guidelines for the NSLP lunches are based on "Dietary Recommendations for Americans" composed by the Institute of Medicine.  Its requirements are that a school lunch includes one third of the RDA of calories, vitamins A and C, calcium and iron, and protein.  Additionally, the lunch should contain no more than 30% of the total calories from fat, and no more than 10% from saturated fat.  The guidelines provide unclear recommendations on fruit, vegetable, whole grain, sodium content.  In general, the guidelines leave room for interpretation and do not always lead to the creation of health meals.  For example, in several schools pizza counts as a vegetable due to its tomato sauce.

Another issue facing schools is the prevalence of other sources of food and snacks, which often make the problem of school lunch nutrition worse.  One such source is called “commodity foods” which are free or low cost foods subsidized by the USDA.  Of the subsidy money, 73% goes to buy meat and dairy, whereas less than 1% goes to subsidize fruits and vegetables.  Schools also may receive “bonus foods,” which are free surplus foods from farms or large-scale agriculture, which also are not typically healthy options for children.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine, "Healthy School Lunches," www.healthyschoollunches.org, accessed March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most concerning is the widespread use of “competitive foods,” a term describing foods and snacks offered outside of the auspices of the NSLP.   Competitive food includes such items as vending machines (which usually contain high-calorie sugary drinks and sodas, as well as other junk foods), snack bars, and pizza or bake sales.

School lunch nutrition is of particular importance currently due to the emerging [[childhood obesity]] epidemic.  Using the definition of obesity as having a BMI-for-age of greater than the 85th percentile, approximately 31.7% of American children qualify as being overweight, whereas 16.9% of US children aged 2 through 19 years meet criteria for being obese (with BMI-for-age greater than the 95th percentile).&lt;ref&gt;Ogden C et al.  Prevalence of High Body Mass Index in US Children and Adolescents, 2007-2008. JAMA 2010 Jan 20;303(3):242-9. Epub 2010 Jan 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, this epidemic is worsening with an alarming pace - in school-age children, the rate of obesity has increased since 1980 from 6.5% to 19.6%.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden C and Carroll M.  Prevalence of Obesity Among Children and Adolescents: United States, Trends 1963-1965 Through 2007-2008.  CDC E-stat.  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_child_07_08/obesity_child_07_08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Given this growing problem facing our nation’s youth, school lunch nutrition will play a vital role in halting and potentially reversing this concerning trend.

Farm to School provides a model for positively influencing children’s eating habits through school cafeteria improvements, hands-on nutrition education, and community involvement and support. The last decade has witnessed a tremendous spike in nutrition- and health-related diseases in the country, especially those affecting children. In response, there have been numerous initiatives undertaken to combat the growing rates of childhood obesity targeted at changes at the school, community and individual levels. Farm to School is one such initiative, and it also has the added benefits of supporting small farmers, local agriculture, and local economies.

==History==

The National Farm to School Network sprouted in 1996-1997 from the desire to support community-based food systems, strengthen family farms, and improve student health by reducing childhood obesity. In 2004 the National Farm to School Program was officially authorized, and included 400 programs in 22 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farmtoschool.org&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the 2011 White House Task Force Report on Childhood Obesity recognized Farm to School as a strategy for obesity prevention.

==The National Farm to School Network ==

The National Farm to School Network (NFSN), established in 2007, began as a collaborative of the Urban &amp; Environmental Policy Institute, [[Occidental College]] and the [[Community Food Security Coalition]] (CFSC). In late 2011, it was decided that the National Farm to School Network had outgrown its original home and it became its own organization under the fiscal sponsorship of the [[Tides Center]]. The National Farm to School Network is as an information, advocacy and networking hub for communities working to bring local food sourcing, school gardens and food and agriculture education into schools and early care and education settings. NFSN includes all 50 states, Washington D.C., Native Communities, and the U.S. Territories; all are represented by Core and Supporting partners. 

The Network’s six main priority areas are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farmtoschool.org&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Policy development
# Training and technical assistance
# Information development and dissemination
# Networking
# Media and marketing
# Research and evaluation

==Benefits of Farm to School==

The Farm to School approach helps children understand where their food comes from and how their food choices impact their bodies, the environment and their communities at large.

Potential benefits of the program for communities, schools, farmers and children include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farmtoschool.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nutrition education for students
* Participation in school meal program
* Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables
* Improved nutrition
* Reduced hunger
* Obesity prevention
* Local economic development: Each dollar invested in farm to school stimulates an additional
$0.60-$2.16 of local economic activity &lt;ref&gt;http://www.farmtoschool.org/Resources/BenefitsFactSheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Market opportunities for farmers
* Food security for children
* Decreased distance between producer and consumer
* Influence policy-making at the local and regional levels

Recent studies conducted by Beery et al. demonstrated additional, unexpected benefits from programs similar to Farm to School, as illustrated by the following quotes:&lt;ref&gt;Beery, M. &amp; Joshi, A. (2007, August). A growing movement: A decade of farm to school in California. Center for Food &amp; Justice,Urban and Environmental Policy Institute. Retrieved from http://scholar.oxy.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1381&amp;context=uep_faculty&lt;/ref&gt;
* “Students eating from the farm fresh salad bar lunches took between 90% and 144% of recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables compared to the students eating hot lunches 40% and 60% of the recommended servings”
* "Experiences from existing programs prove that innovative nutrition education, experiential education, and marketing programs for the salad bar are key to generating enthusiasm about the farm to school programs and maintaining strong participation in the cafeteria meal program"

==Environmental Impact==

Multiple studies have looked at the environmental impact of conventional agriculture versus the local food movement.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, GR and Pretty JN.Unwelcome Harvest: Agriculture and Pollution. (1991) London, UK: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uphoff N (Ed.). Agroecological Innovations. (2002) London, UK: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coley D, Howard M, Winter M. Local food, food miles and carbon emissions: A comparison of farm shop and mass distribution approaches. (2009) 34: 150-155.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies show that there is not yet a consistent methodology for measuring energy consumption in local versus non-local farms. “Local” is not a clearly defined measurement, and by only examining the energy in terms of “food miles” versus an entire life cycle assessment (LCA), much of the research on local farming is missing key components of the farm-to-consumer process, and the energy consumption involved. For example, despite the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from transporting farm foods to consumers, agricultural soils are also responsible for releasing significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (Schlesinger).
The life cycle assessment attempts to measure the impacts of each activity directly or indirectly involved in the production, transport, storage, retail, consumption and disposal of a particular food from “farm to fork” or “farm to waste”. Studies that examine the LCA still show that there is no clear conclusion on the environmental impact of local versus non-local agriculture. A study in Sweden that examined bread production using local flour versus flour from other regions in Sweden found that the smaller scale of local farms results in less energy efficiency5.  [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224408000034%20-%20bib55 Another study] supports this argument that global food systems have better energy efficiency due to the size of production, the so-called “ecology-of-scale”.&lt;ref&gt;Schlich E and Fleissner U. The ecology of scale: assessment of regional energy turnovers and comparison with global food. (2005) Int’l Journal of Life Cycle Assessment. 10: 219-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these studies are countered by other studies that found lower emissions on small scale bread making facilities,&lt;ref&gt;Andersson K and Ohlsson T. Life cycle assessment of bread produced on different scaled. (1998). Gotegorg, Sweden: Chalmers Tekniska Hogskola.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jungbluth N and Demmeler M. Letter to the editor – ‘the ecology of scale: assessment of regional energy turnover and comparison with global food; by Elmar Schlich and Ulla Fleissner. (2005). Int’l Journal of Life Cycle Assessment. 10: 168-170.&lt;/ref&gt; contesting the accuracy of the measurements in the Schilich and Fleissner study. These studies show the inherent variation in farming production, which leads to varying levels of impact on the environment. 
Other environmental assessments of farming production methods include:
* Water consumption (including contamination of water from surface waterways exposed to feces from cattle and wildlife),
* Use (and production) of fertilizers and pesticides (and the impact of these chemical in ground water),
* Risk of food contamination and infectious agents from longer traveling times from farm to consumer,
* Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and the impact on animal and human health,
* And mono-agriculture methods that cause soil erosion and soil nutrient depletion.

Several organizations promoting sustainable agriculture methods have been created on a national and international scale in response to growing concerns about the impact of current farming production methods on the environment, the economy, human health, and animal health combined.

==Economic Impact==

There is a widespread perception that serving healthier meals in schools and doing away with serving typical vending foods such as chips, sodas, and sweets will decrease the financial viability of the school lunch program (CDC).  A growing body of evidence indicates that this concern may not be warranted.&lt;ref&gt;CDC.  Implementing Strong Nutrition Standards for Schools:  Financial Implications.  www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/nutrition/pdf/financial_implications.pdf  Accessed 5/7/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though there may be an initial decrease in revenue, most schools have reported an increase or no change in revenue after implementing strong nutrition standards and restricting the sale of unhealthy a la carte foods in pilot studies (CDC).  This seems to be due to an increase in school lunch program participation.&lt;ref&gt;CDC.  Implementing Strong Nutrition Standards for Schools:  Financial Implications.  www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/nutrition/pdf/financial_implications.pdf  Accessed 5/7/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, vending contracts are not a significant source of funding for most schools and can in most cases be eliminated without significant financial loss.  A la carte foods from vending machines may simply compete with the school lunch program.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, P., and M. Kennedy. “The Economics of a Healthy School Meal.” Choices 24, no. 3 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Stronger restrictions or even eliminating these competing options are most likely to increase participation in the school lunch programs which generally include the healthiest food options.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, P., and M. Kennedy. “The Economics of a Healthy School Meal.” Choices 24, no. 3 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of farm to school argue that it will have a beneficial effect on the regional economy but there are few comprehensive analyses that have evaluated this.  At least one analysis evaluated the potential economic impact of farm to school programs for an entire region (Central Minnesota) in a comprehensive manner.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, B., M. Haynes, R. King, and R. Pesch. “An Extension Community Economics Program.  The Economic Impact of Farm-to-School Lunch Programs: A Central Minnesota Example” University of Minnesota Extension Center for Community Vitality.  Regents of the University of Minnesota, March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The investigators empirically developed a realistic set of potential foods to include in farm-to-school lunch programs in the region.  Their analysis took into account the impact on output as well as employment and labor income in the regions.  Depending on the price paid for the farm foods and how often the farm foods are utilized in school lunches, the regional economic impact ranged from $20,000 to almost $500,000 in their analysis.

Though initial pilot studies and economic analyses provide hope that farm-to-school programs are financially viable options for schools and can also be beneficial to local economies, this research is in early stages and no longer term controlled studies have been completed.&lt;ref&gt;Wharton, Christopher M, Michael Long, and Marlene B Schwartz. “Changing Nutrition Standards in Schools: The Emerging Impact on School Revenue.” Journal of School Health 78, no. 5 (May 1, 2008): 245–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29421">'''Food fortification''' or '''enrichment''' is the process of adding [[micronutrient]]s (essential trace elements and vitamins) to [[food]]. Sometimes it's a purely commercial choice to provide extra nutrients in a food, while other times it is a [[public health]] policy which aims to reduce the number of people with dietary deficiencies within a population. [[Staple food]]s of a region can lack particular nutrients due to the soil of the region or from inherent inadequacy of a normal diet. Addition of micronutrients to staples and condiments can prevent large-scale [[deficiency disease]]s in these cases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/guide-giving/gtg-micronutrient-fortification-and-biofortification-challenge|title=Micronutrient Fortification and Biofortification Challenge {{!}} Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), '''fortification''' refers to "the practice of deliberately increasing the content of an essential micronutrient, ie. vitamins and minerals (including trace elements) in a food irrespective of whether the nutrients were originally in the food before processing or not, so as to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply and to provide a public health benefit with minimal risk to health", whereas '''enrichment''' is defined as "synonymous with fortification and refers to the addition of micronutrients to a food which are lost during processing".&lt;ref name="WHO-FAO_Guidelines"&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/guide_food_fortification_micronutrients.pdf World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Guidelines on food fortification with micronutrients.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226234935/http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/guide_food_fortification_micronutrients.pdf |date=26 December 2016 }} 2006 [cited on 2011 Oct 30].&lt;/ref&gt;

Food fortification was identified as the second strategy of four by the WHO and FAO to begin decreasing the incidence of nutrient deficiencies at the global level.&lt;ref name="WHO-FAO_Guidelines" /&gt; As outlined by the FAO, the most common fortified foods are [[cereal]]s (and cereal based products), [[milk]] (and milk products), [[fat]]s and [[oil]]s, accessory food items, [[tea]] and other beverages, and [[infant formula]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W2840E/w2840e0b.htm Micronutrient Fortification of Food: Technology and Quality Control] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902113703/http://www.fao.org/docrep/W2840E/w2840e0b.htm |date=2 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Undernutrition and nutrient deficiency is estimated globally to cause between 3 and 5 million deaths per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types ==
Main methods of food fortification:
# Commercial and industrial fortification (wheat flour, corn meal, cooking oils)
# [[Biofortification]] (breeding crops to increase their nutritional value, which can include both conventional selective breeding, and genetic engineering)
# Home fortification (example: vitamin D drops)&lt;ref name="CMJ"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=C. |last1=Liyanage |first2=M. |last2=Hettiarachchi |title=Food fortification |journal=Ceylon Medical Journal |year=2011 |volume=56 |pages=124–127 |doi=10.4038/cmj.v56i3.3607 |url=http://www.sljol.info/index.php/CMJ/article/download/3607/2908/3607-12747-1-PB.pdf |issue=3 |pmid=22164753 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513211701/http://www.sljol.info/index.php/CMJ/article/download/3607/2908/3607-12747-1-PB.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

The WHO and FAO, among many other nationally recognized organizations, have recognized that there are over 2 billion people worldwide who suffer from a variety of micronutrient deficiencies. In 1992, 159 countries pledged at the FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition to make efforts to help combat these issues of micronutrient deficiencies, highlighting the importance of decreasing the number of those with iodine, vitamin A, and iron deficiencies.&lt;ref name="WHO-FAO_Guidelines" /&gt; A significant statistic that led to these efforts was the discovery that approximately 1 in 3 people worldwide were at risk for either an iodine, vitamin A, or iron deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Darnton-Hill, E | title=Overview: Rationale and elements of a successful food-fortification programme | journal=FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN (United Nations University) | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=1998 | pages=92–100  | url = http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/food/V192e/ch02.htm | doi=10.1177/156482659801900202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is recognized that food fortification alone will not combat this deficiency, it is a step towards reducing the prevalence of these deficiencies and their associated health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Darnton-Hill, E | title=Overview: Rationale and elements of a successful food-fortification programme | journal=FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN (United Nations University) | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=1998 | pages=92–100  | url = http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/food/fnb19-2.pdf#page=4 | doi=10.1177/156482659801900202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the Food and Drug Regulations have outlined specific criterion which justifies food fortification:
# To replace nutrients which were lost during manufacturing of the product (e.g. the manufacturing of flour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/wheat_maize_fort.pdf |format=PDF |title=Recommendations on Wheat and Maize Flour Fortification Meeting Report: Interim Consensus Statement |website=Who.int |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
# To act as a [[public health intervention]]
# To ensure the nutritional equivalence of substitute foods (e.g. to make butter and [[margarine]] similar in content, [[soy milk]] and cow's milk, etc.)
# To ensure the appropriate vitamin and mineral nutrient composition of foods for special dietary purposes (e.g., [[gluten]]-free products, low sodium, or any other products specifically designed for special dietary requirements from an individual).

There are also several advantages to approaching nutrient deficiencies among populations via food fortification as opposed to other methods. These may include, but are not limited to: treating a population without specific dietary interventions therefore not requiring a change in dietary patterns, continuous delivery of the nutrient, does not require individual compliance, and potential to maintain nutrient stores more efficiently if consumed on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="CMJ" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[File:Ad for "Vitamin Donut" (FDA 168) (8212305596).jpg|thumb|right|Manufacturers once proposed selling fortified [[junk food]] and [[beer]], but [[USFDA]] policies of the time forbade it]]
Several organizations such as the WHO, FAO, [[Health Canada]], and [[Nestlé|Nestlé Research]] acknowledge that there are limitations to food fortification. Within the discussion of nutrient deficiencies the topic of nutrient toxicities can also be immediately questioned. Fortification of nutrients in foods may deliver toxic amounts of nutrients to an individual and also cause its associated side effects. As seen with the case of excessive [[fluoride]] intakes below, the result can be irreversible staining to the teeth. Although this may be a minor toxic effect to health, there are several that are more severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/foodsafetynetwork/food-fortification |title=Food Science &amp;#124; Educating Food Leaders for over 100 years |website=Uoguelph.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO states that limitations to food fortification may include: human rights issues indicating that consumers have the right to choose if they want fortified products or not, the potential for insufficient demand of the fortified product, increased production costs leading to increased retail costs, the potential that 
the fortified products will still not be a solution to nutrient deficiencies amongst low income populations who may not be able to afford the new product, and children who may not be able to consume adequate amounts thereof.&lt;ref name="WHO-FAO_Guidelines"/&gt;

Food safety worries led to legislation in Denmark in 2004 restricting foods fortified with extra vitamins or minerals. Products banned include: [[Rice Crispies]], [[Shreddies]], [[Horlicks]], [[Ovaltine]] and [[Marmite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/8533896/Marmite-made-illegal-in-Denmark.html |title=Marmite made illegal in Denmark |work=The Telegraph |author=Bruno Waterfield |date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited absorption===
One factor that limits the benefits of food fortification is that isolated nutrients added back into a processed food that has had many of its nutrients removed, does not always result in the added nutrients being as [[bioavailable]] as they would be in the original, whole food. An example is [[skim milk]] that has had the fat removed, and then had [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin D]] added back. Vitamins A and D are both fat-soluble and non-water-soluble, so a person consuming skim milk in the absence of fats may not be able to absorb as much of these vitamins as one would be able to absorb from drinking whole milk. On the other hand, the nutrient added as a fortificant may have a higher bioavailability than from foods, which is the case with folic acid used to increase folate intakes.&lt;ref name="McNultyPentieva2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNulty|first1=Helene|last2=Pentieva|first2=Kristina|title=Folate bioavailability|journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|volume=63|issue=04|year=2007|pages=529–536|issn=0029-6651|doi=10.1079/PNS2004383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phytochemical]]s such as [[phytate|phytic acid]] in cereal grains can also impact nutrient absorption, limiting the bioavailability of intrinsic and additional nutrients, and reducing the effectiveness of fortification programs.

===Excess intake of micronutrients===
Ecological studies have shown that increased B vitamin fortification is correlated with the prevalence of [[obesity]] and [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="Zhou2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Shi-Sheng|title=Excess vitamin intake: An unrecognized risk factor for obesity|journal=World J Diabetes|volume=5|issue=1|year=2014|pages=1–13|issn=1948-9358|doi=10.4239/wjd.v5.i1.1|pmid=24567797|pmc=3932423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daily consumption of iron per capita in the United States has dramatically surged since [[World War II]] and nearly doubled over the past century due to increases in iron fortification and increased consumption of meat.&lt;ref name="USDA20014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nutrient Content of the U.S. Food Supply, 1909-2000 |journal=Home Economics Research Report No. 56, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion |date=1 November 2004 |last=Gerrior |first=Shirley |last2=Bente |first2=Lisa |last3=Hiza |first3=Hazel |page=45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing evidence suggests that excess iron intake may play a role in the development of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer.&lt;ref name="SanganiGhio2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sangani|first1=Rahul|last2=Ghio|first2=Andrew|title=Iron, Human Growth, and the Global Epidemic of Obesity|journal=Nutrients|volume=5|issue=10|year=2013|pages=4231–4249|issn=2072-6643|doi=10.3390/nu5104231|pmc=3820071|pmid=24152754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortification of foods with [[folic acid]] has been mandated in many countries solely to improve the folate status of pregnant women to prevent [[neural tube defect]]s—a birth defect which affected 0.5% (1 out of 200) US births before fortification began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Institute of Child Health and Human Development |title=How many people are affected by or are at risk for neural tube defects? |date=30 November 2012 |website=Nichd.nih.gov|publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/ntds/conditioninfo/pages/risk.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Refsum2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | author1 = Helga Refsum|author2=A.

David Smith|author2=Young-In Kim|author3=Helga Refsum| title = Is folic acid good for everyone? | journal = [[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 517–533 |date=March 2008  | pmid = 18326588 | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/3/517.long }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, increased folic acid intake leads to elevated blood concentrations of naturally occurring folates and of unmetabolized folic acid. High blood concentrations of folic acid may decrease natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and high folate status may reduce the response to drugs used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer.&lt;ref name="Smith2008" /&gt; A combination of high folate levels and low vitamin B-12 status may be associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and anemia in the elderly and, in pregnant women, with an increased risk of insulin resistance and obesity in their children.&lt;ref name="Smith2008" /&gt; Folate has a dual effect on cancer, protecting against cancer initiation but facilitating progression and growth of preneoplastic cells and subclinical cancers.&lt;ref name="Smith2008" /&gt; Furthermore, intake of folic acid from fortification have turned out to be significantly greater than originally modeled in pre mandate predictions.&lt;ref name="Choumenkovitch SF 2798"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Choumenkovitch SF, Selhub J, Wilson PW, Rader JI, Rosenberg IH, Jacques PF |title=Folic acid intake from fortification in United States exceeds predictions |journal=J.

===Different forms of micronutrients===
There is a concern that micronutrients are legally defined in such a way that does not distinguish between different forms, and that fortified foods often have nutrients in a balance that would not occur naturally. For example, in the U.S., food is fortified with folic acid, which is one of the many naturally-occurring forms of folate, and which only contributes a minor amount to the folates occurring in natural foods.&lt;ref name="adavidsmith"&gt;[http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/1/3.full A. David Smith, "Folic acid fortification: the good, the bad, and the puzzle of vitamin", ''American Society for Clinical Nutrition'', Vol. 85, No. 1, 3-5. January 2007.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218180042/http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/1/3.full |date=18 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, such as with folate, it is an open question of whether or not there are any benefits or risks to consuming folic acid in this form.

In many cases, the micronutrients added to foods in fortification are synthetic.

In some cases, certain forms of micronutrients can be actively toxic in a sufficiently high dose, even if other forms are safe at the same or much higher doses. There are examples of such toxicity in both synthetic and naturally-occurring forms of vitamins. [[Retinol]], the active form of Vitamin A, is toxic in a much lower dose than other forms, such as beta carotene. [[Menadione]], a phased-out synthetic form of [[Vitamin K]], is also known to be toxic.{{mcn|date=October 2016}}

==Food supplements==
There are several main groups of food supplements like:
*[[Vitamin]]s and co-vitamins
*[[Essential mineral]]s
*[[Essential fatty acid]]s
*[[Essential amino acid]]s
*[[Phytonutrient]]s
*[[Enzyme]]s

==Examples of fortification in foods==
Many foods and beverages worldwide have been fortified, whether a voluntary action by the product developers or by law. Although some may view these additions as strategic marketing schemes to sell their product, there is a lot of work that must go into a product before simply fortifying it. In order to fortify a product, it must first be proven that the addition of this vitamin or mineral is beneficial to health, safe, and an effective method of delivery. The addition must also abide by all food and labeling regulations and support nutritional rationale. From a food developer's point of view, they also need to consider the costs associated with this new product and whether or not there will be a market to support the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=D. P.|title=Food Fortification|journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|date=28 February 2007|volume=49|issue=1|pages=39–50|doi=10.1079/PNS19900007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of foods and beverages that have been fortified and shown to have positive health effects:

=== Iodized salt ===
{{main|Iodised salt}}
"[[Iodine deficiency]] disorder (IDD) is the single greatest cause of preventable mental retardation. Severe deficiencies cause [[cretinism]], stillbirth and miscarriage. But even mild deficiency can significantly affect the learning ability of populations. […] Today over 1 billion people in the world suffer from iodine deficiency, and 38 million babies born every year are not protected from brain damage due to IDD."—Kul Gautam, Deputy Executive Director, UNICEF, October 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salt |first=The |url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Uses-benefits/Salt-in-Food/Essential-nutrient/Iodized-salt |title=Iodized Salt |publisher=Salt Institute |date=13 July 2013 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iodised salt]] has been used in the [[United States]] since before [[World War II]]. It was discovered in 1821 that [[goiters]] could be treated by the use of iodized salts. However, it was not until 1916 that the use of iodized salts could be tested in a research trial as a preventative measure against [[goiters]]. By 1924, it became readily available in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccidd.org/pages/protecting-children/fortifying-salt/history-of-salt-iodization.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121042146/http://www.iccidd.org/pages/protecting-children/fortifying-salt/history-of-salt-iodization.php |archivedate=21 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently in Canada and the US, the [[Recommended Dietary Allowances|RDA]] for iodine is as low as 90&amp;nbsp;µg/day for children (4–8 years) and as high as 290&amp;nbsp;µg/day for breast-feeding mothers.{{mcn|date=October 2016}}

Diseases that are associated with an [[iodine deficiency]] include: [[mental retardation]], [[hypothyroidism]], and [[goiter]]. There is also a risk of various other growth and developmental abnormalities.{{mcn|date=October 2016}}

=== Folic acid ===
[[Folic acid]] (also known as folate) functions in reducing blood homocysteine levels, forming red blood cells, proper growth and division of cells, and preventing [[neural tube defects]] (NTDs).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051026215751/http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/5000/pdf/5553.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In many industrialized countries, the addition of folic acid to flour has prevented a significant number of NTDs in infants. Two common types of NTDs, [[spina bifida]] and [[anencephaly]], affect approximately 2500-3000 infants born in the US annually. Research trials have shown the ability to reduce the incidence of NTDs by supplementing pregnant mothers with [[folic acid]] by 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Honein MA, Paulozzi LJ, Mathews TJ, Erickson JD, Wong LY |title=Impact of folic acid fortification of the US food supply on the occurrence of neural tube defects |journal=JAMA |volume=285 |issue=23 |pages=2981–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11410096 |url=http://jama.highwire.org/cgi/reprint/285/23/2981.pdf |doi=10.1001/jama.285.23.2981 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225625/http://jama.highwire.org/cgi/reprint/285/23/2981.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Recommended Dietary Allowances|RDA]] for [[folic acid]] ranges from as low as 150&amp;nbsp;μg/day for children aged 1–3 years old, to 400&amp;nbsp;μg/day for males and females over the age of 19, and 600&amp;nbsp;μg/day during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/folate |title=Folate — Health Professional Fact Sheet |website=Ods.od.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases associated with folic acid deficiency include: [[megaloblastic anemia|megaloblastic]] or [[macrocytic anemia]], [[cardiovascular disease]], certain types of cancer, and NTDs in infants.{{mcn|date=October 2016}}

=== Niacin ===
[[Niacin]] has been added to bread in the USA since 1938 (when voluntary addition started), a programme which substantially reduced the incidence of [[pellagra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Park YK, Sempos CT, Barton CN, Vanderveen JE, Yetley EA |title=Effectiveness of food fortification in the United States: the case of pellagra |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=727–38 |year=2000 |pmid=10800421 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.5.727 |pmc=1446222}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1755, [[pellagra]] was recognized by doctors as being a niacin deficiency disease. Although not officially receiving its name of [[pellagra]] until 1771.&lt;ref name="Prousky2001"&gt;Prousky, J., Millman, C.G.,  Kirkland, J.B. Pharmacologic Use of Niacin. ''[[Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine]]''. 2001; 16(2): 91-101.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pellagra]] was seen amongst poor families who used corn as their main dietary staple. Although corn itself does contain niacin, it is not a bioavailable form unless it undergoes [[nixtamalization]] (treatment with alkali, traditional in Native American cultures) and therefore was not contributing to the overall intake of niacin.{{mcn|date=October 2016}}

The RDA for niacin is 2&amp;nbsp;mg NE(niacin equivalents)/day ([[Adequate Intake|AI]]) for infants aged 0–6 months, 16&amp;nbsp;mg NE/day for males, and 14&amp;nbsp;mg NE/day for females who are over the age of 19.{{mcn|date=October 2016}}

Diseases associated with niacin deficiency include: Pellagra which consisted of signs and symptoms called the 3D's-"Dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea. Others may include vascular or gastrointestinal diseases.&lt;ref name="Prousky2001"/&gt; Common diseases which present a high frequency of niacin deficiency: alcoholism, anorexia nervosa, HIV infection, gastrectomy, malabsorptive disorders, certain cancers and their associated treatments.&lt;ref name="Prousky2001" /&gt;

=== Vitamin D ===
Since [[Vitamin D]] is a [[fat-soluble vitamin]], it cannot be added to a wide variety of foods. Foods that it is commonly added to are margarine, vegetable oils and dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W2840E/w2840e03.htm |title=Food Fortification Technology |website=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1800s, after the discovery of curing conditions of [[scurvy]] and [[beriberi]] had occurred, researchers were aiming to see if the disease, later known as [[rickets]], could also be cured by food. Their results showed that sunlight exposure and cod liver oil were the cure. It was not until the 1930s that [[vitamin D]] was actually linked to curing [[rickets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = | year = 2002 | title = A dose of vitamin D history | url = | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| page = 77 | doi=10.1038/nsb0202-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery led to the fortification of common foods such as milk, margarine, and breakfast cereals. This took the astonishing statistics of approximately 80–90% of children showing varying degrees of bone deformations due to vitamin D deficiency to being a very rare condition.&lt;ref name="Holick2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holick M.F. | year = 2010 | title = The Vitamin D Deficiency Pandemic: a Forgotten Hormone Important for Health | url = | journal = Health Reviews | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 267–283 | doi=10.1007/bf03391602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[Recommended Dietary Allowances|RDA]] for infants aged 0–6 months is 10&amp;nbsp;µg (400 International Units (IU))/day and for adults over 19 years of age it is 15&amp;nbsp;µg (600 IU)/day.{{mcn|date=October 2016}}

Diseases associated with a vitamin D deficiency include [[rickets]], [[osteoporosis]], and certain types of cancer (breast, prostate, colon and ovaries). It has also been associated with increased risks for fractures, [[heart disease]], [[type 2 diabetes]], autoimmune and infectious diseases, [[asthma]] and other wheezing disorders, [[myocardial infarction]], [[hypertension]], [[congestive heart failure]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]].&lt;ref name="Holick2010"/&gt;

=== Fluoride ===

Although [[fluoride]] is not considered an essential mineral, it is useful in prevention of tooth decay and maintaining adequate dental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/index.html|title=Community Water Fluoridation {{!}} Division of Oral Health {{!}} CDC|date=2018-02-21|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ada.org/en/public-programs/advocating-for-the-public/fluoride-and-fluoridation/medical-testimonials-about-fluoridation|title=Medical Testimonials about Fluoridation|website=www.ada.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1900s it was discovered that towns with a high level of [[fluoride]] in their water supply was causing the residents' teeth to have both brown spotting and a strange resistance to dental caries. This led to the fortification of water supplies with [[fluoride]] in safe amounts (or reduction of naturally-occurring levels) to retain the properties of resistance to dental caries but avoid the staining cause by [[Dental fluorosis|fluorosis]] (a condition caused by excessive fluoride intake).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of Fluoridation|url=http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/oralhealth/topics/fluoride/thestoryoffluoridation.htm|website=National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Tolerable upper intake levels|tolerable upper intake level (UL)]] set for fluoride ranges from 0.7&amp;nbsp;mg/day for infants aged 0–6 months and 10&amp;nbsp;mg/day for adults over the age of 19.

Conditions commonly associated with [[fluoride]] deficiency are dental caries and osteoporosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2280">In the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Air Force]], a '''Gold Bar Recruiter''' (GBR) is a newly-commissioned [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|second lieutenant]] who has been ordered to [[active duty]] on permissive [[Temporary duty assignment|Temporary Duty]] (PTDY) orders to assist the Professor of [[Military Science]] (or Aerospace Science, as applicable) and the Recruiting Operations Officer (ROO) with training and recruiting duties. 

This position typically begins 60 to 140 days before the [[BOLC]] B report date. A Gold Bar Recruiter adds a new perspective and energy to an [[ROTC]] battalion because of their recent familiarity with high school, college, and cadet life. If a "Gold-Bar" is in the National Guard, he/she may request extensions of their tour for up to 180 days providing their National Guard unit is willing to allow such an extension.  Active duty officers may not receive such an extension, as their position at BOLC have already been reserved through their active duty units.

"Gold Bar" refers to the insignia of a second lieutenant in the [[United States Armed Forces]]: [[:File:US-O1_insignia.svg|a single gold bar]]. The analogous position for the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] is Permissive Temporary Additional Duty (PTAD). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/News/Messages/Messages-Display/Article/896301/clarification-to-transition-permissive-temporary-additional-duty-ptad-in-suppor/|title=CLARIFICATION TO TRANSITION PERMISSIVE TEMPORARY ADDITIONAL DUTY (PTAD) IN SUPPORT OF DRAWDOWN &gt; The Official United States Marine Corps Public Website &gt; Messages Display|website=www.marines.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In societies that regard some [[race (classification of human beings)|races]] or [[ethnic group]]s of people as dominant or superior and others as subordinate or inferior, '''hypodescent''' refers to the automatic assignment by the dominant culture of children of a mixed union or sexual relations between members of different socioeconomic groups or ethnic groups to the subordinate group.&lt;ref&gt;Kottak, Conrad Phillip. "Chapter 11: Ethnicity and Race." ''Mirror for Humanity: A Concise Introduction to Cultural Anthropology''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2009, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite practice is [[hyperdescent]], in which children are assigned to the race that is considered dominant or superior.

Parallel practices include [[patrilineality]], [[matrilineality]] and [[Cognatic|cognatic descent]], which assign race according to the father, mother, or some combination, without regard to the race of the other parent.  These systems may not be mutually exclusive with hypo- and hyper-descent, since either parent (or both) might be of mixed race.

Attempts to limit (or eliminate) mixed-race populations by legal means are defined in [[anti-miscegenation laws]], such as passed by various states in the United States.

== History ==

While customs, practices and systems of belief emphasizing the value of purity of descent are arguably as old as mankind, few societies systematically codified them, or legally enforced their outcome. Practices were enforced in communities. Such was the case in classical Greece – which made clear distinctions between Greeks and Barbarians. The Roman Republic had a different pattern. While it was expansionist, and militarily and culturally aggressive, it actively encouraged the Romanisation of client kingdoms, which included intermarriage of Romans with their elite citizens and making this class citizens of Rome as reward and as exemplars.

=== Hypo/hyperdescent in Colonial-Era North America ===

The North American practice of applying a rule of hypodescent began during colonial times when indentured servants and transported convicts working at the direction of the colonists and colonial authorities were joined by Africans that from 1619 on were first taken first  from Spanish and then more and more from English or British slave ships. But while the freed captives were Christians, these individuals were classified as indentured workers.

Virginia formally enacted a 'slave code' in 1705. There is documentary evidence from the 1650s that some Virginia Negroes were serving lifelong terms of indenture. In the 1660s the Assembly stated that "any English servant that shall run away in company with any Negroes who are incapable of making satisfaction by addition of time shall serve for the time of the said Negroes absence", indicating Negroes could not 'make satisfaction' by serving longer if recaptured. This device gave legal status to the practice of lifetime enslavement of persons of African descent; in subsequent statutes the legislature defined conditions of lifetime servitude. 

But in 1655 [[Elizabeth Key]], a mixed-race woman, fought and won the first [[freedom suit]] in Virginia. Her English father had acknowledged her as his daughter, had her baptised as Christian, and, falling ill, established a legal guardian to care for her after his death, arranging a limited-term indenture for her as a girl. But the guardian sold her indenture and left the colony, and the next master did not free her. When he died, his estate claimed her and her son as slave property.&lt;ref name="Banks"&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/52/ Taunya Lovell Banks, "Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit - Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia"], 41 ''Akron Law Review'' 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed 21 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following Key's victory, Virginia established the principle in law in 1662 of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', from [[Roman law]]; that is, children born in the colonies would take the social status of their mothers. This meant that all children born to enslaved women would be born into slavery, regardless of their paternity and race. This was in contrast to English common law, by which the status of children of English subjects was determined by the father.&lt;ref name="Banks"/&gt; 

As slavery became a racial caste system, persons of only partial African ancestry and majority European ancestry were born into slavery. African descent became associated with slavery. By hypodescent, persons of even partial African ancestry were classified socially below whites. By the late 18th century, there were numerous families of majority-white slaves, such as the [[mixed-race]] children born to the slave [[Sally Hemings]] and her master [[Thomas Jefferson]]. She was three-quarters white and the half-sister of his late wife; their children, born into slavery, were seven-eighths white. Jefferson gave the four surviving children their freedom as adults; three assimilated into white society. 

The Southern author [[Mary Chesnut]] wrote in her famous ''[[A Diary from Dixie]]'', of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era, about the hypocrisy of a man's recognizing white women's children among the slaves in every household but his own.

[[Fanny Kemble]], the British actress who married an American slaveholder, wrote about her observations of slavery as well, including the way white men sexually abused slave women and left their mixed-race children enslaved.

Sometimes the white fathers freed the children and/or their mothers, or provided education or apprenticeship, or settled property on them in a significant transfer of social capital. Notable [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] examples of fathers who provided for their mixed-race children were the fathers of [[Charles Henry Langston]] and [[John Mercer Langston]] and the father of the [[Healy family of Georgia]]. (Each had a common-law marriage with a woman of partial African descent.) Other mixed-race children were left enslaved; some were sold away by their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Christine B. Hickman, "The Devil and the One-Drop Rule: Racial Categories, African Americans, and the U.S. Census", ''Michigan Law Review'', Vol: 95, March, 1997, 1175-1176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by historians and [[genealogist]]s has shown that unlike the above examples, most free African Americans listed in the first two US censuses in the Upper South were descended from relationships or marriages in colonial Virginia between white women, indentured servant or free, and African or African-American men, indentured servant, free or slave. Their unions reflected the fluid nature of relationships among the working classes before slave caste was hardened, as well as the small households and farms within which many people worked. The children of white mothers were born free. If they were illegitimate and mixed race, they were apprenticed in order to avoid the community being burdened with upkeep, but such persons gained a step in freedom.&lt;ref name="freeaa"/&gt; 

By the turn of the nineteenth century, many of these families of free African Americans, along with European-American neighbors, migrated to frontier areas of Virginia, North Carolina, and then further west. Such families sometimes settled in insular groups. Mixed-race people of African-European descent are believed to have been the origin of some isolated settlements, which have long claimed or were said to be of [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indian]] or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="freeaa"&gt;Paul Heinegg, ''[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware]'', accessed 15 Feb 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a 21st-century [[DNA]] study of a group of [[Melungeon]] families in Tennessee and Kentucky, long rumored to be descendants of Turks or Native Americans, showed they were overwhelmingly of African and European ancestry.

=== Hypo/hyperdescent in Reconstruction, late 19th century and 20th-century United States ===

By the late 1870s, conservative white Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South, even in areas where there were black majorities, largely by a process of violence and intimidation of black Republicans. The Democrats gradually imposed [[white supremacy]] in law and practice. From 1890 to 1908, beginning with Mississippi, the state legislatures passed new constitutions and laws that created barriers to voter registration by such means as the [[poll tax]], [[literacy tests]], record requirements and others. The number of voters on the rolls fell drastically and most blacks and many poor whites were [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchised]] for decades. The whites also passed [[Jim Crow]] laws, such as [[racial segregation]] of public facilities. 

African Americans and whites established the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] in 1909 to fight against legal discrimination and disenfranchisement. Each time they won a court case, for instance, against the use of [[white primaries]], white-dominated legislatures would pass new laws to exclude blacks from the political system.

In the 20th century, under influences of [[eugenics]] and racial discrimination, states enacted laws classifying persons as black who had any traceable evidence (or perception of any African ancestry). Under Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act]] of 1924, the 'One-drop' rule defined as black a person with ''any'' known African ancestry, regardless of the number of intervening generations.

The same Act established a binary classification system for vital records, classifying persons as 'white' or 'black' (Negro at the time). The latter was effectively a 'catch all' term for all people of color. Native Americans were classified as colored, l attitude to ''all'' races other than white.

In its most extreme form in the United States, hypodescent was the basis of the "[[one-drop theory|one drop rule]]", meaning that if an individual had any black ancestry, the person was classified as black. Laws were passed in southern states and others in the early 20th century, long after the end of slavery to define white and black, under associated laws for segregation: [[Tennessee]] adopted such a "one-drop" statute in 1910; [[Louisiana]]; [[Texas]]; [[Arkansas]] in 1911; [[Mississippi]] in 1917; [[North Carolina]] in 1923; [[Virginia]] in 1924; [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1927; and [[Oklahoma]] in 1931.

During this same period, [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]] retained their old "blood fraction" statutes ''[[de jure]]'', but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirtysecond) to be equivalent to one-drop ''[[de facto]].''&lt;ref&gt;Pauli Murray, ed. ''States' Laws on Race and Color'' (Athens, 1997), 428, 173, 443, 37, 237, 330, 463, 22, 39, 358, 77, 150, 164, 207, 254, 263, 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924 many "white" people in Virginia would have had some African and/or Native American ancestry, given the mixing over the centuries. At the same time that Virginia was trying to harden racial caste, African Americans were organizing to overturn segregation and regain civil rights, that had been lost to [[Jim Crow]] laws and [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchisement]] of the majority of the black community.

== Anti-miscegenation marriage laws ==
By the early 1940s, of the thirty  U.S. states that had [[anti-miscegenation laws]], seven states ([[Alabama]], [[Arizona]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Montana]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], and [[Virginia]]) had adopted the [[one-drop theory]] for rules prohibiting [[interracial marriage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, "The Color of Law", ''Northwestern University Law Review'', Spring, 1992,  Vol. 87, 955, note 96.&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a continuing social hardening of racial lines after the turn of the century, when southern states imposed legal segregation and disfranchised African Americans.

Other states applied the hypodescent rule without carrying it to the "one-drop" extreme, using instead a [[blood quantum]] standard.  For example, [[Utah]]'s anti-[[miscegenation]] law prohibited marriage between a white and anyone considered a [[negro]], [[mulatto]], [[quadroon]] (one-fourth black), [[octoroon]] (one-eighth black), [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]], or member of "the [[Malay race]]" (here referring to [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]).  No restrictions were placed on marriages between people who were not "white persons". The law was repealed in 1963.

=== Other examples of application ===
In the [[United States]], hypodescent has often defined children of mixed-race couples as black when one parents is classified as "black", or either is thought to have African descent. That practice seems to be diminishing. 

President of the United States [[Barack Obama]] is often referred to as the first Black or African-American President. He has said as a youth that he chose to identify as black and worked in community organizing in a black community. His mother and her parents were of European descent; his father and his family are sub-Saharan African from Kenya. But, in a case exemplifying the complex racial history of the United States, Obama is believed to be descended through his maternal line from [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], the first African documented historically as a slave in Virginia.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/us/obamas-mother-had-african-forebear-study-suggests.html SHERYL GAY STOLBERG, "Obama Has Ties to Slavery Not by His Father but His Mother, Research Suggests"], ''New York Times'', 30 July 2012; accessed 30 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The genealogical company Ancestry.com sponsored a study of his family history and documented this connection. Punch's descendants increasingly married white and are believed to have been accepted as white by the early 18th century.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Since the 1960s particularly and the rise of the [[Black Power]] movement, many members of the African-American community have emphasized that mixed-race individuals of African descent should identify as black in order to maximize their political power as a group in the United States. Leaders say they were historically discriminated against as black by whites, so should identify as black to assert their power in number. 

In the US, people have historically less consistently apply hypodescent in intermarriage between whites and persons of other racial groups, such as Native Americans, and Asians.{{cn|date=June 2017}} There was certainly discrimination against persons of mixed European and Native American, and European and Asian ancestry, however. 

But hypodescent is not practiced only by persons of European ancestry. In [[Omaha, Nebraska]], whites have celebrated [[Logan Fontenelle]], a mixed-race man of the late 19th century who served as interpreter for a major treaty between the [[Omaha Nation]] and the United States that ceded most of their land before they moved to a reservation. Whites referred to Fontenell as chief of the Omaha, and he was one of the signatories of the treaty along with Omaha chiefs, perhaps because he spoke English. Whites named various places in the city of Omaha after Fontenelle. 

But among the Omaha, Fontenelle was considered a "white man" because his father was white, and he was never recognized as a recognized chief. As the Omaha had a [[patrilineal]] [[kinship]] society, hereditary chieftainship and descent were passed through the male line. A person whose father was white was not considered Omaha unless he was formally adopted by a male Omaha member.&lt;ref name="TrueLogan"&gt;[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/collections/vol19/v19p064.htm  Melvin Randolph Gilmore, "The True Logan Fontenelle"], ''Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society,'' Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, p. 64, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
[[Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]], in ''[[The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution]]'' (2004), observes in passing that in the United States and Great Britain, societies have developed something like "genetic dominance" in our use of language to identify children from mixed-race unions. He notes first, that people seem to be eager to embrace racial classification, even when talking about people of obviously mixed parentage; and second, that we tend not to describe people as of mixed race.  Mixed-race children of European-African unions tend to be identified as "black", in what Dawkins calls a "cultural or memetic dominant".&lt;ref name=Dawkins&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution'' (Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|401-03}} He opines that this may be a cross-cultural practice with a biological basis; that perhaps humans are genetically wired to recognize and differentiate among minor superficial differences. This is in contrast to what humans share in the "unusually high level of genetic uniformity in the human species" (compared to for example, [[chimpanzee]] [[subspecies]]).&lt;ref name=Dawkins/&gt;{{rp|405}} Scholars speculate about the evolutionary purpose of such differentiation served; it may have contributed to group solidarity when social groups were small [[tribe]]s of [[hunter gatherer]]s, lived further apart in different regions, and were divided by many cultural factors. He suggests that such differentiation may be an "information-rich way to classify people".&lt;ref name=Dawkins/&gt;{{rp|408}}

== References in culture ==
Both African-American and white authors have explored issues related to mixed race and hypodescent in fiction and non-fiction.

In the novel ''[[Pudd'nhead Wilson]]'', by [[Mark Twain]], the character of the enslaved woman Roxy is described as "Negro", although she has considerable white ancestry and could [[passing (racial identity)|pass for white]]. Her son is born into slavery and is 1/32 part black. He is mistakenly switched in infancy with the white son of the master's household, and each grows up to fulfill his social role. 

The US late-19th century author [[Charles Chesnutt]], who grew up free in Ohio and was of mixed African-European ancestry, wrote numerous stories set in the post-Civil War South. He explored the issues encountered by persons of mixed race, in some cases relating what became known as the [[tragic mulatto]] genre. 

''[[Passing (novel)|Passing]]'' is a 1929 novel by [[Nella Larsen]], dealing with mixed-race African-American women who choose alternate paths for marriage and identity.

In the musical ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927), a white man is married to a [[mixed-race]] woman passing for white. He is accused by the sheriff of violating the state's anti-miscegenation laws. The white man pricks his wife's finger with a knife, swallows a drop of blood, then tells the sheriff "I'm no white man – I've got negro blood in me."  The sheriff lets him off.

[[Sinclair Lewis|Sinclair Lewis's]] novel ''[[Kingsblood Royal]]'' uses hypodescent and the "one drop" principle as principal plot elements.

Numerous memoirs have been published by African Americans who explore growing up as mixed race with a white parent, such as ''[[The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother]]'' by [[James McBride (writer)|James McBride]].  Bliss Broyard, in ''[[One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life]]'', wrote about her father [[Anatole Broyard]]'s decision to live and work as a writer, rather than a black writer, largely separating from his mixed-race, [[Louisiana Creole]] family. He married a white woman of Swedish descent and their children appear white.

In his self-published book [https://books.google.com/books/about/Hypodescent.html?id=i1KscQAACAAJ ''Hypodescent - Discovering You Are Not Black: A Memoir''] (2010), Logan Allerton, adopted as an infant, describes being classified at birth as African American because of his darker skin. He was adopted and raised by an African-American family in Chicago, where he was often questioned as a child about his ethnic identity. Later in life, based on research and DNA testing, he learned that his biological ancestry was European.

'''Insurance in Iraq''' refers to the [[insurance]] industry in [[Iraq]] and charts its history from the Babylonians of [[Mesopotamia]] through to the present day, by highlighting key events (such as the signing of treaties and laws), people and companies that influenced its formation and current shape.

==History==

===Ancient times===

Mechanisms for dealing with [[risk]] in Iraq can be traced to the ancient [[Babylonians]] and the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. This established a system of [[bottomry]] (whereby the ship master would take a loan and then use the ship itself as collateral against it) and is seen as an early form of merchant and marine insurance dating back to around 1772 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;http://history.swissre.com/item_detail.php?id=5&amp;comefrom=item*71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theactuary.com/archive/old-articles/part-6/insurance-3A-a-brief-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance under Ottoman laws===

Two pieces of legislation are noteworthy during this period, firstly the Ottoman Commercial Law (9 August 1904), followed by the supplementary Ottoman Insurance Companies Act (1905).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almosul.com/Heritage/History/IraqHistory/Begining_of_Insurance_Iraq.pdf The beginnings of insurance and regulation of insurance activity in Iraq – an overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these, there is no evidence to suggest commercial, institutional insurance activity was known in Iraq until at least after the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty]] of October 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Basim A Faris, Insurance &amp;Reinsurance in the Arab World (London: Kluwer Publishing, 1983), p43.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, by 1928 only 3 insurance companies were known to be operating in Iraq, under the Ottoman laws,&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Batatu, The Old Social Classes and New Revolutionary Movements of Iraq, (London, al-Saqi Books, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; one of which was the General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation (now Aviva Insurance Ltd.).&lt;ref&gt;http://heritage.aviva.com/our-history/companies/a/aviva-insurance-ltd/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign agencies and the birth of modern insurance in Iraq (1936-1964)===

The Insurance Companies Act was brought into effect on 1 April 1936. It was the first Iraqi law passed to specifically regulate the industry. Egypt's Al-Chark Insurance Company (part of Misr Insurance since 2007&lt;ref&gt;"Misr Holding : Company Profile" (PDF). Misrholding.co&lt;/ref&gt;) was the first to set up an agency in Transjordan towards the end of the 1940s and was one of the first in Iraq under the 1936 law, where [[Edward M Fram|Edward Fram]] acted as their first representative.&lt;ref&gt;https://iraqinsurance.wordpress.com/2012/05/13/insurance-agencies-in-iraq-in-1936/&lt;/ref&gt; Other insurance pioneers at this time included [[Shafiq Ades]] and [[Andrew Weir, 1st Baron Inverforth]]&lt;ref&gt;Misbah Kamal. "Insurance Agencies in Iraq 1936". Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalisation of the industry (1964)===

In 1960, the introduction of the Insurance Firms and Agents Law No. 49 replaced the aforementioned law of 1936. By the time of the nationalisation of the industry in 1964, there were still just 15 branches and agencies of regional (Arab) and foreign insurance companies across Iraq. These included the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://iraqshistory.blogspot.co.uk/2008/08/insurance-in-iraq-in-arabic-english.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*l Ittihad Al Watani (L’ Union Nationale), General Insurance Co for the Near East, S.A.L.
*2 Compagnie Libanaise d’Assurance
*3 Al-Chark Insurance Company
*4 Misr Insurance Company
*5 Arabia Insurance Company
*6 Royal Insurance Company
*7 Atlas Insurance Company
*8 London Provincial Marine &amp; General Insurance Company
*9 Sun Insurance Office
*10 Guardian Assurance Company
*11 Société l'Union des Assurances de Paris
*12 Provincial Assurance
*13 American Life Insurance Company
*14 New India Insurance Company
*15 National Insurance Company of New Zealand

In 1966, two years after the nationalisation was completed, Clement Shammas was appointed by Iraq’s then Prime Minister [[Abdul Rahman al-Bazzaz]] as the head of the newly formed Iraqi Insurance Organisation (abolished in 1988). Under the Baath Party in 1997, Law No. 49 (1960) was itself repealed handing the Iraqi Ministry of Finance the authority to oversee all insurance and reinsurance activities in Iraq. At this time, private insurance companies were also allowed to form and the first such company, Dar Al-Salam Insurance Co, was established in 2000 &lt;ref&gt;http://open_jicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/1000008676.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day market==

===Post-Baathist insurance (2003 - present)===

The current legislation is the Insurance Business Regulation Law (2005) drafted under the guidance of USAID/BearingPoint Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdaca883.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of the size of the current industry in Iraq, but using gross written premiums as a guide, the 2013 figure was in the region of $300–480million (with $240–400 million from state-owned companies and $60–80 million from privately owned ones).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3SMvIbNCYI8C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=how+much+is+iraqi+insurance+industry+worth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ME9ym6bc7r&amp;sig=MuU541-79oka1f0xlNhSj7ZgR8w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3_LPJ7MnOAhVUF8AKHdY4CYkQ6AEIMDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20much%20is%20iraqi%20insurance%20industry%20worth&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The [[Iranian Parliament]] passed a law as “Supporting Islamic Revolution Of Palestine” in 1990. According to this law, the Islamic Republic of Iran supports oppressed people of Palestine; as well as this, it assigns a task for the boards of the directors of Iranian Parliament to extend its support (in different ways) for [[Palestinians]] and to hold conference(s) till Palestinians regain their rights.&lt;ref name="Fars" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://icpalestine.parliran.ir/icp/fa/Content/_/%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86%20%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA%20%D8%A7%D8%B2%20%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8%20%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%20%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%85%20%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%DB%8C%D9%86%2013950824 The law of supporting Palestinians Islamic Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, it is the founder and member of the Council of the Platform of Trade Unions of Nations Without a State. On the other hand, it is an active member of the Federation of Internationally Recognized Catalan Organizations (FOCIR) and participates in several social platforms such as Som Escola, Catalan Board for Peace and Human Rights in Colombia or International Action for Peace.

In 1987-88 he was General Secretary Jordi Fayos i López. The union entered into crisis in 1986. In 1987 the CSTC was formally dissolved but a part of its militancy, located on the [[far left]], founded the [[Coordinadora Obrera Sindical]] (COS). Between 1987 and 1989, there were various divisions that passed mainly to [[Workers' Commissions]]. The [[1990]] was renamed Intersindical-CSC.

Since 2004, the union was redirected towards left-wing and pro-independence positions. Between [[1998]] and [[2013]], the secretary was [[Isabel Pallarès]], and as of 6 April, she was charged until now secretary of union action [[Carles Sastre]].

In 8 November 2017, the Intersindical-CSC organized, among other pro-independence organizations, a general strike.&lt;ref&gt;https://elmon.cat/politica/intersindical-csc-no-descarta-vaga-general-motivacions-no-falten&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The  Intersindical-CSC is a pro-independence and class-based trade union that groups all the productive sectors. It is structured in federations and areas: the Federation of Services, the Federation of Public Administrations, the Federation of Industry, the Federation of Education, the Area of Health, the Youth Space and the Area of International Solidarity.

{{Spanish name|Figueres|Ferrer}}
'''José María Hipólito Figueres Ferrer''' (25 October 1906 – 8 June 1990) served as [[List of Presidents of Costa Rica|President of Costa Rica]] on three occasions: 1948–1949, 1953–1958 and 1970–1974. During his first term in office he abolished the country's [[Military of Costa Rica|army]], nationalized its banking sector, and granted women and afrodescendents the right to vote, as well as access to Costarrican nationality to people of African descent. He was a good friend of the [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], [[Luis Muñoz Marín]], praising his political achievements in one of his essays.

==Early life==
Figueres was born on 25 October 1906 in [[San Ramón (canton)|San Ramón]] in [[Alajuela province]]. The locations are significant, according to his best biographer, because his parents came from a world of wide ambition that most Costa Ricans envied, and he was born in a nation that put a high value on his impeccable Spanish background. Figueres was the eldest of the four children of a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] doctor and his wife, a teacher, who had recently immigrated from [[Catalonia]] to [[San Ramón, Costa Rica|San Ramón]] in west-central Costa Rica.

Figueres' first language was [[Catalan language|Catalan]], as he talked to his parents in this language.

==Early business career==
After four years of work and study in the United States, Figueres returned to the country in 1928 and bought a farm in Tarrazú. He named the farm, with a certain degree of foresight, La Lucha sin Fin (the struggle without an end).&lt;sup id="fn_10_back"&gt;[[#fn 10|10]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Figueres became a successful coffee grower and rope manufacturer, employing more than 1,000 sharecroppers and factory laborers. Describing himself as a "[[farmer]]-[[socialist]]", he built housing and provided medical care and recreation for his workers and established a community vegetable farm and a dairy with free milk for workers' children.&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

His sharecroppers could either sell [[hemp]] grown on his plantation to him at market price for use in his rope factory, or sell it elsewhere if they were offered a better price.&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Political career==

===Return to Costa Rica, the Caribbean Legion, and the Costa Rica Civil War (1944–1948)===
{{main article|Costa Rican Civil War}}

When Figueres returned to Costa Rica in 1944 from being exiled in Mexico, he established the Democratic Party, which a year later transformed into the Social Democratic Party. The party was intended to be a counterweight to the ruling National Republican Party (PRN), led by former President [[Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia|Calderón]] and his successor [[Teodoro Picado Michalski|Teodoro Picado]]. The highly controversial Calderón had angered Costa Rican elites, enacting a large social security retirement program and implementing national healthcare.  Calderón was accused  of corruption by the elites, providing a rallying cry for Figueres and the Social Democratic Party.&lt;sup id="fn_18_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|18]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Figueres began training the [[Caribbean Legion]], an irregular force of 700. Figueres launched a revolution along with other landowners and student agitators, hoping to overthrow the Costa Rican government. With plans of using Costa Rica as a base, the Legion planned next to remove the three Central American dictators.  Washington officials closely watched the Legion's activities, especially after Figueres carried out a series of terrorist attacks inside Costa Rica during 1945 and 1946 that were supposed to climax in a general strike, but the people did not respond.&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_8_back"&gt;[[#fn 8|8]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_9_back"&gt;[[#fn 9|9]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Former President [[Rafael Angel Calderón Guardia|Calderón]] supporters prevented and invalidated the 1 March 1948, presidential election in which [[Otilio Ulate Blanco|Otilio Ulate]] had allegedly defeated [[Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia|Calderón]] in his second term bid with fraud. In March–April 1948, the protests over the election results mushroomed into armed conflict, then into revolution. Figueres defeated Communist-led guerrillas and the Costa Rican Army, which had joined forces with President [[Teodoro Picado Michalski|Picado]].&lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_8_back"&gt;[[#fn 8|8]]&lt;/sup&gt;

With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day civil war was the bloodiest event in 20th-century Costa Rican history.

===Figueres as the provisional president (1948–1949)===
After the civil war Figueres became President at the head of a provisional junta known as the "Junta Fundadora" (Founding Council) that held power for 18 months. During that time he took several actions:

* abolishing the army  (as a precaution against the militarism that has perennially thwarted or undercut democracy in Central America)&lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]]&lt;/sup&gt; Figueres said he was inspired to disarm Costa Rica by [[H.G. Wells]] "[[The Outline of History|Outline of History]]", which he read in 1920 while at MIT. "The future of mankind cannot include armed forces. Police, yes, because people are imperfect.", he declared. Ever since, Costa Rica has had no army and has maintained a 7,500-member national police force for a population of over four million.&lt;sup id="fn_6_back"&gt;[[#fn 6|6]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* enabled women and illiterates to vote&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* put into effect basic welfare legislation&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* nationalised banks&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* outlawed the Communist Party&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* directed the writing of a new constitution&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* guaranteed public education for all&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* gave citizenship to black immigrants' children&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* established civil service to eliminate the [[spoils system]] in government&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;, and

"In a short time, we decreed 834 reforms that completely changed the [[wikt:physiognomy|physiognomy]] of the country and brought a deeper and more human revolution than that of Cuba", Figueres said in a 1981 interview.&lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Once Figueres gained control, the legislation he passed regarding [[social reform]] for his Second Republic of Costa Rica was not that much different from Calderón's proposals. In fact, it is believed by some historians (such as [[David LaWare]]) that Figueres' social reforms were more or less the same as Calderón's Labor Code of 1943, only Figueres had gained the power with which to enact the laws upon the whole country with the complete support of virtually all the country. Both of these leaders' programs were in many cases exactly like the ones Franklin D. Roosevelt passed during the Great Depression that helped lift the US out of its own economic slump and social decline it had faced in the 1930s.  Figueres admired what president Franklin D. Roosevelt did, however he noted that "the price he had to pay to get his programs through was to leave the business community free overseas to set up dictatorships and do whatever they liked...What we need now is an international New Deal, to change the relations between North and South."&lt;sup id="fn_6_back"&gt;[[#fn 6|6]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_14_back"&gt;[[#fn 14|14]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Figueres stepped down after 18 months, handing his power over to [[Otilio Ulate]], and ever since Costa Ricans have settled their arguments constitutionally.&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;

"Your hands are not clean to fight communism when you don't fight dictatorships", Figueres told American interviewers in 1951. "It seems that the United States is not interested in honest government down here, as long as a government is not communist and pays lip service to democracy."&lt;sup id="fn_6_back"&gt;[[#fn 6|6]]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Second term as President (1953–1958)===
In 1953, Figueres created the [[Partido Liberación Nacional]] (PLN), the most successful party in Costa Rican political history, and was returned to power in the 1953.&lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]], &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id="fn_10_back"&gt;[[#fn 10|10]]&lt;/sup&gt;  He has been considered to be the most important political figure in Costa Rica's history.

During his various terms in office he nationalized the banking system and contributed to the construction of the [[Panamerican Highway]] that goes across Central America. He promoted the private industry sector and stimulated the national industry sector. He succeeded in energizing the country's middle class creating a strong buffer between the upper and lower classes.

What most alarmed U.S. officials was Figueres's material and moral support for the [[Caribbean Legion]], even though Figueres had obviously lost interest in the Legion after he gained power. But Figueres still criticized U.S. support for the dictators, going so far as to boycott the 1954 inter-American meeting because it was held in [[Caracas]], where President [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez|Marcos Pérez]] of Venezuela held sway.&lt;sup id="fn_8_back"&gt;[[#fn 8|8]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_9_back"&gt;[[#fn 9|9]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Figueres happily cooperated with North American military plans.  After the United States established the [[School of the Americas]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to train Latin American officers in Anti-Communist techniques, more Costa Rican "police" graduated from the School between 1950 and 1965 than did officers of any other hemispheric nation except Nicaragua.&lt;sup id="fn_8_back"&gt;[[#fn 8|8]]&lt;/sup&gt;

The [[Republic of China]] awarded him the "Shining Star" in 1955.

In 1957, an assassination plot by dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo|Rafael Trujillo]] ([[Dominican Republic]]) was uncovered.

===Border war with Somoza's Nicaragua (1954–1955)===
Figueres's support for the [[Caribbean Legion]] nearly cost him his job during this second presidency. Implicated in an invasion of Nicaragua in April 1954 by anti-Somoza exiles linked to the [[Caribbean Legion]], [[Anastasio Somoza García]] launched a counter-attack, allowing the exiled former Costa Rica president [[Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia|Rafael Calderón]] to invade Costa Rica in January 1955.

Figueres had played a dangerous game, but he had also abolished the Costa Rican army, which forced him to appeal to the [[Organization of American States]] to protect his country from Somoza's aggression. The OAS, with the concurrence of the U.S. representative, ordered a cease-fire and sent a delegation to Costa Rica for an on-site investigation.

At that point, Somoza realized that he had to act quickly. He called in his IOU from the CIA. He had permitted the CIA to use [[Las Mercedes Airport]], outside Managua, as a base for its P-47s during the Guatemalan intervention. Now he wanted the planes that were parked there to help him in his feud with Figueres.

On 15 January, three days after the OAS action, a [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] violated Costa Rican airspace and bombed and strafed a number of Costa Rican towns.

Figueres, alarmed by this escalation, pointed out that Costa Rica had no defense against "modern weapons" of this kind and again appealed to the OAS. The council of the organization immediately authorized the United States to sell four [[P-51 Mustang]] fighters to Costa Rica for a dollar apiece.

The State Department, responding to pressure from certain U.S. congressmen and sensing an opportunity to improve America's image in Latin America after Guatemala, came to the rescue and preserved the Caribbean's "lone democrat." Its gesture ended the "invasion", and the State Department scored one over the CIA. The Nicaraguan dictator withdrew, but not before extracting a commitment from Figueres that he would sever links with the exiles.  &lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_10_back"&gt;[[#fn 10|10]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_11_back"&gt;[[#fn 11|11]]&lt;/sup&gt;

===1958 testimony before U.S. Congress===
In 1958, during a visit to Caracas, Venezuela, U.S. Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] was spat at by [[anti-American]] protesters who also disrupted and assaulted Nixon's motorcade, pelting his limousine with rocks, shattering windows, and injuring Venezuela's foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Hate Running Loose Hits Out at Nixons | journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] | date=May 26, 1958 | pages=32–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event prompted the US Congress to create a special committee to investigate the reasons behind it. Many people were invited to speak before it, including Figueres, who testified as follows (in part) on 9 June 1958:

:"As a citizen of the hemisphere, as a man who has dedicated his public life to promote inter-American comprehension, as an educated man who knows and appreciates the United States and who has never tried to hide that appreciation to anyone, no matter how hostile he was, I deplore that the people of the Latin America, represented by a fistful of overexcited Venezuelans, have spit upon a worthy public officer who represents the greatest nation of our time. But I must speak frankly and even rudely, because I am convinced that the situation demands it: the people cannot spit at a foreign policy, which was what they tried to do. But when they have exhausted all other means of trying to make themselves understood, the only thing left to do is spitting.

:"With all due respect to Vice-President Nixon, and with all my admiration towards his conduct, which was, during the events, heroic and later noble, I have no choice but to say that the act of spitting, however vulgar it is, lacks a substitute in our language to express certain emotions.... If you’re going to speak of human dignity in Russia, why is it so hard to speak of human dignity in the Dominican Republic? Where is intervention and where is non-intervention? Is it that a simple threat, a potential one, to your liberties, is, essentially, more serious than the kidnapping of our liberties?

:"Of course you have made certain investments in the (Latin) American dictatorships. The aluminum companies extract bauxite almost for free. Your generals, your admirals, your public officers and your businessmen are treated there like royalty.

:"Like your Senate verified yesterday, there are people who bribe the reigning dynasties with millions, to enjoy the privilege of hunting in their lands. They deduct the money from the taxes they pay in the US, but it returns to the country and, when it arrives in Hollywood, becomes extravagant furs and cars that bring down the fragile virtue of female stars. And, meanwhile, our women are kidnapped by gangsters, our men are castrated in the torture chambers and our illustrious professors disappear, lugubriously, from the halls of the [[University of Columbia]], in New York. When one of your lawmakers calls this a "collaboration to fight communism", 180 million Latin Americans feel the need to spit.

:"Spitting is a despicable custom, if done physically. But what about moral spitting? When your government invited {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedro Estrada|es}}, the [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] of the Western Hemisphere, to be honored in Washington, didn’t you spit upon the face of all democrats in (Latin) America? … I can assure you that, when it comes to international economic policy, the United States seems to be willing to repeat certain errors of domestic policy that inflicted much damage in the past, including, of course, the ones that led to the great crisis of 1929.

:"We, the Latin Americans, are tired of pointing at these mistakes; especially, the lack of interest in the prices of our products. Every time we suggest a plan to stabilize prices at a fair level you answer with economy slogans, like "the law of supply and demand" or "the free market system", or with insults like "Aren’t we paying you enough money now?" We don’t beg, except in emergencies. We’re not people who will spit about merely money. We’ve inherited all the flaws of the Spanish character, but also some of its virtues.

:"Our poverty does not diminish our pride. We have our dignity. What we want is to be paid a fair price for the sweat of our people, for the impoverishment of our land when we provide a product needed by another country. That would be enough to live, to raise our own capital and to carry on with our own development."

===Third presidential term (1970–1974)===
The termination of [[Alliance for Progress]] funds as well as the collapse of the [[Central American Common Market]], threatened to cripple the country's economy until Figueres discovered a new market by selling 30,000 tons of coffee to the Soviet Union in 1972. Costa Rica then became the only Central American nation to establish diplomatic relations with Moscow.  The [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] also delivered millions of dollars to keep the economy afloat.&lt;sup id="fn_10_back"&gt;[[#fn 10|10]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_13_back"&gt;[[#fn 13|13]]&lt;/sup&gt;

When opponents of Nicaragua's Gen. [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] seized a plane in San José in 1971, the 5-foot-3 Figueres stood on the runway and pointed a submachine gun at the cabin until the hijackers surrendered.&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

He claimed that he almost ruined a 1973 Central American summit when he twitted five army generals: "Isn't it odd that all you bastards are generals, and I'm the only civilian, but I'm the only one who's ever fought a war?"&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Political connections==

===Figueres' connection with the CIA===
The CIA gave Figueres money to publish a political journal, Combate, and to sponsor the founding meeting of the Institute of Political Education in Costa Rica in November 1959. The institute was organized as a training school and a center for political collaboration for political parties of the democratic left, principally from Costa Rica, Cuba (in exile), the Dominican Republic (in exile), Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua (in exile), Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. The CIA concealed its role from most of the participants except Figueres. Its funds passed first to a [[shell organization|shell foundation]], then to the [[Kaplan Fund]] of New York, next to the [[Institute for International Labor Research]] (IILR) located in New York, and finally to [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]. Socialist leader [[Norman Thomas]] headed the IILR. After the CIA connection was revealed, Thomas maintained that he had been unaware of it, but the IILR's treasurer, Sacha Volman, who also became treasurer of the institute in San José, was a CIA agent. The CIA used Volman to monitor the institute, and [[Cord Meyer]][https://web.archive.org/web/20051208042339/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKmeyerC.htm]{{Better source|reason=Spartacus is not a reliable source per various discussion on WP:RSN|date=January 2013}}  collaborated directly with Figueres.&lt;sup id="fn_11_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|11]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Mr. Figueres himself acknowledged in 1981 that he had received help from the Central Intelligence Agency.

"At the time, I was conspiring against the Latin American dictatorships and wanted help from the United States", he recalled. "I was a good friend of [[Allen Dulles]]."

"Anyway", Mr. Figueres went on, "the C.I.A.'s Cultural Department helped me finance a magazine and some youth conferences here. But I never participated in espionage. I did beg them not to carry out the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, which was madness, but they ignored me." &lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Cord Meyer came to San José sometime in the summer of 1960. He and Figueres created the [[Inter-American Democratic Social Movement]] (INADESMO), which was nothing more than a front. A flier describing the idealistic purpose of INADESMO carried the same post office box as Figueres's personal letterhead. The INADESMO setup enabled Meyer to disburse funds more directly, without having to bother with conduits or the accounting procedures of the institute. For example, INADESMO contributed $10,000 to help finance the [[First Conference of Popular Parties of Latin America]] in Lima, Peru, in August 1960.

The following May, Meyer returned to San José for a more urgent purpose. In the wake of the Bay of Pigs failure, he provided Figueres with INADESMO funds to sponsor a meeting at his estate, 'La Lucha', (12–20 May) between the leaders of the principal Dominican exile movements, [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] and [[Horacio Ornes]]. With Figueres as sponsor, Bosch and Ornes agreed to form a coalition government in anticipation of the overthrow of dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]]. As the United States moved to rally the hemisphere against Fidel Castro, Trujillo had become expendable, because the United States needed to demonstrate that it opposed all dictators, not just those on the left.

For over a year, the CIA had been in contact also with dissidents inside the Dominican Republic who argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove Trujillo. The CIA station in Ciudad Trujillo (now [[Santo Domingo]]) had encouraged the dissidents and actually delivered to them three pistols and three carbines "attendant to their projected efforts to neutralize Trujillo." Because the Bay of Pigs failure created an uncertain situation, the United States tried to put the brakes on this operation and refused to pass along additional weapons to the dissidents which the Dominican station already had, specifically M-3 machine guns. The U.S. [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]], meeting on 5 May, "noted the President's view that the United States should not initiate the overthrow of Trujillo before [knowing] what government would succeed him."

On 30 May, Trujillo was ambushed and assassinated. The same "action group" with whom the CIA had been in contact and to whom it had delivered pistols and carbines carried out the attack. According to the 1975 report of the [[Church Committee]], there was "no direct evidence" that CIA weapons had been used in the assassinations and the effect of the Bosch-Ornes pact upon the events that transpired remains a matter for speculation. Nonetheless, the CIA described its role in "changing" the government of the [[Dominican Republic]] "as a 'success' in that it assisted in moving the [[Dominican Republic]] from a totalitarian dictatorship to a Western-style democracy." Bosch himself was elected president of the Dominican Republic. [[Sacha Volman]] followed him there, establishing a new "research and publication center" and taking with him the CIA funding that used to go to Figueres in Costa Rica. Though one cannot prove that there was a coordinated link between the external and internal opposition groups, [https://web.archive.org/web/20051208042339/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKmeyerC.htm Cord Meyer]{{Better source|reason=Spartacus is not a reliable source per various discussion on WP:RSN|date=January 2013}}  was in a position to know what both elements were doing.&lt;sup id="fn_11_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|11]]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Relationship with Cuba===
Figueres also opposed the dictatorial regime in pre-Castro Cuba and went so far as to dispatch a planeload of weapons for Cuban insurgents led by the young Fidel Castro, a member of [[Caribbean Legion]]. But soon after the 1959 success of the [[Cuban Revolution]], he and Mr. Figueres had a falling out over the growth of Communist influence on the island.&lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]]&lt;/sup&gt; In March, 1959, Figueres was invited to Havana, and during a public speech, he warned Castro about the ideological deviations he had observed in Cuba, and immediately the microphone was taken from him.  Figueres supported John F. Kennedy's [[Alliance for Progress]] but not the C.I.A.'s clandestine wars with Cuba.&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Robert Vesco, fugitive U.S. financier ===
Figueres was stubborn about his blunders, most notably his most controversial decision to grant asylum to [[Robert Vesco]], the fugitive U.S. financier, accused of looting millions of dollars from the [[Investors Overseas Service|Investors Overseas Service, Ltd.]] (IOS) mutual funds in the 1970s. Mr. Vesco not only had a personal and business relationship with Mr. Figueres but he also made contributions to the campaign coffers of both leading political parties in the 1974 elections. Figueres made it clear, however, that he would not hesitate to extradite Vesco if the United States requested it. Figueres tried to intervene with president Jimmy Carter on Vesco's behalf. In the resulting political uproar in Costa Rica, Figueres' party lost the 1978 presidential election. Mr. Vesco fled Costa Rica after the Presidential elections of 1978 were won by [[Rodrigo Carazo Odio|Rodrigo Carazo]], who had vowed to expel him.  &lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]], &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fn_6_back"&gt;[[#fn 6|6]]&lt;/sup&gt;

In an interview in 1981, Figueres said that Vesco had "committed many stupidities" but added:

"I have always defended asylum and would protect him again if I could because I never abandon my friends. The only thing that pains me is that some friends thought I personally benefitted from Vesco."

Earlier, in a 1973 interview,  Figueres said that he had been introduced to  Vesco in Costa Rica in 1972 and that Vesco had then arranged for the investment of $2.15&amp;nbsp;million in Sociedad Agricola Industrial San Cristobal, S.A.

The financially troubled company was founded by Figueres and owned by him and others. It had diverse operations in agriculture and its 3,000 employees made it the fourth largest employer in Costa Rica.&lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Career after presidency==
Figueres was well liked and received in many Latin American countries for his center-left ideals. He has been called one of the greatest contributors to the Social Democratic ideology.

After the presidency, as an acknowledged elder statesman, Figueres became a roving ambassador for subsequent administrations.&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Americans were shocked by that series of hostile demonstrations during U.S. Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]]'s "goodwill" tour of Latin America in 1958. They climaxed in May in [[Caracas]], Venezuela, where a mob stoned and spat upon the vice president's motorcade and threatened his life. At the invitation of U.S. Representative [[Charles O. Porter|Charles Porter]] of Oregon, Figueres (at the time, just out of office) came to Washington to [[José Figueres Ferrer#1958 testimony before U.S. Congress|explain what had caused these events]].

"People cannot spit on a foreign policy", Figueres told a House committee, "which is what they meant to do." Figueres insisted that Latin America supported the United States in the cold war, but he asked, "If you talk human dignity to Russia, why do you hesitate so much to talk human dignity to the Dominican Republic?" He testified that the United States must change its policy in Latin America and that it could not sacrifice human rights for "investments."

Figueres backed the leftist [[Sandinista revolution]] in neighboring [[Nicaragua]] that overthrew dictator [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] in 1979.  He railed against U.S. policy when the United States supported Nicaragua's [[Contras|Contra]] guerrillas.&lt;sup id="fn_2_back"&gt;[[#fn 2|2]],&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

A proposal by his supporters for a fourth presidential term in the 1980s was quickly crushed.&lt;sup id="fn_10_back"&gt;[[#fn 10|10]]&lt;/sup&gt;

"This is an exemplary little country. We are the example for Latin America", Figueres told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in a 1986 interview. "In the next century, maybe everyone will be like us."&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Private life==
Figueres married [[Henrietta Boggs]] of Alabama in 1942. They had two children, Muni and José Martí, before the marriage ended in divorce in 1952. He later married [[Karen Olsen Beck]] of New York. They had four children, José María, Karen Christiana, Mariano and Kirsten. His wife was a member of the country's Legislative Assembly.

His son, [[José María Figueres]], also served as president from 1994 to 1998. His daughter, Muni Figueres Boggs, is the current Ambassador from Costa Rica to the United States. His other daughter, [[Christiana Figueres]], is a Costa Rican diplomat who served from 2010 to 2016 as the Executive Secretary of the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), and is widely considered to be the architect of the [[Paris Agreement]].

==Tributes to José Figueres==
:''[[New York Times]]'':
:If Costa Rica has eluded the familiar afflictions of Central America – war, poverty and repression – much of the credit belongs to Jose Figueres Ferrer, a fighter for democracy who died recently at the age of 83.

:It was he who took the bold step of dissolving Costa Rica's army nearly 40 years ago. He later remarked with justifiable pride that such reforms gave Costa Rica ''a deeper and more human revolution than that of Cuba.''

:That it was: Costa Rica has shown by example how a farewell to arms can make practical as well as moral sense.&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;

:''[[Los Angeles Times]]'':
:Former Costa Rican President Jose Figueres, considered the father of peaceful modern democracy in his country and one of the most colorful elder statesmen of the Western Hemisphere, died Friday.&lt;sup id="fn_3_back"&gt;[[#fn 3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

:''[[New York Times]]'':
:Mr. Figueres was 5 feet 3 inches tall and was given to airy philosophizing. ''I am what you might call a farmer-philosopher'', he said to an interviewer in 1973, during his last term. But repeatedly, in times of crisis, he stood out as a man of action. It has been said in Costa Rica that once while President he appeared at an airport carrying a submachine gun to put a stop to a hijacking.&lt;sup id="fn_4_back"&gt;[[#fn 4|4]]&lt;/sup&gt;

:''[[Newsday]]'' (New York):
:Once there was a very tiny country, surrounded by war and killing, blessed with a good leader who decided his best legacy, after winning a civil war, would be to abolish the army, and – breaking the mold created by despots in the other small countries around him – let the people vote.

:Meet Costa Rica and its visionary former president, Jose Figueres, who, 40 years later, has earned the right to philosophize on man and government and war – and to do so without a touch of irony.&lt;sup id="fn_5_back"&gt;[[#fn 5|5]]&lt;/sup&gt;

The post-revolution '''Egyptian [[Land Reform]]''' was an effort to change [[land ownership]] practices in [[Egypt]] following the [[1952 Revolution]] launched by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]].

==Problems prior to 1952==
Prior to the 1952 coup that installed [[Muhammad Naguib| Naguib]] as President, less than six percent of Egypt's population owned more than 65% of the land in the country, and less than 0.5% of Egyptians owned more than one-third of all fertile land.&lt;ref&gt; Dr. Assem Al-Desoky's  ''Major Landowners in Egypt: 1914-1952'' (in Arabic, Dar Al-Shorouk, Cairo, 2007. quoted in ''Egypt on the Brink'' by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; These major owners had almost autocratic control over the land they owned and charged high rents which averaged 75% of the income generated by the rented land.  These high rents coupled with the high [[interest rate]]s charged by banks plunged many small [[farmers]] and [[peasants]] into debt.  Furthermore, peasants who worked as laborers on farms also suffered, receiving average wages of only eight to fifteen [[piastre]]s a day.
The combination of these circumstances led [[historian]] Anouar Abdel Malek to call the pre-reform Egyptian peasantry "an exploited mass surrounded by hunger, disease and death".&lt;ref&gt;Abdel-Malek A, p61&lt;/ref&gt;  Another historian, Robert Stephens, has compared the state of Egyptian peasants before land reform to that of French peasants before the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens R&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law Number 178==
On September 11, 1952, Law Number 178 began the process of [[land reform]] in Egypt.  The law had numerous provisions that attempted to remedy the Egyptian land problems:
*Land owners were prohibited to possess more than 200 [[feddan]]s of land.  However, fathers with more than 2 children were allowed to own 300 feddans.
*A limit on the rental rate for land was set at seven times the land tax value of the plot of land.
*All land leases were given a minimum duration of three years.
*The government established cooperatives for farmers holding less than five feddans.  The members of these cooperatives worked together to obtain supplies such as [[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and seeds as well as cooperating to transport their products to market.
*A minimum wage for [[agricultural]] workers was set at 18 piastres per day.
Additionally, the law provided for the redistribution of any land that owners held over the limits it established:
*Each affected owner would receive compensation for his excess land in government [[Government bond|bonds]] worth a total of ten times the rental value of the land.  These bonds would pay 3% interest and mature in thirty years.
*All land bought by the government would be sold to peasants though no person could obtain more than five feddans from the government.  Peasants who bought land would pay the government the cost of the land and a 15% surcharge over a period of thirty years.

Law 178 initially met opposition from Prime Minister [[Ali Maher Pasha]] who supported a limit of 500 feddans for land ownership.  However, the [[Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]] demonstrated its power by forcing him to resign, replacing him with [[Muhammad Naguib]] and passing the law.

==Modifications to land reform==
In 1958, three provisions of the land reform law were revised:
*The interest on the bonds the government used to repay owners of seized land was lowered to 1.5%.
*People who purchased land from the government were given forty years (in place of thirty) to complete repayment.
*The government surcharge to be paid by purchasers was lowered to 10%.

In 1961, the government again revised the land reform program by lowering the land ownership maximum to one hundred feddans.

==Results==
Initially, land reform essentially abolished the political influence of major land owners.  However, it only resulted in the redistribution of about 15% of Egypt's land under cultivation, and by the early 1980s, the effects of land reform in Egypt drew to a halt as the population of Egypt moved away from [[agriculture]].  The Egyptian land reform laws were greatly curtailed under [[Anwar Sadat]] and eventually abolished.

(Allegations of voter suppression)

==Examples of electoral frauds==
*[[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], an effort to secure the voting rights of former slaves, ultimately failed in the states of the former [[Confederate States of America]] as reactionary interests used [[Ku Klux Klan|violence and intimidation against freedmen]] as well as political legerdemain to disenfranchise African-Americans, including [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and so-called [[literacy test]]s, for almost a century after the [[American Civil War]], ensuring the continuing hegemony of élite agrarian interests at the expense of all other interests in the South until the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. 
* Politically enabled by the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] on March 23, 1933, [[Hitler]] arrested or murdered all MPs from the [[Communist Party of Germany]] that were unable to flee or hide, and some from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. He also intimidated most of the other MPs into supporting him. This helped the [[NSDAP]] to get the needed two-thirds-majority to pass the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] giving Hitler [[dictator]]ial powers.
*In Romania, the [[Romanian general election, 1946|heavily-rigged election]] formalized the takeover by Communists and the destruction of a multi-party democracy in 1946.
*[[Ferdinand Marcos]], once fairly elected as President of the [[Philippines]], remained in power and became increasingly [[dictator]]ial and [[kleptocracy|kleptocratic]], as he succeeded in marginalizing dissent and opposition through allegedly rigged elections. 
*Many 3rd World dictatorships and former Warsaw Pact nations held [[show election]]s in which results predictably show that nearly 100% of all eligible voters vote and that nearly 100% of those eligible voters vote for the prescribed (often only) list of candidates for office or for referendums that favour the Party in power irrespective of economic conditions and the cruelties of the government.
*[[Slobodan Milošević]] was accused of rigging both elections in 1996 and 2000 which was followed by mass popular protests. He resigned in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javno.com/en/world/clanak.php?id=189354 |title=Milosevic Resigns, People Celebrate |publisher=Javno.com |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It was widely held in the Ukrainian media that the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] election of 2004 was also hit by ballot rigging and voter intimidation on all sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/28/wukra28.xml |title=Revealed: the full story of the Ukrainian election fraud |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Both tabloid press accusations and several anecdotal public claims of [[postal vote]] fraud in both [[Birmingham]] and [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] dogged many aspects of [[United Kingdom general election, 2001]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 2005]] which were reviewed in the court of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://management.silicon.com/government/0,39024677,39129095,00.htm |title=UK voters fear election fraud |accessdate=2008-10-22 |author=Will Sturgeon |date=30 March 2005 |work=Silicon.com Law &amp; Policy |publisher=CBS Interactive Limited |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117063332/http://management.silicon.com/government/0%2C39024677%2C39129095%2C00.htm |archivedate=17 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4406575.stm |title=Judge upholds vote-rigging claims |accessdate=2008-10-22 |author= |date=4 April 2005 |work=BBC News England |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article377468.ece |title=Labour election fraud ‘would disgrace a banana republic’ |accessdate=2008-10-22 |author=Dominic Kennedy |date=April 5, 2005 |work=TimesOnline UK News |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4410743.stm |title=Voting scandal mars UK election |accessdate=2008-10-22 |author=Barnaby Mason |date=5 April 2005 |work=BBC News UK |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/elections/index.htm |title=Department for Constitutional Affairs - Elections |accessdate=2008-10-22 |author=Department for Constitutional Affairs |date= |work= |publisher=Crown Copyright}}&lt;!-- more specific URL?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/election.htm |title=Elections and Electoral Systems by Country |accessdate=2008-10-22 |author=Richard Kimber |date=7 Oct 2008 |work=Richard Kimber's Political Science Resources |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/28/wukra28.xml |title=Labour |accessdate=2008-10-22 |author= |date= |work= The Daily Telegraph|publisher= |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also claims made over postal vote fraud and intimidation at the [[UK elections, 2004|2004 European and local government elections]] in [[Birmingham]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/4406575.stm |title=Judge upholds vote-rigging claims |accessdate=2008-10-22 |author= |date=4 April 2005 |work= |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election/story/0,15803,1458341,00.html |title=New fears over postal vote fraud |accessdate=2008-10-22 |date=13 April 2005 |work=Guardian |publisher= |location=London |first1=Audrey |last1=Gillan |first2=Sandra |last2=Laville |first3=Hugh |last3=Muir}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,19809-1564522,00.html |title=Labour to halt postal vote fraud but only after election |accessdate=2008-10-22 |author= |date=April 11, 2005 |work=Times |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Honduran general election, 2017]] where considered fraudulent by a lot of citizens in the country.

In the first results the opposition candidate [[Salvador Nasralla]] was leading by more than five percent against the incumbent president (at the time 60% of the votes were counted) [[Juan Orlando Hernandez]] who was violating the constitution by reelecting himself. The Electoral council did not declare [[Salvador Nasralla]] as the winner even though the trend was irreversible, the [[Supreme Electoral Council (Nicaragua)|Supreme Electoral Council]] argued that the [[rural vote]] had not been counted yet and that this vote could change the result even though the [[rural vote]] just represents a small part of the population and with the trend already set it would make no significant change to the results. After a week the vote counting system fell and there was an informational blackout, when the system started functioning again the [[president]] was winning, even though it was mathematically impossible according to multiple mathematicians. Also allegations of [[Ballot stuffing]] and [[Voter manipulation]] were common and in some cases proved.

This is a list of [[Capital city|capital cities]] that were specially designed, planned, and built to be a [[Nation state|national]] or [[Region (geography)|regional]] capital.

! width="150" | City !! width="250" | Country 
!Date!! !width="150px" | Notes
|- 
| [[Abuja]]
|[[Nigeria]]
|1991
| In 1976, Nigeria's military government made plans for a new capital city. In 1991, it was moved from [[Lagos]] in order to provide a capital city that was independent of the three major ethnic groups, the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], and [[Hausa-Fulani]], in an area in the interior of the country. A new capital also allowed for a way to relieve the congestion and overcrowding of Lagos.
|-
| [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]
| [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] (of [[Thailand]])
|1350
| Founded 1350
|- 
| [[Baghdad]]
| [[Abbasid Caliphate]]
|762
| Victorious Abbasid rulers wanted their own capital to rule from. Choosing a site north of the defeated [[Sassanid]]'s capital of [[Ctesiphon]] (and also just north of where ancient [[Babylon]] once stood), on 30 July 762 the caliph [[Al-Mansur]] commissioned the construction of the city.
|- 
|| [[Belmopan]]
|[[Belize]] (then [[British Honduras]])
|1970
| In 1970, it was moved from [[Belize City]] after 1961's [[Hurricane Hattie]] caused extensive damage to that city.
|- 
| [[Brasília]]
|[[Brazil]]
|1960
| In 1960, it was moved from [[Rio de Janeiro]] because of overcrowding, to encourage inland growth, to make the location of the capital more regionally neutral as was stated in the Brazilian constitution in 1891, and to eliminate the vulnerability to attacks by sea. 
|-
| [[Bridgetown]]
| Barbados
|1628
| Moved from [[Holetown|James Town]] to Bridgetown in 1628, due to better topography for a better shipping harbor.
|-
| [[Canberra]]
|[[Australia]]
|1927
| Designed by the American architects [[Walter Burley Griffin]] and [[Marion Mahony Griffin]]. The site was selected as a compromise between the rival cities of Sydney and [[Melbourne]], the two largest cities in the country. Canberra is located in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), selected in southeastern [[New South Wales]]. One of the reasons that the government wanted an inland capital city was that Sydney and Melbourne were both susceptible to attacks from the sea. Canberra means "Meeting Place" in the [[Ngunnawal language]] of the local [[Ngabri]] indigenous aborigines.
|-
| [[Constantinople]]
| [[Roman Empire]]
|330
| Established by [[Constantine the Great]] to be a capital for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], after the fall of Rome to the barbarians, it became the only capital of the empire. Established on the site of old [[Byzantium]], the new city almost completely replaced the old one.
|-
| [[Fujiwara-kyō]]
|[[Japan]]
|694
| In 694, the capital was moved there from [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]], but moved out to [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in 710
|-
| [[Gaborone]]

* In 2010, Indonesia was mulling the relocation of its overcrowded capital from [[Jakarta]] to a [[Indonesian future capital city proposal|proposed new site]].
* In February 2011, the [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (2005–11)|Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan]] adopted a resolution to study moving the capital of the new Republic of [[South Sudan]] that was to be created in July of that year to a new, planned city. In September 2011, the government of South Sudan approved a project to build a new capital at [[Ramciel]] in [[Lakes (state)|Lakes]] state; it is projected that the project will take at least five years.
* [[Ciudad de la Paz]] is under construction and is expected to replace [[Malabo]] as [[Equatorial Guinea]]'s capital city.
* in March 2015, Egypt proposed building a new capital.

A '''Long Term Care Benefit Plan''' is an option to sell a [[life insurance]] policy in return for 30 to 60 percent of the policy value toward [[long term care|long term health care]].&lt;ref name=life2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lifehealthpro.com/2014/04/22/how-a-life-insurance-policy-can-fund-your-clients| title=How a life insurance policy can fund your client's long-term care| author=Chris Orestis| date=April 22, 2014| publisher=Life Health Pro| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=life3&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lifehealthpro.com/2011/05/23/alternative-solutions-to-pay-for-ltc-part-2?t=ltci&amp;page=2| title=Alternative solutions to pay for LTC, part 2| | date=May 23, 2011| publisher=Life Health Pro| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A funeral benefit payment is made to the account beneficiary when the person receiving care dies.&lt;ref name=settlement&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.settlementbenefits.com/policy-owners/faqs/questions-about-long-term-care-benefit-plans| title=Questions About Long Term Care Benefit Plans| publisher=Settlement Benefits Association| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the benefit amount is spent while the person is still alive, they are still eligible for [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref name=cefa&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cefa.fsu.edu/content/download/110537/1027460/file/Medicaid%20Final%20Report%201-19-12.pdf| title=Conversion of Life-Insurance Policies to Long-Term Care Benefit Plans in Florida| date=January 2012| publisher=Florida State University| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
People have a legal right to sell their life insurance policies.&lt;ref name=cefa/&gt; Life insurance policies are sold as Long Term Care Benefit Plans to pay for long term care, including [[assisted living]] and [[home care]] rather than a policy be surrendered or allowing it to lapse.&lt;ref name=life2/&gt;&lt;ref name=cpr&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cpreports.com/2014/06/17/how-men-can-guard-agianst-poverty-in-thier-golden-years-june-18-2014-by-chris-orestis/| title=How Men Can Guard Against Poverty in Their Golden Years| date=June 18, 2014| publisher=CP Reports| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Long Term Care Benefit Plan is also known as an Assurance Benefit Plan.&lt;ref name=life3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.payingforseniorcare.com/longtermcare/lifecare-assurance-benefit-plan.html| title=Converting Life Insurance into Long Term Care Benefits: Life Care Funding's Plan| publisher=Paying for Senior Care| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Benefit Plan is separate from a [[long term care insurance]] policy because it allows policy holders to use any form of life insurance policies to pay for long term care. The plan converts a death benefit into a living benefit.&lt;ref name=life3/&gt; Life insurance policies can be converted into a Long Term Care Benefit Plan for 30 to 60 percent of the policy amount to be used for long term care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/money/business/2014/10/05/take-steps-prepare-possible-long-term-care-costs/16757995/| title=Take steps to prepare for possible long-term care costs| author=Alex Veiga| date=October 5, 2014| publisher=The Jackson Sun| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of a life insurance policy can keep people off [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref name=insurance&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.insurancenewsnetmagazine.com/article/feds-eye-life-settlements-for-ltc-funding-2621| title=Feds Eye Life Settlements for LTC Funding| date=December 2013| publisher=Insurance News Net Magazine| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By exchanging a life insurance policy for a Long Term Care Benefit Plan,&lt;ref name=mhealth&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mhealthtalk.com/alternative-solutions-for-funding-long-term-care/| title=Alternative Solutions for Funding Long Term Care| author=Chris Orestis| date=June 29, 2011| publisher=Modern Health Talk| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the benefits go toward long term care including assisted living, home health care, and nursing homes. The conversion takes away the responsibility of [[insurance|premium payments]] from the family&lt;ref name=life3/&gt; and there is no wait period before benefits begin.&lt;ref name=mhealth/&gt; The policy transfer is subject to regulatory standards in each state. Benefits are deposited into a [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]]-insured benefit account that follows federal and state banking regulations and is held by a nationally chartered bank and trust company. The benefit payments are then made directly to the health care facility on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=insurance/&gt;

If the insured person dies before the benefit period is over, the remaining benefit account is paid to the family or beneficiary as a final expense payment.&lt;ref name=mhealth/&gt;&lt;ref name=settlement/&gt; When the benefit is spent down, the person is still eligible for Medicaid.&lt;ref name=cpr/&gt;&lt;ref name=cefa/&gt; All benefit accounts reserve either five percent of the death benefit or $5,000 (whichever is less) to provide a funeral benefit payment to the account’s [[beneficiary]].&lt;ref name=mom&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aplaceformom.com/senior-care-resources/articles/long-term-care-benefit-plan| title=How to Pay for Senior Care with Life Insurance| date=November 13, 2014| publisher=A Place for Mom| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=settlement/&gt; These Benefit Plans can be funded through companies such as [[Life Care Funding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lifecarefunding.com/| title=Home| publisher=Life Care Funding| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Lifeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thelifeline.com/| title=Home| publisher=The Lifeline Program| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
A bill written by [[Jeffrey D. Klein|State Senator Jeff Klein]] was introduced to the [[New York Assembly]] in 2008. It aimed to offset the costs of the [[New York (state)|New York]] Medicaid program by focusing on accelerated death benefits. The bill was signed into law by [[David Paterson|Governor David Paterson]] on December 14, 2010 and expanded the definition of “life insurance.” The change included the ability to provide a living benefit to pay for long term care, meaning people who have been in nursing homes for over three months can apply accelerated death benefits toward housing and care costs.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lifehealthpro.com/2011/01/05/funding-long-term-care-with-life-insurance-trend-c| title=Funding Long Term Care with Life Insurance: Trend Catches On| author=Chris Orestis| date=January 5, 2011| publisher=Life Health Pro| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) passed the Life Insurance Consumer Disclosure Model Law in 2010. Versions of the law have been considered in&lt;ref name=life/&gt; [[Oregon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/243.870| title=Long term care benefit plans| publisher=Oregon Laws.org| accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Maine]]. NCOIL aims to require a clear notice to consumers concerning the eight options available with life insurance, including accelerated death benefits and conversion to Long Term Care Benefit Plans.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; This basis for legislation requires life insurance companies to provide this information to policy owners older than 60, or if they have a terminal or chronic condition.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;&lt;ref name=insurance/&gt;

By 2013, Medicaid life settlement legislation was introduced in thirteen states, including [[California]], [[Florida]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Texas]]. It had been passed in two states. The legislation aimed to encourage the use of private-pay dollars for long term care through life insurance policy conversion into Long Term Care Benefit 
plans.&lt;ref name=insurance/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Georgia Medicaid Bill Introduced| author=Donna Horowitz| journal=The Deal| url=http://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewArticle.dl?id=100081076976#ixzz3RaPJogBU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minute Man Statue Lexington Massachusetts cropped.jpg|thumb|''The Lexington Minuteman'', a statue commemorating [[John Parker (captain)|Captain John Parker]], a commander of Massachusetts militia forces, during the [[American Revolutionary War]]]]

A '''militia''' {{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|l|ɪ|ʃ|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |date=June 2009 |title=militia, ''n''}}&lt;/ref&gt; is generally an [[army]] or some other [[Military formation|fighting organization]] of non-professional soldiers, citizens of a nation, or subjects of a state, who can be called upon for military service during a time of need, as opposed to a professional force of [[Regular army|regular]], full-time [[military personnel]], or historically, members of a warrior nobility class (e.g., [[knight]]s or [[samurai]]). Generally unable to hold ground against regular forces, it is common for militias to be used for aiding regular troops by [[skirmisher|skirmishing]], holding fortifications, or [[irregular warfare]], instead of being used in offensive campaigns by themselves. Militia are often limited by local civilian laws to serve only in their home region, and to serve only for a limited time; this further reduces their use in long military campaigns.

With the emergence of professional forces (in the form of mercenaries whose livelihood was military service) during the [[Renaissance]], Western European militias wilted; later however, they would be revived as part of Florentine [[Classical republicanism|civic humanism]], which held that professional militaries were a result of corruption, and admired the Roman model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.idehist.uu.se/distans/ilmh/Ren/civic-mil.htm|title=The Militia|last=Hörnqvist|first=Michael|website=Civic Humanism – The Florentine Legacy|publisher=Uppsala University|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The civic humanist ideal of the militia was spread through Europe by the writings of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (According to Hörnqvist, [[The Prince]], ch. 12 and 13, [[Discourses on Livy]], and [[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]].)

Beginning in the late 20th century, some militias (in particular officially recognized and sanctioned militias of a government) act as professional forces, while still being "part-time" or "on-call" organizations. For instance, the members of some [[U.S. Army National Guard]] units are considered professional soldiers, as they are trained to maintain the same standards as their "full-time" (active duty) counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Militias thus can be [[military]] or [[paramilitary]], depending on the instance. Some of the contexts in which the term "militia" is used include:
* Forces engaged in defense activity or service, to protect a community, its territory, property, and laws.&lt;ref&gt;p.7, Sumner&lt;/ref&gt;
* The entire able-bodied population of a community, town, county, or [[State (polity)|state]], available to be called to arms.
** A subset of these who may be legally penalized for failing to respond to a call-up.
** A subset of these who actually respond to a call-up, regardless of legal obligation.
* A private, non-government force, not necessarily directly supported or sanctioned by its [[government]].
* An irregular armed force enabling its leader to exercise military, economic, and political control over a subnational territory within a sovereign state (See: [[Warlord]]).
* An official reserve army, composed of citizen [[soldier]]s. Called by various names in different countries, such as the [[Army Reserve (disambiguation)|Army Reserve]], [[National Guard (disambiguation)|National Guard]], or [[state defense force]]s.
* The national [[police]] forces in several former [[communist states]] such as the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, but also in the [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. The term was inherited in [[Russia]] and other former [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries, where they are known as ''[[militsiya]]''.
* In [[France]] the equivalent term "[[Milice]]" has become tainted due to its use by notorious [[collaborationism|collaborator]]s with [[Nazi Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
* A '''select militia''' is composed of a small, non-representative portion of the population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Militia and the Constitution: A Legal History |author1=Fields, William S. |author2=Hardy, David T. |journal=Military Law Review |date=Spring 1992 |quote="Charles II demobilized the army, keeping only troops that he felt would be loyal to the new regime...Charles's "select" militia was composed only of a small part of the population..." |url=http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/FieldsAndHardy.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410100242/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/FieldsAndHardy.html |archivedate=2008-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; often politicized.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Etymology==
''Militia'' derives from [[Latin language|Latin]] roots:
* ''miles'' /miːles/ : soldier&lt;ref name="Charlton T. Lewis 1997"&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, An Elementary Latin Dictionary, p. 505, Oxford U. Pr., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''-itia'' /iːtia/ : a state, activity, quality or condition of being&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/luschnig/Latin%20Vocab/4.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306002835/http://www.class.uidaho.edu/luschnig/Latin%20Vocab/4.htm |date=March 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/jvsickle/wrlith.htm |title=Roots of Style: Radicals of Latin (&amp; Greek) in English (JVS) |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327055950/http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/jvsickle/wrlith.htm |archive-date=2013-03-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''militia'' /mil:iːtia/: Military service&lt;ref name="Charlton T. Lewis 1997"/&gt;

The word ''militia'' dates back to ancient Rome, and more recently to at least 1590 when it was recorded in a book by Sir John Smythe, ''Certain Discourses Military'' with the meanings: a military force; a body of soldiers and military affairs; a body of military discipline&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, March 2002. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
The word Militia comes from ancient Latin, in which it meant defense service, as distinguished from a body of (armed) defenders which would be ''volgus militum''. It should be noted that the term is used by several countries with the meaning of "defense activity" indicating it is taken directly from Latin.

==Argentina==
In the early 1800s [[Buenos Aires]], which was by then the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], was attacked during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]]. As regular military forces were insufficient to counter the British attackers, [[Santiago de Liniers]] drafted all males in the city capable of bearing arms into the military. These recruits included the [[criollo peoples]], who ranked low down in the social hierarchy, as well as some slaves. With these reinforcements, the British armies were twice defeated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granaderovoluntario.com.ar]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513224611/http://www.granaderovoluntario.com.ar/ |date=May 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The militias became a strong factor in the politics of the city afterwards, as a springboard from which the ''criollos'' could manifest their political ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman Johnson, ''Workshop of Revolution: Plebeian Buenos Aires and the Atlantic World, 1776–1810'', Duke University Press, United States p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; They were a key element in the success of the [[May Revolution]], which deposed the Spanish viceroy and began the [[Argentine War of Independence]]. A decree by [[Mariano Moreno]] derogated the system of promotions involving ''criollos'',{{clarify|post-text=meaning unclear|date=May 2014}} allowing instead their promotion on military merit.

The [[Argentine Civil War]] was waged by militias again, as both federalists and unitarians drafted common people into their ranks as part of ongoing conflicts. These irregular armies were organized at a provincial level, and assembled as leagues depending on political pacts.&lt;ref&gt;Academia Nacional de la Historia Journal, ''Partes de batalla de las guerras civiles'', 1977 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system had declined by the 1870s, mainly due to the establishment of the modern [[Argentine Army]], drafted for the [[Paraguayan War]] by President [[Bartolome Mitre]].&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Angel De Marco, ''La guerra del Paraguay'', Ed. Booket, Buenos Aires, 2010. {{ISBN|978-987-580-364-0}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial militias were outlawed and decimated by the new army throughout the presidential terms of Mitre, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Sarmiento]], [[Nicolas Avellaneda|Avellaneda]] and [[Julio Argentino Roca|Roca]].&lt;ref&gt;Trinidad Delia Chianelli, ''El gobierno del puerto''.

==Armenia==
[[File:Armenian Fedayees 1890-1896.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian fedayi|Armenian ''fedayi'']] were [[Armenia|Armenian]] [[irregular military|irregular militia]] formed in the late 19th and early 20th century to defend Armenian villages.]]
{{Main article|Armenian irregular units}}
Armenian militia, or ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' played a major role in the independence of various Armenian states, including [[Western Armenia]], the [[First Republic of Armenia]], and the currently de facto independent [[Republic of Artsakh]]. Armenian militia also played a role in the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|Georgia-Abkhazia War]] of 1992–1993.

==Australia==
In the [[Colony of New South Wales]] Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] proposed a [[Militia (British Dominions and Crown Colonies)|colonial militia]] but the idea was rejected. Governor [[Ralph Darling]] felt a [[mounted police]] force was more efficient than a militia. A [[military volunteer]] movement attracted wide interest during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 21–22 Grey, Jeffrey ''A Military History of Australia'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Following Federation, the various military reserve forces of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] became the [[Citizen Military Force]] (CMF).

A citizens' militia modeled on the [[British Home Guard]] called the [[Volunteer Defence Corps (Australia)|Volunteer Defence Corps]] (VDC) was founded by the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]] (RSL) in 1940 in response to the possibility of a Japanese invasion of Australia. In the beginning, members didn't have uniforms and often paraded in business attire. They were given instruction on [[guerrilla warfare]], and later the private organization was taken over by the Australian Government and became part of the [[Australian Military Forces]] (AMF). The government supported the organization and equipped them with [[anti-aircraft artillery]]; however, they were disbanded by the end of World War II due to the fact that there was no longer a significant threat to national security.

==Austria==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00839, Österreich, Republikanischer Schutzbund.jpg|thumb|[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]] was an [[Austria|Austrian]] militia formed in 1923, one of several militias formed in post-[[World War I]] Austria.]]

During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]], a National Guard was established in Vienna. A separate but related [[Academic Legion (Vienna)|Academic Legion]] was composed mainly of students in the capital city.

After [[World War I]], multiple militias formed as [[soldier]]s returned home to their [[village]]s, only to find many of them occupied by [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|Slovene]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] forces. Especially in the southern province of [[Carinthia (province)|Carinthia]] the Volkswehr (Peoples Defense Force) was formed, to fight the occupant forces.

During the [[First Austrian Republic|First Republic]], similar to the development in [[Germany]], increasing [[radicalization]] of politics led to certain [[paramilitary]] militias associating with certain [[political parties]]. The [[Heimwehr]] (German: ''Home Defense'') became affiliated with the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] and the [[Republikanischer Schutzbund]] (German: ''Republican Defense League'') became affiliated with the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria]]. Violence increasingly escalated, breaking out during the [[July Revolt of 1927]] and finally the [[Austrian Civil War]], when the Schutzbund was defeated by the Heimwehr, [[Law enforcement in Austria|police]], [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|Gendarmerie]] and [[Austrian Armed Forces]].

After [[World War II]] the [[Austrian Armed Forces]] (Bundesheer) were reestablished as a [[conscript]] military force. A basic part of it is the militia, which is a regular reservists force of the Bundesheer, comparable to the [[National Guard of the United States|national guard]] units of the United States. The conscript soldiers of the militia have to store their military equipment at home, to be mobilized quite fast within a few days in case of emergency. The system was established during the [[Cold War]] and still exists, but the members of the militia now are volunteers only.

[[File:Push on, brave York volunteers(large).jpg|thumb|Depiction of a mortally wounded [[Issac Brock]] urging the [[2nd Regiment of York Militia|York Volunteers]] forward during the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]]. The York Volunteers were a part-time militia unit in the [[War of 1812]].]]

In Canada the title "Militia" historically referred to the land component of the armed forces, both regular (full-time) and reserve. The earliest [[Canadian militia]]s date from the beginning of the French colonial period. In [[New France]], King Louis XIV created a compulsory militia of settlers in every parish that supported French authorities in the defence and expansion of the colony. 

Following the British [[Conquest of 1760|conquest of New France]] in 1760, local militia units supported [[British Army]] regiments stationed in [[British North America]]. In addition to the Canadian militia, British regiments were also supported by locally raised regulars (including the [[40th (the 2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot|40th Regiment of Foot]], and the [[100th (Prince of Wales's Royal Canadian) Regiment of Foot]]) and [[Fencibles]] regiments. These regiments were raised through ordinary modes of recruiting, as opposed to being raised by ballot like the militia. Most militia units were only activated in time of war, but remained inactive in between. The battle honours awarded to these colonial militia regiments are perpetuated by modern regiments within the [[Canadian Army]].

Defence of [[the Canadas]] long relied on a contingent of British soldiers, as well as support from the [[Royal Navy]]. However, the Crimean War saw the diversion of a significant amount of British soldiers from [[British North America]]. Fearing possible incursions from the United States, the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] passed the [[Militia Act of 1855]], creating the Active Militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cmhg-phmc.forces.gc.ca/cmh-pmc/page-448-eng.aspx |title=The 1855 Volunteers |publisher=Government of Canada |work=Canadian Military Heritage, vol. 2 |date=1 May 2017 |accessdate=15 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Active Militia, later referred to as the [[Permanent Active Militia]] (PAM), was created as a full-time professional army, although it continued to use the label militia. After PAM's formation, the remaining sedentary militia regiments were collectively referred to as the [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]] (NPAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmhg-phmc.forces.gc.ca/cmh-pmc/page-545-eng.aspx|title=The Defence of Canada by Canadians

Prior to [[Canadian Confederation]], the colonies that made up the [[The Maritimes|Maritimes]], and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] maintained their own militias independent of the Canadian Militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmhg-phmc.forces.gc.ca/cmh-pmc/page-449-eng.aspx|title=In the Maritimes|work=Canadian Military Heritage, vol. 2|date=1 May 2017|accessdate=16 January 2018|publisher=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1853 to 1871, the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] (and the succeeding [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–1871)|Colony of British Columbia]]) periodically raised and disbanded militia units. These units were raised for specific purposes, or in response to a specific threat, real or perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Canadian Forces|last=Goulet|first=Adam|title=The Colonial Militia of Vancouver Island and British Columbia 1853–1871|journal=Canadian Military Journal|volume=14|issue=3|page=64|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Canadian Militia, 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Uniforms of the [[Canadian Militia]] in 1898. The force included the [[Permanent Active Militia]], a full-time professional land force which became the [[Canadian Army]] in 1940.]]
After the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] was signed between the Americans and British, nearly all remaining British soldiers were withdrawn from Canada in November 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmhg-phmc.forces.gc.ca/cmh-pmc/page-507-eng.aspx|title=Withdrawal of British Troops from Canada|work=Canadian Military Heritage, vol. 3|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=14 December 2017|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The departure of the majority of British forces in Canada made the Canadian militia the only major land forces available in Canada. In 1940, both components of the militia, PAM and NPAM were reorganized, and renamed the Canadian Army. NPAM was integrated into the Canadian Army as the Army's [[Primary Reserve]]. 

The term Militia is still used from then to the present day to refer to the part-time army reserve component of the [[Canadian Forces]]. Currently, Militia troops usually train one night a week and every other weekend of the month, except in the summer. Summertime training may consist of courses, individual call-outs, or concentrations (unit and formation training of one to two weeks' duration). In addition, [[Primary Reserve]] members are increasingly used for voluntary service as augmentation to the regular force overseas—usually [[NATO]] or [[United Nations]] missions. Most Canadian cities and counties have one or more militia units.

In addition to the various colonial militia units, and the regiments of the Canadian militia, in 1942, the Army's [[Pacific Command (Canadian Army)|Pacific Command]] created the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers. Intended to function similarly to the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], the Rangers were a secondary defence force, defending the coast of [[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]] from potential Japanese attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canadian Rangers: A Living History|page=32-33|last=Lackenbauer|first=P. Whitney|publisher=UBC Press|year=2013|isbn=0-7748-2455-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rangers were disbanded in September 1945, shortly after the conclusion of World War II. The legacy of the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers is perpetuated by the [[Canadian Rangers]], a component of the Primary Reserve that provides a military presence in areas where it would not be economically or practically viable to have conventional Army units - most notably [[northern Canada]].

Historically, militias of varying levels of ability have existed in China, organized on a village and [[Chinese clan|clan]] level, especially during periods of instability and in areas subject to pirate and bandit attack. When the British attempted to take control of the [[New Territories]] in 1898, they were resisted by the local militias which had been formed for mutual defence against [[Piracy|pirate]] raids. Although ultimately defeated, the militias' dogged resistance convinced the British to make concessions to the [[Indigenous inhabitants (Hong Kong)|indigenous inhabitants]] allowing them to preserve inheritance, property and marriage rights and customs throughout most of the period of the British rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.geocities.com/yingconghk/NT.htm |title=The reason behind the resistance by the New Territories inhabitants against British takeover in 1899 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027114956/http://hk.geocities.com/yingconghk/NT.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/tp_d/pdf/TaiPo%20Book%20(Eng%20Ver)/TaiPo%20Book%20(Eng%20Ver)%2008%20Chap%2003.pdf ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609192135/http://www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/tp_d/pdf/TaiPo%20Book%20%28Eng%20Ver%29/TaiPo%20Book%20%28Eng%20Ver%29%2008%20Chap%2003.pdf |date=June 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Danish Home Guard]] ({{lang-da|Hjemmeværnet}}) (HJV) is the fourth service of the [[Danish military]]. It was formerly concerned only with the defence of Danish territory but, since 2008, it has also supported Danish international military efforts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Kosovo.

{{see also|White Guard (Finland)}}
While [[Conscription in Finland|Finland employs conscription]], they do not have separate militia units: all units are organized by and under the command of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]. All men belong to the reserve until age 50 or 60 depending on rank, and may be called up in case of mobilization. Each reservist is assigned a position in a unit to be activated. However, since 2004, the FDF does have [[Territorial Forces (Finland)|territorial forces]], organized along the lines of regular infantry formations, which are composed of volunteers. Furthermore, long-range patrol units ([[Sissi (Finnish light infantry)|sissi troops]], a type of [[special forces]]) are assigned to local troops.

In history, before Finland became independent, two types of local militias existed: the White Guards and Red Guards, which were non-socialists and socialists, respectively. In the [[Finnish Civil War]] (1918) the White Guards founded the White Army, which was victorious over the Red Guards. White Guards continued their existence as a volunteer militia until the Second World War. In some cases their activity found overt political expression as in the [[Mäntsälä rebellion]]. However, in 1934 separate wartime White Guard units were dissolved and in the Second World War they served at the front, dispersed in regular units. They were dissolved as a condition of peace after the Continuation War.

==France==
The first notable militia in French history was the resistance of the [[Gaul]]s to invasion by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] until they were defeated by Julius Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliver, Kate. ''Caesar's Gallic Wars 58–50 BC.'' London: Osprey Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-96858-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries later, [[Joan of Arc]] organized and led a militia until her capture and execution in 1431. This settled the succession to the French crown and laid the basis for the formation of the modern nation of France.&lt;ref&gt;''Joan of Arc: Her Story'', by Régine Pernoud (Author), Marie-Véronique Clin (Author), Jeremy duQuesnay Adams (Translator), Palgrave Macmillan (1999), {{ISBN|0-312-22730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[French Revolution]] the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] was a political home defense militia. The [[levée en masse]] was a conscription army used during the Revolutionary and [[Napoleonic Wars]].

At the time of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the Parisian National Guard engaged the Prussian Army and later rebelled against the Versailles Army under Marshal McMahon.

Under German occupation during World War II, a militia usually called the [[French Resistance]] emerged to conduct a guerrilla war of attrition against German forces and prepare the way for the [[D-Day]] Allied Invasion of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Schoenbrun]], ''Soldiers of the Night: The Story of the French Resistance'', New American Library, 1980. {{ISBN|0-452-00612-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Resistance militia were opposed by the collaborationist [[French Militia]]—the paramilitary police force of the [[Vichy France|German puppet state of Vichy]].

Although defunct from 1871 until 2016, the French National Guard has now been reestablished for homeland security purposes.&lt;ref name="militarytimes"&gt;[http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/france-creates-national-guard-to-battle-terrorism France creates National Guard to battle terrorism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The earliest reports of Germanic militias was the system of [[Hundred (division)|hundreds]] described in 98 AD by the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] as the ''centeni.'' They were similar in nature to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ''[[fyrd]]''.
[[File:Luetzows verwegene jagd aquarellreproduktion 1900.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lützow Free Corps]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the Napoleonic Wars, the [[Freikorps]] referred to volunteer forces that fought against the French.]]
[[Freikorps]] ([[German language|German]] for "Free Corps") was originally applied to voluntary armies. The first freikorps were recruited by [[Frederick II of Prussia]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. These troops were regarded as unreliable by regular armies, so they were mainly used as sentries and for minor duties. During the Napoleonic occupation, organizations such as the Lutzow Freikorps fought against the occupiers and later joined the allied forces as regular soldiers.

However, after 1918, the term was used for [[nationalist]] [[paramilitary]] organizations that sprang up around [[Germany]] as soldiers returned in defeat from [[World War I]]. They were one of the many [[Weimar paramilitary groups]] active during that time. They received considerable support from [[Gustav Noske]], the German Defence Minister who used them to crush the [[Spartakist League]] with enormous violence, including the murders of [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] on January{{nbsp}}15, 1919. Militia were also used to put down the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919. They were officially "disbanded" in 1920, resulting in the ill-fated [[Kapp Putsch]] in March 1920. The ''Einwohnerwehr'', active in Germany from 1919 to 1921 was a paramilitary citizens' militia consisting of hundreds of thousands of mostly former servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Bruce: ''The Sa Generals and the Rise of Nazism'', Page 99.

In 1921, the Berlin government dissolved the ''Einwohnerwehr''. Many of its members went on to join the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radix.net/~bbrown/police_unit_marks.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605123951/http://www.radix.net/~bbrown/police_unit_marks.html |date=June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-033-15, Vorbeimarsch des Volkssturms an Goebbels, Berlin.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkssturm]] was a national militia formed by [[Nazi Germany]] in the last months of [[World War II]].]]
In 1921 the Nazi Party created the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), which was the first paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party and served as a Nazi militia whose initial assignment was to protect Nazi leaders at rallies and assemblies. The SA also took part in street battles against the forces of rival political parties and violent actions against Jews. From the SA sprung the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS; Protective Squadron) which grew to become one of the largest and most powerful groups in [[Nazi Germany]], which Reichsführer-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]] (the leader of the SS from 1929) envisioned as an elite group of guards. The [[Waffen-SS]], the military branch of the SS, became a de facto fourth branch of the [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref name="Benz"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Benz|title=A Concise History of the Third Reich |date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520253834|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944–1945, as World War II came to a close in Europe, the German high command deployed increasing numbers of [[Volkssturm]] units to combat duties. These regiments were composed of men, women and children too old, young or otherwise unfit for service in the Wehrmacht (German Regular Army).&lt;ref&gt;Yelton, David K., ''Hitler's Volkssturm: The Nazi Militia and the Fall of Germany, 1944–1945''. University Press of Kansas, 2002. {{ISBN|0700611924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary role was assisting the army with fortification duties and digging anti-tank ditches. As the shortage of manpower became severe, they were used as front line infantry, most often in urban settings. Due to the physical state of members, almost non-existent training and shortage of weapons, there was not much the Volkssturm could do except act like shields for regular army units. However, armed with [[Panzerfaust|Panzerfausts]] and deeply entrenched, a unit of Volkssturm could cause serious trouble for Soviet armor.{{weasel inline|date=February 2018}}

From the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840 until 1844 small detachments of [[British Army|British Imperial troops]] based in New Zealand were the only military. This changed as a result of the [[Flagstaff War]],&lt;ref&gt;Bay of Islands, Daily Southern Cross, vol 2 issue 101, 22 March 1845, p2&lt;/ref&gt; with the colonial government passing a Militia Act on 25 March 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Militia Ordinance, Daily Southern Cross, Vol 2 issue 103, 5 April 1845, p2&lt;/ref&gt; Militia units were formed in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], [[New Plymouth]], and [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]]. Service in the militia was compulsory.

Many localized militia saw service, together with British Imperial troops, during the [[New Zealand land wars]].

==Portugal==
[[Portugal]] had a long tradition in the use of militias for national defense. Between the 12th and 16th centuries, the municipal militias – composed of [[Spear (weapon)|spear]]men, [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]men, horsemen, slingers, javelineers, archers, [[crossbow]]men and later [[arquebus]]iers – constituted the main component of the [[Portuguese Army|Portuguese Royal Army]], together with smaller military forces from the [[King of Portugal|King]], the [[Military order (monastic society)|military order]]s and the feudal lords.

After some failed previous attempts, in 1570 King [[Sebastian of Portugal]] created the ''[[Ordenanças]]'', a centrally managed military territorial organization that would replace the municipal militias and became the basis of a national army. After 60 years of foreign domination (1580–1640), the ''Ordenanças'' were reorganized for the [[Portuguese Restoration War]]. The Portuguese Army was then organized in three lines, with the 2nd and 3rd being militia forces. The ''Ordenanças'' became the 3rd line and acted both as a territorial draft organization for the 1st and 2nd line troops and as a kind of home guard for local defense. The 2nd line was made of the auxiliary troops, also militia units with the role of regional defense. In the end of the 18th century, the auxiliary troops were renamed "Militias".

In the [[Peninsular War]], the Militia regiments and the Ordenanças units had an important role in the defense of the country against the Napoleonic invader army. Still in the 19th century, the Militia units also had an important role in the [[Liberal Wars]], with the majority of those troops fighting on the side of King [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]]. Besides the regular militias, a number of volunteer militia units were formed to fight on both sides of the war.

With the establishment of the constitutional regime, the old Militias and ''Ordenanças'' were replaced by a single national militia force, the National Guard. However, the National Guard revealed itself an ineffective and undisciplined force. Their units became highly politicized, being involved in a number of conspiracies and coups. The National Guard having less and less confidence from the authorities, became extinct in 1847, terminating a long tradition of national militias in Portugal.

During the 20th century, some experiments with militia type forces were made. From 1911 to 1926, the Portuguese Army was organized as a militia army. Also, in 1936, the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] regime created the [[Portuguese Legion (Estado Novo)|Portuguese Legion]] as a political volunteer militia, dedicated to the fight against the enemies of country and of the social order. From World War II, the Portuguese Legion assumed the responsibility for [[civil defense]], this becoming its main role during the [[Cold War]], until its extinction in 1974.

==Russia and the Soviet Union==
[[File:Знамя Санкт-Петербургского ополчения 1812 года.jpg|thumb|Banner of [[Saint Petersburg]] militia from [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Russia.]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
Neither the [[Russian Empire]], nor the [[Soviet Union]] ever had an organised force that could be equated to a militia. Instead a form of organisation that predated the Russian state was used during national emergencies called [[Narodnoe Opolcheniye]] (People's Regimentation). More comparable to the English [[Leidang|Fyrd]], it was a popular voluntary joining of the local полк [[Regiment#Russian Army|polk]], or a regiment, though it had no regular established strength or officers, these usually elected from prominent local citizens. Although these spontaneously created popular forces had participated in several major wars of the Russian Empire, including in combat, they were not obligated to serve for more than one year, and notably departed for home during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|1813 campaign in Germany]]. On only one occasion, during the [[military history of the Soviet Union]], the Narodnoe Opolcheniye was incorporated into the regular forces of the [[Red Army]], notably in [[List of infantry divisions of the Soviet Union 1917–1957#Narodnoe Opolcheniye divisions|Leningrad and Moscow]].

The term [[Militsiya]] in Russia and former [[Eastern bloc|Communist Bloc]] nations was specifically used to refer to the civilian [[police force]], and should not be confused with the conventional western definition of militia. The term, as used in this context, dated from post-revolutionary Russia in late 1917 and was intended to draw a distinction between the new Soviet law enforcement agencies and the disbanded Tsarist police. In some of these states militia was renamed back to police such as [[Ukraine]] while in the other states it remains such as [[Belarus]]. In Russia it was renamed to Police (in {{lang-ru|Полиция}}, ''Politsiya'') in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgianjournal.ge/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=966:russian-police-bill-to-come-into-force-next-spring&amp;catid=20:our-man-in-moscow&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Russian Police Bill to Come into Force Next Spring |publisher=Georgianjournal.ge |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sri Lanka==
The first militias formed in [[Sri Lanka]] were by Lankan Kings, who raised militia armies for their military campaigns both within and outside the island. This was due to the reason that the Kings never maintained a standing army instead had a [[Royal Guard]] during peace time and formed a militia in wartime.

When the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] who were the first colonial power to dominate the island raised local militias under the command of local leaders known as [[Mudaliyars]]. These militias took part in the many [[Portugal|Portuguese]] campaigns against the Lankan Kings. The Dutch continued to employ these militias but due to their unreliability tended to favor employing [[Switzerland|Swiss]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[mercenaries]] in their campaigns in the island.
[[File:Sri Lanka Military 0092.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sri Lanka Civil Security Force]] is a paramilitary militia tasked to serve as an [[auxiliary police|auxiliary]] to the [[Sri Lanka Police]].]]
The [[British Empire]] then ousted the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] from the coastal areas of the country, and sought to conquer the independent [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandyan Kingdom]]. In 1802, the British became the first foreign power to raise a regular unit of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] with British officers, which was named the 2nd Ceylon Regiment, also known as the [[Sepoy|Sepoy Corps]]. It fought alongside British troops in the [[Kandyan Wars|Kandyan wars]]. After the [[Matale Rebellion]] led by [[Puran Appu]] in 1848, in which a number of Sinhalese recruits defected to the side of the rebels, the recruitment of Sinhalese to the British forces was temporarily halted and the Ceylon Regiments disbanded.

In 1861, the [[Ceylon Light Infantry Volunteers]] were raised as a militia, but soon became a [[military reserve force]]. This became the [[Ceylon Defence Force]] in 1910 and consisted of militia units. These were the [[Colombo Town Guard]] and the [[Ceylon Garrison Artillery|Town Guard Artillery]] formed during the two world wars.

With the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], local villagers under threat of attack were formed into localized militia to protect their families and homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/02/17/sec02.asp |title=Security News &amp;#124; Sundayobserver.lk – Sri Lanka |publisher=Sundayobserver.lk |date=2008-02-17 |accessdate=2014-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226064150/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/02/17/sec02.asp |archive-date=2014-02-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Sri Lankan Military these militias were formed after "massacres done by the [[LTTE]]" and in the early 1990s they were reformed as the [[Sri Lankan Home Guard]].

==Sweden==
As of 2012, the [[Swedish Home Guard]] consists of 22,000 organized into 40 [[light infantry]] [[battalions]] of 300–700 Guardsmen. These battalions are then organised into [[Company (military unit)|companies]], usually one for every [[municipality]]. The main task of the battalions is to guard vital military and civilian installations throughout the country.

In 2001, the Rapid Response units numbered around 5,000 soldiers of the total of 42,000. As of 2014, the majority of the force, 17,000 out of 22,000 soldiers will be in Rapid Response units. The decrease in number of troops comes with an equal increase in quality and modern equipment. These units are motorized and are ready to be mobilized more often, than other Home Guard units. Rapid response units have more combat tasks compared to the rest of the Home Guard, including escort duties. Some battalions located near the coast also have marine companies equipped with [[Combat Boat 90]]. A few battalions have recently set up 'specialized' companies to evaluate the possibility to add new abilities to the Home Guard. These are at the time of writing eight reconnaissance/intelligence companies, four [[CBRN]]-platoons, a movcon platoon, an engineer platoon, and a [[military police]] unit.

==Switzerland==
{{Main article|Conscription in Switzerland}}

One of the best known and ancient militias is the [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss Armed Forces]]. [[Switzerland]] has long maintained, proportionally, the second largest military force in the world, with about half the proportional amount of reserve forces of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]], a militia of some 33% of the total population. The "[[militia principle]]" of public duties is central to Swiss political culture and not limited to military issues. For example in most municipalities it is common to serve as a conscript fire fighter in the [[Compulsory Fire Service|Compulsory Fire Department]].

Article 58.1 of the April{{nbsp}}18, 1999, Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation (official, French version) provides that "Switzerland has an army. It is primarily organised according to the principle of a militia." However, under the country's militia system, professional soldiers constitute about 5 percent of military personnel. In 1995, the number of soldiers was reduced to 400,000 (including reservists, amounting to some 5.6% of the population) and again in 2004, to 200,000 (including 80,000 reservists, or 2.5% of the population). However, the Swiss Militia continues to consist of most of the adult male population (with voluntary participation by women) who are required to keep an assault rifle at home and to periodically engage in combat and marksmanship training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/mil/swiss_rpt.pdf The Swiss Report: A special study for Western Goals Foundation], Gen.

The tradition was that all able-bodied males were liable to be called out to serve in one of two organisations. These were the [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse comitatus]], an ''ad hoc'' assembly called together by a law officer to apprehend lawbreakers, and the [[fyrd]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary. Second Edition 1989&lt;/ref&gt; a military body intended to preserve internal order or defend the locality against an invader. The latter developed into the militia, and was usually embodied by a [[Warrant (law)|royal warrant]].&lt;ref&gt;The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I, Pollock and Maitland, Cambridge U. Pr. (1898)&lt;/ref&gt; Service in each organisation involved different levels of preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Century Dictionary]] (1891) articles on ''posse comitatus'' and ''militia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th and 17th centuries===
With the decay of the feudal system and the military revolution of the 16th century, the militia began to become an important institution in English life. It was organised on the basis of the [[Historic counties of England|shire county]], and was one of the responsibilities of the [[Lord Lieutenant]], a royal official (usually a trusted nobleman). Each of the [[hundred (division)|county hundreds]] was likewise the responsibility of a [[Deputy Lieutenant]], who relayed orders to the [[justices of the peace]] or [[magistrates]]. Every parish furnished a quota of eligible men, whose names were recorded on [[Muster (military)|muster rolls]]. Likewise, each household was assessed for the purpose of finding weapons, armour, horses, or their financial equivalent, according to their status. The militia was supposed to be [[Muster (military)|mustered]] for training purposes from time to time, but this was rarely done. The militia regiments were consequently ill-prepared for an emergency, and could not be relied upon to serve outside their own counties. This state of affairs concerned many people. Consequently, an elite force was created, composed of members of the militia who were prepared to meet regularly for military training and exercise. These were formed into trained band regiments, particularly in the [[City of London]], where the [[Artillery Ground]] was used for training. The [[trained bands]] performed an important role in the [[English Civil War]] on the side of parliament, in marching to raise the siege of [[Gloucester]] (5 September 1643). Except for the London trained bands, both sides in the Civil War made little use of the militia, preferring to recruit their armies by other means.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}&lt;!-- Then one has to explain away their use at the Battle of Worcester: "The Parliamentary militia were sent home within a week. Cromwell, who had ridiculed 'such stuff' six months ago, knew them better now. 'Your new raised forces,' he wrote to the House, 'did perform singular good service, for which they deserve a very high estimation and acknowledgment.'" (Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition article GREAT REBELLION 59. The Crowning Mercy) --&gt;

===Militia in the British Empire===
{{main article|Militia (British Dominions and Crown Colonies)}}
[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith's]] 1624 map of the Somers Isles ([[Bermuda]]), showing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]] and related fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]] with their garrisons of militiamen]]
As successful English settlement of North America began to take place in 1607 in the face of the hostile intentions of the powerful Spanish, and of the native populations, it became immediately necessary to raise militia amongst the settlers. The militia in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] saw constant action against the [[Powhatan|Powhatan Federation]] and other native polities. In the [[London Company|Virginia Company]]'s other outpost, [[Bermuda]], fortification began immediately in 1612. A Spanish attack in 1614 was repulsed by two shots fired from the incomplete [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]] manned by [[Bermuda Militias 1612–1815|Bermudian Militiamen]]. In the Nineteenth century, ''Fortress Bermuda'' would become Britain's ''Gibraltar of the West'', heavily fortified by a Regular Army garrison to protect the [[Royal Navy]]'s headquarters and dockyard in the Western Atlantic.

In the 17th Century, however, Bermuda's defence was left entirely in the hands of the Militia. In addition to requiring all male civilians to train and serve in the militia of their Parish, the Bermudian Militia included a standing body of trained artillerymen to garrison the numerous fortifications which ringed ''New London'' ([[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]]). This standing body was created by recruiting volunteers, and by sentencing criminals to serve as punishment. The Bermudian militiamen were called out on numerous occasions of war, and, on one notable occasion, to quell rioting privateers. The 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] made Bermudian and other English militiamen ''British''. The Militia in Bermuda came to include a Troop of Horse (mounted infantry) and served alongside volunteers and (from 1701) a small body of regulars. The Militia faded away after the American War of 1812 when the [[Parliament of Bermuda]] declined to renew the Militia Act. This resulted from the build-up of the regular army [[Bermuda Garrison]] along with Bermuda's development as the headquarters and [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|dockyard]] of the [[North America and West Indies Station]] of the [[Royal Navy]], which made the militia seem excess to need. Vast sums of the Imperial defence expenditure were lavished on fortifying Bermuda during the Nineteenth Century and the British Government cajoled, implored, begged, and threatened the colonial legislature for 80 years before it raised a militia and volunteer units (in 1894 and 1894 respectively). Although the militia had historically been an infantry force, many units in Britain had been re-tasked as militia artillery from the 1850s onward due to the increased importance of the coastal artillery defences and the new militia unit in Bermuda followed suit. Titled the ''Bermuda Militia Artillery'', it was badged and uniformed as part of the Royal Artillery, and tasked with the garrison artillery role, manning coastal batteries. As in Britain, recruitment was of volunteers who engaged for terms of service, whereas the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps was organised on the same lines as volunteer rifle corps in Britain. Recruitment to the BVRC was restricted to whites, but the BMA recruited primarily coloured (those who were not entirely of European heritage) other ranks, though its officers were all white until 1953. Neither unit was reorganised in 1908 when the Militia, Volunteer Force and Yeomanry in Britain merged into the Territorial Force, but the BVRC was re-organised as a territorial in 1921 and the BMA in 1926. The BVRC name was not modified to Bermuda Rifles until 1951, however, and the Bermuda Militia Artillery (and from 1939 the Bermuda Militia Infantry) continued to be titled as militia until amalgamated with the Bermuda Rifles in 1965 to form the [[Bermuda Regiment]].

In British India, a special class of militia was established in 1907. This took the form of the [[Frontier Corps]], which consisted of locally recruited full-time auxiliaries under British officers. Their role combined the functions of tribal police and border guards deployed along the [[Military history of the North-West Frontier|North-West Frontier]]. Regional units included the [[Zhob Militia]], the Kurram Militia, and the Chagai Militia. After 1946 the Frontier Corps became part of the modern Pakistan Army.

===Political issues===
Until the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688 [[the Crown]] and Parliament were in strong disagreement. The [[English Civil War]] left a rather unusual military legacy. Both [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and [[Tories]] distrusted the creation of a large [[standing army]] not under civilian control. The former feared that it would be used as an instrument of royal tyranny. The latter had memories of the [[New Model Army]] and the anti-monarchical social and political revolution that it brought about. Both preferred a small standing army under civilian control for defensive deterrence and to prosecute foreign wars, a large navy as the first line of national defence, and a militia composed of their neighbours as additional defence and to preserve domestic order.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Consequently, the [[English Bill of Rights]] (1689) declared, amongst other things: "that the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with consent of Parliament, is against law..." and "that the subjects which are [[Protestant]]s may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law." This implies that they are fitted to serve in the militia, which was intended to serve as a counterweight to the standing army and preserve civil liberties against the use of the army by a tyrannical monarch or government.

The Crown still (in the British constitution) controls the use of the army. This ensures that officers and enlisted men swear an oath to a politically neutral head of state, and not to a politician. While the funding of the standing army subsists on annual financial votes by parliament, the [[Mutiny Act]], superseded by the Army Act, and now the [[Armed Forces Act]] is also renewed on an annual basis by Parliament.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} If it lapses, the legal basis for enforcing discipline disappears, and soldiers lose their legal indemnity for acts committed under orders.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

With the creation of the [[British Empire]], militias were also raised in the colonies, where little support could be provided by regular forces. Overseas militias were first raised in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], [[Virginia]], and in [[Bermuda]], where the [[Bermuda Militias 1612–1815|Bermuda Militia]] followed over the next two centuriesa similar trajectory to that in Britain.

===18th century and the Acts of Union===
In 1707 the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] united the [[Kingdom of England]] with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The [[Royal Scots Navy|Scottish navy]] was incorporated into the Royal Navy. The Scottish military (as opposed to naval) forces merged with the English, with pre-existing regular Scottish regiments maintaining their identities, though command of the new British Army was from England. How this affected militias either side of the border is unclear.

====British Militia====
{{Main article|Militia (Great Britain)|Militia (United Kingdom)}}
[[File:Thomas Rowlandson - A Review of the Northapmton Militia at Brackley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|A review of the [[Northampton Militia]]. Formed in 1763, it men were selected by ballot to serve for a period of time.]]
The [[Militia Act of 1757]] created a more professional force. Better records were kept, and the men were selected by ballot to serve for longer periods; specific provision was made for members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]], [[Quakers]], to be exempted, as [[conscientious objector]]s, from compulsory enlistment in the militia. Proper uniforms and better weapons were provided, and the force was 'embodied' from time to time for training sessions.

The militia was widely embodied at various times during the French and [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It served at several vulnerable locations, and was particularly stationed on the South Coast and in [[Ireland]]. A number of camps were held at [[Brighton]], where the militia regiments were reviewed by the [[Prince Regent]]. (This is the origin of the song "Brighton Camp".) The militia could not be compelled to serve overseas, but it was seen as a training reserve for the army, as [[bounty (reward)|bounties]] were offered to men who opted to 'exchange' from the militia to the [[regular army]].

====Irish militia====
The [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed an [[act of parliament|act]] in 1715 raising regiments of militia in each county and [[county corporate]]. Membership was restricted to [[Protestant]]s between the ages of 16 and 60. In 1793, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the Irish militia were reorganised to form thirty-seven county and city regiments. While officers of the reorganised force were Protestant, membership of the other ranks was now made available to members of all denominations.

====Scottish militia====
In the late 17th century came calls for the resurrection of militia in Scotland that had the understated aim of protecting the rights of Scots from English oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fletchr/fletchr.htm |title=Andrew Fletcher: A Discourse of Government with relation to Militias |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1757 Militia Act did not apply in Scotland. The old traditional system continued, so that militia regiments only existed in some places. This was resented by some and the Militia Club, soon to become [[the Poker Club]], was formed to promote the raising of a Scottish militia. This and several other Edinburgh clubs became the crucible of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. The Militia Act 1797 empowered Scottish Lord Lieutenants to raise and command militia regiments in each of the "Counties, Stewartries, Cities, and Places" under their jurisdiction.

===19th century===
[[File:Prince of Wales reviewing the Norfolk Artillery Militia.jpg|thumb|The [[Prince of Wales]] reviewing the [[Norfolk Militia]], 1872. By the mid-19th century, the militia had become a volunteer force.]]
Although muster rolls were prepared as late as 1820, the element of compulsion was abandoned, and the militia transformed into a volunteer force, revived by the [[List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1840–59#15_.26_16_Vict.|Militia Act of 1852]]. It was intended to be seen as an alternative to the army. Men would volunteer and undertake basic training for several months at an army depot. Thereafter, they would return to civilian life, but report for regular periods of military training (usually on the weapons ranges) and an annual two-week training camp. In return, they would receive military pay and a financial retainer, a useful addition to their civilian wage. Of course, many saw the annual camp as the equivalent of a paid holiday. The militia thus appealed to agricultural labourers, colliers and the like, men in [[Contingent work|casual occupations]], who could leave their civilian job and pick it up again. Until 1852 the militia were an entirely [[infantry]] force, but from that year a number of county infantry regiments were converted to [[artillery]] and new ones raised. In 1877 the militia of [[Anglesey]] and [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] were converted to engineers. Under the [[Childers reforms|reforms]], introduced by [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Hugh Childers]] in 1881, the remaining militia infantry regiments were redesignated as numbered battalions of regiments of the line, ranking after the two regular battalions. Typically, an English, Welsh or Scottish regiment would have two militia battalions (the 3rd and 4th) and Irish regiments three (numbered 3rd–5th).

The militia must not be confused with the volunteer units created in a wave of enthusiasm in the second half of the nineteenth century. In contrast with the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], and the similar [[Yeomanry]] Cavalry, they were considered rather plebeian.

===The Special Reserve===
[[File:Volunteer with Me for the Territorial Army Art.IWMPST14588.jpg|thumb|Recruitment poster for the British [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] during World War II. The reserve force was formed after the militias were reorganized in 1907.]]
{{main|Special Reserve}}
The militia was transformed into the Special Reserve by the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907|military reforms]] of [[Haldane Reforms|Haldane]] in the reforming post 1906 Liberal government. In 1908 the militia infantry battalions were redesignated as "reserve" and a number were amalgamated or disbanded. Numbered [[Territorial Force]] battalions, ranking after the Special Reserve, were formed from the volunteer units at the same time. Altogether, 101 infantry battalions, 33 artillery regiments and two engineer regiments of special reservists were formed.&lt;ref&gt;Units of the Militia to be transferred to the Special Reserve, published as a schedule to an [[Order in Council]] made 9 April 1908, ''The London Gazette'', 10 April 1908&lt;/ref&gt; Upon mobilisation, the special reserve units would be formed at the depot and continue training while guarding vulnerable points in Britain. The special reserve units remained in Britain throughout the [[First World War]], but their rank and file did not, since the object of the special reserve was to supply drafts of replacements for the overseas units of the regiment. The original militiamen soon disappeared, and the battalions simply became training units. The Special Reserve reverted to its militia designation in 1921, then to Supplementary Reserve in 1924, though the units were effectively placed in "suspended animation" until disbanded in 1953.

===The militiamen===
The name was briefly revived in the [[Military Training Act 1939]], in the aftermath of the [[Munich Crisis]]. [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]], Secretary of State for War, wished to introduce a limited form of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscription]], not known in peacetime Britain since the militia of the early 19th century and previously. It was thought that calling the conscripts 'militiamen' would make this more acceptable, as it would render them distinct from the rest of the army. Only single men aged 20 up to the day before their 22nd birthday were to be conscripted, for six months full-time training before discharge into the reserve (with a free suit of civilian clothing). Although the first intake was called up in late July 1939, the declaration of war on 3 September entailed implementation of full-time conscription for all men aged 18–41, superseding the militia, never to be revived.

===Modern survivals===
[[File:Royal Visit 2012 0010.jpg|thumb|A non-commissioned officer of the [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]]. The unit is one of two regiments in the Territorial Army that maintain their militia designation.]]
Three units still maintain their militia designation in the [[British Army]].These are the [[Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers]] (formed in 1539), the [[Royal Jersey Militia|Jersey Field Squadron (The Royal Militia Island of Jersey)]] (formed in 1337), and the Royal Alderney Militia (created in the 13th century and reformed in 1984). Additionally, the [[Atholl Highlanders]] are a ceremonial infantry militia maintained by the [[Duke of Atholl]]—they are the only legal [[private army]] in Europe.

===Other British militias===
Various other part-time, home defence organisations have been raised during times of crisis or perceived threat, although without the word "militia" in their title. These have included:
*[[British Volunteer Corps|Volunteer Corps]], part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803–1805]]
*[[Fencibles]], part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803–1805]]
*[[Sea Fencibles]], a volunteer coastal defence force in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]
*[[Yeomanry]], volunteer cavalry initially raised in the Napoleonic Wars
*[[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], from 1857 to 1908
*[[Volunteer Training Corps (World War I)|Volunteer Training Corps]], 1914 to 1918
*[[National Defence Companies]], 1936 to 1939
*[[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], initially Local Defence Volunteers, 1940 to 1944 and 1951 to 1957
*[[Ulster Defence Regiment]], 1970 to 1992
*[[Home Service Force]], 1982 to 1992

===The Troubles and Irish War of Independence===
{{See also|The Troubles|Irish War of Independence}}

The various non-state paramilitary groups involved in the 20th-century conflicts in [[Northern Ireland]] and the island of [[Ireland]], such as the various [[Irish Republican Army]] groups and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitaries, could also be described as militias and are occasionally referred to as such.

The [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) was a locally raised professional militia instituted by an [[Act of Parliament]] in December 1969, becoming operational on 1 April 1970. Created as a [[Nonpartisan|non-partisan]] force to defend Northern Ireland "against armed attack or sabotage", it eventually peaked at 11 battalions with 7,559 men and women. 197 soldiers of the UDR, including four women, were killed as active servicemen, with a further 61 killed after leaving the regiment, mostly by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. As a result of defence cuts it was eventually reduced to 7 battalions before being amalgamated with the [[Royal Irish Rangers]] in 1992 to form the "Home Service Battalions" of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]].

==United States==
{{Main article|Militia (United States)}}
The history of militia in the [[United States]] dates from the colonial era, such as in the American Revolutionary War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Linder| first=Doug| title=United States vs. Miller (U.S. 1939)| work=Exploring Constitutional Law| publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School| year=2008| url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/millervus.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123170327/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/millervus.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2001-11-23| accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the English system, colonial militias were drawn from the body of adult male citizens of a community, town, or local region. Because there was no standing English Army before the [[English Civil War]], and subsequently the English Army and later the British Army had few regulars garrisoning North America, colonial militia served a vital role in local conflicts, particularly in the [[French and Indian Wars]]. Before shooting began in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], American revolutionaries took control of the militia system, reinvigorating training and excluding men with [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;John Shy, "Mobilizing Armed Force in the American Revolution", in John Parker and Carol Urness, eds., ''The American Revolution: A Heritage of Change'' (Minneapolis, 1975), pp. 104–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation of the militia was codified by the [[Second Continental Congress]] with the [[Articles of Confederation]]. The revolutionaries also created a full-time regular army—the [[Continental Army]]—but because of manpower shortages the militia provided short-term support to the regulars in the field throughout the war.
[[File:American militia firing at the British infantry from behind a split rail fence during the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, March 15, 1781.jpg|left|thumb|Depiction of American militiamen firing at British infantry during the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]] in 1781.]]
In colonial era Anglo-American usage, militia service was distinguished from military service in that the latter was normally a commitment for a fixed period of time of at least a year, for a [[salary]], whereas militia was only to meet a threat, or prepare to meet a threat, for periods of time expected to be short. Militia persons were normally expected to provide their own weapons, equipment, or supplies, although they may later be compensated for losses or expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Halbrook, "The Right of the People or the Power of the State Bearing Arms, Arming Militias, and the Second Amendment," ''Valparaiso Law Review'', vol. 26, number 1, page 131 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is the [[jury]], which can be regarded as a specialized form of militia convened to render a verdict in a court proceeding (known as a petit jury or [[jury|trial jury]]) or to investigate a public matter and render a presentment or indictment ([[grand jury]]).&lt;ref&gt;William E. Nelson, "The Eighteenth-Century Background of John Marshall's Constitutional Jurisprudence," 76 ''Mich. L. Rev''. 893 (1978), ch. 23, 23. The Jury and Consensus Government in Mid-Eighteenth-Century America&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787 and Article 1 Section 8 of the [[United States Constitution]], control of the army and the power to direct the militia of the states was concurrently delegated to the federal [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref name="Wills 1999"&gt;[[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]] (1999). ''A Necessary Evil, A History of American Distrust of Government''. New York, NY; Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|0-684-84489-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Militia Clause]]s gave Congress authority for "organizing, arming, and disciplining" the militia, and "governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States", with the States retaining authority to appoint officers and to impose the training specified by Congress. Proponents describe a key element in the concept of "militia" was that to be "genuine" it not be a "select militia", composed of an unrepresentative subset of the population. This was an argument presented in the [[Ratification of the United States Constitution|ratification debates]].&lt;ref&gt;''Right to Keep and Bear Arms'', U. S. Senate. [[Paladin Press]] (2001). {{ISBN|1-58160-254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first legislation on the subject was the [[Militia Act of 1792]] which provided, in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia, ... every citizen, so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:NewYorkStateMilitiaCivilWar.jpg|thumb|Uniformed American militiamen during the American Civil War.]]
During the nineteenth century, each of the states maintained its militia differently, some more than others. American militia saw action in the various [[Indian Wars]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[American Civil War]], and the [[Spanish–American War]]. Sometimes militia units were found to be unprepared, ill-supplied, and unwilling.&lt;ref name="Wills 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LT4OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=spanish+american+war+militia#PPA466,M1 |title=The Spanish–American War |author=Russell Alexander Alger |publisher=Harper &amp; Bros. |date=1901 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William H.

Kohn, ''Anglo-American Antimilitary Tracts, 1697–1830'', Arno Press (1979) {{ISBN|0-405-11886-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Civil War, militia units were sometimes used by southern states for slave control. Formed in 1860, Republican Party-affiliated [[Wide Awakes]] clubs were quick to take action to defend persons against southern slave-hunters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Manski|Manski, Ben]] (2006). [https://www.academia.edu/26391441/State_Power_Against_the_Slave_Power ''States Rights for Civil Rights''], [[Liberty Tree Foundation for the Democratic Revolution|Liberty Tree Journal, Vol 1, Issue 4]].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[California]], the militia carried out campaigns against bandits and against the Indians at the direction of its Governor between 1850 and 1866. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] after the Civil War, Republican state governments had militias composed almost entirely of freed slaves and populist whites. Their deployment to maintain order in the former Confederate states caused increased resentment among many Southern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Catton, Bruce (2004). ''The Civil War,'' pages 28–29. Mariner Books. {{ISBN|0-618-00187-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Civil War]], secret groups like the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Knights of the White Camellia]] arose quickly across the [[Southern United States|South]], reaching a peak in the late 1860s. Even more significant in terms of effect were private militias: [[Paramilitary|paramilitary organizations]] that formed starting in 1874, including the [[White League]] in [[Louisiana]], which quickly formed chapters in other states; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in [[Mississippi]] in 1875, and with {{clarify |date=April 2016 |text=force in}} [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]]; and other "white line" militias and rifle clubs.

In contrast to the KKK, these paramilitary organizations were open; members were often well known in their communities. Nevertheless, they used force, intimidation, and violence, including murder, to push out Republican officeholders, break up [[Community organizing|organizing]], and suppress [[Freedman|freedmen]]'s voting and civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux paperback, 2007, pp.25, 167, 170&lt;/ref&gt; The paramilitary groups were described as "the military arm of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]" and were instrumental in helping secure Democratic victories in the South in the elections of 1876.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Missouri National Guard training.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[National Guard of the United States]] undergoing self-defense training. The force was created in 1903 as an organized militia.]]
The [[Militia Act of 1903]] divided what had been the militia into what it termed the "organized" militia, created from portions of the former state guards to become state [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] units, and the "unorganized" militia consisting of all males from ages 17 to 45, with the exception of certain officials and others, which is codified in {{UnitedStatesCode|10|311}}. Some states, such as Texas, California, and Ohio, created separate [[state defense force]]s for assistance in local emergencies. Congress later established&lt;ref&gt;National Defense Act Amendments of 1933, Act of June 15, 1933, ch. 87, 48 Stat. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; a system of "dual enlistment" for the National Guard, so that anyone who enlisted in the National Guard also enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/WhiskerCitizenSoldier.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207180224/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/WhiskerCitizenSoldier.htm |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[U.S. Air Force]] was established as an independent service in 1947, the National Guard was further divided into the [[Army National Guard]] and the [[Air National Guard]]. Under this construct, the 1933 defense act's "dual enlistment" facet was further amended so that enlisted soldiers and commissioned officers in the Army National Guard were also enlisted or commissioned in the Reserve Component of the [[U.S. Army]]. Enlisted airmen and commissioned officers in the Air National Guard were also enlisted or commissioned in the Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the U.S. Air Force.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Privately organized citizen militia-related groups blossomed in the mid-1990s, which collectively became known as the [[constitutional militia movement]]. The supporters have not been affiliated with any government organization, although many have been military and law enforcement veterans.{{Request quotation|date=October 2007}}

In its original sense, ''militia'' meant "the state, quality, condition, or activity of being a fighter or warrior." It can be thought of as "combatant activity", "the fighter frame of mind", "the militant mode", "the soldierly status", or "the warrior way".&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, Ian, The Amateur Military Tradition, 1558–1945 (Manchester, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In this latter usage, a militia is a body of private persons who respond to an emergency threat to public safety, usually one that requires an armed response, but which can also include ordinary law enforcement or disaster responses. The act of bringing to bear arms contextually changes the status of the person, from peaceful citizen, to warrior citizen. The militia is the sum total of persons undergoing this change of state.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Lee Malcolm, The Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms: The Common Law Tradition, ''Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly'', Vol. 10:285–314, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Persons have been said to engage in militia in response to a "call up" by any person aware of the emergent threat requiring the response, and thence to be in "called up" status until the emergency is past.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Lee Malcolm, ''The Role of the Militia in the Development of the Englishman's Right to be Armed—Clarifying the Legacy'', Royal Historical Society and Humanities Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; There is no minimum size to militia, and a solitary act of defense, including self-defense, can be thought of as one person calling up himself to defend the community, represented by himself or others, and to enforce the law.{{Request quotation|date=October 2007}}&lt;ref&gt;''Cases &amp; Comments on Criminal Procedure'', Fred E. Inbau and James R. Thompson, Foundation Press, Mineola, NY (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; See [[citizen's arrest]] and [[hue and cry]].

===21st century===
In the 2008 decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], in [[District of Columbia v. Heller]], the ''[[de jure]]'' definition of "militia" as used in [[United States]] [[jurisprudence]] was discussed. The Court's opinion made explicit, in its ''[[Obiter dictum|obiter dicta]]'', that the term "militia," as used in colonial times in this [[Originalism|originalist]] decision, included both the federally organized militia and the citizen-organized militias of the several [[U.S. state|States]]: "... the 'militia' in colonial America consisted of a subset of 'the people'—those who were male, able-bodied, and within a certain age range" (7) ... Although the militia consists of all able-bodied men, the federally-organized militia may consist of a subset of them"(23).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scalia |first=Antonin |title=DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ET AL. v.

{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
The most important previous activity of the Texas Militia was the [[Texas Revolution]] in 1836. Texans declared independence from [[Mexico]] while they were defeated during the [[Battle of the Alamo]], in March 1836. On April 21, 1836, led by [[Sam Houston]], the Militia attacked the [[Mexican Army]] at their camp, in the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] near the present city of [[Houston]]. Following the war, some militia units reorganized into what was later to be known as the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], which was a private, volunteer effort for several years before becoming an official organization. After Texas joined the Union of the United States in 1845, Texas militia units participated in the [[Mexican–American War]].

In 1861 Texas joined the other [[Confederate States]] in seceding from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and Texas militias played a role in the [[American Civil War]], until it ended in 1865. Texas militiamen joined [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders]], a volunteer militia, and fought with him during the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898. Some of the training of the Rough Riders took place in San Pedro Park, in the north central part of San Antonio near the present site of [[San Antonio College]]. When a muster of the Militia proposed to train there on April 19, 1994, they were threatened with arrest, even though the charter of San Pedro Park forbids exclusion of activities of that kind. This threat led to a change of the meeting site. Like many other American states, Texas maintains a recognized State Militia, the [[Texas State Guard]].

==Vietnam==
The [[Militia#Vietnam|Vietnam Militia]] (''Dân quân Tự vệ'') is a part of [[Vietnam People's Armed Forces]]. The militia organized in communes, wards and townships and are put under commune-level military commands. 

Vietnam Militia has two branches: Special Militia (nòng cốt) and General Militia (rộng rãi). The term of service in the core militia is 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moj.gov.vn/vbpq/en/Lists/Vn%20bn%20php%20lut/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=10474 Law no. 43/2009/QH12 on Militia and Self Defense Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

==SFR Yugoslavia==
{{Main article|Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)}}

Beside the federal [[Yugoslav People's Army]], each [[Country|constituent republic]] of the former [[SFR Yugoslavia]] had its own ''[[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defense Forces]]''. The [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Aligned]] Yugoslavia was concerned about an eventual aggression from any of the [[superpower]]s, especially by the [[Warsaw Pact]] after the [[Prague Spring]], so the ''Territorial Defense Forces'' were formed as an integral part of the [[total war]] [[military doctrine]] called ''Total National Defense''. Those forces corresponded to [[military reserve force]]s, [[paramilitary]] or militia, the latter, in the military meaning of the term (like [[military formation]]). It should not be confused with the Yugoslav Militia- ''[[Milicija]]'' which was a term for a [[police]].

==Civic duty==
The Militia Information Service (MIS), an [[Australia]]n not-for-profit organization, asserts that membership in the militia is a civic duty that helps to deter crime, tyranny, and [[crimes against humanity]] like [[genocide]]. The MIS urges all competent, law-abiding adults to "obtain a military type rifle and pistol like those commonly used by soldiers in their nation's armed forces and use them regularly (target shooting, hunting, etc.) in order to become proficient with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Militia Information Service| work=| publisher=| year=| url=http://www.militia.info/facts.html| accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation of Egypt''' is a ministerial body in charge of [[agriculture]] and [[land reclamation]] in [[Egypt]].

==History==
The Ministry of Agriculture was established on 20 November 1913.&lt;ref name=min&gt;{{cite web|title=The evolution of the structure of the Ministry of Agriculture|url=http://www.agr-egypt.gov.eg/En_MinHistory.aspx|work=Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, it was renamed Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation.&lt;ref name=min/&gt; One of its goals is to address sustainability in agriculture such as better ways to do agricultural irrigation.&lt;ref name="2017 ministry news"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry News|url=http://www.agr-egypt.gov.eg/|website=Ministry of Ag official site}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, an agency from Switzerland was put in charge of inspecting Egypt's imported wheat. Egypt imports the most wheat of any country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.world-grain.com/articles/news_home/World_Grain_News/2017/01/Egypt_names_new_head_of_ag_qua.aspx?ID=%7B55DF4583-04FD-476B-A63C-F2913F5015FB%7D&amp;cck=1|title=Egypt names new head of ag quarantine agency|date=9 January 2017|work=world grain|last1=Demaree|first1=Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World-Grain"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schroeder|first1=Eric|title=Egypt names new ag minister|url=http://www.world-grain.com/articles/news_home/World_Grain_News/2017/02/Egypt_names_new_ag_minister.aspx?ID={F9B00277-771E-471A-B7F1-075133536EC2}&amp;cck=1|agency=World-Grain|date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around 40% of the average Egyptians' income is spent on food.&lt;ref name="Farming the Sahara"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peter|first1=Schwartzstein|title=Farming the Sahara|url=http://www.takepart.com/feature/2016/01/08/desert-farming-egypt|website=Take Part}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farmland==
As of 2000, small farms (between 5 and 6 [[feddans]]) accounted for most (49.61%) of the agricultural land ownership in Egypt. 34.72% of farm holdings were of 1 feddan or less.&lt;ref name="PetitMontaigne2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michel Petit|author2=Etienne Montaigne|author3=Fatima El Hadad-Gauthier|title=Sustainable Agricultural Development: Challenges and Approaches in Southern and Eastern Mediterranean Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BmN1CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=15 May 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-17813-4|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hope is that with desalination plants, new wells&lt;ref name="2015 project" /&gt; and better infrastructure farmers will be able to grow more wheat.

In April 2018 Egypt purchased wheat from local farmers but not at a price farmers found sustainable.&lt;ref name="2018 buying wheat from farmers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt buys 190,000 tonnes of locally-produced wheat - ministr|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL8N1RW45B?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=egyptNews|accessdate=29 April 2018|work=Reuters|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land reclamation==
A land reclamation project was begun in 2015, near the town of [[Farafra]].&lt;ref name="2015 project"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sisi inaugurates 1st phase of 1.5 million feddan reclamation project|url=http://www.madamasr.com/en/2015/12/31/news/u/sisi-inaugurates-1st-phase-of-1-5-million-feddan-reclamation-project/|agency=Mada Masr|date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large government and private investment and initiatives in farming the [[Sahara Desert]] have sometimes ended with little to show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maloy|first1=T.J.|title=Agribusiness overview: Egypt’s agriculture is poised for growth|url=http://www.marcopolis.net/agribusiness-overview-egypts-agriculture-is-poised-for-growth.htm|website=Marcopolis.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, it was announced 1.7 million [[feddans]] had been reclaimed and according to the Egyptian Prime Minister, [[Sherif Ismail]], this work would continue. It was President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] who, in May 2017, asked for the armed services to begin reclaiming land by demolishing illegally erected structures on land not owned by builders or [[squatters]].&lt;ref name="2017 reclaimed feddans"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt PM says recovered 1.7 million feddans of agricultural land|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/recovered-agricultural-land-egypt/|work=Egypt Independent|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11438">The '''Mississippi Plan''' of 1875 was developed by conservative white Democrats as part of the white [[insurgents|insurgency]] during the [[Reconstruction Era (United States)|Reconstruction Era]] in the [[Southern United States]]. It was devised by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in that state to overthrow the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in [[History of Mississippi|Mississippi]] by means of organized threats of violence and suppression or purchase of the black vote. Democrats wanted to regain political control of the legislature and governor's office. Their success in doing so led to similar plans being adopted by white Democrats in [[South Carolina]] and other majority-black states.

To end election violence and ensure that [[freedmen]] were excluded from politics, the Democrat-dominated state legislature passed a new constitution in 1890, which effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] and disarmed most blacks by erecting barriers to voter registration and firearms ownership.&lt;ref name=SBTahmassebi&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Tahmassebi1.html |title=Gun Control and Racism |first=Stefan B. |last=Tahmassebi |date=1991 |publisher=CRLJ Association |work=George Mason University Civil Rights Law Journal |page=67 |accessdate=July 8, 2001 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010708012948/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Tahmassebi1.html |archivedate=July 8, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CECramer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claytoncramer.com/scholarly/racistroots.htm |title=The Racist Roots of Gun Control |last=Cramer |first=Clayton E. |date=1995 |publisher=Kansas Journal of Law and Public Policy |accessdate=December 28, 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228195302/http://www.claytoncramer.com/scholarly/racistroots.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RockvilleJWL&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/blog/153651#sthash.08HmqupB.dpuf |title=What Does Rockville, Maryland's Confederate Monument Tell Us About the Civil War?

They did not regain the power to vote until the late 1960s after the federal [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] was passed to authorize federal oversight of state practices and protect citizens' right to vote. 

==History==
During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], former slaves were granted citizenship and African-American men were granted the franchise by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendments]]. The consequences of this were far-reaching and almost immediate, as freedmen eagerly registered and flooded the polls. Freedmen overwhelming registered as Republicans, allying with the party that had secured their emancipation. But they voted for white Republican candidates as well as for blacks. 

For example, in the black-majority state of Mississippi, of the 100 delegates to the Mississippi constitutional convention that drafted the Reconstruction constitution, only 16 were black.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/271241?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Vernon L. Jordan, "The Race Issue in the Overthrow of Reconstruction in Mississippi:" A Paper Read before the American Historical Association, 1940, in ''Phylon'' (1940-1956), Vol. 2, No. 4 (4th Qtr., 1941), pp. 362-370, accessed 15 June 2015, via JSTOR {{subscription required|via JSTOR}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mississippi's 1874 election, the Republican Party carried a 30,000 majority in what had been a Democratic Party stronghold when only whites voted. Republicans took the governor's office and some legislative seats, but blacks never held a majority of seats in any of the state legislatures, although that was their proportion of the population. Freedmen and other blacks (some free blacks had migrated from the North to work in the state), were elected to many local offices and held 10 of 36 seats in the state legislature that year. (They comprised a large majority of the population and voted for white Republicans as well as blacks.)

In 1874 whites in the city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] were determined to suppress black voting in that year's election. White armed patrols prevented blacks from voting; Democrats succeeded in defeating all Republican city officials in the August election. By December the emboldened party forced the black county sheriff, Crosby, to flee to the state capital. Blacks who rallied to the city to aid the sheriff also had to flee in the face of superior white forces, as armed whites flooded the city. Over the next few days, armed white gangs may have murdered up to 300 blacks in the city and its vicinity, in what became known as the [[Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant#Vicksburg riots|Vicksburg riots]].

U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] sent a company of troops to Vicksburg in January 1875 to quell the violence and allow the sheriff's safe return. The sheriff was assassinated by his white deputy, A. Gilmer on June 7, 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9802E5D6153BEF34BC4053DFB066838E669FDE
|title=The Negro Sheriff Crosby…| date=June 8, 1875|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, under their Mississippi Plan, the Democrats conducted a political dual-pronged battle to reverse Republican strength in the state. White [[paramilitary organizations]] such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] arose to serve as "the military arm of the Democratic Party."&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (which was defunct by then), the Red Shirts operated and paraded openly, with members known in local areas. They sometimes invited newspaper coverage of their parades and activities, and their goals were political &amp;ndash; to throw out the Republicans. They were well-armed, with private financing for the purchase of new weapons as they took on more power. The first step was to persuade the 10 to 15 percent of [[Scalawags]] (white Republicans) to vote with the Democratic party. Outright attacks and economic and political pressure convinced many [[carpetbaggers]] to switch parties or flee the state.

The second step of the Mississippi Plan was intimidation of freedmen and their families. Planters, landlords and merchants used economic coercion against black sharecroppers and farmers, with limited success. The Red Shirts more often used violence, including whippings and murders, and intimidation at the polls. They were joined in the violence by white paramilitary groups known as "[[rifle clubs]]," who frequently provoked riots at Republican rallies, shooting down dozens of blacks in the ensuing conflicts.

Although the governor requested Federal troops to curb the violence, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] hesitated to act. He feared being accused of "bayonet rule" — which he believed would undoubtedly be exploited by Democrats to carry [[Ohio]] in that year's state elections. The violence went unchecked and the plan worked as intended: during Mississippi's 1875 statewide election, five counties with large black majorities polled only 12, 7, 4, 2, and 0 Republican votes, respectively. The Republican dominance by 30,000 votes in the 1874 national and city elections was reversed in 1875, with polls showing a Democratic majority of 30,000 in statewide elections.

The success of the white Democrats in Mississippi influenced the growth of Red Shirt chapters in [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]] as well, which also had thousands of white men involved in rifle clubs. The Red Shirts were particularly prominent in suppressing black votes in majority-black counties in South Carolina.  Historians estimated that they committed 150 murders in the weeks leading up to the 1876 election in South Carolina. Louisiana also produced white insurgents, known as the [[White League]], who together with rifle clubs likewise suppressed black voting in the state by violence from 1874 on.

==Legacy==
{{See also|Constitution of Mississippi}}
In 1877, U.S. federal troops were withdrawn from the Southern states, due to the national [[Compromise of 1877]]. White Democrats had control of all southern state legislatures, although blacks continued to be elected to local offices through the 1880s, and to some congressional seats in the late 19th century, the result of alliances with the Populists in some states. 

In 1890 the Mississippi Democratic-dominated legislature drafted and passed a [[Constitution of Mississippi|new constitution]], which effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] and disarmed most blacks by erecting barriers to firearms ownership&lt;ref name=SBTahmassebi/&gt;&lt;ref name=CECramer/&gt; as well as voter registration, by a method of [[poll taxes]], subjective [[literacy tests]], and more restrictive residency requirements. When these legal provisions, which used race-neutral language but were enforced in a discriminatory manner, survived legal challenges to the United States Supreme Court, other Southern U.S. states, such as South Carolina and Oklahoma, adopted similar provisions in new constitutions or laws.&lt;ref name=RockvilleJWL/&gt; Through the turn of the century to 1908, Southern Democrats disenfranchised most black people and many poor whites (especially in Alabama) by enacting such new state constitutions. Black people were effectively excluded from participating in the formal political system of the American South until the late 1960s, after gaining federal legislation to support and defend their constitutional right to vote.

'''Mote Marine Laboratory''' is an independent, [[not-for-profit]], marine research organization based on City Island in [[Sarasota, Florida]], with additional campuses in eastern Sarasota County, Boca Grande, Florida, and the Florida Keys. Founded in 1955 by [[Eugenie Clark|Dr. Eugenie Clark]] in [[Placida, Florida]], it was known as the '''Cape Haze Marine Laboratory''' until 1967. The Lab aims to advance marine science and education, supporting conservation and sustainable use of marine resources. The public Mote Aquarium and associated education program translate Mote research for the public.

==History==
Mote Marine Laboratory, founded by [[Eugenie Clark|Dr. Eugenie Clark]] in 1955 in [[Placida, Florida]], was known as Cape Haze Marine Laboratory until its 1967 renaming in honor of major benefactors of the laboratory William R. Mote, his wife Lenore, and his sister, Betty Mote Rose. Mote's early research was focused on sharks and other fishes. Since 1960, Mote has been based in Sarasota, Florida, and has been located on City Island since 1978.

Mote celebrated its 55th Anniversary during 2010. The Lab was recognized for its 55 years of marine science with a resolution in the Florida House and Senate in March 2010. Founder Clark was also recognized in March 2010 with an induction to the Florida Women's Hall of Fame.

The laboratory celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2015 and unveiled its first multi-year, comprehensive fundraising effort, ''Oceans of Opportunity: the Campaign for Mote Marine Laboratory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mote Celebrates 60th Anniversary, Announces $50-million Fundraising Campaign {{!}} News &amp; Press|url = https://mote.org/news/article/mote-celebrates-60th-anniversary-announces-50-million-fundraising-campaign|website = mote.org|accessdate = October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark was still working as Senior Scientist, Director Emerita, and Trustee at the laboratory when she died in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Remembering Mote’s "Shark Lady": The Life and Legacy of Dr. Eugenie Clark {{!}} News &amp; Press|url = https://mote.org/news/article/remembering-the-shark-lady-the-life-and-legacy-of-dr.-eugenie-clark|website = mote.org|accessdate = October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Mote employs more than 200 staff members, including Ph.D. scientists conducting research through more than 20 research programs (Coral Health &amp; Disease; Chemical &amp; Physical Ecology; Phytoplankton Ecology; Ocean Acidification; Marine &amp; Fresh Water Aquaculture; Fisheries Habitat Ecology; Stranding Investigations; Ecotoxicology; Sharks &amp; Rays Conservation Research; Fisheries Ecology &amp; Enhancement; Coral Reef Monitoring &amp; Assessment; Coral Reef Restoration; Environmental Health; Ocean Technology; Marine Immunology; Benthic Ecology; Marine Biomedical Research; Environmental Laboratory for Forensics; Sea Turtle Conservation &amp; Research; Manatee Research; and the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sarasotadolphin.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mote Marine Laboratory 2020 Vision&amp;Strategic Plan: Version 2.0&lt;/ref&gt; a partnership of the Chicago Zoological Society &lt;ref&gt;https://www.czs.org&lt;/ref&gt; and Mote that conducts the world's longest-running study of a wild dolphin population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientific Research|url = http://www.sarasotadolphin.org/scientific-research/|website = www.sarasotadolphin.org|accessdate = October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1978, the Laboratory has expanded to include a {{convert|10.5|acre|ha|sing=on}} campus in Sarasota, the Elizabeth Moore International Center for Coral Reef Research &amp; Restoration on Summerland Key; a public exhibit in [[Key West]]; a Boca Grande Outreach Office; and Mote Aquaculture Research Park in eastern Sarasota County. In addition to staff members, Mote has about 1,400 volunteers who contribute more than 200,000 volunteer hours to the organization.

==Mote Aquarium==
[[File:Coral on display at Mote Marine Laboratory 2.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|[[Coral]] on display.]]
Mote Aquarium is the public outreach arm of Mote Marine Laboratory, displaying more than 100 marine species with a focus on species and ecosystems studied by Mote scientists. Mote Aquarium is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which accredits qualified facilities based on a rigorous application and inspection process focusing on animal care, conservation and science, facilities and more.

The Aquarium opened in 1980 on City Island in [[Sarasota Bay]]. Visitors can see sharks, manatees, sea turtles, seahorses, rays, skates and invertebrates including cuttlefish and/or octopuses, sea jellies, anemones and corals. Special exhibits such as "Otters &amp; Their Waters" and "The Teeth Beneath: The Wild World of Gators, Crocs and Caimans," highlight animals found in the watershed (land that drains into the ocean and other waterbodies), including North American river otters, American alligators and spectacled caimans. The special exhibit "Oh Baby! Life Cycles of the Seas" showcases marine courtship and reproduction, featuring babies of multiple species and highlighting their early-life survival challenges through an interactive game, a baby shark touch tank and other features.&lt;ref&gt;https://mote.org/news/article/new-mote-exhibit-oh-baby-to-explore-ocean-animal-romance-babies-families&lt;/ref&gt; Though originally announced as a temporary exhibit, "Oh Baby!" has continued to operate at Mote (as of November 2017) due to a positive response from visitors. Mote Aquarium includes windows into Mote's working laboratories and interactive exhibits designed to make science accessible for all ages. The Aquarium hosts birthdays, weddings, corporate gatherings, and other events. Special group tours can be provided and are designed to show visitors how staff tend the animals and exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Immerse yourself in discovery.|url = https://mote.org/aquarium|website = mote.org|accessdate = October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aquarium offers narrated shark feedings, in which large sharks are trained to go to specific targets for a food reward. Other resident animals, such as sea turtles and river otters, are similarly fed and trained during narrated sessions designed to enhance their care and provide healthy stimulation. All narrated training/feeding sessions at Mote are designed specifically for the animals' care, and in some cases, to allow behavioral research intended to inform conservation of wild populations.

Until 2011, Harley, the last recorded [[spinner dolphin]] in captivity so far, lived at Mote Aquarium.

==Education==
Mote's Education, Aquarium and Outreach Division includes marine science school and public programs for all ages. Mote offers internships, summer camps, school visits, field trips, on-demand learning experiences, an annual Special Lecture Series featuring Mote scientists and other marine experts, and a digital-learning program called SeaTrek.TV, which connects Mote educators to students and other audiences via live videoconferencing, often using common programs such as Skype and Zoom, making scientific lessons accessible to classrooms across the U.S. and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = If you want to change the world, dive deeper.|url = https://mote.org/education|website = mote.org|accessdate = October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Mote's newest offerings include enhanced adult learning programs such as professional development workshops for teachers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mote.org/news/article/mote-to-host-professional-development-workshop-for-teachers|title=Mote to host professional development workshop for teachers {{!}} News &amp; Press|website=mote.org|access-date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mote maintains multiple aquarium tanks at other southwest Florida facilities, including at the [[Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport]] between the information kiosk and the security checkpoint.

== Library ==
A library has existed at Mote since the laboratory's beginnings in Cape Haze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Lady and the Sharks|last = Clark|first = Eugenie|publisher = The Peppertree Press|year = 2010|isbn = 9781936051526|location = |pages = |quote = "We also had a small office and file room and a sizable library room. We were accumulating all the books we could find and fit in our budget pertaining to marine life on the Gulf coast of Florida. We started subscriptions to scientific journals and much of my paperwork time was devoted to writing people and organizations to get the Lab's name on the mailing list for scientific papers on marine life. [...] Bill Vanderbilt shared one of his secretaries, Marion Suss, with me. Marion was the Lab's secretary, bookkeeper, librarian, and in a pinch helped measure and photograph sharks, clean and dry fishbones."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arthur Vining Davis Library and Archives has been providing resources, reference materials, and research publications for more than 35 years at Mote Marine Laboratory. Its collections are maintained for the support of marine and environmental research and education. In addition to print and archival collections, the Library maintains searchable online, open-access institutional repositories of Mote staff publications, institutional papers, and items from historical collections.

The Library and Archives are open to the public for study and exploration. Appointments are suggested for library visitors and required for archival tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research Library|url = https://mote.org/research/research-library|website = mote.org|accessdate = October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mote's library is a member of the International Association of Aquatic and Marine Science Libraries and Information Centers (IAMSLIC), an association of individuals and organizations interested in library and information science, especially as these are applied to the recording, retrieval, and dissemination of knowledge and information in all aspects of aquatic and marine sciences and their allied disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IAMSLIC|url = http://www.iamslic.org/|website = www.iamslic.org|accessdate = October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caviar and other commercial demonstration programs==
From 2006 to 2014, the laboratory produced "Mote caviar" (Siberian malossol [[osetra]]) from Siberian [[sturgeon]] at Mote Aquaculture Research Park in eastern Sarasota County as part of a demonstration of sustainable eco-sensitive [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;October 2012 Florida Trend pages 14,16&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 2014, Mote announced the sale of their caviar production operation to Southeast Venture Holdings, LLC (Seven Holdings).&lt;ref&gt;https://mote.org/news/article/mote-marine-laboratory-and-southeast-venture-holdings-announce-spin-off&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Mote continued to own the entire 200-acre Mote Aquaculture Research Park and continued its sustainable aquaculture and aquaponics research, emphasizing a range of goals from eco-friendly food production to restocking wild fish populations. In early 2017, Seven Holdings concluded its work with the Siberian sturgeon caviar for financial reasons, and the sturgeon program concluded. Meanwhile, Mote staff at the Park have continued research programs investigating marine aquaponics (growing fish and salt-tolerant "sea vegetables" in prototype greenhouses), examining the potential for aquaculture production of the Gulf of Mexico stock of almaco jack, examining the effects of probiotic supplements on survival of larval fish, and other projects designed to inform and contribute to the growth of sustainable, commercial aquaculture &lt;ref&gt;Mote Marine Laboratory &amp; Aquarium Community Relations &amp; Communications staff provided direct edits to this section of the Wikipedia page on January 2, 2018, describing the conclusion of the Seven Holdings sturgeon operation and specifying Mote's commercially relevant projects active during and after the discussed time period. Mote staff are paid by the institution to provide accurate and up-to-date public information.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''National Labor Party''' was formed by [[Australia]]n Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] in 1916 following the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1916|1916 Labor split]] on the issue of [[World War I conscription in Australia]]. Hughes had taken over as leader of the [[Australian Labor Party]] and [[Prime Minister of Australia]] when anti-conscriptionist [[Andrew Fisher]] resigned in 1915. He formed the new party for himself and his followers after he was expelled from the ALP a month after the [[Australian plebiscite, 1916|1916 plebiscite]] on [[conscription in Australia]]. Hughes held a pro-conscription stance in relation to [[World War I]].

==Formation==
On 15 September 1916 the executive of the Political Labour League (the Labor Party organisation in New South Wales at the time) expelled Hughes from the Labor Party.

When the Federal Parliamentary Labor caucus met on 14 November 1916, lengthy discussions ensued until Hughes walked out with 24 other Labor members; the remaining 43 members of Caucus then passed their motion of no confidence in the leadership, effectively expelling Hughes and the other members.

Hughes and his followers, who included several early Labor leaders, formed a minority government supported by the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]], led by another Labor dissident, [[Joseph Cook]]. Believing the Labor Party was no longer sufficiently nationalist, they began laying the groundwork for a new party that would be both socially radical and nationalist.

In 1917, Hughes and Cook turned their confidence-and-supply agreement into a formal party, the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]].  Hughes became the merged party's leader, with Cook as his deputy.  Although it was essentially an upper- and middle-class party dominated by former Liberals, the presence of several Labor men allowed the party to project an image of national unity.

The National Labor Party was never formally constituted itself as a party and had no organisational structure, although some trade union officials and Labor Party branches, particularly in [[Western Australia]] and [[Tasmania]], supported it.

==Queensland==
{{Main article|National Labor Party (Queensland)}}
The Labor Party avoided a split in Queensland due to the efforts of [[T. J. Ryan]] to minimise losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=D.J. |author-link1=Denis Murphy (Australian politician) |date=1975 |title=T J Ryan: A Political Biography |publisher=University of Queensland Press |pages=186-208 |isbn=9780702222894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one member of the state parliament, [[John Adamson (Queensland politician)|John Adamson]], left the party and initially there was no attempt to create an alternate vehicle at the state level. However in October 1919 Adamson was part of the formation of a party for ex-Labor supporters that used the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/179391506 |title=20 Oct 1919 - THE DAILY MIRROR |publisher=Trove |date=1919-10-20 |accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had no electoral success and soon disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Irving |first1=Baiba |last2=Schedvin |first2=Bernie |date=May 1973 |title=A Confidential Report on Nationalist Organisation in Queensland, 1920 |journal=Queensland Heritage |volume=2 |issue=8 |page=15n }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western Australia==
The National Labor movement in Western Australia started off as two separate groups—one known as the Labor Solidarity Committee based out of Trades Hall in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and the other known as National Labor and based on the goldfields. The two merged in April–May 1917, with former [[Premier of Western Australia|Premier]] [[John Scaddan]] as their leader. However, by July he was without a seat in Parliament, and the party turned to Federal [[Australian Senate|Senators]] [[Patrick Lynch (Australian politician)|Patrick Lynch]], [[Hugh de Largie]] and [[George Pearce]] for leadership and guidance. Unlike its federal counterpart, it maintained its own distinct identity and structure and worked with the Nationalists as coalition partners. A number of Western Australian unions disaffiliated from the Australian Labor Federation to support the National Labor movement—most notably those representing the engine-drivers, railway employees, boilermakers and carpenters which were powerful in the goldfields. Organisationally, however, the party was believed to be over-dependent on its Senate patrons and struggled to build a genuine extraparliamentary organisation.

The party scored six of 50 [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Assembly]] seats in each of the [[Western Australian state election, 1917|1917]] and [[Western Australian state election, 1921|1921 elections]], and held three of 30 [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Council]] seats during this period. However, in the [[Western Australian state election, 1924|1924 elections]], their representation was reduced to one in the Assembly and two in the Council—many through the defeat of sitting NLP members by Labor candidates—and later that year, what remained of the Party was subsumed by the Nationalists.

From the point of view of human geography, '''neogeography''' could be also defined as the use of new specific information society tools, especially the Internet, to the aims and purposes of Geography as an academic discipline; in all branches of geographical thought and incorporating contributions from outside of Geography performed by non-specialist users in this discipline through the use of specific geographic ICT tools. This new definition, complementing previous ones, restores to academic Geography the leading role it should play when considering a renewal of the discipline with the rigor and right granted by its centuries-existence, but also includes the interesting social phenomenon of citizen participation in the geographical knowledge from its dual role: as undoubted possibility of enrichment for Geography and as social phenomenon with geographic interest.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

==History==
The term ''neogeography'' has been used since at least 1922.  In the early 1950s in the U.S. it was a term used in the [[sociology]] of production &amp; work.  The French philosopher [[François Dagognet]] used it in the title of his 1977 book ''Une Epistemologie de l'espace concret: Neo-geographie''.  The word was first used in relation to the study of online communities in the 1990s by Kenneth Dowling, the Librarian of the City and County of [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="d-log.info"&gt;[http://www.d-log.info/on-neogeography.pdf "A short enquiry into the origins and uses of the term “neogeography”", ''D'log'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Immediate precursor terms in the industry press were: "the geospatial Web" and "the geoaware Web" (both 2005); "Where 2.0" (2005); "a dissident cartographic aesthetic" and "mapping and counter-mapping" (2006).&lt;ref name="d-log.info"/&gt; These terms arose with the concept of [[Web 2.0]], around the increased public appeal of mapping and [[geospatial]] technologies that occurred with the release of such tools as "slippy maps" such as [[Google Maps]], [[Google Earth]], and also with the decreased cost of geolocated mobile devices such as [[GPS]] units.  Subsequently, the use of geospatial technologies began to see increased integration with non-geographically focused applications.

The term neogeography was first defined in its contemporary sense by Randall Szott in 2006.  He argued for a broad scope, to include artists, [[psychogeography]], and more. The technically oriented aspects of the field, far more tightly defined than in Scott's definition, were outlined by Andrew Turner in his ''Introduction to Neogeography'' (O'Reilly, 2006). The contemporary use of the term, and the field in general, owes much of its inspiration to the [[locative media]] movement that sought to expand the use of location-based technologies to encompass personal expression and society.&lt;ref name="d-log.info"/&gt;

Traditional [[Geographic Information Systems]] historically have developed tools and techniques targeted towards formal applications that require precision and accuracy. By contrast, neogeography tends to apply to the areas of approachable, colloquial applications. The two realms can have overlap as the same problems are presented to different sets of users: experts and non-experts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Graham (2010). Journal of Economic And Social Geography (TESG)]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be active collection of data such as [[OpenStreetMap]] or passive collection of user-data such as Flickr tags for folksonomic toponyms.

==Discussion about the definition==
There is currently much debate about the scope and application of neogeography in the web mapping, geography, and GIS fields. Some of this discussion considers neogeography to be the ease of use of geographic tools and interfaces while other points focus on the domains of application.

Neogeography is not limited to a specific technology and is not strictly web-based, so is not synonymous with [[web mapping]] though it is commonly conceived as such.

A number of geographers and geoinformatics scientists (such as Mike Goodchild&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a911734343 "NeoGeography and the nature of geographic expertise", Goodchild (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;) have expressed strong reservations about the term "neogeography". They say that [[geography]] is an established scientific discipline; uses such as mashups and tags in Google Earth are not scientific works, but are better described as [[Volunteered Geographic Information]].

There are also a great many artists and inter-disciplinary practitioners involved in an engagement with new forms of mapping and locative art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intute.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?term1=neogeography&amp;amp;jacsheading=%25&amp;amp;submit=Search&amp;amp;limit=0&amp;amp;subject=All "Search results - neogeography"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus far wider than simply [[web mapping]].

==Neogeography and Geographical Education==

The applications of neogeography  in geographical education were first explored by  Papadimitriou (2010, 2010a), who also suggested a “Neogeographical education” to encompass all educational aspects of geoinformation over web and mobile platforms and devices.

'''Petrodollar recycling''' is the international spending or investment of a country's revenues from [[petroleum]] exports ("'''petrodollars'''"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major [[List of countries by oil exports|petroleum-exporting nations]], mainly the [[OPEC#Membership|OPEC members]] plus [[Russia]] and [[Norway]], earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of hundreds of billions of [[US dollars]] per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some [[Currency peg|pegged]] to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both [[global finance]] and [[petroleum politics]]. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the [[price of oil]] is historically high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nsouli |first=Saleh M. |title=Petrodollar Recycling and Global Imbalances |url=http://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp032306a |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]] |date=March 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term petrodollar was coined in the early 1970s during the [[OPEC oil crisis|oil crisis]], and the first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).&lt;ref name="kinzer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kinzer |first1=Stephen |title=All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror |publisher=Wiley |isbn=047018549X |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital flows==

===Background===
Especially during the years [[1970s energy crisis|1974–1981]] and [[2000s energy crisis|2005–2014]], oil exporters amassed large surpluses of "petrodollars" from historically expensive oil.&lt;ref name=EIA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=EIA2015&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/regions-topics.cfm?RegionTopicID=OPEC |title=OPEC Revenues Fact Sheet |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=May 15, 2017 |accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=profusion&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21553424 |title=Petrodollar Profusion |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=April 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The word has been credited alternately to Egyptian-American economist [[Ibrahim Oweiss]] and to former [[US Secretary of Commerce]] [[Peter G.

Alternatively, global economic growth would have suffered if that money was withdrawn from the world economy, while the oil-exporting nations needed to be able to invest profitably to raise their long-term standards of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/center/mm/eng/mm_rs_03.htm |title=Petrodollar Problem |publisher=International Monetary Fund |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1974–1981 surge===
While petrodollar recycling reduced the short-term [[1973–75 recession|recessionary]] impact of the [[1973 oil crisis]], it caused problems especially for oil-importing countries that were paying much higher prices for oil, and incurring long-term debts. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) estimated that the foreign debts of 100 oil-importing [[developing countries]] increased by 150% between 1973 and 1977, complicated further by a worldwide shift to [[floating exchange rate]]s. [[Johan Witteveen]], the Managing Director of the IMF, said in 1974: "The international monetary system is facing its most difficult period since the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/center/mm/eng/rs_sub_3.htm |title=Recycling Petrodollars |publisher=International Monetary Fund |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF administered a new lending program during 1974–1976 called the Oil Facility. Funded by oil-exporting nations and other lenders, it was available to nations suffering from acute problems with their [[balance of trade]] due to the rise in oil prices, notably including [[Italy]] and the [[UK]] as well as dozens of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Balance of Payments Financing and the Budget Process |publisher=[[U.S. Congressional Budget Office]] |first=Carl Richard |last=Neu |date=August 1977 |pages=27–29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VK6wuXHuPJkC&amp;pg=PA27 |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1974 through 1981, the total [[current account]] surplus for all members of OPEC amounted to US$450&amp;nbsp;billion, without scaling-up for the subsequent decades of inflation. Ninety percent of this surplus was accumulated by the [[Arab countries]] of the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Libya]], with [[Iran]] also accumulating significant oil surpluses through 1978 before suffering the hardships of [[Iranian Revolution|revolution]], [[Iran–Iraq War|war]] and [[Sanctions against Iran|sanctions]].&lt;ref name=Oweiss&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/imo3/petrod/petro2.htm |chapter=Economics of Petrodollars |title=The Economic Dimensions of Middle Eastern History |pages=179–199 |authorlink=Ibrahim Oweiss |first=Ibrahim M. |last=Oweiss |editor-first1=Haleh |editor-last1=Esfandiari |editor-first2=A.L. |editor-last2=Udovitch |publisher=Darwin Press |date=1990 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large volumes of Arab petrodollars were invested directly in [[US Treasury securities]] and in other financial markets of the major industrial economies, often directed discreetly by government entities now known as [[sovereign wealth funds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David E. |last=Spiro |title=The Hidden Hand of American Hegemony: Petrodollar Recycling and International Markets |location=Ithaca |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |date=1999 |isbn=0-8014-2884-X |pages=74–75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3vWgRS_itIC&amp;pg=PA74 |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret |title=The Untold Story Behind Saudi Arabia's 41-Year U.S. Debt Secret |first=Andrea |last=Wong |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=May 30, 2016 |accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many billions of petrodollars were also invested through the major [[commercial bank]]s of the US and Europe. In fact, the process contributed to the growth of the [[Eurodollar]] market as a less-regulated rival to US monetary markets. As the recessionary condition of the world economy made investment in corporations less attractive, bankers and well-financed governments lent much of the money directly to the governments of developing countries, especially in Latin America such as [[Economy of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Economy of Argentina|Argentina]]&lt;ref name=Oweiss/&gt; as well as other major developing nations like [[Turkey]]. The 1973 oil crisis had created a vast dollar shortage in these countries; however, they still needed to finance their imports of oil and machinery. In early 1977, when Turkey stopped heating its prime minister's office, opposition leader [[Suleyman Demirel]] famously described the shortage as: "Turkey is in need of 70&amp;nbsp;cents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OY09BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 |title=State–Business Alliances and Economic Development: Turkey, Mexico and North Africa |first=Işık |last=Özel |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-317-81782-6 |page=34 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As political journalist [[William Greider]] summarized the situation: "Banks collected the deposits of revenue-rich OPEC governments and lent the money to developing nations so they could avoid bankruptcy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lFWuAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=revenue-rich |first=William |last=Greider |authorlink=William Greider |title=Secrets of the Temple |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |date=1987 |isbn=978-0-671-47989-3 |page=340 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades, many of these developing nations found their [[Latin American debt crisis|accumulated debts]] to be [[Unpayable debt|unpayably large]], concluding that it was a form of [[neocolonialism]] from which [[debt relief]] was the only escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606040838/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/contents/part4-I.shtml |chapter=Foreign Debt: Forgiveness and Repudiation |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/ebook.shtml |title=The E-Book on International Finance &amp; Development |first1=Enrique |last1=Carrasco |first2=Charles |last2=McClellan |first3=Jane |last3=Ro |publisher=[[University of Iowa]] |date=April 2007 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606000610/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/ebook.shtml |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005–2014 surge===
[[File:InflationAndInterestRates.png|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Inflation and interest rates surged with oil prices in the 1970s, but not in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=239792 |title=Federal Reserve Economic Data graph |publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, financial decision-makers were able to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced than they did in the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were much better contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/events/2007debtworkshop/david%20lubin.pdf |title=Petrodollars, emerging markets and vulnerability |first=David |last=Lubin |publisher=[[Citigroup]] |date=March 19, 2007 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/5136281 |title=Recycling the Petrodollars |newspaper=The Economist |date=November 10, 2005 |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/08/08/oil-liquidity-petrodollars-biz_0811oxford.html |title=World Economy Less Vulnerable To Petrodollars |author=Oxford Analytica |date=August 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign aid==
Oil-exporting countries have used part of their petrodollar surpluses to fund [[foreign aid]] programs, as a prominent example of so-called "[[checkbook diplomacy]]" or "[[petro-Islam]]". The [[Kuwait Fund]] was an early leader since 1961, and certain Arab nations became some of the largest donors in the years since 1974, including through the IMF and the [[OPEC Fund for International Development]].&lt;ref name=Oweiss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kuwait-fund.org/timeLine/?lang=en |title=Timeline |publisher=Kuwait Fund |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/world/middleeast/cables-released-by-wikileaks-reveal-saudis-checkbook-diplomacy.html |title=Cables Released by WikiLeaks Reveal Saudis' Checkbook Diplomacy |first=Ben |last=Hubbard |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 21, 2015 |accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil exporters have also aided poorer nations indirectly through the personal [[remittances]] sent home by tens of millions of [[Foreign worker#Foreign workers in Middle East|foreign workers in the Middle East]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-02-04/oil-s-plunge-spills-over |title=Oil's Plunge Spills Over |first=Andy |last=Mukherjee |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=February 4, 2016 |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although their working conditions are generally harsh.&lt;ref name=migrants/&gt; Even more controversially, several oil exporters have been major [[State-sponsored terrorism|financial supporters of armed groups]] challenging the governments of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/10/27/iranian-general-tehran-arming-liberation-armies.html |title=Iranian General: Tehran Arming 'Liberation Armies' |date=October 27, 2008 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cbb_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA208 |title=The Role of Terrorism in 21st-Century Warfare |first1=Leonard |last1=Weinberg |first2=Susanne |last2=Martin |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2016 |isbn=978-1-78499764-9 |at="Libya", pp. 207–208 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hillary-clinton-wikileaks-email-isis-saudi-arabia-qatar-us-allies-funding-barack-obama-knew-all-a7362071.html |title=US allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS |first=Patrick |last=Cockburn |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=October 14, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pacepa |first=Ion Mihai |authorlink=Ion Mihai Pacepa |title=Russian Footprints |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/218533/russian-footprints/ion-mihai-pacepa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109232047/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/218533/russian-footprints/ion-mihai-pacepa |archivedate=January 9, 2015 |deadurl=yes |journal=[[National Review]] |date=August 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-priced oil allowed the [[USSR]] to support the struggling economies of the [[Soviet bloc]] during the 1974–1981 petrodollar surge, and the loss of income during the [[1980s oil glut]] contributed to the bloc's collapse in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economics Behind the Fall of the Berlin Wall |first=Ryan |last=McMaken |publisher=[[Mises Institute]] |date=November 7, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |url=https://mises.org/library/economics-behind-fall-berlin-wall |quote=High oil prices in the 1970s propped up the regime so well, that had it not been for Soviet oil sales, it's quite possible the regime would have collapsed a decade earlier.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, OPEC member [[Venezuela]] played a similar role supporting [[Cuba]] and [[Petrocaribe|other regional allies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4179050.stm |title=Venezuela ends upbeat Cuba visit |first=Stephen |last=Gibbs |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=August 24, 2005 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the 2014–2017 oil downturn brought Venezuela to its own economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-colombia-idUSKCN0ZX0V9 |title=Venezuelan shoppers flock across border to Colombia |first=Anggy |last=Polanco |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=July 17, 2016 |accessdate=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janus as "radical prevention".&lt;ref name="Janus" /&gt; Its opposite is the [[punitive]] state, or any punitive methods, under which criminals are punished after a criminal act has been committed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6700/is_/ai_n28711705 BNET Articles United Kingdom]&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that punitive methods often involve incarceration, thereby preventing further crimes being committed by the individual, they can also be considered preventive.&lt;ref name="Steiker 774"&gt;Steiker 774&lt;/ref&gt; Michael L. Rich further defines as the "perfect preventive state" a situation in which targeted criminal conduct is made impossible by the mandates of government.&lt;ref name="Rich"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rich|first=Michael L.|title=Flipping the Murder Switch: The Limits of the Perfect Preventive State|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/events/criminal_justice/Fall2012/Roundtable_Rich_Perfect_Prevention.authcheckdam.pdf|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a wide scope for the use of preventive methods, which is constantly increased by developing technologies; in-vehicle technology responding to a user's [[blood alcohol level]] (BAL) and restricting use; restrictive measures in the infrastructure of the [[world wide web]] (i.e., preventing users' being able to illegally download music).&lt;ref name="Rich" /&gt;  Several countries have deployed them as a means of [[anti-terrorism]] in the wake of terrorist attacks; preventive measures can include intelligence gathering, detention and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigthink.com/ideas/3423 Big Think]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suicide terrorism]] is an example where a more preventive model is required because punishment of the individual after the crime is not possible, especially since most democracies are committed to principles of individual guilt and can not punish friends or relatives for the crimes of the individual.&lt;ref name=dershowitz2008&gt;{{citation | first=Alan M. | last=Dershowitz | title=Is There A Right To Remain Silent? | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-19-530779-5 | page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preventive policies have raised serious concerns about [[liberty]] and [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] in modern democracies, and continue to generate debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janus|first=Eric S.|title=Failure to protect: America's sexual predator laws and the rise of the preventive state|year=2006|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=978-0-8014-7531-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Administrative divisions of Sri Lanka}}

In [[Politics of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], [[province]]s ({{lang-si|පළාත|translit=Paḷāta}}; {{lang-ta|மாகாணம்|translit=Mākāṇam}}) are the first level [[administrative division]]. They were first established by the [[United Kingdom|British]] rulers of [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] in 1833. Over the next century most of the administrative functions were transferred to the [[Districts of Sri Lanka|districts]], the second level administrative division. By the middle of the 20th century the provinces had become merely [[ceremonial]]. This changed in 1987 when, following several decades of increasing demand for a [[Devolution|decentralization]], the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka|13th Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka]] established [[Provincial councils of Sri Lanka|provincial councils]].&lt;ref name="Law 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ulk.html|title=Provinces of Sri Lanka|last=Law|first=Gwillim|year=2010|work=statoids.com|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/ProvCouncils/ProvicialCouncils.html|work=Provincial Councils|publisher=[[Government of Sri Lanka]]|accessdate=16 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707214924/http://www.priu.gov.lk/ProvCouncils/ProvicialCouncils.html|archivedate=7 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are nine provinces.

After the British took control of the entire island of Ceylon in 1815 it was divided into three ethnic based administrative structures: Low Country Sinhalese, Kandyan Sinhalese and Tamil. In 1829 the British established the [[Colebrooke–Cameron Commission]] to review the colonial government of Ceylon, including its administrative structures.&lt;ref name=LoC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Colebrooke-Cameron Reforms|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13139.html|work=Sri Lanka|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission recommended that the existing three ethnic based administrations be unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces.&lt;ref name=LoC/&gt; Accordingly, on 1 October 1833 five provinces under one administration came into being:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Lennox A.|title=Ceylon Under British Rule 1795–1932|year=1933|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]/[[Humphrey S.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri Lanka North Eastern Province locator map.svg|200px|thumb|left|The short lived [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|North Eastern Province]]]]
The number of provinces remained static until September 1988 when, in accordance with the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Accord|Indo-Lanka Accord]], [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] [[J. R. Jayewardene|Jayewardene]] issued proclamations enabling the Northern and Eastern provinces to be one [[Administrative division|administrative unit]] administered by one elected Council, creating the [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|North Eastern Province]].&lt;ref name=DM171006&gt;{{cite news|last=Selvanayagam|first=S. S.|title=North-East merger illegal: SC|url=http://archives.dailymirror.lk/2006/10/17/front/02.asp|newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)]]|date=17 October 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403231109/http://archives.dailymirror.lk/2006/10/17/front/02.asp|archivedate=3 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamations were only meant to be a temporary measure until a [[referendum]] was held in the Eastern Province on a permanent merger between the two provinces. However, the referendum was never held and successive Sri Lankan presidents issued proclamations annually extending the life of the "temporary" entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sambandan|first=V. S.|title=Sri Lanka's North-East to remain united for another year|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2003/11/14/stories/2003111411881500.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=14 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was bitterly opposed by Sri Lankan [[nationalists]]. On 14 July 2006, after a long campaign against the merger, the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|JVP]] filed three separate [[petitions]] with the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka]] requesting a separate Provincial Council for the East.&lt;ref name=DM171006/&gt; On 16 October 2006 the Supreme Court ruled that the proclamations issued by President Jayewardene were null and void and had no legal effect.&lt;ref name=DM171006/&gt; The North-East Province was formally de-merged into the Northern and Eastern provinces on 1 January 2007.

Sri Lanka currently has nine provinces, seven of which have had provincial councils from the start.&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;

After graduating in 1977 from the Architectural Institute in [[Alma-Ata]], Nugmanov enrolled at the prestigious [[VGIK|Moscow State Film Institute]] (VGIK), the world's first institute of [[cinematography]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brashinsky |first=Michael |year=2000 |title=Igla |journal=International Dictionary of Film and Filmmakers |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5212/is_2000/ai_n19127240 |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His directorial debut, ''[[The Needle (1988 film)|The Needle]]'', premiered in September 1988 at the "Golden Duke" Festival in Odessa, where it won the Un Certain Regard prize. Starring popular Soviet rock musician [[Viktor Tsoi]], it was one of the first films to break the [[taboo]] against talking about [[drug addiction]] in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="drieu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drieu |first=Cloe |date=October 2000 |title=Don't Blink Now, It's Kazakhstan  |journal=UNESCO Courier |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_2000_Oct/ai_66495271 |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the [[USSR]] in February 1989 with 1,000 prints in circulation and became a [[box office]] hit viewed by over 30 million cinemagoers.&lt;ref name="drucker"/&gt; The film was also a critical success, winning First Prize at the [[Perspektive - Filmfestival der Menschenrechte|Nuremberg Film Festival]] and initiating the "Kazakh New Wave".

We are unified, instead, in our freedom and love of art".&lt;ref&gt;"Tysiacha i odna zabota," ''Iskusstuo kino'' 4 [1990]: 37)&lt;/ref&gt; Nugmanov served as President of the Union of Kazakh Filmmakers from 1989 until 1992, when he wrote, directed and produced ''[[The Wild East]]'', a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[punk subculture|punk]] [[samurai]] [[Ostern]] which attracted international acclaim at [[film festival]]s in [[Venice]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Tokyo]], and was awarded the Prix Special du Jury in [[Valenciennes]], France.

It was founded in 2011 by journalist and celebrity agriculturist [[Zaharije Trnavčević]]. 

==Ideology==
The goal of the party was to appeal to agronomists and entrepreneurs. Its policies were [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] and included tripling the agricultural subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/zaharije-trnavcevic-osniva-stranku/x5f7hc2|title=Zaharije Trnavčević osniva stranku|date=29 November 2015|website=Blic.rs|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glas-javnosti.rs/clanak/politika/glas-javbnosti-23-01-2011/zaharije-trnavcevic-predsednik-bogate-srbije|title=Zaharije Trnavčević predsednik "Bogate Srbije" - Glas javnosti|website=Glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Its founding assembly was held on 22 January, and the party was formally registered on 5 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mduls.gov.rs/doc/dokumenta/pstranke/IZVOD%20IZ%20REGISTRA%2003022015.pdf] {{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 election]], BS ran as part of the [[U-Turn (Serbian coalition)|U-Turn]] political alliance led by [[Čedomir Jovanović]], the head of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Serbia 2005)|Liberal Democratic Party]] and won 1 seat. However, almost immediately after the election, it broke from the coalition and joined the parliamentary majority with the [[Serbian Progressive Party|Progressives]] and [[Socialist Party of Serbia|Socialists]], siding with the [[Cabinet of Ivica Dačić|government of Ivica Dačić]], which it continued to support until the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Srbija/240846/Velja-ministar-za-gradevinu-i-urbanizam-|title=Vesti online / Vesti / Srbija / Mrkonjiću saobraćaj, a Velji građevinarstvo|website=Vesti-online.com|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 election]] the party ran in coalition with the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] and won no seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_id=811761|title=RIK proglasio listu DS-a - B92.net|website=B92.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/politika/u_parlamentu_18_stranaka.56.html?news_id=278572|title=U parlamentu 18 stranaka|website=Danas.rs|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 the party reached an agreement on beginning cooperation with the [[Third Serbia]] political movement led by [[Miroslav Parović]]. The party is ''de facto'' nonexistent as it was renamed Third Serbia - Rich Serbia ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Трећа Србија -Богата Србија) and is now led by Parović, effectively a merger of the two groups. This was opposed by some members of Third Serbia, and they split into a new movement called the [[Serbian League (political movement)|Serbian League]] led by [[Aleksandar Đurđev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/337919/Kako-se-obogatila-Treca-Srbija|title=Како се „обогатила“  Трећа Србија|first=С.|last=Ковачевић|website=Politika.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/vesti/vojvodina/bivsi-generalni-sekretar-trece-srbije-osnovao-svoju-ligu/02zns59|title=Bivši generalni sekretar Treće Srbije osnovao svoju Ligu|date=25 November 2015|website=Blic.rs|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rights of Man''''' (1791), a book by [[Thomas Paine]], including 31 articles, posits that popular political revolution is permissible when a government does not safeguard the natural rights of its people. Using these points as a base it defends the [[French Revolution]] against [[Edmund Burke]]'s attack in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/paine/rights/index.htm|title=''Rights of Man''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was published in two parts in March 1791 and February 1792.&lt;ref name="bl.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/635painerightsofman.html|title=Taking Liberties – Star Items – Paine's ''Rights of Man''|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Paine was a very strong supporter of the French Revolution that began in 1789; he visited France the following year. Many English thinkers supported it, including [[Richard Price]], who initiated the [[Revolution Controversy]] with his sermon and pamphlet drawing favourable parallels between the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and the French Revolution. Conservative intellectual [[Edmund Burke]] responded with a counter-revolutionary attack entitled ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), which strongly appealed to the [[landed gentry|landed class]] and sold 30,000 copies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Mark Philp, ‘Paine, Thomas (1737–1809)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21133, accessed 4 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's ''Rights of Man'' was printed by [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] for publication on 21 February 1791, then withdrawn for [[self-censorship|fear of prosecution]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; J. S. Jordan stepped in and published it on 16 March.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The 90,000-word book appeared on 13 March, three weeks later than scheduled. It sold as many as one million copies and was "eagerly read by reformers, [[English Dissenters|Protestant dissenters]], democrats, London craftsman, and the skilled factory-hands of the new industrial north".&lt;ref&gt;George Rudé, ''Revolutionary Europe: 1783–1815'' (1964) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
Paine argues that the interests of the monarch and his people are united, and insists that the French Revolution should be understood as one which attacks the despotic principles of the French monarchy, not the king himself, and he takes the [[Bastille]], the main prison in Paris, to symbolise the despotism that had been overthrown.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Natural and legal rights|Human rights originate in Nature]], thus, rights cannot be granted via political charter, because that implies that rights are legally revocable, hence, would be privileges:

{{quote|... It is a perversion of terms to say that a charter gives rights. It operates by a contrary effect—that of taking rights away. Rights are inherently in all the inhabitants; but charters, by annulling those rights, in the majority, leave the right, by exclusion, in the hands of a few ... They ... consequently are instruments of injustice ... The fact, therefore, must be that the individuals, themselves, each, in his own personal and sovereign right, entered into a contract with each other to produce a government: and this is the only mode in which governments have a right to arise, and the only principle on which they have a right to exist.|2=''Rights of Man'', I, London, 1795, pp. [https://books.google.be/books?id=M4cBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA125 125]-[https://books.google.be/books?id=M4cBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA126 126], ''Rights of Man'', II, London, 1795, p. [https://books.google.be/books?id=kkYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 13].}}

Government's sole purpose is safeguarding the individual and his/her inherent, inalienable rights; each societal institution that does not benefit the nation is illegitimate—especially monarchy and aristocracy. The book's acumen derives from the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and has been linked to the ''Second Treatise of Government'', by [[John Locke]] (even though Paine himself claimed to have never read this work).&lt;ref&gt;J. Fruchtman jr., ''The Political Philosophy of Thomas Paine'', Baltimore, 2009, p. [https://books.google.be/books?id=HqJeb93uwTwC&amp;pg=PA5 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

The fuller development of this position seems to have been worked out one night in France after an evening spent with [[Thomas Jefferson]], and possibly [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], discussing a pamphlet by the Philadelphia conservative [[James Wilson]] on the proposed federal constitution.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Paine - introd. ed. anot. M. Philp, ''Rights of Man, Common Sense, and Other Political Writings'', Oxford - e.a., 1995, p. [https://books.google.be/books?id=slgVDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR18 xviii].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation of English Government===

''Rights of Man'' concludes in proposing practical reformations of English government: [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|a written Constitution]] composed by a national assembly, in the American mould; the elimination of [[aristocratic class|aristocratic titles]], because democracy is incompatible with [[primogeniture]], which leads to the despotism of the family; a national budget without allotted military and war expenses; lower taxes for the poor, and [[right to education|subsidised education]] for them; and a [[progressive tax|progressive income tax]] weighted against wealthy estates to prevent the re-emergence of a hereditary aristocracy.

==Aristocracy==
Principally, ''Rights of Man'' opposes the idea of [[hereditary government]]—the belief that dictatorial government is necessary, because of man's corrupt, essential nature. In ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (1790) Edmund Burke says that true [[social stability]] arises if the nation's poor majority are governed by a minority of wealthy aristocrats, and that lawful inheritance of power (wealth, religious, governing) ensured the propriety of political power being the exclusive domain of the nation's élite [[social class]]—the nobility.

''Rights of Man'' denounces Burke's assertion of the nobility's inherent ''hereditary wisdom''; countering the implication that a nation has not a right to form a Government for governing itself. Paine refutes Burke's definition of Government as "a contrivance of human wisdom". Instead, Paine argues that Government is a contrivance of man, and it follows that [[hereditary succession]] and hereditary rights to govern cannot compose a Government—because the wisdom to govern cannot be inherited.

==Heredity==

Edmund Burke's counter-revolutionary ''Reflections on the French Revolution'' delineates the legitimacy of aristocratic government to the 1688 Parliamentary resolution declaring [[William and Mary of Orange]]—and their heirs—to be the true rulers of England. Paine puts forward two arguments against this view. Firstly, he argues that "Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself in all cases as the age and generations which preceded it." Secondly, Paine counters that the institution of monarchy should not be historically traced from 1688, but from 1066, when [[William of Normandy]] forcibly imposed his Norman rule upon Englishmen.

Thomas Paine's intellectual influence is perceptible in the two great political revolutions of the eighteenth century. He dedicated ''Rights of Man'' to [[George Washington]] and to the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], acknowledging the importance of the American and the French revolutions in his formulating the principles of modern democratic governance.

Thus, the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]]'' (''Déclaration des droits de l'Homme et du citoyen'') can be encapsulated so: (1) Men are born, and always continue, free and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility; (2) The end of all political associations is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man; and these rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression; and (3) The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; neither can any individual, nor any body of men, be entitled to any authority, which is not expressly derived from it.

These capsulations are akin to the self-evident truths concept that the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]] expresses.

==Analysis and public impact==
According to [[Mark Philp]], "In many respects ''Rights of Man'' is a disordered mix of narrative, principled argument, and rhetorical appeal—betraying the composite materials Paine used and the speed with which it was composed."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

It was quickly reprinted and widely circulated, with copies being read aloud in inns and [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|coffee houses]], so that by May some 50,000 copies were said to be in circulation. Of the 300 or more pamphlets which the revolution controversy spawned, ''Rights of Man'' was the first to seriously damage Burke's case and to restore credit to the French both in Britain and America.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The publication of ''Rights of Man'' caused a furore in England; [[Trial of Thomas Paine|Paine was tried ''in absentia'']], and convicted of [[seditious libel]] against the Crown, but was unavailable for hanging, being in France and never returning to England. ([[Sir Archibald Macdonald, 1st Baronet]] served as the prosecutor.)

Thomas Paine was not the only advocate of the rights of man or the only author of a work titled ''Rights of Man''. The working-class radical, [[Thomas Spence]], is among the first, in England, to use the phrase as a title. His 1775 lecture, usually titled ''The Rights of Man'', and his later ''The Rights of Infants'', offer a proto-[[geoist]] take on political philosophy mirroring Paine's work [[Agrarian Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas-spence-society.co.uk|title=thomas spence.co.uk – Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paine's acquaintance [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], whom he met via their common publisher, wrote ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' as one of the very first responses to Burke's attack on Richard Price. Her work was in print in December 1790, and was well reviewed. She extended the arguments in the book for which she is best remembered, the 1792 ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''.

'''Rolling elections''' are [[election]]s in which all [[Representative democracy|representatives]] in a body are elected, but these elections are spread over a period of time rather than all at once. Examples are the presidential [[primaries]] in the [[United States]], the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] in [[Germany]] and, due to logistics, general elections in [[Elections in Lebanon|Lebanon]] and [[Elections in India|India]]. The voting procedure in the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic]] are also a classical example.

In rolling elections, voters have information about previous voters' choices. While in the first elections, there may be plenty of hopeful candidates, in the last rounds consensus on one winner is generally achieved. In today's context of rapid communication, presidential candidates can put disproportionate resources into competing strongly in the first few stages, because those stages affect the reaction of latter stages.

'''Socialism in One Country''' was a theory put forth by [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]] in 1924 which was eventually adopted by the [[Soviet Union]] as state policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1924-2/industrialization-debate/industrialization-debate-texts/socialism-in-one-country-versus-permanent-revolution/|title=October Revolution and the Tactics of the Russian Communists.|last=Stalin|first=Joseph|date=December 17, 1925|publisher=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory held that given the defeat of all the [[communist revolution]]s in Europe in [[Revolutions of 1917–1923|1917–1923]] except [[October Revolution|Russia]], the Soviet Union should begin to strengthen itself internally. That turn toward [[national communism]] was a shift from the previously held position by [[classical Marxism]] that [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] must be established globally ([[world communism]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} However, proponents of the theory argue that it contradicts neither [[world revolution]] nor [[world communism]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The theory was in opposition to [[Leon Trotsky]]'s theory of [[permanent revolution]].

== Background ==
{{Further|Proletarian internationalism|World revolution|World communism}}
The defeat of several [[proletarian revolution]]s in countries like [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolsheviks]]' hopes for an imminent world revolution and began promotion of socialism in one country by Stalin. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin was still a follower of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s idea that revolution in one country is insufficient. Lenin died in January 1924 and by the end of that year in the second edition of the book Stalin's position started to turn around as he claimed the "[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country". In April 1925, Nikolai Bukharin elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?''. The Soviet Union adopted socialism in one country as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism''. 1925–1926 signaled a shift in the immediate activity of the Comintern (the [[Communist International]]) from world revolution towards a defense of the Soviet state. This period was known up to 1928 as the "Second Period", mirroring the shift in the Soviet Union from [[war communism]] to the [[New Economic Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Hallas. ''The Comintern''. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1985/comintern/ch5.htm "Chapter 5"].&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1915 article "On the Slogan for a United States of Europe", Lenin had written: &lt;blockquote&gt;Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. Hence, the victory of socialism is possible first in several or even in one capitalist country alone. After expropriating the capitalists and organising their own socialist production, the victorious proletariat of that country will arise against the rest of the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1918, Lenin wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;I know that there are, of course, sages who think they are very clever and even call themselves Socialists, who assert that power should not have been seized until the revolution had broken out in all countries. They do not suspect that by speaking in this way they are deserting the revolution and going over to the side of the bourgeoisie. To wait until the toiling classes bring about a revolution on an international scale means that everybody should stand stock-still in expectation. That is nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Speech delivered at a joint meeting of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Moscow Soviet, 14 May 1918, Collected Works, Vol. 23, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Stalinism sidebar}}
After Lenin's death, Stalin used these quotes and others to argue that Lenin shared his view of socialism in one country. [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and Leon Trotsky vigorously criticized the theory of socialism in one country. In particular, [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] often claimed and still claim that socialism in one country opposes both the basic tenets of [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism|Lenin's particular beliefs]]&lt;ref name="The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government"&gt;''The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government'' by V.I. Lenin (1918). ''Lenin' Collected Works'' 4th English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1972 Volume 27, pages 235-77 &lt;/ref&gt; that the final success of socialism in one country depends upon the revolution's degree of success in proletarian revolutions in the more advanced countries of [[Western Europe]]. At the Seventh Congress in March 1918, Lenin explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;Regarded from the world-historical point of view, there would doubtlessly be no hope of the ultimate victory of our revolution if it were to remain alone, if there were no revolutionary movements in other countries [...] I repeat, our salvation from all these difficulties is an all Europe revolution [...] At all events, under all conceivable circumstances, if the German revolution does not come, we are doomed.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

However, proponents of socialism in one country assert that though initially optimistic about the prospect of a communist revolution in Germany (which eventually never came), Lenin had strongly opposed banking solely on Western European revolutions to come to the rescue of the beleaguered Russian communists that too at such a definite and early date. They assert that Lenin had advocated a more pragmatic path for the revolution and its pilot, the R.C.P (B), that was based on building a close alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry (the proletariat being in the lead) and construction of complete socialism in Russia whilst patiently awaiting and aiding the [[Class conflict|class struggle]] to first mature around the world before a proletarian revolution on a worldwide scale is made plausible. 

To support this assertion, they quote Lenin's own words at the selfsame Seventh Congress in March 1918: &lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, we shall see the world revolution, but for the time being it is a very good fairy-tale, a very beautiful fairy-tale—I quite understand children liking beautiful fairy-tales. But I ask, is it proper for a serious revolutionary to believe in fairy-tales? There is an element of reality in every fairy-tale. If you told children fairy-tales in which the cock and the cat did not converse in human language they would not be interested. In the same way, if you tell the people that civil war will break out in Germany and also guarantee that instead of a clash with imperialism we shall have a field revolution on a world-wide scale, the people will say you are deceiving them. In doing this you will be overcoming the difficulties with which history has confronted us only in your own minds, by your own wishes. It will be a good thing if the German proletariat is able to take action. But have you measured it, have you discovered an instrument that will show that the German revolution will break out on such-and-such a day? [...] If the revolution breaks out, everything is saved. Of course! But if it does not turn out as we desire, if it does not achieve victory tomorrow—what then? Then the masses will say to you, you acted like gamblers—you staked everything on a fortunate turn of events that did not take place, you proved to be unequal to the situation that actually arose instead of the world revolution, which will inevitably come, but which has not yet reached maturity&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{cite book|title= V.I Lenin, Collected Works Vol. 27|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=101-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also cite his 1918 "[[Letter to American Workers]]" in which he wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;We are banking on the inevitability of the world revolution, but this does not mean that we are such fools as to bank on the revolution inevitably coming on a definite and early date.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Joseph Stalin ==
Stalin presented the theory of socialism in one country as a further development of [[Leninism]] based on Lenin's aforementioned quotations.

In his 14 February 1938 ''Response to Comrade Ivanov'', formulated as an answer to a question of a "comrade Ivanov" mailed to ''[[Pravda]]'' newspaper, Stalin splits the question in two parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/01/18.htm |title=On the Final Victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. |last=Stalin |first=Joseph |date=1938 |publisher=Marxist Internet Archive |access-date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first side of the question is in terms of the internal relations within the Soviet Union, whether it is possible to construct the socialist society by defeating the local bourgeoisie and fostering the union of workers and peasants.

Stalin quotes Lenin that "we have everything necessary to construct the complete socialism" and claims that the socialist society has for the most part been indeed constructed. The second side of the question is in terms of external relations and whether the victory of the socialism is "final", i.e. whether capitalism cannot possibly be restored. Here, Stalin cites Lenin that the final victory is possible only on the international scale and only with the help of the workers of other countries.

== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ==
On the question of socialist construction in a single country, [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;
:Will it be possible for this revolution to take place in one country alone?

No. By creating the world market, big industry has already brought all the peoples of the Earth, and especially the civilized peoples, into such close relation with one another that none is independent of what happens to the others.  Further, it has co-ordinated the social development of the civilized countries to such an extent that, in all of them, bourgeoisie and proletariat have become the decisive classes, and the struggle between them the great struggle of the day. It follows that the communist revolution will not merely be a national phenomenon but must take place simultaneously in all civilized countries—that is to say, at least in England, America, France, and Germany.  It will develop in each of these countries more or less rapidly, according as one country or the other has a more developed industry, greater wealth, a more significant mass of productive forces. Hence, it will go slowest and will meet most obstacles in Germany, most rapidly and with the fewest difficulties in England. It will have a powerful impact on the other countries of the world, and will radically alter the course of development which they have followed up to now, while greatly stepping up its pace.  It is a universal revolution and will, accordingly, have a universal range.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
: —Friedrich Engels, ''[[Principles of Communism]]'', 1847

However, a year later [[Karl Marx]] and Engels claimed: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationalities. The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
: —Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', 1848

In 1882, Marx and Engels wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
: —Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''The Communist Manifesto'', preface to the Russian edition, 1882

== In popular culture ==
The slogan was parodied in the novel ''[[Moscow 2042]],'' where "Communism in one city" was built.

__NOTOC__
A '''State Agricultural Farm''' ({{lang-pl|Państwowe Gospodarstwo Rolne}}, PGR) was a form of [[collective farming]] in the [[People's Republic of Poland]], similar to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[sovkhoz]] and to the [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] [[Volkseigenes Gut]].

They were created in 1949 as a form of [[socialist]] ownership of agricultural land by the government. They were primarily formed on the ''[[Regained Territories]]'' - lands that Poland acquired from Germany after the [[Second World War]] - but existed throughout Poland. Some farms took over farms of monasteries, e.g. in Szczyrzyc, see the picture. Relatively inefficient and subsidized by the government,  most PGRs went [[bankrupt]] quickly after the [[fall of communism]] and adoption of a [[market economy]] by Poland.

The state ran many specialised farms, which bred and trained horses (especially Arabians, e.g. [[Bask]]), bred cows, fishes, produced certified seed and potatoes. Some of the farms were state ones before the World War II. Many of the specialised farms still exist, controlled by the Agricultural Property Agency.

[[Farm]]s were created primarily on the basis of the earlier [[estate (land)|estates]]. Many of these households were founded on the ''[[Regained Territories]]''. Low efficiency of work and extensive social benefits for workers in many cases led to disastrous management with low productivity, causing state deficit.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

After moving to the [[market economy]] under the Act of October 19, 1991 on agricultural property of the Treasury&lt;ref&gt;{{Official Gazette | year = 1991 | number = 107 | position = 464}}&lt;/ref&gt; collective farms were liquidated and their assets were taken over by the Agricultural Property Agency of the Treasury (now [[Agricultural Property Agency]]), and their workers - 300 to 450 thousand people - joined the ranks of the [[unemployed]]. Households that have not been sold or leased were administered by the Agency of the State Treasury and managed by administrators appointed by the Agency. Then sought to sell or lease property holdings and the accompanying holdings, such as apartments, holiday resorts, etc. The social base has also been a sale of land to individual [[agriculture|farmers]]. The weakest part of the land remained undeveloped for several years. The process of selling and leasing land societies and social services continues.

Liquidation of state-owned farms has often been restricted, or permanent abandonment of animal husbandry, crop production limitation, changes in farming methods. This led to a drastic reduction of jobs and the resulting wide range of local problems; in many regions, PGR were the only employer, the new owners after restructuring usually significantly reduced the employment. State-owned farms were very often the organizers of social life, and theoretically adequately met all the needs of [[worker]]s. Their downfall has often caused damage to the [[Social structure|structure of the local communities]], which were not adapted to the new situation of economic activity. It has also devastated the property - partly as a result of theft, partly because of the lack of elementary security.

On 22 July 2008 in [[Bolegorzyn]], near [[Złocieniec]] a museum of the State Farms was opened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842.5056842.

'''State atheism''' is the incorporation of [[positive atheism]] or [[non-theism]] into [[Forms of government|political regimes]], particularly associated with Soviet systems.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XguDDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last1=Bullivant|first1=Stephen|last2=Lee|first2=Lois|title=A Dictionary of Atheism|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191816819|quote=State Atheism is the name given to the incorporation of positive atheism or non-theism into political regimes, particularly associated with Soviet systems. State Atheisms have tended to be as much anti-clerical and anti-religious as they are anti-theist, and typically place heavy restrictions on acts of religious organization and the practice of religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a [[secular state]] purports to be officially neutral in matters of [[religion]], supporting neither religion nor [[irreligion]].&lt;ref name="Jeroen 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Temperman|first1=Jeroen|title=State-Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law : Towards a Right to Religiously Neutral Governance|date=2010|publisher=Brill Academic/Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9789004181489|page=140|quote=Although the historical underlying incentives that accompanied the establishment of a secular state may have been characterized by criticism of certain religious doctrines or practices, presently a state of secularity in itself does not necessarily reflect value judgements about religion. In other words, state secularism does not come down to an official rejection of religion. State secularism denotes an intention on the part of the state to not affiliate itself with religion, to not consider itself a priori bound by religious principles (unless they are reformulated into secular state laws) and to not seek to justify its actions by invoking religion. Such a state of secularity denotes official impartiality in matters of religion rather than official irreligiosity. By contrast, secularism as a philosophical notion can indeed be construed as an ideological defense of the secular cause, which might include criticism of or scepticism towards religion. Thus, states that are 'ideologically secular' and that declare secular world-views the official state doctrine give evidence, explicitly or by implication, of judgements about the value of religion within society. Most versions of state communism, for instance, embrace Marxist criticism of religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; State atheism may refer to a government's [[anti-clericalism]], which opposes religious institutional power and influence in all aspects of public and political life, including the involvement of religion in the everyday life of the citizen.&lt;ref name="Jeroen 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Temperman|first1=Jeroen|title=State-Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law : Towards a Right to Religiously Neutral Governance|date=2010|publisher=Brill Academic/Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9789004181489|pages=140–141|quote=Before the end of the Cold War, many Communist States did not shy away from being openly hostile to religion.

The 1976 Constitution of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, for instance, was firmly based on a Marxist dismissal of religion as the opiate of the masses. It provided: "The state recognizes no religion of any kind and supports and develops the atheist view so as to ingrain in to the people the scientific and materialistic world-view."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FrankenLoobuyck2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franken|first1=Leni|last2=Loobuyck|first2=Patrick|title=Religious Education in a Plural, Secularised Society.

The Soviet Union attempted to suppress public religious expression over wide areas of its influence, including places such as [[central Asia]].

==Communist states==
{{Main|Marxism and religion}}

A [[communist state]], in popular usage, is a [[State (polity)|state]] with a [[form of government]] characterized by [[One-party state|one-party rule]] or [[Dominant-party system|dominant-party rule]] of a [[communist party]] and a professed allegiance to a [[Leninist]] or [[Marxist–Leninist]] [[Communism|communist]] ideology as the guiding principle of the state.  The founder and primary theorist of [[Marxism]], the nineteenth-century German thinker [[Karl Marx]], had an ambivalent attitude toward religion, viewing it primarily as "the [[opium of the people]]" that had been used by the ruling classes to give the [[working classes]] false hope for millennia, whilst at the same time recognizing it as a form of protest by the working classes against their poor economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, John. 2002. "Introduction". ''Marx on Religion'' (Marx, Karl). Philadelphia: Temple University Press. Page 05-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Marxist–Leninist interpretation of Marxist theory, developed primarily by Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], religion is seen as negative to human development, and communist states that follow a Marxist–Leninist variant are [[Atheism|atheistic]] and explicitly [[Antireligion|antireligious]].&lt;ref name=Lenin&gt;

Baggini goes on to argue that "Fundamentalism is a danger in any belief system" and that "Atheism's most authentic political expression... takes the form of state secularism, not state atheism."

State atheism, (''gosateizm'', a [[Abbreviation#Syllabic abbreviation|syllabic abbreviation]] of "state" (''gosudarstvo'') and "atheism" (''ateizm'')), was a major goal of the official [[Soviet]] ideology.&lt;ref name="Kowalewski1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowalewski|first1=David|title=Protest for Religious Rights in the USSR: Characteristics and Consequences|journal=Russian Review|jstor=128810|publisher=Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Editors and Board of Trustees of the Russian Review|volume=39|issue=4|year=1980|pages=426–441|issn=0036-0341|doi=10.2307/128810}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To that end, the regime expropriated church property, publication of information against religious beliefs and the official promotion of anti-religious materials in the education system.

After the [[Russian Civil War]], the state used its resources to stop the implanting of religious beliefs in nonbelievers and remove "prerevolutionary remnants" that still existed.&lt;ref name="Kowalewski1980"/&gt; The [[Bolsheviks]] were particularly hostile toward the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (which supported the [[White Movement]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]) and saw it as a supporter of [[Tsarist autocracy]].&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sheila Fitzpatrick|title=Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village After Collectivization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlBvcNMlr4EC|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510459-2|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a process of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] of land, Orthodox priests distributed pamphlets declaring that the Soviet regime was the [[Antichrist]] coming to place "the Devil's mark" on the peasants, and encouraged them to resist the government.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick1996"/&gt; [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|Political repression]] was widespread in the Soviet Union, and while religious persecution was applied to most religions,&lt;ref name=RussianOrthodox /&gt; the regime's anti-religious campaigns were often directed against specific religions based on state interests, that varied over time. The attitude in the Soviet Union toward religion varied from a total ban on some religions to official support of others.

From the late 1920s to the late 1930s, such organizations as the [[League of Militant Atheists]] ridiculed all religions and harassed believers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy]] (2006), ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 271 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-religious and atheistic propaganda was implemented into every portion of soviet life: in schools, communist organizations such as the [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization|Young Pioneer Organization]], and the media. Though Lenin originally introduced the [[Gregorian calendar]] to the Soviets, subsequent efforts to reorganise the week to improve worker productivity saw the introduction of the [[Soviet calendar]], which had the side-effect that a "holiday will seldom fall on Sunday".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Within about a year of the revolution, the state [[Eminent domain|expropriated]] all church property, including the churches themselves, and in the period from 1922 to 1926, 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and more than 1,200 priests were killed (a much greater number was subjected to persecution).&lt;ref name=RussianOrthodox&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/russia/38.htm Country Studies: Russia-The Russian Orthodox Church] U.S. Library of Congress, Accessed Apr. 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Most seminaries were closed, and publication of religious writing was banned.&lt;ref name=RussianOrthodox /&gt;  The Russian Orthodox Church, which had 54,000 parishes before World War I, was reduced to 500 by 1940.&lt;ref name=RussianOrthodox /&gt;  A meeting of the Antireligious Commission of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party ([[Bolsheviks]]) that occurred on 23 May 1929 estimated the portion of believers in the [[USSR]] at 80 percent, though this percentage may be understated to prove the successfulness of the struggle with religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marjorie Mandelstam Balzer|title=Religion and Politics in Russia: A Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DEufvUyRcygC|year=2009|publisher=M.E.

===Albania===
{{Main|Religion in Albania#Communist Albania|Freedom of religion in Albania|Irreligion in Albania}}
Religion in [[Albania]] was subordinated to the interests of nationalism during periods of national revival, when it was identified as foreign predation to Albanian culture. During the late nineteenth century, and also when Albania became a state, religions were suppressed in order to better unify Albanians. This nationalism was also used to justify the communist stance of state atheism from 1967 to 1991.&lt;ref name="Hall1999"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3060414 Representations of Place: Albania], Derek R. Hall, ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 165, No. 2, The Changing Meaning of Place in Post-Socialist Eastern Europe: Commodification, Perception and Environment (Jul., 1999), pp. 161–172, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) "the perception that religion symbolized foreign (Italian, Greek and Turkish) predation was used to justify the communists' stance of state atheism (1967-1991)."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agrarian Reform Law (Albania)|Agrarian Reform Law]] of August 1945 nationalized most property of religious institutions, including the estates of mosques, monasteries, orders, and dioceses. Many clergy and believers were tried and some were executed. All foreign Roman Catholic priests, monks, and nuns were expelled in 1946.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-186.html|title=Albania - Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign|work=country-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious communities or branches that had their headquarters outside the country, such as the [[Jesuit]] and [[Franciscan]] orders, were henceforth ordered to terminate their activities in Albania. Religious institutions were forbidden to have anything to do with the education of the young, because that had been made the exclusive province of the state. All religious communities were prohibited from owning real estate and from operating philanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals.
Although there were tactical variations in [[Enver Hoxha]]'s approach to each of the major denominations, his overarching objective was the eventual destruction of all organized religion in Albania. Between 1945 and 1953, the number of priests was reduced drastically and the number of Roman Catholic churches was decreased from 253 to 100, and all Catholics were stigmatized as fascists.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

The campaign against religion peaked in the 1960s. Beginning in February 1967 the Albanian authorities launched a campaign to eliminate religious life in Albania. Despite complaints, even by [[Party of Labour of Albania|APL]] members, all churches, mosques, monasteries, and other religious institutions were either closed down or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, or workshops by the end of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-170.html|title=Albania - The Cultural and Ideological Revolution|work=country-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1967, religious institutions had been forced to relinquish all 2,169 churches, mosques, cloisters, and shrines in Albania, many of which were converted into cultural centers for young people. As the literary monthly Nendori reported the event, the youth had thus "created the first atheist nation in the world."&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

Clerics were publicly vilified and humiliated, their vestments were taken and desecrated. More than 200 clerics of various faiths were imprisoned, others were forced to seek work in either industry or agriculture, and some were executed or starved to death. The cloister of the Franciscan order in Shkodër was set on fire, which resulted in the death of four elderly monks.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, "The state recognizes no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people.",&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjoerna.dk/dokumentation/Albanian-Constitution-1976.htm#C.%20Education,%20Science,%20Culture C. Education, Science, Culture], The Albanian Constitution of 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeroen 2" /&gt; and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for "religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} A new decree that in effect targeted Albanians with Muslim and Christian names, stipulating that citizens whose names did not conform to "the political, ideological, or moral standards of the state" were to change them.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} It was also decreed that towns and villages with religious names must be renamed.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Hoxha's brutal antireligious campaign succeeded in eradicating formal worship, but some Albanians continued to practice their faith clandestinely, risking severe punishment.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Individuals caught with Bibles, Qurans, icons, or other religious objects faced long prison sentences. Religious weddings were prohibited.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Parents were afraid to pass on their faith, for fear that their children would tell others. Officials tried to entrap practicing Christians and Muslims during religious fasts, such as [[Lent]] and [[Ramadan]], by distributing dairy products and other forbidden foods in school and at work, and then publicly denouncing those who refused the food. Those clergy who conducted secret services were incarcerated.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt; Catholic priest [[Kurti, Shtjefen|Shtjefen Kurti]] had been executed for secretly baptizing a child in [[Shkodër]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Sinishta, G., 1976. The Fulfilled Promise: A Documentary Account of Religious Persecution in Albania. Albanian Catholic Information Center, Santa Clara.&lt;/ref&gt;

The article was interpreted by Danes as violating The [[United Nations Charter]] (chapter 9, article 55) which declares that [[religious freedom]] is an inalienable human right. The first time that the question came before the United Nations' [[Commission on Human Rights]] at Geneva was as late as 7 March 1983. A delegation from Denmark got its protest over Albania's violation of religious liberty placed on the agenda of the thirty-ninth meeting of the commission, item 25, reading, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief.", and on 20 July 1984 a member of the [[Danish Parliament]] inserted an article into one of Denmark's major newspapers protesting the violation of religious freedom in Albania.

The 1998 [[Constitution of Albania]] defined the country as a [[parliamentary republic]], and established personal and political rights and freedoms, including protection against coercion in matters of religious belief.&lt;ref name=uscirf-oic&gt;{{cite web|title=The Religion-State Relationship and the Right to Freedom of Religion or Belief: A Comparative Textual Analysis of the Constitutions of Majority Muslim Countries and Other OIC Members|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/resources/USCIRF%20Constitution%20Study%202012%20(full%20Text(2)).pdf|publisher= U.S. COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2013statealbania/&gt; Albania is a member state of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]],&lt;ref name=uscirf-oic/&gt; and the 2011 census found that 58.79% of Albanians adhere to [[Islam]], making it the largest [[religion]] in the country.

Press 2004&lt;/ref&gt; For much of its early history, that government maintained under [[Marxism|Marxist]] thought that religion would ultimately disappear, and characterized it as emblematic of [[feudalism]] and foreign [[colonialism]].

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], student vigilantes known as [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] converted religious buildings for secular use or destroyed them. This attitude, however, relaxed considerably in the late 1970s, with the [[reform and opening up]] period. The [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] with a number of restrictions.  Since then, there has been a massive program to rebuild Buddhist and Taoist temples that were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.

The Communist Party has said that religious belief and membership are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/212827/no-religion-chinese-communist-party.html "No Religion for Chinese Communist Party Cadres".

Article 36 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] of 1982 specifies that:

{{blockquote|Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief.

:*Buddhists 8%.
:*Taoists, unknown as a percentage partly because it is fused along with Confucianism and Buddhism.
:*Muslims, 1%, with more than 20,000 [[Imams]]. Other estimates state at least 1%.
:*Christians, Protestants at least 2%. Catholics, about 1%.

Statistics relating to [[Buddhism]] and religious [[Taoism]] are to some degree incomparable with statistics for [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. This is due to the traditional [[China|Chinese]] belief system which blends [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Taoism]], so that a person who follows a traditional belief system would not necessarily identify him- or herself as exclusively Buddhist or Taoist, despite attending Buddhist or Taoist places of worship. According to Peter Ng, Professor of the Department of Religion at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, {{as of|2002|lc=y}}, 95% of Chinese were religious in some way if religion is considered to include traditional folk practices such as burning incense for gods or ancestors at life-cycle or seasonal festivals, fortune telling and related customary practices.&lt;ref name=madsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=Richard|title=Chinese society: change, conflict and resistance|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-56073-3|editor=Elizabeth J.

The Constitution of 1917 also forbade the existence of monastic orders (article 5) and any religious activity outside of church buildings (now owned by the government), and mandated that such religious activity would be overseen by the government (article 24).&lt;ref name="ilstu.edu"/&gt;

Due to the strict enforcement of anti-clerical laws, people in strongly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] states, especially [[Jalisco]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Colima]] and [[Michoacán]], began to oppose him, and this opposition led to the [[Cristero War]] from 1926 to 1929, which was characterized by brutal atrocities on both sides. Some Cristeros applied terrorist tactics, while the Mexican government persecuted the clergy, killing suspected Cristeros and supporters and often retaliating against innocent individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Plutarco_Elias_Calles.aspx Calles, Plutarco Elías] The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001–05 Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 1926, Calles was awarded a medal of merit from the head of Mexico's Scottish rite of Freemasonry for his actions against the Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storialibera.it/epoca_contemporanea/messico_1926-1929/articolo.php?id=508 The Cristeros: 20th century Mexico's Catholic uprising, from The Angelus, January 2002, Volume XXV, Number 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903020244/http://www.storialibera.it/epoca_contemporanea/messico_1926-1929/articolo.php?id=508 |date=2009-09-03 }} by Olivier LELIBRE, [[The Angelus (magazine)|The Angelus]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A truce was negotiated with the assistance of U.S. Ambassador [[Dwight Whitney Morrow]].&lt;ref name="Blood Drenched Altars"&gt;Van Hove, Brian [http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/FR94204.TXT Blood Drenched Altars] 1996 EWTN&lt;/ref&gt; Calles, however, did not abide by the terms of the truce – in violation of its terms, he had approximately 500 Cristero leaders and 5,000 other Cristeros shot, frequently in their homes in front of their spouses and children.&lt;ref name="Blood Drenched Altars"/&gt; Particularly offensive to Catholics after the supposed truce was Calles' insistence on a complete state monopoly on education, suppressing all Catholic education and introducing "socialist" education in its place: "We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth.".&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"&gt;Van Hove, Brian [http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/FR94204.TXT Blood-Drenched Altars] Faith &amp; Reason 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution continued as Calles maintained control under his [[Maximato]] and did not relent until 1940, when President [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]], a believing Catholic, took office.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"/&gt; This attempt to indoctrinate the youth in atheism was begun in 1934 by amending Article 3 to the [[Mexican Constitution]] to eradicate religion by mandating "socialist education", which "in addition to removing all religious doctrine" would "combat fanaticism and prejudices", "build[ing] in the youth a rational and exact concept of the universe and of social life".&lt;ref name="lawreview.byu.edu"/&gt; In 1946 this "socialist education" was removed from the constitution and the document returned to the less egregious generalized secular education.
The effects of the war on the Church were profound.

Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is designed to protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116043952/http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html|archivedate=2015-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views."

The '''United States Department of Commerce''' is the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] department of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] concerned with promoting [[economic growth]]. Among its tasks are gathering economic and demographic data for business and government decision-making, and helping to set industrial standards. This organization's main purpose is to create jobs, promote economic growth, encourage sustainable development and improve standards of living for all Americans.&lt;ref name="Commerce Dept 1995"&gt;[[Steve Charnovitz]], "Reinventing the Commerce Dept.," ''Journal of Commerce'', July 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Commerce headquarters is the [[Herbert C. Hoover Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

[[Wilbur Ross]] is the current Commerce secretary.

==History==
The department was originally created as the [[United States Department of Commerce and Labor]] on February 14, 1903. It was subsequently renamed the Department of Commerce on March 4, 1913, as the bureaus and agencies specializing in labor were transferred to the new [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] was transferred from the Interior Department into Commerce, and the Federal Employment Stabilization Office existed within the department from 1931 to 1939. In 1940, the Weather Bureau (now the [[National Weather Service]]) was transferred from the Agriculture Department, and the [[Civil Aeronautics Authority]] was merged into the department. In 1949, the [[Public Roads Administration]] was added to the department due to the dissolution of the [[Federal Works Agency]]. In 1958, the independent [[Federal Aviation Agency]] was created and the Civil Aeronautics Authority was abolished. The [[United States Travel Service]] was established by the [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] on July 1, 1961 pursuant to the International Travel Act of 1961 (75 Stat. 129; 22 U.S.C. 2121 note)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Travel and Tourism Administration (1961-1996)|url=https://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/socialsciences/docdigiproj/traveltourism.html|website=Department of Commerce Digitization Repository Project|publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]]|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Economic Development Administration]] was created in 1965. In 1966, the Bureau of Public Roads was transferred to the newly created Department of Transportation. The [[Minority Business Development Agency]] (MBDA) was created on March 5, 1969, originally established by President Richard M. Nixon as the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.
The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) was created on October 3, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones|url=http://2001-2009.commerce.gov/About_Us/Milestones/|publisher=United States Department of Commerce|accessdate=January 19, 2012|date=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reorganization proposals==

{{Update|section|date=March 2018}}

Proposals to reorganize the Department go back many decades.&lt;ref name="Commerce Dept 1995"/&gt; The Department of Commerce was one of three departments that Texas governor [[Rick Perry]] [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2012#November 9, 2011 – Auburn Hills, Michigan|advocated eliminating]] during his [[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012|2012 presidential campaign]], along with the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. Perry's campaign cited the frequency with which agencies had historically been moved into and out of the department and its lack of a coherent focus, and advocated moving its vital programs into other departments such as the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], and [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]. The [[Economic Development Administration]] would be completely eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uproot and Overhaul Washington: Eliminate and Restructure Wasteful Federal Agencies|url=http://www.rickperry.org/uproot-and-overhaul-washington-html/#eliminate|publisher=RickPerry.org, Inc.|accessdate=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2012, President Obama announced his intentions to ask the United States Congress for the power to close the department and replace it with a new cabinet-level agency focused on trade and exports. The new agency would include the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], currently part of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]], as well as the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States]], the [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]], the [[United States Trade and Development Agency]], and the [[Small Business Administration]], which are all currently [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agencies]]. The Obama administration projected that the reorganization would save $3 billion and would help the administration's goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|last=MacInnis|first=Laura|title=Obama wants export agency, closing of Commerce Department|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/13/us-usa-obama-reform-idUSTRE80C0SA20120113|accessdate=January 19, 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new agency would be organized around four "pillars": a technology and innovation office including the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]; a statistical division including the [[United States Census Bureau]] and other data-collection agencies currently in the Commerce Department, and also the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] which would be transferred from the Department of Labor; a trade and investment policy office; and a small business development office. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) would be transferred from the Department of Commerce into the Department of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mervis|first=Jeffrey|title=What Would Wiping Out the Commerce Department Mean for Science?|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/01/what-would-wiping-out-the-commerce.html|work=ScienceInsider|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=January 19, 2012|date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, shortly before the 2012 presidential election, Obama invoked the idea of a "secretary of business" in reference to the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schroeder|first=Peter|title=Obama floats plan for a 'secretary of Business' if he wins second term|url=http://thehill.com/policy/finance/264587-obama-calls-for-a-secretary-of-business|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=May 23, 2014|date=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reorganization was part of a larger proposal which would grant the President the authority to propose mergers of federal agencies, which would then be subject to an up-or-down Congressional vote. This ability had existed from the Great Depression until the Reagan presidency, when Congress rescinded the authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Landler|first=Mark|title=Obama Bid to Cut the Government Tests Congress|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/14/us/politics/obama-to-ask-congress-for-power-to-merge-agencies.html|accessdate=January 19, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2012|author2=Lowrey, Annie|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama administration plan faced criticism for some of its elements. Some Congress members expressed concern that the Office of the United States Trade Representative would lose focus if it were included in a larger bureaucracy, especially given its status as an "honest broker" between other agencies, which tend to advocate for specific points of view.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt; The overall plan has also been criticized as an attempt to create an agency similar to Japan's powerful [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]], which was abolished in 2001 after some of its initiatives failed and it became seen as a hindrance to growth.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartlett|first=Bruce|title=The Pros and Cons of Obama's Reorganization Plan|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/the-pros-and-cons-of-obamas-reorganization-plan/|series=Economix|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 19, 2012|date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOAA's climate and terrestrial operations and fisheries and endangered species programs would be expected to integrate well with agencies already in the Interior Department, such as the [[United States Geological Survey]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. However, environmental groups such as the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] feared that the reorganization could distract the agency from its mission of protecting the nation's oceans and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malakoff|first=David|title=Rough Sailing for Plan to Move NOAA?|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/01/rough-sailing-for-plan-to-move.html|work=ScienceInsider|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=January 19, 2012|date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was reiterated in the Obama administration's [[2016 United States federal budget|FY2016 budget proposal]] that was released in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Josh|title=Six ways the White House budget would affect federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2015/02/03/six-ways-the-white-house-budget-would-affect-federal-workers/|accessdate=February 3, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
