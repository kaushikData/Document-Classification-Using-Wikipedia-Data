The '''United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum''', also known as the '''UK-wide referendum on the Parliamentary voting system''' was held on Thursday 5 May 2011 (the same date as local elections in many areas) in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) to choose the method of electing MPs at subsequent general elections as part of the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]] drawn up after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] which had resulted in the first [[hung parliament]] since [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974]] and also indirectly in the aftermath of the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 expenses scandal]] under the provisions of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]] and was the first national referendum to be held under provisions laid out in the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]].

The [[referendum]] concerned whether or not to replace the present "[[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]" system with the "[[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]]" (AV) method and was the first national referendum to be held across the whole of the United Kingdom in the twenty first century. The proposal to introduce AV was overwhelmingly rejected by 67.9% of voters on a national turnout of 42%.

This was only the second UK-wide referendum to be held (after the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|EC referendum back in 1975]]) and is to date the only UK-wide referendum to be held on an issue not related to the [[European Union|European Economic Community (Common Market) or European Union]] and was also the first UK-wide referendum to be overseen by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]. It was also the first that was not merely [[Public consultation|consultative]]: it committed the government to give effect to its decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/1/section/8/enacted|title=Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011: Section 8|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All registered electors over 18 ([[British citizen|British]], [[Irish citizen|Irish]] and [[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth]] citizens living in the UK and enrolled British citizens living outside)&lt;ref name="ECbooklet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Local elections and Referendum|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/PDF/England-accessible.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410141102/http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/PDF/England-accessible.pdf#|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 April 2011|work=[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]|year=2011|accessdate=8 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – including Members of the [[House of Lords]] (who cannot vote in UK general elections) – were entitled to take part.

On a turnout of 42.2 per cent, 68 per cent voted "No" and 32 per cent voted "Yes". Ten of the 440 local voting areas recorded 'Yes' votes above 50 per cent: those in Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh Central and Glasgow Kelvin, with the remaining six in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/1/section/2 |title=Parliamentary Voting Systems and Constituencies Act 2011, Section 2(1)(b) |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was described in retrospect by political scientist Iain McLean as a "bad-tempered and ill-informed public debate".&lt;ref&gt;McLean, I.

==History==

===Historical context===
{{Main|Electoral reform in the United Kingdom}}

The Alternative Vote and the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) for the House of Commons were debated in Parliament several times between 1917 and 1931 and came close to being adopted. Both the Liberals and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] at various times supported a change from non-transferable voting to AV or STV in one-, two- and three-member constituencies. STV was adopted for the [[University constituency|university seats]] (which were abolished in 1949).&lt;ref&gt;Butler DE (1953), "The Electoral System in Britain 1918–1951", Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Both AV and STV involve voters rank ordering preferences. However, STV is considered to be a form of [[proportional representation]], using multi-member constituencies, while AV, in single-member constituencies, is not.&lt;ref&gt;Taagepera, R. and Shugart, M. S. (1989): Seats and Votes. The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems. Yale University Press, New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 all constituencies became single-member and all votes non-transferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge50/results.htm|title=UK General Election 1950: voting results and statistics [Archive]|work=politicsresources.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then until 2010, the Labour and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] parties, the two parties who formed [[List of British Governments|each government of the United Kingdom]] normally by virtue of an overall majority in the Commons, always voted down proposals for moving away from this uniform "[[First-past-the-post voting|First-past-the-post]]" (FPTP) voting system for the Commons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Other voting systems were introduced for various other British elections. STV was reintroduced in Northern Ireland and list-PR introduced for European elections except in Northern Ireland.

While out of power, the Labour Party set up a working group to examine electoral reform. The resulting [[Plant Commission]] reported in 1993 and recommended the adoption, for Commons elections, of the [[supplementary vote]], the system used to elect the London Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/plant-commission-moves-towards-pr-labour-working-party-wants-first-past-post-system-for-electing-mps-scrapped-1452577.html Plant commission moves towards PR: Labour working party wants 'first past post' system for electing MPs scrapped], by Patricia Wynn Davies, ''The Independent'', 1 April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Labour's 1997 manifesto committed the party to a referendum on the voting system for the Commons and to setting up an independent commission to recommend a proportional alternative to FPTP to be put in that referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020821164207/http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 August 2002 |title=1997 Labour Party Manifesto |publisher=Labour-party.org.uk |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning the 1997 General Election, the new Labour government consequently set up the [[Jenkins Commission (UK)|Jenkins Commission]] into electoral reform, supported by the Liberal Democrats, the third party in British politics in recent years and long supporters of proportional representation. (The Commission chair, [[Roy Jenkins]], was a Liberal Democrat peer and former Labour minister.) The commission reported in September 1998 and proposed the novel [[alternative vote top-up|alternative vote top-up or AV+ system]]. Having been tasked to meet a "requirement for broad proportionality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4090/terms.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917082440/http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4090/terms.htm# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 September 2002 |title=The Report of the Independent Commission on the Voting System: Terms of Reference |publisher=Archive.official-documents.co.uk |accessdate=12 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Commission rejected both FPTP, as the status quo, and AV as options. It pointed out (chapter 3, para 21) that "the single-member constituency is not an inherent part of the British parliamentary tradition. It was unusual until 1885...Until [then] most seats were two-member..." (the English system established in 1276). Jenkins rejected AV because "so far from doing much to relieve disproportionality, it is capable of substantially adding to it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4090/chap-5.htm#c5-a |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021217012514/http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4090/chap-5.htm#c5-a#c5-a |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 December 2002 |title=The Report of the Independent Commission on the Voting System: Chapter 5, Sections 81–85 |publisher=Archive.official-documents.co.uk |accessdate=12 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; AV was also described as "disturbingly unpredictable" and "unacceptably unfair".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/14/alternative-vote-electoral-reform|title=AV won't improve our electoral system {{!}} David Rowntree|last=Rowntree|first=David|date=2011-03-14|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, legislation for a referendum was not put forward. Proportional systems were introduced for the new [[Scottish Parliament]] and Welsh and London Assemblies, and the supplementary vote was introduced for mayoral elections. With [[House of Lords Act 1999|House of Lords reform in 1999]], AV was introduced to [[By elections to the House of Lords|elect replacements]] for the remaining 92 hereditary peers who sit in the [[House of Lords|Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12400281 Landale Online: Rebellious peers to use AV voting], by James Landale, BBC News, 9 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

At the next General Election in 2001, the Labour manifesto stated that they would review the experience of the new systems (in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) and the Jenkins report, to assess the possibility of changes to the Commons, which would still be subject to a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/2001/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020829224049/http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/2001/# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 August 2002 |title=2001 Labour Party Manifesto |publisher=Labour-party.org.uk |accessdate=18 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electoral reform in the Commons remained at a standstill, although in the Scottish Parliament, a coalition of Labour and the Liberal Democrats introduced STV for local elections in Scotland.

===Pre-election===
In February 2010, the Labour Government, which had been in power since 1997, used their majority to pass an amendment to their [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005|Constitutional Reform Bill]] to include a referendum on the introduction of AV to be held in the next Parliament, citing a desire to restore trust in Parliament in the wake of the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 expenses scandal]].&lt;ref name=BBC9Feb2010MPsBackReferendum/&gt; A Liberal Democrat amendment to hold the referendum earlier, and on STV,&lt;ref&gt;[http://main.hop.lbi.co.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-05317.pdf AV and electoral reform]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}, by Isobel White, House of Commons Library&lt;/ref&gt; was defeated by 476 votes to 69.&lt;ref name=BBC9Feb2010MPsBackReferendum/&gt; There was insufficient time remaining in the term of that Parliament for the Bill to become law before Parliament was dissolved; and so the move was dismissed by several Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs as a political manoeuvre.&lt;ref name=BBC9Feb2010MPsBackReferendum/&gt;

In the ensuing 2010 general election campaign, the Labour manifesto supported the introduction of AV via a referendum, to "ensure that every MP is supported by the majority of their constituents voting at each election".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110102200613/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2010/12/29/a-blank-sheet-of-paper/ A "blank sheet of paper"?], by John Rentoul, 29 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal Democrats argued for proportional representation, preferably by single transferable vote, and the Conservatives argued for the retention of FPTP. Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats proposed reducing the number of MPs, while the Conservative Party argued for more equal sized constituencies.

===Election outcome to Queen's Speech===
The 2010 General Election held on 6 May resulted in a [[hung parliament]], the first since 1974, leading to a period of negotiations. Honouring a pre-election pledge, the Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] entered into negotiations with the Conservatives as the party who had won most votes and most seats. [[William Hague]] offered the Liberal Democrats a referendum on the Alternative Vote as part of a "final offer" in the Conservatives' negotiations for a proposed "full and proper" coalition between the two parties.&lt;ref name=BBC10May2010HagueFinalOffer/&gt; Hague and Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] said that this was in response to Labour offering the Liberal Democrats the Alternative Vote without a referendum, although it later emerged that Labour had not made such an offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/michaelcrick/2010/07/was_the_coalition_built_on_a_l.html|title=BBC - Newsnight: Michael Crick: Was the coalition built on a lie?|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations between the Liberal Democrats and Labour quickly ended.&lt;ref name=BBC10May2010HagueFinalOffer/&gt; On 11 May 2010, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] stepped down, followed by the establishment of a full coalition government between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. David Cameron became Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg became Deputy Prime Minister.

The initial [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]], dated 11 May 2010, detailed the issues which had been agreed between the two parties before they committed to entering into coalition. On the issue of an electoral reform referendum, it stated:

{{pull quote|The parties will bring forward a Referendum Bill on electoral reform, which includes provision for the introduction of the Alternative Vote in the event of a positive result in the referendum, as well as for the creation of fewer and more equal sized constituencies. Both parties will whip their Parliamentary Parties in both Houses to support a simple majority referendum on the Alternative Vote, without prejudice to the positions parties will take during such a referendum.&lt;ref name=BBC12May2010CoalitionAgreementText/&gt;}}

Following the agreement between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, with the new coalition government now formed, a commitment to the referendum was included in the coalition government's [[Queen's Speech]] on 25 May 2010 as the Parliamentary Reform Bill, although with no date set for the referendum.&lt;ref name=BBC25May2010QueensSpeechBills/&gt;

The coalition agreement committed both parties in the government to "[[Whip (politics)|whip]]" their Parliamentary parties in both the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]] to support the bill, thereby ensuring that it could reasonably be expected to be passed into law due to the simple majority in the Commons of the combined Conservative – Liberal Democrat voting bloc. The Lords can only delay, rather than block, a Bill passed by the Commons.

===Passage through Parliament===
According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', reporting after the Queen's Speech, unnamed pro-referendum Cabinet members were believed to want the referendum held on 5 May 2011, to coincide with elections to the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and many English local councils. Nick Clegg's prior hope of a referendum as early as October 2010 was considered unrealistic due to the parliamentary programme announced in the speech.&lt;ref name=Guardian25May2010LibDemPush/&gt;

On 5 July 2010, Clegg announced the detailed plans for the Parliamentary Reform Bill in a statement to the House of Commons, as part of the wider package of voting and election reforms set out in the coalition agreement, including setting the referendum date as 5 May 2011.&lt;ref name=BBC5July2010CleggOutlines/&gt;&lt;ref name=CleggCommonsStatement5July2010/&gt; In addition to a referendum on AV, the reform bill also included the other coalition measures of reducing and resizing the [[Constituencies in the United Kingdom general election, 2010|Westminster parliamentary constituencies]], introducing fixed term parliaments and setting the date of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|next general election]] as 7 May 2015, changing the voting threshold for early [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolution of parliament]] to 55%, and providing for the [[Recall election|recall]] of MPs by their constituents.&lt;ref name=Number10ParliamentaryReformBill25May2010/&gt;

The plans to hold the vote on 5 May faced criticism from some Conservative MPs as distorting the result because turnout was predicted to be higher in those places where local elections were also held. It also faced criticism from Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs for the effects it would have on their devolved elections on the same day, while Clegg himself faced further criticism from Labour, and implied lessening support from Liberal Democrat MPs, for backing down on earlier Liberal Democrat positions on proportional representation.&lt;ref name=BBC5July2010CleggFacesAnger/&gt; Clegg defended the date, stating the referendum question was simple and that it would save £17m in costs.&lt;ref name=BBC5July2010CleggAnnouncesDate/&gt; Over 45 MPs, mostly Conservatives, signed a motion calling for the date to be moved.&lt;ref name=BBCNews7Sep2010/&gt; In September 2010, [[Ian Davidson (Scottish politician)|Ian Davidson]] MP, chairman of the Commons Scottish affairs select committee, stated after consultation with the Scottish Parliament that there was "unanimous" opposition among [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs) to the referendum date, following the "chaos" of the combined 2007 Scottish [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|parliament]] and [[Scottish local elections, 2007|council]] elections.&lt;ref name=BBC30Sep2010ScotsPoliticiansOpposeDate/&gt;

On 22 July 2010, the proposal for fixed term parliaments was put before parliament as the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Bill]], while the proposals for the AV referendum, change in dissolution arrangements and equalising constituencies were put forward in the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill]], which accordingly had three parts: Part 1, Voting system for parliamentary elections; Part 2, Parliamentary constituencies; and Part 3, Miscellaneous and general.&lt;ref name=BBC22Jul2010QuestionPublished/&gt;&lt;ref name=PVSAndConstBill22Jul2010/&gt; The Bill contained the text of a proposed referendum question.&lt;ref name=BBC22Jul2010QuestionPublished/&gt;

The original proposed question in English was:&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmbills/063/2011063.pdf Parliamentary Voting Systems and Constituencies Bill] as introduced (House of Commons Bill 63 of Session 2010–12).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pull quote|'''Do you want the United Kingdom to adopt the "alternative vote" system instead of the current "first past the post" system for electing Members of Parliament to the House of Commons?'''}}

In Welsh:

{{pull quote|'''Ydych chi am i'r Deyrnas Unedig fabwysiadu'r system "bleidlais amgen" yn lle'r system "first past the post" presennol ar gyfer ethol Aelodau Seneddol i Dŷ'r Cyffredin?'''}}

permitting a simple '''YES''' / '''NO''' answer (to be marked with a single (X)).

This wording was criticised by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], saying that "particularly those with lower levels of education or literacy, found the question hard work and did not understand it". The Electoral Commission recommended a changed wording to make the issue easier to understand,&lt;ref name=BBC30Sep2010QuestionTooHard/&gt; and the government subsequently amended the Bill to bring it into line with the Electoral Commission's recommendations.&lt;ref name=Bill26SessionDec2010/&gt;

The Bill passed an interim vote in the Commons on 7 September 2010 by 328 votes to 269.&lt;ref name=BBCNews7Sep2010/&gt;

An amendment proposed in the Lords by [[Jeff Rooker, Baron Rooker|Lord Rooker]] ([[Independent (politician)|Independent]]) to require a minimum turn-out of 40% for the referendum to be valid was supported by Labour, a majority of cross-benchers and ten rebel Conservatives, and was passed by one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/LordsDivisionsAnalysis/session/2010_11/division/20110207 |title=Lords Divisions Analysis |publisher=United Kingdom Parliament |accessdate=24 February 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour's 2010 AV referendum proposal had not included such a threshold and they were criticised for seeking to impose one for this referendum, while the [[Welsh devolution referendum, 2011|2011 Welsh referendum]], held under a Bill passed by Labour, also had no threshold&lt;ref name=newsnight&gt;''Newsnight'', BBC2, 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; (and would have failed if it had had one, as turnout in that referendum was only 35%). In the latter hours of debate, a "game" of [[parliamentary ping-pong]] saw the Commons overturning the threshold amendment before it was reimposed by the Lords, and then removed again.&lt;ref name="Go ahead"&gt;{{cite news|title=Referendum on voting system goes ahead after Lords vote|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12485084|work=BBC News|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some compromises between the two Houses on amendments, the Bill was passed into law on 16 February 2011.&lt;ref name="Go ahead"/&gt;

==Legislation==
The [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]] provides for the holding of the referendum, and the related changes had it led to the adoption of AV. Passing the bill into law was a necessary measure before the referendum could actually take place.&lt;ref name=BBC22Jul2010QuestionPublished/&gt; It received [[Royal Assent]] from [[Elizabeth II]] on 16 February 2011.&lt;ref name="Go ahead"/&gt;

The Act has the following long title:&lt;ref name=PVSAndConstBill22Jul2010/&gt;

{{pull quote|An Act to make provision for a referendum on the voting system for parliamentary elections and to provide for parliamentary elections to be held under the alternative vote system if a majority of those voting in the referendum are in favour of that; to make provision about the number and size of parliamentary constituencies; and for connected purposes}}

=== Referendum question===

Based on the coalition agreement, the referendum was a [[majority|simple majority]] yes/no question as to whether to replace the current [[First Past the Post]] (FPTP) electoral system used in [[United Kingdom general elections overview|general elections]] with the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] (AV) system.

The question posed by the referendum was:&lt;ref name=Bill26SessionDec2010/&gt;

{{Quotation|
'''At present, the UK uses the "first past the post" system to elect MPs to the House of Commons. Should the "alternative vote" system be used instead?'''
}}

In [[Wales]], the question on the [[ballot paper]] also appeared in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]:

{{Quotation|

====Coalition parties====
The coalition partners campaigned on opposite sides, with the Liberal Democrats supporting AV and the Conservatives opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/07/03/cameron-will-campaign-against-changes-to-the-voting-system-91466-26777028/ |title=News – Wales News – Cameron will campaign against changes to the voting system |publisher=WalesOnline |accessdate=6 August 2010|date=2010-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Conservative Party's formal position, party members aligned to the Conservative Action for Electoral Reform, an [[ginger group|internal party group]] in favour of electoral reform, campaigned in favour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservativeelectoralreform.org/Media/14-05-2010.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429034811/http://www.conservativeelectoralreform.org/Media/14-05-2010.htm# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 April 2011 |title=Conservative Action for Electoral Reform – Press Release |date=14 May 2010 |access-date=13 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while a BBC News report described "some Tory MPs" as being "relaxed" about a yes result.&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11609887 AV referendum: Where parties stand], BBC News, 13 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Some Conservatives campaigned in favour of AV, ''e.g.'' [[Andrew Boff]] AM;&lt;ref&gt;Letters: The debate over AV rages on, ''The Evening Standard'', 19 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and Andrew Marshall, former head of the Conservative Group on [[London Borough of Camden|Camden Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2011/jan/conservatives-are-divided-they-get-ready-may-referendum-electoral-reforms ‘AV’ makes sure every vote counts], by Andrew Marshall, ''[[Camden New Journal]]'', 13 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative party uses a system of successive ballots to elect its leader,&lt;ref name=ConservativeLeader&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=House of Commons Library |url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN01366 |title=Leadership Elections: Conservative Party |format=PDF |date= 2016-07-11|accessdate=2017-01-05|last1=Maer |first1=Lucinda |last2=Johnston |first2=Neil }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been described as a "form of AV" (since the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated in each round),&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; but unlike AV, the candidates are not ranked in order of preference during each ballot.

====Other parties represented in the House of Commons====
The previous [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government sought to introduce AV before the 2010 general election. [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|Labour elected a new leader]] after the general election and almost all of the leadership candidates supported AV, including winner [[Ed Miliband]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Ed Balls]] on ''[[Newsnight]]'', 25 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/07/03/condem-coalition-to-apend-80million-on-voting-reform-115875-22378551/ |title=ConDem coalition to apend £80million on voting reform |work=Daily Mirror |location=UK |accessdate=6 August 2010|date=2010-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="squareeye1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clients.squareeye.com/uploads/compass/documents/LawsonSocialism.web.pdf |title=Socialism is Democracy Why Labour Must Support Electoral Reform |publisher=Compass |date= 8 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Burnham]] was the sole leadership contender who was more critical of the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0703/1224273901021.html |title=Voting reform poll to coincide with devolved elections – The Irish Times – Sat, 3&amp;nbsp;July 2010 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=3 July 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has, however, voiced opposition to the bill currently providing for the referendum, on the grounds of the inclusion of [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)#Changes to boundary review legislation 2010|boundary changes]] that are viewed as beneficial to the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukelectiontrend.blogspot.com/2010/07/labour-support-av-oppose-av-bill.html |title=Labour Support AV, Oppose the AV Bill |publisher=UK Election Trend |accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plaid Cymru]] supported AV, but did not take an active role in the campaign, as it focused on separate Welsh votes on the same day.&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand/&gt; The [[Scottish National Party]], while maintaining its long standing support for PR-STV, also supported a Yes vote in the referendum.&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand/&gt; Both of these parties opposed the planned referendum date, as they did not want it held at the same time as the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2011|2011 Welsh Assembly elections]] and the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2011|2011 Scottish Parliament elections]] respectively.&lt;ref name=BBCNews7Sep2010/&gt;

Among the Northern Irish parties, the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] and the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) supported AV.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-11193145 |title=BBC News – Northern Ireland parties divided on electoral reform |publisher=BBC   |date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDLP leader [[Margaret Ritchie (politician)|Margaret Ritchie]] announced that her party would actively campaign in favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=7 July 2010 at 13:30 |url=http://www.irishdigest.com/?p=8799 |title=SDLP leader says alternative vote system 'a step forward' |publisher=IrishDigest.com |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinn Féin]] also supported a Yes vote, but the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] supported a No vote.&lt;ref name=bbcni&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-13051074 NI parties divided over Alternative Vote referendum], by Mark Davenport, BBC News, 13 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] voted in favour of joining the campaign for AV in the referendum at its September 2010 party conference. Many leading figures in the party supported the change as a step towards their preferred system, [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/News/conference-av-campaign-adrian-ramsay.html |title=Greens to campaign for AV |publisher=Green Party of England and Wales |date=13 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918052119/http://www.greenparty.org.uk/News/conference-av-campaign-adrian-ramsay.html |archivedate=18 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the party's leader and only MP, [[Caroline Lucas]], had called for a referendum that included a choice of proportional representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/12090 |title=Green Party leader says real voting reform is an absolute must |publisher=Ekklesia |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But at their Conference, Deputy Leader [[Adrian Ramsay]] argued that "If you vote No in this referendum, nobody would know whether you were rejecting AV because you wanted genuine reform, or were simply opposing any reform."&lt;ref name=green/&gt;

====Minor parties====
The [[United Kingdom Independence Party]]'s National Executive Committee formally announced that it would be supporting Alternative Vote, although they would prefer a proportional system.&lt;ref name="UKIP and electoral reform poll"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110429195721/http://www.ukip.org/content/westminster/2140-ukip-and-electoral-reform-poll UKIP and electoral reform poll], UK Independence Party, 17 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; An e-mail was sent to members informing them that they may vote against AV, but are not allowed to campaign.&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UKIP and Electoral Reform Poll|url=http://www.ukip.org/content/westminster/2140-ukip-and-electoral-reform-poll|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429195721/http://www.ukip.org/content/westminster/2140-ukip-and-electoral-reform-poll#|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 April 2011|access-date=24 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British National Party]] supports proportional representation and has criticised AV as not being proportional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Under True Proportional Representation, the BNP Would Have 12 Seats|url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/under-true-proportional-representation-bnp-would-have-12-seats|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706151912/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/under-true-proportional-representation-bnp-would-have-12-seats#|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 July 2010|access-date=18 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They supported a 'No' vote.&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand/&gt;

The [[Respect Party]] also supported proportional representation and campaigned against AV.&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand/&gt; Rob Hoveman, on behalf of Tower Hamlets Respect, wrote to the ''[[East London Advertiser]]'' on 24 February 2011 urging a 'No' vote on the grounds that the AV system created an even greater imbalance between votes and seats, and urging a proportional system instead.&lt;ref&gt;"Alternative vote won't make polls fairer" (letter), ''East London Advertiser'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Green Party]] also supported AV, although it prefers the adoption of STV for all elections.&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greens |first=Edinburgh |url=http://www.edinburghgreens.org.uk/site/campaigns/yes-to-av/ |title=Yes To Av |publisher=Edinburghgreens.org.uk |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919235659/http://www.edinburghgreens.org.uk/site/campaigns/yes-to-av/ |archivedate=19 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] supported a No vote.&lt;ref name=bbcni/&gt; The [[Green Party in Northern Ireland]] also opposed the change to AV, as they viewed it as a betrayal of proportional representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brianwilsonmla.blogspot.com/2010/10/green-party-votes-to-oppose-alternative.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708025829/http://brianwilsonmla.blogspot.com/2010/10/green-party-votes-to-oppose-alternative.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2011 |title=Brian Wilson Mla: Green Party Votes To Oppose Alternative Vote In Referendum |publisher=Brianwilsonmla.blogspot.com |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English Democrats]],&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand/&gt; [[Christian Peoples Alliance]]&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand/&gt; and the [[Christian Party (UK)|Christian Party]] all support AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/christian.party.welcomes.referendum.on.electoral.reform/26228.htm |title=Christian Party welcomes referendum on electoral reform, Christian News on Christian Today |publisher=Christiantoday.com |date=5 July 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pirate Party UK]] endorsed a Yes vote, with over 90% of members expressing support for AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirates Overwhelmingly Endorse AV|url=http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2010/nov/28/pirates-overwhelmingly-endorse-av/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]] agreed to support the 'Yes' campaign, seeing AV as "a potential 'stepping stone' to further reform" and STV.&lt;ref name=liberalparty&gt;{{cite web|title=The Liberal Party – Yes to Fair Votes|url=http://www.liberal.org.uk/elections/av.htm|publisher=The Liberal Party|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of Britain]] opposed AV.&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand/&gt;

[[Mebyon Kernow]], the Cornish nationalist party, favoured proportional representation and was disappointed that the referendum did not give voters that option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mebyonkernow.org/?q=news/245 |title=The Party for Cornwall, BETA |publisher=Mebyon Kernow |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, leader [[Dick Cole (politician)|Dick Cole]] announced on 1 April 2011 that Mebyon Kernow would be supporting the Yes campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mebyonkernow.blogspot.com/2011/04/my-view-on-av.html|title=Cllr Dick Cole: My View on AV |publisher=Dick Cole |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom Libertarian Party]] favoured AV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lpuk.org/2011/04/av-whats-the-alternative/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521083332/http://lpuk.org/2011/04/av-whats-the-alternative/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 May 2011 |title=AV- What's The Alternative? |publisher=Libertarian Party  |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a slight improvement on first past the post.

The [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] adopted a neutral position, arguing "what matters more is what we use our votes for" in the context of class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Socialist Party of Great Britain |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/altvote.html |title=The Alternative Vote AV |publisher=Worldsocialism.org |accessdate=18 April 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party]] opposed AV, pointing out that it is not more proportional than First Past the Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Socialist Party |url=http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/articles/11892/20-04-2011/the-alternative-vote-referendum-5-may |title=The Alternative Vote referendum – 5 May A 'miserable little compromise'?|publisher=socialistparty.org.uk |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]] opposed AV, arguing that it did not offer progress on the party's main democratic demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workersliberty.org/story/2011/04/20/democracy-yes-av-no "Democracy, yes! AV, no!"], ''[[Solidarity (newspaper)|Solidarity]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Politicians====
Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] of the Conservative Party and Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] of the Liberal Democrats made speeches backing the 'No' and 'Yes' campaigns respectively on the same day, but were thereafter not expected to take much part in the campaigns,&lt;ref name=colinhelena/&gt; although both were active since. Cameron described AV as "undemocratic, obscure, unfair and crazy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12934509|title=David Cameron: Alternative vote is a 'crazy, undemocratic system'|publisher=BBC News|date=1 April 2011|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was praised for his intervention by back-bench Conservative MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/05/av-campaign-david-cameron-praised|title=No to AV campaign wins David Cameron plaudits from backbench MPs |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=5 May 2011|accessdate=6 May 2015|newspaper=The Guardian |last1=Watt |first1=Nicholas |last2=Correspondent |first2=Chief Political }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Democrats supported a Yes vote and many individual Liberal Democrat politicians were active in the Yes campaign. The SNP leader, [[Alex Salmond]], supported a Yes vote.&lt;ref name=snp&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Salmond-likely-to-say-yes.6721176.jp Salmond likely to say 'yes' to AV system], by Nick Eardley, ''The Scotsman'', 20 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; UKIP are supporting a Yes vote and their principal spokesmen on the campaign will be [[William Legge, 10th Earl of Dartmouth|William Dartmouth]] MEP and party leader, [[Nigel Farage]] MEP.&lt;ref name="UKIP and electoral reform poll"/&gt;

[[NOtoAV]] was established to campaign against the change to the Alternative Vote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.no2av.org/ |title=NO2AV |publisher=NO2AV |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[YES! To Fairer Votes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yestofairervotes.org/ |title=Yes! To Fairer Votes |publisher=Yes! To Fairer Votes |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to campaign in favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yestofairervotes.org/ |title=Vote yes to AV on 5&amp;nbsp;May 2011 |publisher=Yes to fairer votes |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political reform groups====
[[Take Back Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takebackparliament.com/ |title=Take Back Parliament |publisher=Take Back Parliament |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Electoral Reform Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/news.php?ex=0&amp;nid=478 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006023827/http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/news.php?ex=0&amp;nid=478# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 October 2010 |title=Electoral Reform Society |publisher=Electoral-reform.org.uk |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Make My Vote Count,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Make Votes Count |url=http://www.makemyvotecount.org.uk/news.html |title=Campaign News |publisher=Make My Vote Count |accessdate=6 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709142526/http://www.makemyvotecount.org.uk/news.html |archivedate=9 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Unlock Democracy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/ |title=Unlock Democracy |publisher=Unlock Democracy |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all campaigned in favour of the change to AV.

====Trade unions====
The [[GMB Union]] opposes the change to AV. It provided "substantial" sums of money to the No campaign and marshalled its members to vote No.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/gmb-joins-tory-right-in-campaign-against-vote-reform-2040853.html |title=GMB joins Tory right in campaign against vote reform – UK Politics, UK |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010  | first=Matt | last=Chorley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unions generally supported the No campaign, with only [[Billy Hayes (trade unionist)|Billy Hayes]], general secretary of the [[Communication Workers Union (UK)|Communication Workers' Union]], supporting AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-politics-12706074|title=AV referendum: Union stance 'depressing', says Johnson|publisher=BBC News|date=11 March 2011|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Think tanks====
[[Compass (think tank)|Compass]] supported the change to the AV and urged the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to do so too.&lt;ref name="squareeye1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/neal-lawson/democracy-by-machines-or-morals-why-av-referendum-matters-to-left Democracy by machines or morals? Why the AV referendum matters to the Left], by Neal Lawson, OurKingdom, 15 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It prefers a switch to a more proportional system, but viewed AV as superior to FPTP. [[ResPublica]] supported the change to AV and urged the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to do so too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.respublica.org.uk/blog/2010/06/av-only-option-21st-century-conservatives |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618131428/http://www.respublica.org.uk/blog/2010/06/av-only-option-21st-century-conservatives# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 June 2010 |title=AV: The Only Option for 21st Century Conservatives? |publisher=ResPublica |access-date=13 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Policy Exchange]] opposed the change to AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/pdfs/Alternative_Vote_-_Oct_10.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140135/http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/pdfs/Alternative_Vote_-_Oct_10.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-16 |title=The Alternative Vote – the system no‐one wants |date=October 2010 |publisher=Policy Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ekklesia (think tank)|Ekklesia]] supported the change to AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/13809 |title=Supporting the Case for Fairer Votes |publisher=Ekklesia.co.uk |accessdate=12 March 2011|date=2010-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] in January 2011 was very critical of FPTP's flaws,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110118011713/http://www.ippr.org/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=798 Worst of Both Worlds: Why First Past the Post no longer works], by G Lodge &amp; G Gottfried, IPPR, 4 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while a report in April 2011 came down in support of AV over FPTP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ippr.org.uk/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=814 The Right Alternative? Assessing the case for the Alternative Vote], by Guy Lodge and Glenn Gottfried, IPPR, 18 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the IPPR also previously called for a wider choice in the referendum and favours [[Alternative Vote Plus]] over FPTP or AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/?id=4050 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416032321/http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/?id=4050# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 April 2011 |title=ippr calls for wider referendum on voting reform |publisher=IPPR |date=5 July 2010 |access-date=13 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Academics====
A number of academics entered the debate, either in mainstream media or through blogs and social networking.

Those in favour of AV included [[Timothy Gowers]] ([[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/is-av-better-than-fptp/|title=Is AV better than FPTP? |accessdate=27 April 2012|date=2011-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Held]] (LSE), [[Patrick Dunleavy]] (LSE), and [[Helen Margetts]] ([[Oxford University|Oxford]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yestofairervotes.org/blog/entry/academics-speak-out-for-fairer-votes/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128082039/http://www.yestofairervotes.org/blog/entry/academics-speak-out-for-fairer-votes# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 January 2011 |title=Academics Speak Out for Fairer Votes |publisher=Yestofairervotes.org |accessdate=13 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thom Brooks]] ([[Newcastle University]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-brooks-blog.blogspot.com/2011/05/vote-yes-to-av.html |title=Vote "Yes" to AV |publisher=Thom Brooks|date=2011-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alastair McMillan ([[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canvas.union.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/?p=884 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813034417/http://canvas.union.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/?p=884 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-13 |title=Debate: Vote Yes on 05&amp;nbsp;May |publisher=Canvas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ben Saunders ([[University of Stirling|Stirling]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bensaunders.blogspot.com/2011/04/leaning-towards-av-though-it-wouldnt-be.html |title=Leaning Towards AV |publisher=Ben Saunders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Felsenthal (LSE) criticised AV as "deeply flawed", though he also described it as "a minor improvement on the current first-past-the-post system".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.co.uk/news/legal-and-constitutional/academics-attack-av-$21378545.htm Academics Attack AV], by Ian Dunt, politics.co.uk, 27 May 201&lt;/ref&gt;

David S. Moon ([[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]]) argued that AV would be worse than FPTP, though he regards both as flawed and supports a move to [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canvas.union.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/?p%3D891 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223212604/http://canvas.union.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/?p%3D891 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2017 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a March 2011 Voting Power in Practice annual workshop, held at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), 22 voting theory specialists voted to select the "best voting procedure" to elect a candidate from a selection of three or more. First past the post received no votes, compared to 10 for AV, although another system, [[Approval Voting]] (not on offer in the referendum), received 15 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101221081409/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS/projects/VPP/Home.aspx Voting Power and Procedures], LSE, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March, 29 historians, including [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] and [[David Starkey]], wrote to the Times expressing opposition to the adoption of the Alternative Vote.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Campaign donors and spending==
By around the beginning of May, the Yes campaign had spent £3.4&amp;nbsp;million compared to £2.6&amp;nbsp;million by the No campaign.&lt;ref name=guardiandonors/&gt;

The Yes campaign revealed that they had raised £2&amp;nbsp;million (as of 15 February 2011), with 95% coming from two donors, the [[Electoral Reform Society]] and the [[Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust]]. The Yes campaign also received five-figures sums from [[Alan Parker]], who is close to both [[Gordon Brown]] and [[David Cameron]], and [[Paul Marshall (investor)|Paul Marshall]], a donor to the Liberal Democrats.&lt;ref name=guardiandonors/&gt;

There were initially accusations in the press that the No campaign was refusing to publish details of their donors and the yes campaign was quicker than the no campaign in doing this,&lt;ref name=donors&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no2av-campaigners-refuse-to-publish-donor-details-2215747.html No2Av campaigners refuse to publish donor details], Oliver Wright, ''The Independent'', 15 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently said on 18 February 2011 they would do so before the referendum date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/18/alternative-vote-campaigns-donors-disclosed Rival AV campaigns pledge to disclose their donors before referendum day], by Patrick Wintour, ''The Guardian'', 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, they had not done so by 28 March 2011 when the Yes campaign published an updated list of all donors of over £7,500 and launched a petition calling on the No campaign to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110403015853/http://www.yestofairervotes.org/blog/entry/alternative-vote-campaign-publishes-donor-list/ Alternative Vote campaign publishes donor list], by Katie Ghose, Yes! to Fairer Votes, 28 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The No campaign released a list of donors on 9 April 2011, which included several major donors to the Conservative Party, including [[John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover|Lord (John) Sainsbury]], [[Michael Farmer]], [[Philip Harris, Baron Harris of Peckham|Lord Harris]], [[Stanley Fink, Baron Fink|Lord Fink]]&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/apr/09/av-tories-no-campaign AV: Tories come out in support of no campaign to the tune of £1.8m], by Nicolas Watt, ''The Guardian'', 9 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lord Edmiston]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12989168 Inside the Yes and No AV referendum campaigns], by James Silver, 7 April 2011, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the No campaign had raised by that date £1.8m in donations of over the declarable limit of £7,500 from 41 donors, with the largest being from philanthropist [[Peter Cruddas]], founder of the CMC spread betting firm, who gave £400,000.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

The Guardian newspaper identified 42 of the 53 named donors to the No campaign as donors to the Conservative Party, while one, the GMB union, is a donor to the Labour Party, and nine were not identified in official donor records. The remaining donor is official funding from the electoral commission. The donors include seven Conservative peers. They quote Margaret Beckett, a leading Labour No campaigner, as saying this situation is a "necessary evil".&lt;ref name=guardiandonors&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/02/no-to-av-vote-tory-party-funding No to AV campaign neutrality under spotlight over Tory party funding], ''The Guardian'', by Polly Curtis &amp; Julia Kollewe, 2 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Yes campaign has released figures of all donations over the declarable limit since it was set up, the No campaign has not declared any donations prior to the referendum bill receiving [[Royal Assent]], as they are not required to do under the relevant regulations. David Blunkett, a No campaigner, has called on the No campaign to do so.&lt;ref name=guardiandonors/&gt;

==Campaign==
The initial part of the campaign was overshadowed by continuing Parliamentary battles over the introducing Bill, which had threatened to delay the referendum date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Commons-Rejects-Amendment-Saying-There-Must-be-40-Percent-Turnout-Threshold-On-Changing-Vote-System/Article/201102315933198?f=rss MPs Reject Lords' Change Over Voting Bill]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}, Jon Craig, Sky News&lt;/ref&gt; Launching their campaign supporters of AV argued that the need for candidates to campaign for later preferences will encourage candidates to appeal to a broader cross-section of the electorate. They have also pointed out the declining number of people voting for the main two parties in the UK over recent decades.&lt;ref name=newsnight/&gt;

===Party politics===
The Yes campaign sought to present their campaign as being on behalf of members of the public. The No campaign sought to play on the unpopularity of the leader of the Liberal Democrats, [[Nick Clegg]], and to present the referendum as an opportunity to punish Clegg at the polls. They also claimed that Clegg described AV as "a miserable little compromise" before the 2010 general election. The fuller quote says: "I am not going to settle for a miserable little compromise thrashed out by the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/05/av-get-clegg-campaign Nick Clegg targeted as anti-AV campaign links him to broken promises], Toby Helm, ''The Independent'', 5 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Conservatives rejected the possibility of introducing PR in coalition negotiations, leading to a referendum in which the choice was between FPTP and AV.

While officially supporting a No vote, the Conservative Party leadership reportedly initially held back on campaigning and advised major Conservative Party donors not to donate to the No campaign. However, this position changed in January 2011 and the leadership became more involved, with requests to donors to fund the No campaign and staff and party headquarters becoming directly involved in campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1370131/Voting-reform-referendum-A-yes-death-David-Cameron.html A 'yes' to voting reform could be death for Cameron], by Iain Martin, ''Daily Mail'', 26 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-February, the prime minister, [[David Cameron]], and the deputy prime minister, [[Nick Clegg]], made opposing speeches advocating a 'No' and 'Yes' result respectively. Clegg argued that AV would mean "fairer votes" and that FPTP produced more safe seats, and linked these to the MPs' expenses scandal. He said that AV would encourage politicians to work to appeal to more of the electorate rather than just their core supporters.&lt;ref name=camclegg&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12498624 Votes referendum: Cameron and Clegg set out views], BBC News, 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that "I think this [AV] is a natural evolution which reflects the fact that politics is no longer now, as it was 50&amp;nbsp;years ago when everybody was very happy to plump for the blue corner or the red corner, people want more choice now."

Cameron, in contrast, argued that FPTP delivers more accountability and claimed it reduces the number of [[hung parliament|"hung" parliament]]s. He insisted that "when it comes to our democracy, Britain shouldn't have to settle for anyone's second choice."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12495429 Vote referendum: Clegg v Cameron], by Brian Wheeler, BBC News, 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He also made the &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/PSAPubs/TheAlternativeVoteBriefingPaper.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330123910/http://www.psa.ac.uk/PSAPubs/TheAlternativeVoteBriefingPaper.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 March 2011 |title=Political Studies Association AV Referendum Briefing Paper |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim, on the 3 May 2011 BBC Radio4 Today Programme, that AV would undermine the fundamental principle of "one person, one vote". Despite the coalition parties being on different sides in the campaign, Cameron insisted that "whatever the result", the coalition would continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13109304 AV referendum: Result will not end coalition – Cameron], BBC News, 17 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caroline Lucas]], head of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] said in support of AV that "they can vote for what they believe in and I think that will be very liberating for a lot of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12576979 |title=Green leader Lucas says vote system change 'liberating' |publisher=BBC   |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Row over possible costs===
The No campaign launched with a claim that choosing AV would cost £250&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votemay5th.notoav.org/documents/the-cost-of-AV.pdf |title=250&amp;nbsp;Million Reasons to Say no to AV |format=PDF |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this figure was criticised on several grounds. For example, it included an estimated £82&amp;nbsp;million for holding the referendum, that would have applied whatever the referendum outcome, and failed to take into account costs saved from holding the referendum at the same time as other elections. The £250&amp;nbsp;million figure also included £130&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.no2av.org/02/why-our-country-cant-afford-av/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219044836/http://www.no2av.org/02/why-our-country-cant-afford-av/# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 February 2011 |title=£250&amp;nbsp;million reasons to say NO: Why our country can't afford AV |accessdate=20 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the cost of electronic voting systems, although these were not used by the largest country then using AV, Australia,&lt;ref name=newsnight/&gt;&lt;ref name=donors/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100076325/notoav-campaign-launched-with-these-guys-in-charge-were-screwed/ NOtoAV campaign launched – with these guys in charge we're screwed], by Toby Young, ''The Telegraph'', 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and there were no plans to use such machines if AV were introduced in the UK.&lt;ref name=scarestories&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12564879 No to AV campaign reject rivals' 'scare stories' claim], BBC News, 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; (The referendum actually cost about £75&amp;nbsp;million, below estimates made at the time, according to the Electoral Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20790944 | work=BBC News | title=Watchdog: AV referendum cost £75m | date=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Labour MP [[Douglas Alexander]] described the figure claimed as a "lie".&lt;ref name=newsnight/&gt; A Channel 4 News Fact Check concluded that the specific claim that AV would require electronic counting machines, the main component of the £250&amp;nbsp;million figure, was "fiction".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110226061358/http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-the-av-campaign-gets-dirty/5789 FactCheck: the AV campaign gets dirty], by Emma Thelwell, 25 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Renwick likewise dismissed the suggestion that voting machines would be required, saying "The No camp [...] say that AV would require expensive voting machines. [...] that is just plain false."&lt;ref name=renwick/&gt;

The Treasury stated that the adoption of AV would not lead to any spending cuts. [[Danny Alexander]], the Liberal Democrat [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] and a supporter of AV himself, stated in a leaked letter that, "The Government has no plans to reopen departmental spending review settlements as a consequence of a Yes vote in the referendum on AV." He also told the ''[[The Independent on Sunday|Independent on Sunday]]'' newspaper that, "I don't expect to see any increase in the cost of holding a general election if the British people vote yes. There's no good reason to believe that even under a new voting system an election would need to be more expensive."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/voting-reform-will-not-cause-more-cuts-treasury-insists-2226784.html Voting reform will not cause more cuts, Treasury insists], by Matt Chorley, ''The Independent on Sunday'', 27 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The No campaign launched a series of advertisements in regional newspapers based on the £250&amp;nbsp;million figure. The Yes campaign described these as "shameful", a "smear" and "lies", and complained to the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] and [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]], both of whom stated that they did not have powers to regulate individual adverts in the campaign.&lt;ref name=scarestories/&gt;

On 5 May, David Blunkett, one of the Labour Party former-government ministers who had supported the No campaign, admitted that the £250&amp;nbsp;million figure used by the No campaign had been fabricated, and that the No campaign had knowingly lied about the figure and other claims during the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/05/campaign-figure-blunkett "No Campaign used made up figures", says David Blunkett] by Samira Shackle, ''New Statesman'', 5 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coalition and minority governments===
Supporters of a No vote claimed that AV would lead to more coalition governments, but models of recent UK elections suggest that this may not be the case,&lt;ref name=newsnight/&gt;&lt;ref name=mortimore&gt;''[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/RM-AVarticle.PDF A Guide to the Alternative Vote]'', by Roger Mortimore, Ipsos MORI Social Research Institute, February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC had modelled the possible effect of AV on every general election since 1983 and concluded that the overall result would not have changed in any of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8506306.stm Would the alternative vote have changed history?], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy Ashdown pointed out that in the twentieth century Australia had fewer hung Parliaments under AV than the UK had under FPTP. The report of the [[Jenkins Commission (UK)|Independent Commission on the Voting System]], issued in 1998, stated that "There is not the slightest reason to think that AV would reduce the stability of government; it might indeed lead to larger parliamentary majorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4090/4090.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020417015512/http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4090/4090.htm#|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 April 2002|title=Report of the Independent Commission on the Voting System|accessdate=25 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the referendum campaign a BBC ''Newsnight'' special on the referendum suggested that AV would lead to a small increase in the number of hung results&lt;ref name=newsnight/&gt; and Alan Renwick, author of ''A Citizen's Guide To Electoral Reform'', wrote in ''Total Politics'' magazine that "AV makes election results more volatile, exaggerating landslides on the one hand and making coalitions more common on the other."&lt;ref name="Total Politics 2011 p. 19"&gt;"The Myths of the Alternative Vote" (article), ''Total Politics (February 2011)'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dennis Leech, a professor at Warwick University, has argued that coalitions will not be any more likely under AV.&lt;ref name=leech&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/alumni/knowledge/culture/alternative_vote Two Cheers for AV], by Dennis Leech, Warwick University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mathematicians&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2011/04/mathematicians-weigh-in-on-uk.html Mathematicians weigh in on UK voting debate], by Jacob Aron, ''New Scientist'', 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vernon Bogdanor]] stated that:

{{pull quote|AV would probably make little difference in most general elections. ...By helping the Lib Dems – the second choice of many voters – AV makes hung parliaments more likely. But the effect would probably not be very great. AV would not have transformed the result in any of the twelve postwar elections that yielded large working majorities. But the parliaments of 1951 and 1992 might have been hung, and AV might have given Labour a working majority in the indecisive elections of 1950, 1964, and February and October 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Logged in as click here to log out |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/11/av-referendum-weapon-of-choice |title=AV Referendum: the Weapon of Choice |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Channel 4 News FactCheck summarised the position as follows:

{{pull quote|AV would not lead to permanent hung parliaments and coalition governments. The best academic research we have suggests that AV wouldn’t make big landslides a thing of the past, and nor would it make hung Parliaments more likely ..hung parliaments are indeed more likely in the future. But that will be the case under both AV and FPTP.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-av-round-up-the-truth-behind-the-claims/6364 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429165441/http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-av-round-up-the-truth-behind-the-claims/6364# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 April 2011 |title=Channel 4 FactCheck Blog: AV Round-Up |publisher=Blogs.channel4.com |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==="One person, one vote"===

The No campaign argued that some people would get multiple votes under AV,&lt;ref name=newsnight/&gt; and that the system was therefore contrary to the principle of "[[one person, one vote]]" (which they adopted as a slogan of their campaign). This was rejected by [[Ipsos MORI]],&lt;ref name=mortimore/&gt; Channel Four News&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt; and academics attached to the Yes campaign.&lt;ref name=renwick&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12750864 AV voting referendum: Alan Renwick's viewpoint], by Alan Renwick, BBC News, 12 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Logged in as click here to log out |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/11/av-referendum-weapon-of-choice |title=AV referendum: The weapon of choice |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safe seats===
The Yes campaign argued that AV would be fairer, and that it would reduce or even eliminate 'safe seats', making MPs work harder. This was contested by the No campaign, again with reference to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/18/av-reform-david-cameron?intcmp=239 AV reform is 'inherently unfair', says David Cameron], by Patrick Wintour, ''The Guardian'', 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This view was supported by Alan Renwick, who stated that "AV wouldn't significantly change the number of safe seats. Even the claim that AV would make a big dent in the number of safe seats goes further than the facts support."&lt;ref name="Total Politics 2011 p. 19"/&gt; However, the [[New Economics Foundation]] think-tank, which supported a Yes vote, published modelling showing that with the introduction of AV the number of very marginal seats would have increased from 81 to 125, and the number of very safe seats would decrease from 331 to 271, although there would also have been an increase in the number of quite safe seats.&lt;ref&gt;"The Voter Power Index" (report), New Economics Foundation, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation found that, with FPTP, the average number of seats changing hands per election was 13% and this could rise to 16% under AV, modestly increasing voter power overall, but concluded "that neither system is very good at translating votes into electoral power."&lt;ref&gt;"The Voter Power Index" (report), New Economics Foundation, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/av/vote-reform-would-create-more-marginal-seats-says-study-2262446.html Vote reform would create more marginal seats, says study], by Andrew Grice, ''The Independent'', 5 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority support for MPs===
The Yes campaign argue that AV ensures that every MP is supported by an overall [[majority]] (more than 50% of the voters). In its Guide to AV, Mori-Ipsos states "this is not really true, but maybe it’s a defensible simplification". AV ensures that a candidate is elected with the support of 50% of voters who have expressed a preference between the final two candidates in the contest. If some voters have indicated that they are indifferent between the final two, by not ranking either of them on the ballot paper, then the winner may be elected with the support of less than 50% of all votes cast.

Rawlings and Thrasher state that "the claims that AV will guarantee local majority support can only be validated if every voter is compelled or chooses to cast a full range of preferences. There seems little prospect of that happening in a general election conducted under AV in the UK."&lt;ref name=mortimore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2010/10/25/suppose-uk-voters-accept-the-alternative-vote-in-the-may-referendum%E2%80%A6-but-then-don%E2%80%99t-use-av-to-signal-multiple-party-preferences/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107071323/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2010/10/25/suppose-uk-voters-accept-the-alternative-vote-in-the-may-referendum%E2%80%A6-but-then-don%E2%80%99t-use-av-to-signal-multiple-party-preferences/# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 January 2011 |title=Suppose UK voters accept the Alternative Vote in the May referendum... but then don't use AV to signal multiple party preferences? |publisher=LSE Blogs |accessdate=5 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Channel Four]] FactCheck states that it "is right that candidates will have to aim for 50% of votes, though it is true that some candidates will end up being elected on fewer than 50% of all the votes cast."&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;

In the most recent general election roughly two-thirds of MPs were elected with less than an overall majority. Rawlings and Thrasher predict that 'more than four out of ten' MPs will still not have majority support under AV. Ipsos Mori state "It is certainly true that in many constituencies ..MPs elected under AV will have the support of a higher proportion of voters than they did under FPTP".

===Existing use of voting systems in Britain and abroad===
The No campaign argued that only three countries use AV. They also stated that the Australian public wish to do away with AV, a claim that is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mia! No real name given + Add Contact |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/_mia/5660630645/ |title=Picture showing 'No to AV' flyer claiming Australians want to get rid of AV |publisher=Flickr.com |accessdate=7 May 2011|date=2011-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2011/02/do-australians-really-want-to-abandon-the-alternative-vote.html Do Australians really want to Abandon the Alternative Vote?], in Antony Green's Election Blog, 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the referendum, three nations used AV for parliamentary elections: [[Australian electoral system|Australia]], [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and [[Electoral system of Fiji|Fiji]]. However, AV is also used internationally for many other forms of election.

AV is used for [[Irish presidential elections]] and for by-elections in the Republic of Ireland, and in some local elections in New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, AV is used by MPs to elect the chairs of select committees, the [[Speaker of the House of Lords]] and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. AV is also used in by-elections to select hereditary peers for the [[House of Lords]]. A variant of AV called the [[contingent vote|supplementary vote]] is used to elect the [[Mayor of London]] and of other UK cities. A related system called the [[exhaustive ballot]] is used to elect the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. AV is used for various elections in the United States (see [[instant-runoff voting in the United States|AV in the United States]]).

AV is used by many private organisations in the UK, for example in the leadership elections of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, while the leadership elections for the Conservative Party use the related exhaustive ballot. AV is also used by the [[Royal British Legion]], and in certain trade unions and [[students' union]]s.&lt;ref name=newsnight/&gt; In the US, AV is now used to decide the winner of the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Oscar for Best Picture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Alternative-Vote-Analysis-Of-The-Electoral-System-Being-Proposed-In-The-Referendum-On-May-5/Article/201102315936067?lpos=Politics_First_Home_Page_Feature_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15936067_Alternative_Vote%3A_Analysis_Of_The_Electoral_System_Being_Proposed_In_The_Referendum_On_May_5_ What Is The Alternative Voting System?]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}, by David Connolly, Sky News Online, 19 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A method similar to AV, called the [[two round system]], is widely used internationally. For example, it is used to elect the National Assembly of France and the Presidents of eighty nations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idea.int/esd/world.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051015024923/http://www.idea.int/esd/world.cfm# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 October 2005 |title=National voting systems by country |publisher=idea.int |access-date=2 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States also uses [[Primary election|primaries]], followed by a second round, for the President, House of Representatives and the Senate.

[[Single transferable vote|PR-STV]] is another related system. It uses a preferential ballot like AV but is used for elections in multi-seat constituencies. It is used for national elections in the Republic of Ireland, Australia and Malta, and for other purposes in many other nations.

The No campaign stressed that FPTP is used in over fifty countries, with a combined population of approximately 2.4&amp;nbsp;billion people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NOtoAV: Vote NO on 5 May |url=http://www.no2av.org/why-vote-no/current-system/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116160316/http://www.no2av.org/why-vote-no/current-system/# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 January 2011 |title=Why Our Current System is Better than AV |publisher=No2av.org |accessdate=7 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; FPTP is used for legislature elections in the United States, India and Canada, as well as other non-G20 nations. It is used for presidential elections in twenty countries, and for various forms of election in 45 others (35 of these are [[Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations]] or [[British Overseas Territories]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

===Proportional representation===
Some opponents of AV saw it as a stepping stone towards, for them unwanted, proportional representation, while some supporters of proportional representation like the [[British National Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11609887 | title=AV referendum: Where parties stand| work=BBC News| date=2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the referendum as a lost opportunity that will delay a move to proportional representation. Both positions have been described as "entirely speculative".&lt;ref name=mortimore/&gt; An ''Evening Standard'' editorial described the result of a 'No' win: "the issue of electoral reform will be shelved for a generation."&lt;ref&gt;"To destroy Clegg, Ed must schmooze, not exclude, him", by Matthew d'Ancona, ''Evening Standard'', 16 March 2011, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Thomas Lundberg, an electoral systems specialist at Glasgow University, wrote in a Political Studies Association paper: "Anything that reduces the ability of small parties to win seats – a process that has been going on since the 1970s at British general elections – could be detrimental to the prospect of a PR transition. Because AV raises the threshold to victory to 50 per cent plus one vote, small parties, which often win seats on low vote shares, might be threatened unless they can win significant numbers of transfers from voters who prefer other parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/2011/UploadedPaperPDFs/1255_666.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324230834/http://www.psa.ac.uk/2011/UploadedPaperPDFs/1255_666.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 March 2012 |title=Be Careful What You Wish For: Potential Problems for the Yes Side in the Alternative Vote Referendum, p9 |publisher=Political Studies Association |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tactical voting===
[[Tactical voting]] means that a voter supports a candidate other than his or her sincere preference, in order to get a relatively desirable outcome. No conventional (i.e. [[Ranked voting system|ordinal]]) voting system can eliminate tactical voting (under the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]]) and situations in which AV is susceptible to tactical voting can be demonstrated.&lt;ref name=mortimore/&gt; The Yes to AV campaign argued that, under AV, such scenarios were rare&lt;ref&gt;[http://labouryes.org.uk/uncategorized/australia-tactical-voting-almost-unknown-with-av/ Australia: tactical voting almost unknown with AV]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}, Labour Yes! to Fairer Votes, 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or theoretical.&lt;ref name=mathematicians/&gt; The independent market research group Ipsos MORI has published a guide to AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/RM-AVarticle.PDF |title=A guide to the Alternative Vote (Ipsos MORI) |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This states that the scenario in which tactical voting might influence the outcome of an AV election "is very easy to demonstrate in the case of AV and is unlikely to be especially rare". It is however true that, under AV, it is harder for the tactical voter to know what effect he is going to have so the prevalence of what is strictly defined as "tactical voting" may be reduced under AV.

First-past-the-post is a [[monotonicity criterion|monotonic voting system]], while AV meets [[Independence of clones criterion|independence of clones]] and [[mutual majority criterion|mutual majority]] criteria.

====AV and the BNP====
The [[British National Party]] (BNP) supported a No vote in the referendum. In response, Conservative chairman and No supporter [[Baroness Warsi]] described AV as "a system which rewards extremism and gives oxygen to extremist groups".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110404015059/http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2011/03/Sayeeda_Warsi_AV_will_give_extremist_parties_more_credibility.aspx Sayeeda Warsi: AV will give extremist parties more credibility] Conservatives.com&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Yes campaign launched advertising with the slogan, "Say No to the BNP, Say Yes on 5th May"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713234017/http://labouryes.org.uk/say-no-to-the-bnp-say-yes-to-av-on-may-5th/ "Say No to the BNP – Say YES to AV on May 5th"] Labour Yes campaign site&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out the BNP's opposition to AV. The [[Channel 4 News]] FactCheck concluded the Yes campaign were correct, saying:

{{pull quote|AV is highly unlikely to help the BNP win any seats, and the secondary votes of BNP supporters alone wouldn’t swing a seat for any other party – going on last year’s results.

In fact, in a very divided constituency, the BNP arguably has a better chance of winning a seat under First Past the Post than under AV.}}

They go on to quote the BNP deputy chairman [[Simon Darby]], who said: "AV is a retrograde step – it's worse than what we've got now[.] We are never going to get our feet under the table under the AV system."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110416111101/http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-would-av-help-or-hinder-the-bnp/6273 FactCheck: Would AV help or hinder the BNP?], by Cathy Newman, Channel 4 News, 13 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The No2AV-Yes2PR campaign website countered that "AV does confer a subtle benefit on extremists like the BNP: increased legitimacy. AV enables people to cast ‘free’ protest vote safe in the knowledge that they can they cast a second preference for the party they actually want."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.no2av-yes2pr.org/why-vote-no/ Why Vote No?], No2AV-Yes2PR&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennis Leech, a professor at Warwick University, has argued that extremists like the BNP are more likely to win under FPTP, but he has also argued against the notion that AV automatically favours centrists:

{{pull quote|while AV prevents the kind of undemocratic result that often occurs under FPTP, and always ensures that the winning candidate has at least some kind of majority support, it has nothing to do with proportional representation. It does not follow that centrist or compromise candidates such as the LibDems will be more likely to win – only that ''the least popular cannot win''. A centrist candidate such as a LibDem will still need enough ''first preference'' votes to stand a chance.&lt;ref name=leech/&gt;}}

===Final weeks===

The final weeks of the campaign were marked by an increased rancour, with a battle of words between members of the Coalition Government.&lt;ref name=commissioncannot&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13185576 AV referendum: Commission 'cannot investigate untruths'], BBC News, 25 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Liberal Democrat energy secretary [[Chris Huhne]] threatened legal action over "untruths" that he claimed were told by Conservative Chancellor [[George Osborne]] that new voting machines would be required by AV, despite these not being used in Australian elections under AV&lt;ref name=commissioncannot/&gt; and no plans to introduce them. The No campaign countered, quoting a senior returning officer (Anthony Mayer), that voting machines would be essential with AV if results are desired as quickly as today, rather than counting over the weekend after a general election.&lt;ref&gt;Former GLA CEO Says: With AV No Choice But Electronic Counting (Press Release), Tuesday 26 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011#Row over possible costs|row over possible costs]] section for a fuller discussion.

Huhne was reported to have strongly criticised Conservative colleagues at a Cabinet meeting in early May 2011 for the No campaign's material. However, one of the key No campaign leaflets he targeted, showing a newborn baby with the slogan "She needs a maternity unit, not an alternative voting system", was developed by [[Dan Hodges]], a Labour Party campaigner working for NO2AV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110505231143/http://politics.standard.co.uk/2011/05/the-real-father-of-the-sick-baby-posters.html The real father of the "Sick Baby" posters], by Joe Murphy. ''Evening Standard'', 4 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading members of the Labour Party on different sides of the campaign also stepped up to campaign for the votes of Labour supporters,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13191009 AV referendum: Bid for Labour swing voters], BBC News, 26 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; including a major newspaper interview with [[Peter Mandelson]] in which he called for a Yes vote and a major advertising campaign by the Labour Yes to Fairer Votes group, both arguing that Labour voters should vote Yes because of Conservative support for a No result. However, the No campaign responded by pointing out that a majority of Labour MPs oppose AV (130 out of 255 opposing AV, 86 in support).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1381096/AV-referendum-Half-Labour-MPs-oppose-voting-reform-claims-No-campaign.html 'Half of Labour MPs oppose voting reform' claims No to AV campaign as the battle heats up ahead of referendum], ''Daily Mail'', 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the last week a grassroots campaign featuring Reform Cat in the YouTube video "Is your Cat confused about the referendum on the voting system on the 5th&amp;nbsp;May?" which was released on 27 April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiHuiDD_oTk |title=Is your Cat confused about the referendum on the voting system on the 5 May? |work=Youtube |date=27 April 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; gained more views than either official campaign videos.

==Proposed AV system==

===System===
Under the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] system proposed in the referendum, voters would still be electing just one candidate associated with one geographic constituency. Instead of simply voting for one candidate on the ballot paper (with an 'X'), the voter would instead be asked to rank one or more of the candidates in order of preference. If after first preferences have been counted, no one candidate has a majority of the votes cast, then the bottom candidate will be eliminated and votes for that candidate are transferred to each voter's next available preference. The process continues repeatedly until one candidate reaches a majority and wins.&lt;ref name=BBC22Jul2010QuestionPublished/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.re-constitution.org.uk/discover-the-facts/electoral-process/#facts_28 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100607074144/http://www.re-constitution.org.uk/discover-the-facts/electoral-process/#facts_28#facts_28 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 7 June 2010 |title= AV Explained |publisher= The Constitution Society |location= London |access-date= 14 April 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system proposed was a form of "optional [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]]", in that voters would not be obliged to rank every candidate in order of preference in order to cast a valid vote.

===Ballot instructions===
Schedule 10 to the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]] proposed to amend Paragraph (5) of Rule 29 of Schedule 1 to the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]] (the "Parliamentary Election Rules"), so that the instructions to the voter displayed in ballot boxes would be changed from an instruction to vote for only one candidate, to read:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/1/schedule/10/part/1/enacted |title=2011 Act, Schedule 10 (as enacted) |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2016-11-11 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pull quote|"Remember—use 1, 2, 3 etc at this election—this is an election using the alternative vote system. Put the number 1 next to the name of the candidate who is your first choice (or your only choice, if you want to vote for only one candidate). You can also put the number 2 next to your second choice, 3 next to your third choice, and so on. You can mark as few or as many choices (up to the number of candidates) as you wish. Do not use the same number more than once. Put no other mark on the ballot paper, or your vote may not be counted."}}

This was repealed by the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 (Repeal of Alternative Vote Provisions) Order 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1702/contents/made |title=2011 Order |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting areas and Counts ==
The referendum was held nationally across all four countries of the [[United Kingdom]] as a single majority vote in 440 voting areas and twelve regional count areas. In [[England]] the [[Districts of England|districts]] were used as the voting areas before being combined into the nine regional count areas. In [[Scotland]] the [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions from 2011|constituencies]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]] were the voting areas and in [[Wales]] the voting areas were the [[National Assembly for Wales constituencies and electoral regions|constituencies]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] was a voting area.&lt;ref name="electoarlcommission.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/elections/upcoming-elections-and-referendums/uk/?a=117467 electoarlcommission.org.uk], 7 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows the breakdown of the voting areas for the referendum within the [[United Kingdom]].

==Result==
{{main|Results of the United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011}}
According to the Electoral Commission, the votes were first counted in the 440 voting areas across the United Kingdom. Except in [[Northern Ireland]], the results from these local counts were relayed to twelve regional count areas to be officially announced by the Regional Counting Officers. [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] were each classed as one regional count area, so votes in those areas were counted and declared locally within Scottish Parliamentary and Welsh Assembly constituency boundaries before the results were declared nationally. Northern Ireland was also classed as a single regional count area but its votes were counted and declared nationally as one unit. In England, the votes were counted and declared locally at district council level, and those results were carried over to the nine remaining regional count areas. The national result for the whole United Kingdom was announced at the Platinum Suite at the [[ExCeL London|Exhibition Centre London (ExCel)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/elections/upcoming-elections-and-referendums/uk/referendum Referendum on the voting system for the UK Parliament], Electoral Commission, 3 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; by the Chief counting officer (CCO) and Chair of the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], [[Jenny Watson]], at 0100 [[British Summer Time|BST]] on Saturday 7 May 2011 after all 440 voting areas and UK regions had declared their results.&lt;ref name="electoarlcommission.org.uk"/&gt; With a national turnout of 42% across the [[United Kingdom]] the target to secure the majority win for the winning side was 9,639,512 votes. The decision by the electorate was a decisive "No" vote to adopting the alternative vote system in all future [[United Kingdom general elections]] by a majority of 6,860,516 votes over those who had voted "Yes" in favor of the proposal.

Ahead of the last results from Northern Ireland, the result was confirmed as a "No", as it was mathematically impossible for the "Yes" voters to outnumber them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13297573 |title=Vote 2011: UK rejects alternative vote |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=6 May 2011 |date=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcome ==
Further details of campaigning decisions emerged after the referendum result, with Dan Hodges reporting that the Conservatives had endorsed the No campaign's targeting of Nick Clegg, although they had originally opposed the idea. Hodges also reported that an aide of David Cameron secretly met No campaign leaders in a hotel room in order to stop the Liberal Democrats finding out the scale of Conservative involvement.&lt;ref name="murphy12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23949307-cameron-aide-met-no-campaign-leader-in-secret-before-av-poll.do |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608004133/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23949307-cameron-aide-met-no-campaign-leader-in-secret-before-av-poll.do# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 June 2011 |title=Cameron aide 'met No campaign leader in secret before AV poll |publisher=thisislondon.co.uk |access-date=13 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coalition Government continued and sought to present a united front after the fractious campaign. Former Conservative Cabinet minister [[Michael Portillo]] criticised Cameron, saying he "forgot the importance of courtesy" towards Clegg and the Liberal Democrats and, thus, the survival of the Coalition, when he joined what Portillo called "the disgraceful No campaign".&lt;ref name="murphy12"/&gt;

On 8 July 2011, the Alternative Vote Provisions were repealed, bringing the statutory process that had initiated the referendum to an end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1702/pdfs/uksi_20111702_en.pdf The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 (Repeal of Alternative Vote Provisions) Order 2011] SI 2011/1702&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''abreuvoir''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|b|r|ə|ˈ|v|w|ɑr|,_|ˌ|æ|b|ˌ|r|uː|ˈ|v|w|ɑr}} ([[French language|French]]: ''watering place'', ''[[Watering trough|trough]]''), can mean a basin containing water or a type of masonry joint.&lt;ref name="wiktionary"&gt;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abreuvoir . accessed 2.12.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water basin==
An ''abreuvoir'' is a [[watering trough]], fountain, or other installed basin: originally intended to provide humans and/or animals at a rural or urban watering place with fresh drinking [[water]]. They were often located at [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s. In pre-automobile era cities, they were built as equestrian water troughs for horses providing transportation. In contemporary times, ''abreuvoirs'' are also seen as civic or private fountains in the designed townscape-landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6845">The '''Arlington Group''' is a coalition which unites the leaders of prominent [[Christian right|Christian conservative]] organizations in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/us/conservatives-using-issue-of-gay-unions-as-a-rallying-tool.html?pagewanted=all Conservatives Using Issue of Gay Unions As a Rallying Tool]&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 2002 principally through the efforts of [[American Family Association]] President [[Donald Wildmon]] and Free Congress Foundation Chairman [[Paul Weyrich]], the group seeks to establish consensus goals and strategy among its members and translate its combined constituency into an overwhelming force within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], particularly at its highest levels.  Its membership and purpose overlaps to a high degree with the [[Council for National Policy]]; but the group is much more narrowly focused, choosing to emphasize such issues as same-sex marriage, abortion, and confirmation of like-minded federal judges.

The group's success has been mixed.  While widely acknowledged to have the ear of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and his chief political advisor [[Karl Rove]], and while generally successful in its efforts to coordinate the [[Christian Right]], it has also endured noteworthy embarrassments.  In early 2005, it threatened to withhold support for the President's [[Social Security debate (United States)|proposed Social Security reforms]] if Bush did not vigorously support a federal [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] ban on [[same-sex marriage]].  This provoked a firestorm of unwelcome media attention, but failed to produce the group's desired result (despite the President's continuing support for both their specific and broader aims).  And later, in October 2005, Arlington Group Chairman and [[Focus on the Family]] founder [[James Dobson]] became the center of a minor scandal after leaking assurances made by Rove to an Arlington Group conference call regarding the pro-life credentials of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] nominee and [[White House]] counsel [[Harriet Miers]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  [[Harriet Miers Supreme Court nomination|Miers withdrew her nomination]] later that month, largely due to reservations among conservatives.

== Membership ==

The organization's deliberations are strictly off-the-record, and membership was previously held confidential, but the group launched a website in July 2006 which lists its member organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20060901092849/http://www.thearlingtongroup.org/2.html The Arlington Group - Members]&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2007, the home page was taken down; according to an article in the [[Boston Globe]], it was "abruptly disabled earlier this month after the Globe began making inquiries".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/03/25/coalition_seeks_to_reframe_gop_race/?page=full Coalition seeks to reframe GOP race | Leaders of secretive group interview 2008 candidates]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since each group's principal serves as its Arlington Group "member", but many of the groups are headed by a single principal (e.g., [[Focus on the Family]] and Focus on the Family Action are both headed by [[James Dobson]]), the site's list is somewhat confusing; and members are not required to disclose their participation.  However, the following organizations and individuals have been identified as members as of 2006:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20060901092849/http://www.thearlingtongroup.org/2.html The Arlington Group - Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rigid social designators remain fixed throughout an individual's life and are inseparable from the positive or negative stereotypes that are linked with one's ascribed statuses.

The practice of assigning such statuses to individuals exists cross-culturally within all societies and is based on gender, race, family origins, and ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;These rigid social designators remain fixed throughout an individual's life and are inseparable from the positive or negative stereotypes that are linked with one's ascribed statuses.

The practice of assigning such statuses to individuals exists cross-culturally within all societies and are based on gender, race, family origins, and ethnic backgrounds.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person born into a wealthy family has a high ascribed status based solely on the [[social network]]s and economic advantages that one gains from being born into a family with more resources than others.

In contrast, an [[achieved status]] is a social position a person takes on voluntarily that reflects both personal ability and merit.  An individual's occupation tends to fall under the category of an achieved status; for example, a teacher or a firefighter.

Individuals have control over their achieved statuses insofar as there are no restrictions associated with their ascribed statuses that could potentially hinder their social growth.  Ascribed status plays an important role in societies because it can provide the members with a defined and unified identity.  No matter where an individual's ascribed status may place him or her in the social hierarchy, most has a set of roles and expectations that are directly linked to each ascribed status and thus, provides a social personality.

==Factors==
The various factors that determine ascribed status are [[Ageing|age]] (as in [[age stratification]]), [[kinship]], [[sex]], [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[social group]] and [[caste]].

In addition to ascription, at birth there are also:
* Delayed Ascription (when social status is given at a later stage of life)
* Fluid Ascription (when ascribed status leads to an achieved status)

==Reversible and irreversible==
The anthropologist, [[Ralph Linton]], developed definitions for ascribed status and achieved status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Linton
  | first = Ralph
  | authorlink = Ralph Linton
  | title = The Study of Man: An Introduction
  | publisher = Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc.

  | url = https://archive.org/details/studyofman031904mbp
  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Linton, ascribed status is assigned to an individual without reference to their innate differences or abilities. Achieved status is determined by an individual's performance or effort. Linton noted that while the definitions of the two concepts are clear and distinct, it is not always easy to identify whether an individual's status is ascribed or achieved. His perspective offers a deviation from the view that ascribed statuses are always fixed.

Religion is generally perceived as an ascribed status but for those individuals who choose a religion as an adult, or convert to another religion, their religion becomes an achieved status, based on Linton's definition.  It is commonly perceived that ascribed statuses are irreversible while achieved statuses are reversible.  Linton uses Leo Schnore's research to illustrate how ascribed statuses can be both irreversible and reversible.  An example of an ascribed reversible status is the status of citizenship.

An example of ascribed irreversible status is age.  His conclusion is based on the fact that an ascribed status within a social structure is indicative of the behavior that one can exhibit but it does not explain the action itself.  Ascribed status is an arbitrary system of classifying individuals that is not fixed in the way that most people think.

Status is a social phenomenon rather than a biological one. The meaning is derived from the collection of expectations of how an individual should behave and what the expected treatment of that individual is. If an individual lies about a biological fact or social accomplishment and this lie remains undiscovered by others and is accepted by them, then in this social system, his status will be based on the lie. His status would not be based on a biological fact or social accomplishment.

Behavior toward the individual will be in accordance with the accepted lie.  Consequently, behavior expected from that individual will also be in accordance with that accepted lie rather than the ascribed status that would be associated with him if the truth were known. The success of the structure requires that the expectations remain constant, even if they are illegitimately acquired, given that the truth is never discovered.  This further highlights the arbitrariness of ascribed status because there is no biological basis or universal truth for assigning these societal rankings to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Foladare|first1= Irving S.|year= 1969|title= A Clarification of "Ascribed Status" and "Achieved Status"|journal= The Sociological Quarterly|volume= 10|issue= 1|pages= 53–61|jstor= 4105001 |doi= 10.1111/j.1533-8525.1969.tb02061.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low self-esteem==
There is a positive correlation between an individual's self-esteem and their ascribed status; for this purpose, self-esteem is defined as a liking and respect for oneself which has its basis in reality.  Individuals with a low social status generally have a lower self-esteem.  A negative image of oneself among individuals with lower ascribed statuses is the result of the internalization of the expectations that others have of them and the treatment that they receive based on those statuses.

The juxtaposition of their own value systems against the larger society's view often leaves individuals of a lower status with low self-esteem without regard to the individual’s actual capabilities.  A negative self-image may stifle an individual's efforts to acquire a certain achieved status; this illustrates how a low ascribed status can result in a low achieved status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacques | first1 = J.

J. | doi = 10.1111/j.1533-8525.1977.tb01424.x | title = Self-Esteem and Low Status Groups: A Changing Scene?* | journal = The Sociological Quarterly | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 399 | year = 1977 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minorities and status inconsistency==
Ascribed statuses are determined by the dominant groups in society and as a result, minorities are often assigned lower statuses.  Minority groups are forced to attempt to reconcile the conflicts that arise from the social expectations that are linked with their assigned statuses in society and their perceived view of themselves.  In the face of the knowledge that individuals occupy more than one ascribed role at a time, it becomes evident that there may be some statuses in society’s multi-dimensional structure that do not comfortably coexist.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Consistency is defined as the degree to which an individual’s social rank positions that exist within important status hierarchies are at a comparable level.  The greater mobility of class systems produces less status consistency. In Canada, for example, most university professors with advanced academic degrees enjoy high social prestige but earn only average salaries. Low status consistency means that classes are much harder to define than castes.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber,  John, Linda (2010). ''Sociology 7th Canadian Ed.'' Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the root of the problem of status inconsistency is the inability of individuals to reconcile the conflicting expectations.  A woman from a racial minority group may not experience status inconsistency because as a woman and as a member of a minority group, she may be considered to be of a lower ascribed status.  But, if this woman rejects the assigned roles that are associated with her status, she experiences status inconsistency.

To offer another example, a woman born into a wealthy family occupies both a high and a low ascribed status within the social structure: her inherited resources and social networks are advantageous but her role as a woman may be considered inferior.  When a person holds a high rank on one status dimension and low rank on another, the expectations of the two are often at odds with one another.

The two general consequences that arise from the tension that exists between the differing expectations are frustration and uncertainty about how one should act, given how others believe they should behave, and their own perceived notions of their abilities and the course of action that they should take to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jackson |first1=Elton F. |year= 1962|title=Status Consistency and Symptoms of Stress |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=469–480 |jstor=2090028 |doi=10.2307/2090028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Wealth is not the only social characteristic that defines an individual's ascribed status.  Religion is also a factor. If a person's family identifies with a particular religion, be it [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], etc., generally that person may be presumed to adopt the same religion as their biological or adopted parents. An individual's religion or absence of religion becomes a part of his or her ascribed status.  The social norms of a particular religion may have different ascribed statuses than those given by the larger society because followers are ascribed status based on the religious doctrines that govern their belief.  

Ascribed status can also be closely linked with master status, as they both involve what a person is born into. Master status is a broader term that includes more topics than ascribed status.

==Caste system==

The [[castes]] are an example of a stratification structure based on ascribed status.&lt;ref&gt;The Sociology: A Study of Society, p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsMyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=%22Ascribed+status%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ascribed%20status%22&amp;f=false 190], Irshad Ahmad Wani&lt;/ref&gt; Each level in the stratification structure is known as a caste. Everyone is born into a specific caste. The caste of the parents generally determines the status of their children, regardless of ability or merit. The ranks of the caste system include:

* priests and scholars
* rulers, warriors, and those concerned with the defense and administration of the well-being of their town or village
* traders, merchants, and people involved in agricultural production
* laborers, servants, and other low-paying jobs.

{{Politics of Bhutan}}

The '''Bhutan Tiger Force''' (BTF) is the armed wing of the [[Bhutan Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist)]] (BCP [MLM]).&lt;ref&gt;Simon Denyer [http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/05/15/bhutan_tolerates_democracy_but_not_dissent/?page=2 Bhutan tolerates democracy but not dissent] ''The Boston Globe''. 15 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks==
On 13 December 2007, the BTF injured a refugee at the Beldangi I camp near Sangam Chowk in [[Damak]], [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name=Pid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/bhutan/index.html|title=Bhutan Assessment 2008|date=2008|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2008, a bomb planted by BTF rebels was defused near a bridge in [[Phuntsholing]].&lt;ref name=Pid/&gt; {{not in citation|date=February 2016}}

On 30 December 2008, BTF insurgents killed four forest  rangers and injured another, later took their weapons in the Singye village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Communist guerrillas kill four Bhutanese forest guards| newspaper = Reuters| publisher = Thomson Reuters| date = January 1, 2009| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSB595776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Harrington resigned from SDUSA and founded the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC) in 1973.

==United Nations: Committee on Human Rights==
Gershman served as the U.S. Representative to the U.N.'s Committee on human rights during the first [[Reagan Administration]].&lt;ref name="NED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nossiter"&gt;{{citation|title=New team at U.N.: Common roots and philosophies|first=Bernard&amp;nbsp;D.|last=Nossiter|newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 3, 1981 |edition=Late City final |at=section A, p. 2, col. 3 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/03/world/new-team-at-un-common-roots-and-philosophies.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lip34"/&gt; He and other members of [[Social Democrats, USA]] were called "State&amp;nbsp;Department socialists" by {{harvtxt|Massing|1987}}, who wrote that the [[foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|foreign policy of the Reagan administration]] was being run by [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], a claim that was called a "myth" by {{harvtxt|Lipset|1988|p=34}}.&lt;ref name="Lip34"&gt;
"A 1987 article in ''The New Republic'' described these developments as a Trotskyist takeover of the Reagan administration" wrote {{harvtxt|Lipset|1988|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Endowment for Democracy==
Carl Gershman has served as the President of the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] since 1984.&lt;ref name="NED"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ned.org/about/president.html |title=Meet Our President |accessdate=2008-08-05|publisher=[[National Endowment for Democracy]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080426072715/http://www.ned.org/about/president.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Gershman said
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I'm non-partisan; I try to bring Democrats and Republicans together in the United States, which is not that easy because we're very divided politically, today. And also, people from the business&amp;nbsp;community and the trade&amp;nbsp;union movement and intellectuals, and so forth, and try and bring people together around a common democratic faith&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;philosophy."&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1982 speech at the [[Palace of Westminster]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] proposed an initiative "to foster the infrastructure of democracy--the system of a free press, unions, political parties, universities." The U.S. government, through [[USAID]] (United States Agency for International Development), contracted [[The American Political Foundation]] to study democracy promotion, which became known as "The Democracy Program."  The Program recommended the creation of a bipartisan, private, non-profit corporation to be known as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). NED, though non-governmental, would be funded primarily through annual appropriations from the U.S. government and subject to congressional oversight.&lt;ref name="ned1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ned.org/about/nedhistory.html |title=History |publisher=National Endowment for Democracy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080426072447/http://www.ned.org/about/nedhistory.html |archivedate = April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NED was established in 1983 by an act of Congress.  The House Foreign Affairs Committee proposed legislation to provide initial funding of $31.3 million for NED as part of the [[State Department Authorization Act]] (H.R. 2915).  Included in the legislation was $13.8 million for the [[American Center for International Labor Solidarity|Free Trade Union Institute]], an affiliate of the [[AFL-CIO]] (much of which went to support the Polish labor union, [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]), $2.5 million for an affiliate of the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], and $5 million each for two party institutes. The conference report on H.R. 2915 was adopted by the House on November 17, 1983 and the Senate the following day. On November 18, 1983, articles of incorporation were filed in the District of Columbia to establish the National Endowment for Democracy as a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref name="ned1"/&gt;

NED is structured to act as a grant-making foundation, distributing funds to private non-governmental organizations for the purpose of promoting democracy abroad. Approximately half of NED's funding is allocated annually to four main U.S. organizations: the [[American Center for International Labor Solidarity]] (ACILS), the [[Center for International Private Enterprise]] (CIPE), the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (NDI), and the [[International Republican Institute]] (IRI). The other half of NED's funding is awarded annually to hundreds of non-governmental organizations based abroad which apply for support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ned.org/grants/grants.html |title=Grants |publisher=National Endowment for Democracy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114042003/http://www.ned.org/grants/grants.html# |archive-date=November 14, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Michelides''' (born July 19, 1957) is an Austrian [[psychotherapist]]. He is the director of [[Lighthouse Wien]].

==Life and career==
Michelides was born in [[Graz]]. In 1973, he started to work as an opera critic of a provincial newspaper called ''Südost Tagespost''. After serving as an [[assistant director]] for plays of [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Thomas Bernhard]] in 1975 at Austria's National Theater, the [[Burgtheater]], he achieved his high school diploma in 1978. Thereafter he studied [[arts]], [[philosophy]] and [[history of theatre]], as well as [[Theatre director|directing]] in Milan, Vienna and New York, while still publishing articles in Austrian and Italian journals.

In the 1980s, Michelides was a collaborator for the newly founded magazine ''WIENER''; he then joined the ad agency ''GGK Wien'' and the marketing team of the Swiss watch [[Swatch]] in [[Biel]]. At the same time, he organized a series of exhibitions in Vienna and published some catalogues. He presented five young American photographic artists ([[John Dugdale (photographer)|John Dugdale]], [[Marcus Leatherdale]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Todd Watts]] and [[Joel-Peter Witkin]]) for the first time in Europe.

In the early 1990s, he served as an [[investigative journalist]] for the magazine ''[[FORVM]]'' and other publications in Austria and Germany. Michelides disclosed the membership of [[Thomas Bernhard]] in a conservative party organization called the ''Bauernbund'';&lt;ref&gt;Jens Ditmar (Hg.): ''Sehr geschätze Redaktion. Leserbriefe von und über Thomas Bernhard.'' Wien: Österreichische Staatsdruckerei 1991, 222-226 (Bernhard im Bauernbund)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Thomas Bernhard und die ÖVP'', Wien 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; he also revealed that [[Rudolf Augstein]] had published in the Nazi paper ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]''. Finally he exposed [[Gertrud Fussenegger]], Austria's then most prominent female author, as a former avid Hitler worshipper.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Denk: ''Die Zensur der Nachgeborenen.'' Weilheim i.OB 1996 (3rd.&amp;nbsp;ed.), pp.&amp;nbsp;13–138, 164–188.&lt;/ref&gt; Michelides also discovered that the [[Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften|Austrian Academy of Sciences]] had secretly stopped awarding the [[Franz-Grillparzer-Preis]], a prize for dramatists left in trust for that purpose by Austrian national poet [[Franz Grillparzer]].&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Vogler, Christian Michelides (ed.): ''Der Skandal um den Grillparzer-Preis.'' Pressedokumentation, Wien 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he researched and documented the expansionistic endeavours of ''[[Großdeutsche Lösung|großdeutsch]]''-orientated [[Alfred Toepfer]] and his close ties to [[Joseph Goebbels]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pinto-Duschinsky: ''Der Kampf um Geschichte. Der Fall Alfred C. Toepfer und der Nationalsozialismus.'' In: Michael Fahlbusch, Ingo Haar (ed.): ''Völkische Wissenschaften und Politikberatung im 20. Jahrhundert.'' Paderborn 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1994, Michelides changed his focus to [[Human rights activist|human rights activism]] and the defence of [[minorities]]. In June 1995 he founded the first [[International Human Rights Tribunal]] in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wiener Zeitung]]'', June 10, 1995: ''Österreich auf der Anklagebank.'' [Austria in the Dock]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Oberschlick: [http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/1995/7/article36.en.html "Appell des 'Internationalen Menschenrechts-Tribunals' gegen die Diskriminierung von Homosexuellen und Transsexuellen in den Medien".] In: Database on legal information relevant to the audiovisual sector in Europe IRIS Merlin. The Audiovisual Law Information Wizard 1995-7:12/36&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal was chaired by human rights activists [[Freda Meissner-Blau]] and [[Gerhard Oberschlick]]; in this tribunal, Michelides acted as the [[attorney general]]. The theme of the tribunal was the discrimination and persecution of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender-persons in Austria during the period from 1945 to 1995.

Michelides was the founder of the initiative "Häfn human" that counselled and visited [[prison|prison inmates]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falter.at/print/F2001_24_1.php |title=Florian Klenk.

From 1995 to 1997, Michelides chaired the [[Österreichisches Lesben- und Schwulenforum|Austrian Lesbian and Gay Forum]] (ÖLSF) and instigated Austria's first [[LGBT]] parade, called {{Lang|de|Regenbogenparade}} (rainbow parade).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdanachrichten.at/ln305.pdf |title=LN 3&amp;#124;05.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-03}} [Rainbow Parade]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he started his social work for the [[homeless]].

In 2000, Michelides founded [[Lighthouse Wien]], a shelter for homeless drug addicts with severe [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]s, many of them [[HIV-positive]]. In 2002, he graduated as a [[Sex counseling|sex]] and [[mental health counselor]]. Since 2009 Michelides has conducted a psychoanalytic men's group. He now also works as a [[group analyst]] in private practice.

'''Clear title''' is the phrase used to state that the owner of [[real property]] owns it free and clear of [[encumbrance]]s.  In a more limited sense, it is used to state that, although the owner does not own clear title, it is nevertheless within the power of the owner to convey clear title.  For example, a property may be encumbered by a [[Mortgage law|mortgage]].  This encumbrance means that no one has clear title to the property.  However, standard terms in a mortgage require the mortgage holder to release the mortgage if a certain amount of money is paid.  Therefore, a buyer with enough money to satisfy both the mortgage and the current owner can get clear title.

According to Investopedia: "A clear title is a title without any kind of lien or levy from creditors or other parties and poses no question as to legal ownership. For example, an owner of a car with a clear title is the sole undisputed owner, and no other party can make any kind of legal claim to its ownership."

'''''Communisme''''' is a [[French language|French]] multidisciplinary [[academic journal]] in the field of [[Soviet and Communist studies|communist studies]], focusing in particular on the history of communism, founded in 1982 by [[Annie Kriegel]] and [[Stéphane Courtois]]. The starting objective of the journal has been to scientifically analyze the history of communism.

==History==

===Description===
This French biannual multidisciplinary journal brought together specialists of different generations and targeted young people. The editorial board included: [[Nicolas Werth]], Marc Lazar, Philippe Buton, Michel Hastings, Karel Bartosek and Denis Peschanski. Published works include both the teleological (political and doctrinal side) and social (relationships with society, social settlements) dimensions of communism.

===Evolution===
Access to archives of the [[Comintern]], following the collapse of the communist regimes of Eastern Europe, was interpreted by [[Stéphane Courtois]] as providing an opportunity to create a true history of communism.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Courtois, "Archives of Communism: death of a memory, birth of a history", ''[[Le Débat]]'', n° 77, 1993 (Fr).&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been criticized as "aimed at justifying a rewrite of history, the craze for suspecting all "affairs", the explicit desire to exploit the political history of communism in trying to present himself as the sole possessor of the truth of communism".&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Groppo and Bernard Pudal, "Historiographs of French and Italian Communism", in ''The Century of Communism'', Paris: Points Seuil, 2004, p. 107. (Fr)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departures===
Since 1993, a significant portion of the editorial board of the ''Communisme'' journal distanced themselves to express their disagreement with the evolution of the journal. Numerous stirrings agitated the editorial team of the journal, especially the [[Jean Moulin]] matter (when he was accused of being a Soviet agent) and the publication of the Black Book of Communism (under the direction of Courtois, who put Nazism and Communism on the same plane in his preface). This resulted in the resignations of the core of the editorial board, including Karel Bartosek and [[Nicolas Werth]].

The historian Denis Peschanski, who was among the first contributors to the journal "motivated by a desire to make communism a scientific subject" left because he did not feel in tune with the editorial line. He explained that "the collapse of the team began when a renewed police-related history appeared of the [[French Communist Party|PCF]] which was a "scoop".&lt;ref&gt;« Le communisme, entre analyse scientifique et vision policière de l'histoire », ''Le Monde'', 21 Septembre 2000, p. 32 (Fr).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Corruption in Cuba'' states that public ownership resulted in "a lack of identifiable ownership and widespread misuse and theft of state resources... when given opportunity, few citizens hesitate to steal from the government."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64098477|title=Corruption in Cuba : Castro and beyond|last=Sergio.|first=Diaz-Briquets,|date=2006|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Pérez-López, Jorge F.|isbn=9780292714823|edition= 1st|location=Austin|oclc=64098477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the complex relationship between governmental and economic institutions makes them especially "prone to corruption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47738358|title=Political corruption : concepts &amp; contexts|date=2002|publisher=Transaction Publishers|others=Heidenheimer, Arnold J., Johnston, Michael, 1949-|isbn=0765807610|edition= 3rd|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|oclc=47738358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of what causes '''corruption in Cuba''' presently and historically continues to be discussed and debated by scholars. Jules R. Benjamin suggests that Cuba's corrupt politics were a product of the colonial heritage of Cuban politics and the financial aid provided by the United States that favoured international sugar prices in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19811341|title=The United States and the origins of the Cuban Revolution : an empire of liberty in an age of national liberation|last=R.|first=Benjamin, Jules|date=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691025360|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=19811341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Second World War]], the level of corruption in Cuba, among many other Latin American and Caribbean countries, was said to have risen significantly.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/401386259|title=The Cuban connection : drug trafficking, smuggling, and gambling in Cuba from the 1920s to the Revolution|last=Eduardo.|first=Sáenz Rovner,|date=2008|publisher=Univ. of North Carolina Press|isbn=0807831751|location=Chapel Hill|oclc=401386259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, such as Eduardo Sáenz Rovner, attribute this to North America's increased involvement in Cuba after the First World War that isolated Cuban workers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Cubans were excluded from a large sector of the economy and unable to participate in managerial roles that were taken over by United States employers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Along similar lines, Louis A. Pérez has written that “World War Two created new opportunities for Cuban economic development, few of which, however, were fully realized. Funds were used irrationally. Corruption and graft increased and contributed in no small part to missed opportunities, but so did mismanagement and miscalculation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707926335|title=Cuba and the United States : ties of singular intimacy|last=1943-|first=Pérez, Louis A.,|date=2003|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=9780820324838|edition= Third |location=Athens, Ga.|oclc=707926335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transparency International]]'s 2017 Corruption Perception Index (CPI) gave [[Cuba]] a score of 47/100, where 0 indicates that a country is very corrupt and 100 indicates that it is very clean.  Cuba ranks 62nd out of 180 countries in terms of corruption perception, which is an increase of 2 places since last years' CPI score in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/country/CUB|title=Transparency International - Cuba|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Pre-Revolution ===
''For more information: [[Republic of Cuba (1902–1959)|Republic of Cuba (1902-1959)]]''

The Republic of Cuba at the turn of the 20th Century was largely characterized by a deeply ingrained tradition of corruption where political participation resulted in opportunities for elites to engage in opportunities for wealth accumulation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Cuba's first presidential period under [[Tomás Estrada Palma|Don Tomas Estrada Palma]] from 1902 to 1906 was considered to uphold the best standards of administrative integrity in the history of the Republic of Cuba.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2789690|title=Historia de Cuba : la lucha de un pueblo por cumplir su destino histórico y su vocación de libertad|last=1901-1974.|first=Masó y Vázquez, Calixto,|date=1976|publisher=Ediciones Universal|isbn=0897298756|edition= 2nd|location=Miami, Fla.|oclc=2789690}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a United States intervention in 1906 resulted in [[Charles Edward Magoon]], an American diplomat, taking over the government until 1909. It has been debated whether Magoon's government condoned or in fact engaged in corrupt practices. Hugh Thomas suggests that while Magoon disapproved of corrupt practices, corruption still persisted under his administration and he undermined the autonomy of the judiciary and their court decisions.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38157333|title=Cuba, or, The pursuit of freedom|last=1931-2017.|first=Thomas, Hugh,|date=1998|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0306808277|edition= Updated 1st Da Capo Press |location=New York|oclc=38157333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba's subsequent president, [[José Miguel Gómez|Jose Miguel Gomez]], was the first to become involved in pervasive corruption and government corruption [[scandal]]s. These scandals involved [[Bribery|bribes]] that were allegedly paid to Cuban officials and legislators under a contract to search the Havana harbour, as well as the payment of fees to government associates and high-level officials.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Gomez's successor, [[Mario García Menocal|Mario Garcia Menocal]], wanted to put an end to the corruption scandals and claimed to be committed to administrative integrity as he ran on a slogan of "honesty, peace and work." &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Despite his intentions, corruption actually intensified under his government from 1913-1921.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Instances of fraud became more common while private actors and contractors frequently colluded with public officials and legislators. Charles Edward Chapman attributes the increase of corruption to the [[Cuban sugar economy|sugar boom]] that occurred in Cuba under the Menocal administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/67235524|title=A history of the Cuban Republic : a study in Hispanic American politics|last=1880-1941.|first=Chapman, Charles E.

[[Alfredo Zayas y Alfonso|Alfredo Zayas]] succeeded Menocal from 1921–25 and engaged in what Calixto Maso refers to as the most "maximum expression of administrative corruption."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Both petty and grand corruption spread to nearly all aspects of public life and the Cuban administration became largely characterized by [[nepotism]] as Zayas relied on friends and relatives to illegally gain greater access to wealth.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Due to Zaya's previous policies, [[Gerardo Machado]] aimed to diminish corruption and improve the public sector's performance under his successive administration from 1925-1933. While he was successfully able to reduce the amounts of low level and petty corruption, grand corruption still largely persisted. Machado embarked on development projects that enabled the persistence of grand corruption through inflated costs and the creation of "large margins" that enabled public officials to appropriate money illegally.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45733547|title=Pleasure Island : tourism and temptation in Cuba|last=1936-|first=Schwartz, Rosalie,|date=1997|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0585300615|location=Lincoln|oclc=45733547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his government, opportunities for corruption became concentrated into fewer hands with "centralized government purchasing procedures" and the collection of bribes among a smaller number of [[bureaucrat]]s and administrators.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Through the development of real estate infrastructures and the growth of Cuba's tourism industry, Machado's administration was able to use insider information to profit from private sector business deals.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Argote-Freyre points out that Cuba's population under the Republic had a high tolerance for corruption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/77539032|title=Fulgencio Batista : from revolutionary to strongman|last=Frank.|first=Argote-Freyre,|date=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=081354100X|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|oclc=77539032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Cubans knew and criticized who was corrupt, but admired them for their ability to act as "criminals with impunity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Corrupt officials went beyond members of congress to also include military officials who granted favours to residents and accepted bribes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The establishment of an illegal gambling network within the military enabled army personnel such as Lieutenant Colonel Pedraza and Major Mariné to engage in extensive illegal gambling activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mauricio Augusto Font and Alfonso Quiroz, authors of ''The Cuban Republic and José Martí'', say that corruption pervaded in public life under the administrations of Presidents [[Ramón Grau]] and [[Carlos Prío|Carlos Prío Socarrás]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61179604|title=The Cuban Republic and José Martí : reception and use of a national symbol|date=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|others=Font, Mauricio A.

Prior to the Communist revolution, Cuba was ruled under the elected government of [[Fulgencio Batista]] from 1940-1944. Throughout this time period, Batista's support base consisted mainly of corrupt politicians and military officials. Batista himself was able to heavily profit from the regime before coming into power through inflated government contracts and gambling proceeds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1942, the [[British Foreign Office]] reported that the [[U.S. State Department]] was "very worried" about corruption under [[President of Cuba|President]] [[Fulgencio Batista]], describing the problem as "endemic" and exceeding "anything which had gone on previously." British diplomats believed that corruption was rooted within Cuba's most powerful institutions, with the highest individuals in government and military being heavily involved in gambling and the drug trade.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/401386259|title=The Cuban connection : drug trafficking, smuggling, and gambling in Cuba from the 1920s to the Revolution|last=Eduardo.|first=Sáenz Rovner,|date=2008|publisher=Univ. of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807831755|location=Chapel Hill|oclc=401386259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of civil society, Eduardo Saenz Rovner writes that corruption within the Police and government enabled the expansion of criminal organizations in Cuba.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Batista refused [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s offer to send experts to help reform the Cuban Civil Service.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Later in 1952, Batista led a U-S backed [[Coup d'état|military coup]] against Prío Socarras and ruled until 1965.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalresearch.ca/cuba-pre-1959-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-u-s-backed-dictator-with-links-to-the-mob/5464738|title=Cuba Pre-1959: The Rise and Fall of a U.S. Backed Dictator with Links to the Mob|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his rule, Batista led a corrupt [[dictatorship]] that involved close links with organized crime organizations and the reduction of civil freedoms of Cubans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This period resulted in Bastista engaging in more "sophisticated practices of corruption" at both the administrative and civil society levels.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Batista and his administration engaged in profiteering from the lottery as well as illegal gambling.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Corruption further flourished in [[civil society]] through increasing amounts of [[police corruption]], [[censorship]] of the press as well as media, and creating anti-communist campaigns that suppressed opposition with violence, torture and public executions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45844532|title=Contesting Castro : the United States and the triumph of the Cuban Revolution|last=1941-|first=Paterson, Thomas G.,|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195101201|location=New York|oclc=45844532}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former culture of toleration and acceptance towards corruption also dissolved with the dictatorship of Batista. For instance, one citizen wrote that "however corrupt Grau and Prío were, we elected them and therefore allowed them to steal from us. Batista robs us without our permission.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Corruption under Batista further expanded into the economic sector with alliances that he forged with foreign investors and the prevalence of illegal casinos and criminal organizations in the country's capital of Havana.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Post-Revolution ===
''For more information: [[Cuban Revolution]]''

Corruption in the Batista government has been cited as a key factor that led to his overthrow in 1959. Timothy Gaman writes that "Cuba became a cesspool of corruption, illegal drugs and prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalresearch.ca/cuba-pre-1959-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-u-s-backed-dictator-with-links-to-the-mob/5464738|title=Cuba Pre-1959: The Rise and Fall of a U.S. Backed Dictator with Links to the Mob|last=Guzman|first=Timothy Alexander|date=July 26, 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the United States' initial support of Batista, [[John F. Kennedy]] stated in 1961 that,&lt;blockquote href="Saint Lucia"&gt;"The character of the Batista regime in Cuba made a violent popular reaction almost inevitable. The rapacity of the leadership, the corruption of the government, the brutality of the police, the regime's indifference to the needs of the people for education, medical care, housing, for social justice and economic opportunity-all these, in Cuba as elsewhere, constituted an open invitation to revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/dl/free/0072849037/35273/9_3.html|title=The Kennedy Administration: The Reasons for Invading Cuba at the Bay of Pigs (April 3, 1961)|website=highered.mheducation.com|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Once the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] took control of the government, [[Fidel Castro]] immediately began to eliminate all remnants of the former ''batistiano'' system that was seen as highly corrupt. This involved executing several hundred ''batistianos'' and calling for the confiscation of wealth of corrupt officials among other actions. In 1959, Fidel Castro issued a series of law decrees that enabled the confiscation of private property in addition to funds that were previously controlled by Batista and his collaborators.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Cuban government thus transformed from a corrupt military dictatorship system to a single-party socialist authoritarian state.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt;

Despite their efforts to rid Cuba of any former corruption that persisted under Batista, Sergio Diaz-Briquets and Jorge F. Pérez-López, in the book ''Corruption in Cuba'', argue that the government of Fidel and [[Raul Castro]] institutionalized corruption with [[government monopolies]], [[cronyism]], and lack of accountability. Moreover, Daniel Erikson writes that Castro's control of economic resources transformed Cuba into "the most captured state in Latin America" and suggests that corruption might have increased, rather than decreased after the Cuban Revolution.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/7342|title=Looking Forward: Comparative Perspectives on Cuba's Transition|last=Perez-Stable|first=Marifeli|last2=Cardoso|first2=Fernando Henrique|date=2007|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|isbn=9780268089757|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the state has no toleration for political or economic opposition to the government, a system of special advantages evolved for high-ranking members of the Cuban [[nomenklatura]] and the [[Military of Cuba|military]] as they were able to enjoy privileges that were unavailable to ordinary citizens.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The nomenklatura, a term adopted by the former Soviet Union, referred to list of key positions and appointments within the government made by the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This privileged group of political elites were particularly subject to corruption due to their access to state resources. As such, the nomenklatura were able to benefit from certain privileges that are not available to the general public including, but not limited to, being exempt from the rationing system, obtaining imported foods and consumer goods, gaining access to better housing as well as special hospitals and medications, and having the ability to travel abroad.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Cuban [[nomenklatura]] were also referred to as ''pinchos'', ''pinchos grandes'' or ''mayimbes''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Cuba's Socialist Economy and Corruption ====
By 1968, the Cuban state had nationalized 100% of the industry, construction, transportation, retail trade, wholesale and foreign trade, banking and education.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ascecuba.org/asce_proceedings/corruption-and-the-cuban-transition/|title=Corruption and the Cuban Transition - ASCE|work=ASCE|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988, they further controlled 92% of the state's agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a result of their large share of ownership, measuring corruption in Cuba proves to be difficult. Citizens have limited possibilities to appeal against arbitrary or take actions against instances of unjust government action.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, as Pérez-López writes, there is some available information on Cuba's corrupt activities regarding former [[black market]] operations, the misuse of office and presence of the Cuban [[nomenklatura]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other forms of corrupt behaviour such as paying bribes were likely present, but are much more difficult to measure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Professor Esteban Morales Domínguez also states that the illegal market in Cuba's economy was able to emerge due to "large imbalances between [[supply and demand]]" that result in "hidden leaders" offering alternatives to state resources and services.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;

On a micro-level, corruption under the [[Socialism|socialist]] economy involved ordinary citizens engaging in acts of petty corruption in everyday life. Díaz-Briquets and Pérez-López have argued that the socialist economy resulted in the rise of social attitudes that condone taking advantage of inequalities in income and assets for personal benefit.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsmb.am/Maac/ATRANSPARENCY&amp;ACCOUNTABILITY.pdf|title=A Transparency/Accountability Framework for Combating Corruption in Post-Castro Cuba|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was mainly developed through the confiscation of private assets and expropriation of personal property.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result, they suggest that the scarcity of goods and services resulted in the widespread prevalence of petty corruption and crimes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On the other hand, Mark Kruger states that Cuba has had one of the lowest crime rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, specifically referencing the low rates of domestic violence and violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kruger|first=Mark H.|date=March 19, 2007|title=Community-Based Crime Control in Cuba|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10282580601157919|journal=Contemporary Justice Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, theft from the state sector became the main source of resources and products that entered the black market in Cuba.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One Cuban attorney from a cigar factory described the petty theft issue as individuals "faced with shortages of food and basic consumer-products, workers steal from the workplaces where something is made in order to ease their needs."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Other instances of documented theft included stealing bottles of rum, beer, slaughtering stolen cattle, stealing cigarette papers, and more.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

From a government standpoint, public officials in Cuba largely engaged in corrupt practices through the diversion of state resources for personal gains and taking bribes in return for discussing benefits.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, one scandal broke out in which a manager of the [[Antonio Guiteras]] sugar mill had used construction materials to build his own personal pig pen outside of his home.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through a [[Planned economy|centrally planned economy]], the lack of independent civil society organizations and a government controlled press, Klitgaard suggests that this created the perfect conditions under a socialist society for which corruption could flourish.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14214949|title=Controlling corruption|last=E.|first=Klitgaard, Robert|date=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520059859|location=Berkeley|oclc=14214949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban government officials were able to enjoy privileges possessed by few others along with a low degree of accountability for their actions and control over the supply of goods and services.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

In the 1990s, corruption changed its form and visibility due to the changing economic structures that enabled more space for the private sector.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Jorge Dominguez thus writes that the [[marketization]] of the economy in the 1990s contributed to corruption through the "interaction of state and economy" despite its limited nature.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Domínguez|first=Jorge I.|date=2008-05-30|title=Revolution and Its Aftermath in Cuba|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/236953|journal=Latin American Research Review|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|pages=225–240|doi=10.1353/lar.0.0034|issn=1542-4278}}&lt;/ref&gt; New opportunities for corruption were created due to the lack of legal institutions and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] to account for the transitioning economy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The new economic system of the 1990s in Cuba included new, limited opportunities for self-employment in newly private industries such as restaurants. However, due to the scarcity of these jobs, a large proportion of the Cuban population resorted to working in the black market and underground economy.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Cuban citizens further depended on black markets for access to basic resources that exhibit high costs under state-led businesses.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

====Sociolismo====

''[[Sociolismo]]'' is the informal term used in [[Cuba]] to describe the reciprocal exchange of favours by individuals, usually relating to circumventing bureaucratic restrictions or obtaining hard-to-find goods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ramón de la Cruz Ochoa, Cuba's General Prosecutor of the Republic, stated that he viewed ''sociolismo'' as one of the main corruption problems in Cuba.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This system involves rewarding friends and family of government officials and generally results in individuals disregarding the rule of law.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/economics/wp-content/uploads/cep04-12.pdf|title=Cuba's Underground Economy|last=Ritter|first=Archibald|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Marx wrote that "in cash-poor Cuba, connections are as good as currency" and thus the system of ''sociolismo'' is able to flourish.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-11-15/news/0411150150_1_cubans-connections-friend|title=Getting one's way on an isle of want|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, ''sociolismo'' expanded into daily life as it involved maintaining relationships with individuals that had access to resources.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Personal ties are used in Cuba in nearly every aspect of daily life, from receiving extra food that is rationed by the government to securing spaces in schools for children.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In relation to ''sociolismo'', Fernández also uses the term ''lo informal'' to refer to the behavioural patterns involving likability (''simpatia)'', familiarity that leads to trust (''confianza),'' and being a nice person (''ser buena gente)'' that serve create informal networks and bypass legal norms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55670447|title=Cuba and the politics of passion|last=J.|first=Fernández, Damián|date=2000|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=0292798792|edition= 1st|location=Austin|oclc=55670447}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, participation in ''lo informal'' results in individuals engaging in a "culture of illegality" and becoming accustomed to breaking the law.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In terms of the word's origin, it is derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''socio'' which means business partner or buddy, and is a [[pun]] on ''socialismo'', the Spanish term for [[socialism]]. It is analogous to the ''[[Blat (Russia)|blat]]'' of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Cuba in the 21st Century: Combatting Corruption ===
Erikson identifies the control of corruption as one of the main obstacles that Cuba must overcome in order to transition successfully away from authoritarian rule to democracy.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The Cuba Transition Project (CTP) has aimed to propose anti-corruption policies as an important component of a greater transition strategy for Cuba.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2001, the Cuban Government set up a Ministry for Auditing and Control to investigate corruption and improve efficiency in the Cuban economy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, Lopez and Diaz-Briquets have pointed out that this system relies upon transparency and accountability in order to function, which is lacking in Cuba through their tendencies to hide budgetary and financial information. A [[BBC news]] article stated that foreign businessmen in Cuba said levels of corruption were lower than in most other countries in Latin America.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5397926.stm|title=Cuba businesses 'cheat clients'|date=2006-10-02|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC says that "Inspectors went to thousands of state-run enterprises and consistently found customers being short-changed. The offences included beer mugs being only partially filled, taxi rides being charged at almost five times the going rate, government price lists being hidden, even shoe repairers charging vastly inflated rates."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Fidel Castro announced in 2005 his new efforts to root out cases of corruption and avoid maldistribution of government goods and services.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This included a major housing initiative that involved the participation of local governments and citizens as a strategy to prevent corrupt practices and maximize the benefits of the housing program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Castro later promised in the same year to embark on a battle against theft, immoral conduct and misuse of government resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After Raúl Castro took power in 2006, over 10 corruption scandals have been uncovered and several public servants were arrested.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4fc4a39d2.html|title=Refworld {{!}} Cuba: Corruption at the state and private level|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=Refworld|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Raúl Castro's government led additional initiatives to crack down on possible corruption cases through auditing and inspections. This led to the conviction of Rogelio Acevedo who had leased Cuba's airline's planes and was found with millions of dollars worth of cash in his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2011/05/corruption_cuba|title=The cleanup continues|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raúl Castro later created the Office of the Comptroller General to fight corruption after stating that corruption risked destroying Cuba's "values and morality and it corrodes our institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700199377/Amid-economic-reforms-Cuba-goes-after-corruption.html|title=Amid economic reforms, Cuba goes after corruption|date=2011-11-19|work=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other convictions, high-level employees from the [[Tourism agency|Tourist Agency]] ''Sol y Son'' as well as the food company ''Río Zaza'' were arrested for [[fraud]] and bribery.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Both companies were said to have had ties to a previously arrested corrupt businessman and close friend of Fidel Castro.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

'''Corruption in Romania''' can be found in the politics, military, health care and private businesses and poses concerns for foreign investors. Although there have been improvements since the fall of the communist regime in 1989, corruption remains a problem in [[Romania]] as it is especially found on all levels of public office, in the police force as well as in the judiciary system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/romania|title=Romania Corruption Report|last=GAN|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Transparency International]]'s annual [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], as of 2017, Romania is the third most corrupt country in the [[European Union]] after Bulgaria, Hungary and at the same level as Greece. The same index also ranks the country as the 59th most corrupt nation out of 180 countries.&lt;ref name="cpi20162"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, despite efforts using laws and regulations to prevent corruption, enforcement has been weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2017/01/04/fighting-corruption-with-con-tricks-romanias-assault-on-the-rule-of-law/|title=Fighting Corruption with Con Tricks: Romania’s Assault on the Rule of Law {{!}} Henry Jackson Society|website=henryjacksonsociety.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014 however, the investigation and prosecution of medium- and high-level political, judicial and administrative officials by the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]] has increased &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2015/241712.htm|title=2015 Investment Climate Statement - Romania|work=The US Department of State|publisher=The US Department of State|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Anticorruption Directorate]] was established in 2002 by the Romanian government to investigate and prosecute corruption related offenses causing damage to the Romanian state.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} 

In terms of scandals, corruption was cited among many issues that provoked the [[2012–15 unrest in Romania|2012–15 social unrest]], the [[2015 Romanian protests|2015 protests]] following the [[Colectiv nightclub fire]], and the [[2017 Romanian protests|2017 protests]].

==  Background ==
After the fall of communism in 1989, Romania has struggled and is still struggling with its transition towards democracy and establishing a well-functioning judicial system.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=David|date=January  2017|title=Fighting Corruption with Con Tricks: Romania's Assault on the Rule of Law|url=|journal=The Henry Jackson Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the treaty was signed with the [[European Union]], former president [[Traian Băsescu]] mentioned that "Romania [was] not yet prepared to meet the European Union's standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/europe-union-how-fit-are-romania-and-bulgaria-for-the-eu-a-352874.html|title=Europe Union: How Fit Are Romania and Bulgaria for the EU?|date=2005-04-18|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since entering the [[European Union|EU]], Romania has somewhat improved [[Government transparency|transparency]] and accountability in the [[public sector]], but the European Commission still considers the government's reform to be slow and weak.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/thursromania-praised-again-by-monitoring-report-but-weaknesses-remain/|title=Romania praised again in EU justice monitoring report but weaknesses remain|website=EURACTIV.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor implementation of laws on the transparency of information and decision-making processes between government officials coupled with the bribes and conflicts of interests in public procurement practices makes the judicial system ineffective in fighting against corruption. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52015DC0035|title=EUR-Lex - 52015DC0035 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had consequences in effectively using the [[European Union]]'s funds towards developing the country. Although it plays a considerable role in the country's stagnant path towards progress, corruption is only one of the issues among others. Other factors include the administrative capacity of public purchasers, the lack of stability and fragmentation of the legal framework, the quality of competition in public procurement and few others listed in the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/de/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52015SC0042 Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/romania/snapshot.aspx|title=Snapshot of the Romania Country Profile|work=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|publisher=GAN Integrity Solutions|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[European Commission]] expressed concerns about the [[rule of law]], pointing to the power struggle between Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]] and President [[Traian Băsescu]], which gave rise to what is called the  [[2012 Romanian political crisis|2012 political crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/romanian-power-struggle-alarms-europes-leaders/|title=Romanian power struggle alarms Europe's leaders|author=Andrew Gardner, Toby Vogel|date=11 July 2012|work=European Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/22/romania-politics-idUSL5E8MD5G320121122|title=Populism takes spotlight in Romania power struggle|author=Sam Cage, Luiza Ilie|date=22 November 2012|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also criticized Romania for failing to root out corruption in its state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18889374|title=EU Commission chides Romania over state corruption|date=18 July 2012|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, the Chamber of Deputies passed without parliamentary debate several controversial amendments to the [[Penal Code of Romania|Penal Code]], including that the country's president, senators, members of the lower chamber, as well as lawyers are no longer to be considered "public officials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/12/legally-corrupt-romanian-politicians-chase-super-immunity-2013123183238113962.html|title=Legally corrupt: Romanian politicians chase 'super-immunity'|author=Raluca Besliu|date=18 January 2014|work=Aljazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/transparency_international_romania_statment_on_recent_immunity_decision_by|title=Transparency International Romania statement on recent immunity decision by Chamber of Deputies|date=12 December 2013|work=Transparency International}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actors can as a result take part in illicit interests without being held accountable for [[abuse of office]], [[bribery]], [[conflicts of interest]] and other corruption crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/justice/122424|title=Romanian MPs decriminalise political corruption|author=Valentina Pop|date=11 December 2013|work=EUobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments were sharply criticized by Romanian opposition parties and European leaders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/22/us-romania-politics-idUSBRE90L0PG20130122|title=Romania parliament boosts criminal immunity, may irk EU|author=Luiza Ilie|date=22 January 2013|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Constitutional Court of Romania]] cataloged this move as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205403832_text|title=Romania: Court Finds Immunity Law Unconstitutional|author=Wendy Zeldin|date=23 January 2014|work=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report from the US Department of State published in May 2015 demonstrates that the government of Romania still takes part in corrupt activities such as bypassing standard legislative procedures [[2017–2018 Romanian protests#cite note-auto6-12|and]] imposing fines on infrastructure in certain sectors like the energy industry. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2015/241712.htm|title=2015 Investment Climate Statement - Romania|website=US Department of State|accessdate=May 2015|ref=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of political will demonstrated by the 2012 political crisis as well as the under-funding of the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]]  poses a major challenge in investigating and enforcing sanctions to bureaucratic corruption. Although the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]] has taken action in investigating corrupt cases, enforcing sanctions remains weak and staff and inspection procedures are under-resourced. As it is mentioned in the report, "conflict of interest, respect for standards of ethical conduct, and integrity in public office in general remain a concern for all three branches of government" and the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]] will further its initiatives in tackling the problem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Anti-corruption measures ==
[[File:Afis anticoruptie ANAF.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-corruption poster in [[Bucharest]]]]
In 2014, the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]] indicted 1,138 authorities. Among them were politicians, judges and prosecutors, and businessmen. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-eu-31537338|title=Romania anti-sleaze drive reaches elite|last=|first=|date=19 February 2015|website=BBC News|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the number of filed cases against high-level politicians and businessmen that committed corrupt acts has increased by an additional 1,250 people and has had a substantial social impact. Out of those people are Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]], 5 ministers and 21 parliamentarians.&lt;ref name="DNA Report, 20152"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pna.ro/obiect2.jsp?id=249|title=Raport de activitate 2015|publisher=National Anticorruption Directorate|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been 970 final convictions throughout the year and the amount of damages recovered has increased to €194.37 million.&lt;ref name="DNA Report, 20152" /&gt;

In 2016, 1,270 more people were brought to trial, including 3 ministers, 17 parliamentarians, 47 mayors, 16 magistrates and 21 CEOs.&lt;ref name="DNA Report, 20162"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pna.ro/obiect2.jsp?id=285|title=Raport de activitate 2016|publisher=National Anticorruption Directorate|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of damages recovered has increased to €226 million.&lt;ref name="DNA Report, 20152" /&gt;

2017 marked the year where an additional 997 individuals were accused and found guilty by the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]], including the former [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania|President of the Chamber of Deputies]], 6 parliamentarians, 3 ministers, 49 mayors, 6 magistrates and 11 CEOs.&lt;ref name="DNA Report, 20172"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pna.ro/obiect2.jsp?id=328|title=Raport de activitate 2017|publisher=National Anticorruption Directorate|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of damages recovered has decreased to €159.5 million.&lt;ref name="DNA Report, 20172" /&gt;

In January 2017, the newly appointed government modified the Penal Code and Penal Procedure Code overnight as a way to fix the issue of overcrowding in prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/romanians-protest-government-plan-to-commute-sentences/|title=Romanians protest government plan to commute sentences|date=2017-01-22|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents released accusations that the government has actually modified the Codes as a way to decriminalize political corruption, to release former politicians from prison without punishment and to stop any accusations and investigations made to current authorities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-21569643-nucleara-din-justitie-lista-potentialilor-beneficiari-dezincrimarii-mascate-abuzului-serviciu.htm?nomobile=|title=Nucleara din justitie.

Gu Wengen, Commander of the People's Liberation Army (Navy) South Sea Fleet during a courtesy call.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral [[Gary Roughead]] making a courtesy call on Vice Admiral [[Gu Wengen]] in the port of [[Zhanjiang]]]]
A '''courtesy call''' is a call or visit made out of politeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/courtesy+call|title=Definition of COURTESY CALL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Diplomacy==
In diplomacy, a courtesy call is a formal meeting in which a diplomat or representative or a famous person of a nation pays a visit out of courtesy to a head of state or state office holder. Courtesy calls may be paid by another [[head of state]], a [[prime minister]], a [[Minister (government)|minister]] (Government), or a [[diplomat]]. The meeting is usually of symbolic value and rarely involves a detailed discussion of issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=CXHADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=diplomacy+%22courtesy+call%22+symbolic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWkejQ29_bAhWUNcAKHWsOD9YQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22courtesy%20call%22&amp;f=false Paradiplomacy: Cities and States as Global Players],  Rodrigo Tavares&lt;/ref&gt; 

A newly appointed [[head of mission]] will usually make a courtesy call to the receiving foreign minister, head of government, and often other dignitaries such as the local mayor. It is also customary for a new head of mission to make courtesy calls to other heads of missions in the capital and often to receive return courtesy calls. Neglecting to pay a courtesy call to missions of smaller countries may result in them resenting the newly arrived mission head. Upon the departure of a head of mission, an additional round of courtesy calls is often expected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=xzTdwLE2mMcC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=%22Courtesy+call%22+diplomacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuh9GK29_bAhWDL8AKHX4CBx0Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Courtesy%20call%22%20diplomacy&amp;f=false The Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Diplomacy], Palgrave Macmillan, G. Berridge, Alan James, Lorna Lloyd, page 85&lt;/ref&gt; Fulfilling this protocol obligation is a time consuming task, with one diplomat noting it took him five months to complete a round in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=BfACAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=round+of+%22courtesy+calls%22+diplomacy&amp;dq=round+of+%22courtesy+calls%22+diplomacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9n_Xp39_bAhUJIMAKHZgyAO84ChDoAQgwMAI Assignment in Washington], Eduardo Z. Romuáldez, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomatic convention states courtesy calls last 20 minutes, which is some cases is excessive with both sides searching frantically for what to say, though some ambassadors consult an encyclopedia prior to the call to prepare talking points. In other cases, in which the meeting sides have joint items to discuss, a call may last an hour or two. Diplomatic personnel are split on the value of courtesy calls, some seeing them as a time wasting tradition while others see them as a means to secure a valuable introduction. In some cases, it is possible to arrange a joint courtesy call by visiting a senior ambassador who will, by prearrangement, assemble his regional colleagues for the meeting.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BrKuCwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=round+of+%22courtesy+calls%22+diplomacy&amp;ots=izO09pQZMe&amp;sig=C1-ho-KfM7_CvaA4ArpG31Di3No&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22courtesy%20calls%22&amp;f=false Third-World Diplomats in Dialogue with the First World: The New Diplomacy],  Robert J. Moore, Palgrave Macmillan, pages 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtesy calls to cabinet members and members of parliament or congress are important and may lay the foundation for a continuing relationship. In Western democracies, ambassadors will pay calls to leaders of minor and major opposition parties as a change of government may occur at a future point. Such calls are important, and the ambassador must take care to cultivate the opposition without offending the incumbents. Calls to civic dignitaries of major cities, newspaper editors, and trade unions are also performed.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

== Naval ==
Naval courtesy calls were common in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkxCAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22courtesy+calls%22|title=The Great White Fleet: Its Voyage Around the World, 1907–1909|last=Hart|first=Robert A.|date=1965|publisher=Little, Brown|page=15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Great White Fleet]] paid a series of courtesy calls to ports around the world in a show of American naval strength in 1907-1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJYYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT210&amp;lpg=PT210&amp;dq=%22great+white+fleet%22+%22courtesy+call%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NVUAirCgcZ&amp;sig=cCyPX2N5ZMrhOwC07mDbNHqi9NE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiohMXI59_bAhVOfMAKHaPjBd4Q6AEISzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22great%20white%20fleet%22%20%22courtesy%20call%22&amp;f=false|title=Bamboozled!: How America Loses the Intellectual Game with Japan and Its Implications for Our Future in Asia: How America Loses the Intellectual Game with Japan and Its Implications for Our Future in Asia|last=Hall|first=Ivan P.|date=2016-09-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315290553|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Navy]] regulations require that (upon joining a new ship or station) an officer must make a courtesy call to his new commanding officer or commandant within 48 hours after joining.&lt;ref&gt;Naval Ceremonies, Customs, and Traditions, William P. Mack, Naval Institute Press, 1980, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
In business a courtesy call is a visit or call from a company to customers for the purposes of gauging satisfaction or to thank them for their patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/courtesy-call|title=courtesy call Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Climate Change Programme''' (ECCP) was launched in June 2000 by the [[European Union]]'s [[European Commission]], with the purpose of [[avoiding dangerous climate change]].

The goal of the ECCP is to identify, develop and implement all the necessary elements of an EU strategy to implement the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. All EU countries' [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|ratifications of the Kyoto Protocol]] were deposited simultaneously on 31 May 2002. The ECCP involved all the relevant stakeholders working together, including representatives from Commission's different departments, the member states, industry and environmental groups. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eubusiness.com/topics/environ/eccp&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS) is perhaps the most significant contribution of the ECCP, and the EU ETS is the largest [[carbon emissions trading|greenhouse gas emissions trading]] scheme in the world.

In 1996 the EU adopted a target of a maximum 2°C rise in global mean temperature, compared to pre-industrial levels. Since then, European Leaders have reaffirmed this goal several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

This review will be based on a thorough impact assessment of the existing Community target of a new car fleet average emission of '''120 [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] g/km''' and of the possible measures that could form part of a revised strategy based on an integrated approach to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions reductions.

On 7 February 2007, the [[European Commission]] announced plans for new legislation requiring the average [[carbon dioxide]] emissions of the vehicles produced in 2012 to be no more than 130 g/km. This is a bit more than the goal of 120, which corresponds to 4.5 [[litre|L]]/100&amp;nbsp;km for [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and 5 L/100&amp;nbsp;km for gasoline engines.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/155&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en#fnB2&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the [[European Commission]] presented the '''EU Transport Roadmap''', which shows pathways to achieve a 60% cut in greenhouse gases from all modes of transport by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/news/transport/110328_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public funding ==

Public funding of Canada's federal political parties is allocated in two ways:&lt;ref name="Conservatives cutting wrong political subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Electoral System of Canada - Political financing"/&gt;

* [[#Per-vote subsidy|Per-vote subsidies]] (2004 to 2015) - allocated according to the votes of Canadians.
* [[#Electoral expense reimbursement|Electoral expense reimbursements]] - reimbursements allocated according to party spending during election periods.

The per-vote subsidy (amounting to $27.7 million in 2009), also referred to as the "government allowance", the "quarterly allowance", or the "direct public subsidy", was argued by some political commentators to be the most democratic of the three funding mechanisms: The choices of 100% of voters of eligible parties (13,675,146 individual Canadians or 99% of all valid votes in the preceding election) are taken into account, all on an equal-basis.&lt;ref name="Conservatives cutting wrong political subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Voter Turnout at Federal Elections and Referendums, 1867-2008"&gt;[http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=ele&amp;dir=turn&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e Voter Turnout at Federal Elections and Referendums, 1867-2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM targets party subsidies"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2011/01/13/harper-toronto-appearances.html PM targets party subsidies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subsides for parties, for and against"&gt;[http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Editorial+Subsides+parties+against/4558029/story.html Subsides for parties, for and against]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition parties accept defeat on per-vote subsidy"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/budget/news/opposition-parties-accept-defeat-on-per-vote-subsidy/article2046672/ Opposition parties accept defeat on per-vote subsidy]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some argue that political contributions are democratic by virtue of being completely voluntary, statistics show that upper income individuals make the large majority of political contributions and stand to gain the most by way of tax incentives for those contributions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The electoral expense reimbursement, which accounts for the largest part of the public financing following an election ($54 million in 2009), reimburses 50%-60% of a party's expenses on elections - the more a party spends during an election, the more public funds they get back.&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Electoral System of Canada - Political financing"/&gt;

=== Per-vote subsidy to 2015 ===

Until 2015, every registered federal political party that received inflation-indexed subsidy each year of $1.53-$2.04 per vote received in the preceding election.&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;

=== 2006 challenge to 2% threshold &amp; controversy ===

In 2006, in an Ontario Court of Justice ruling &lt;ref&gt;https://jimbender.wordpress.com/2006/12/16/supreme-court-documents-related-to-the-2-challenge/&lt;/ref&gt;, several small federal parties had successfully challenged provisions in the original law that limited reimbursement to parties receiving at least 2% of all valid votes in the preceding general election or at least 5% of the valid votes in the electoral districts in which it had a candidate.  Judge P. Theodore Matlow ruled that "the law made it difficult for members of small parties to "play a meaningful role in the electoral process." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/votes-for-small-federal-parties-now-worth-1-75-1.624533&lt;/ref&gt;.  They were reimbursed retroactively for funds withheld from them.

This removal however opened the government to criticism of funding small extremist parties including the [[Marijuana Party of Canada]], [[Communist Party of Canada]], [[Christian Heritage Party of Canada]] who had participated in the suit along with the less generally controversial [[Green Party of Canada]], [[Progressive Canadian Party of Canada]] and [[Canadian Action Party]].

==== removal of subsidy ====

The per-vote subsidy was removed in stages after the passing of the ''Keeping Canada’s Economy &amp; Jobs Growing Act'', a bill introduced by the Conservative Party in October 2011.&lt;ref name="Conservative Government press release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minister of Finance Introduces the Keeping Canada's Economy &amp; Jobs Growing Act|url=http://www.fin.gc.ca/n11/11-093-eng.asp|website=Department of Finance Canada|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Previous to 2015 ===

Of the three ways in which federal parties are allocated public funding, the per-vote subsidy is largely argued as the most democratic as it rewards each vote absolutely equally.  However, there are reasons to believe that it creates perverse incentives, such as running for votes where candidates cannot win, thus defeating (at least under [[first past the post]] voting) the party's own policy objectives, and muddying it's potential alliances with every other party once legislatures sit.  Election financing is a complex issue that has been studied in depth academically &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/%7Eaheard/elections/laws.html&lt;/ref&gt;

100% of the voters of eligible parties (99% of all voters in the preceding election) have a say, with their input treated on equal basis (1 voter, 1 vote).&lt;ref name="Party subsidy is democracy in action"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Don't Scrap the Voter Subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper plan would undermine democracy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Political parties could be forced to return to big money corporate funding if per-vote subsidies scrapped, says Kingsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservatives cutting wrong political subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Voter Turnout at Federal Elections and Referendums, 1867-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PM targets party subsidies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition parties accept defeat on per-vote subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Killing vote subsidy bad for democracy"&gt;[http://www.brandonsun.com/opinion/killing-vote-subsidy-bad-for-democracy-122649193.html?thx=y Killing vote subsidy bad for democracy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper ‘trying to annihilate the opposition’ by killing per-vote subsidies"/&gt;

The subsidy entered into effect on January 1, 2004, at $1.75 per vote (indexed to the [[Consumer Price Index]]) as part of a set of amendments made by the [[Jean Chrétien]] government to the [[Canada Elections Act]] which for the first time set limits on political contributions by individuals and organizations (corporations, unions, non-profit groups). The per-vote subsidy was introduced to replace the reliance of political parties and candidates on corporate, union, and wealthy donors in order to reduce the political influence of such donors.&lt;ref name="Party subsidy is democracy in action"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Political parties could be forced to return to big money corporate funding if per-vote subsidies scrapped, says Kingsley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/features/parliament/party-finance/regulating-donations.html Regulating Political Donations]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 court challenge to remove the 2%/5% threshold, the subsidy was reduced to $1.53 by the Harper government on April 1, 2012, and was reduced on each subsequent April 1, until its elimination in 2015.&lt;ref name="Opposition parties accept defeat on per-vote subsidy"/&gt;.

=== Public subsidy of contributions ===

Political contributions are publicly subsidized via a personal income tax credit that credits 75% of the first $400 contributed, 50% of the amount between $400 and $750, and 33.33% of the amount over $750, up to a maximum tax credit of $650 (reached when contributions by an individual total $1,275 in one calendar year.) As of 2017, the maximum political contribution is $1,550 and increases by $25 each year thereafter. this can be given to the national organization of each party, the tax credit is $650, representing a subsidy of 42%.&lt;ref name="Political parties could be forced to return to big money corporate funding if per-vote subsidies scrapped, says Kingsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Electoral System of Canada - Political financing"&gt;[http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=ces&amp;document=part3&amp;lang=e#36 The Electoral System of Canada - Political financing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;document=index&amp;dir=lim&amp;lang=e Limits on Contributions ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxtips.ca/filing/politicalcontributions.htm Political contribution tax credits]&lt;/ref&gt;

(''Note: The actual numbers of unique individual contributors are likely to be less than the totals shown as multiple anonymous contributions of under $20 by the same person are counted as separate contributors, and contributions made by the same person to both the riding level and at the party level, to different ridings, and/or to different parties are also all counted as separate contributors.'')

=== Electoral expense reimbursement ===

When an election takes place, perhaps the most significant source of public funding for the federal political parties is the election expenses reimbursement which subsidizes 50% of the national campaign expenses of any party that obtains at least 2 per cent support, or at least 5 per cent in the [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] (electoral districts) in which they presented candidates. In addition to this, the parties' riding organizations are also reimbursed 60% of all expenses incurred by their candidates in each riding where they obtained at least 10% of the votes, plus 100% of allowable "personal expenses". The reimbursements are also referred to as "government rebates", "government transfers", or "election rebates".&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;

Under this subsidy, the more a party spends, the more they are subsidized. The subsidy therefore magnifies the public funds allocated by tax credits on political contributions and by the per-vote subsidies. It also means that loans to political parties and their candidates can play a significant role in determining how much public money is received by the parties.&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;

During the 2008 election, the Conservatives spent the most, and, as a result, received the largest reimbursements under this public subsidy in 2009.&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;

== Private funding ==

Private funding of the federal political parties occurs through political contributions made by individuals, but these contributions are vastly subsidized by public funds disbursed through tax credits.

As of 2017, the maximum yearly contribution limit is $1550 to a given federal political party, $1550 to a given party's riding associations, $1550 to a given party's leadership candidates, and $1550 for each independent candidate. The total tax credit for all contributions is capped at $650, representing a subsidy of 42%.&lt;ref name="The Electoral System of Canada - Political financing" /&gt;

Of the $46 million in political contributions received in 2009 by federal party organizations and riding associations, between $28.5 million and $31 million of the contributions was publicly funded - through tax credits amounting to between 62% and 67.5% - while between $15 million and $17.5 million was net private funding.&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

=== Cost of fundraising ===

In order to solicit political monetary contributions, [[fundraising]] is a major focus for many parties that involves hiring fundraising experts, and employing sophisticated database systems, email lists, newsletters, and [[telemarketing]].&lt;ref name="Expanding the debate on party financing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Subsides for parties, for and against"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Experts say Tories 'extraordinarily successful' at fundraising on wedge issues, hope and fear"&gt;[http://www.thehilltimes.ca/page/view/fundraising-11-22-2010 Experts say Tories 'extraordinarily successful' at fundraising on wedge issues, hope and fear]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liberal election debacle was years in the making"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/996374--liberal-election-debacle-was-years-in-the-making Liberal election debacle was years in the making]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative Party, for example, is reported to make phone calls or send letters to about 200,000 people a month, and conducts surveys to collect and feed information on the views of individuals into its database referred to as CIMS, an acronym for "Constituent Information Management System". The information stored in the database is then used to customize mailings and phone calls for each targeted donor to appeal to them specifically on issues that they are known to react more strongly to.&lt;ref name="Experts say Tories 'extraordinarily successful' at fundraising on wedge issues, hope and fear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liberal election debacle was years in the making"/&gt;

Other associated overhead for fundraising include legal consultation, processing, accounting, auditing, and reporting costs.

&lt;br&gt;In 2009, the overhead cost of fundraising for the top three parties exceeded the net private funds they raised. They spent a combined $11.2 million on fundraising at the party level (riding-level expenses not included), according to their 2009 annual party returns, to raise approximately $10.3 million in net private funds.&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

=== The corrupting influence of fundraising ===

In 2006, it was revealed during the Liberal leadership contest that one candidate, Joe Volpe, had received a total of $108,000 in contributions from 20 individuals that were all in some way connected to the top corporate executives of Apotex Pharmaceuticals. Each of the 20 individuals - which included 11-year-old twin boys and a 14-year-old boy - gave exactly $5,400, the maximum allowed at the time.&lt;ref name="Political parties could be forced to return to big money corporate funding if per-vote subsidies scrapped, says Kingsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Political contributions: money, money, money"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/cdngovernment/political-contributions.html Political contributions: money, money, money]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political financing expert Louis Massicotte, a political scientist from [[Université Laval]], political systems that rely heavily on political contributions from individuals can encourage corruption. In 2010-2011, it was discovered that corporations had been funnelling money to major provincial political parties by disguising the corporate funds as individual political contributions made by their employees, circumventing the political fundraising laws. Former employees of one corporation flatly admitted that political contributions had illicitly been made in their name.&lt;ref name="Harper, Quebec differ on per-vote subsidy"&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20110401/harper-quebec-subsidy-110401/20110401?s_name=election2011 Harper, Quebec differ on per-vote subsidy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420032011/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20110401/harper-quebec-subsidy-110401/20110401?s_name=election2011 |date=2011-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the provincial level in Quebec, the far-reaching influence of fundraisers over everything from the selection of judges to the distribution of construction contracts fuelled widespread demand for a [[public inquiry]] into [[political corruption]], and caused the [[Jean Charest]] Liberal government and other major political parties to agree to increase the provincial per-vote subsidy as a way to reduce the influence of  party [[bagman|bagmen]] ([[influence peddling]] political fundraisers) over government decisions and policies.&lt;ref name="Harper, Quebec differ on per-vote subsidy"/&gt;

=== Lack of transparency ===

Political parties are only required to report the identities of contributors that have given a total of over $200 to one riding association or the central organization. For donations of $200 or less, receipts must be kept by the individual riding associations, but Elections Canada has no way to keep track of them. Completely anonymous contributions of $20 or less are permitted.&lt;ref name="Our Democracy for Sale, Still"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loophole tears lid off political donations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ottawa refuses to close donation loophole"/&gt;

In 1997, Industry Minister [[John Manley]] only disclosed the identities of individuals and corporations who contributed $10,150 and $15,800, respectively, to his re-election campaign.  However, he did not disclose where $74,664 - received through his riding association - had originally come from.&lt;ref name="Political parties could be forced to return to big money corporate funding if per-vote subsidies scrapped, says Kingsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Election Financing's Black Hole"&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0012152 Election Financing's Black Hole]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2002, [[Paul Martin]] refused to reveal the names of donors to his leadership campaign, claiming that new disclosure rules brought in a month earlier applied only to current cabinet and not to a former cabinet minister as he was, and that he did not think it would be fair to name people who had donated to his campaign before the new disclosure rules were in effect.&lt;ref name="Political contributions: money, money, money"/&gt;

In October 2002, [[Stephen Harper]] initially did not reveal the names of anyone who had donated to his leadership campaign. While he later quietly posted a few names - those of 54 donors who had given more than $1,075 each - he continued to keep secret the identities of 10 other large donors and the names of more than 9,000 donors who each gave sums of less than $1,000 each.&lt;ref name="Political contributions: money, money, money"/&gt;

In 2009, an annual report by [[Global Integrity]], an independent non-profit organization that tracks corruption trends around the world, said that Canada posted a slight "downward tick" based on secrecy surrounding political financing and gaps in government accountability.&lt;ref name="Lax rules on political financing No. 1 global corruption threat: report"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2009/02/18/corruption.html Lax rules on political financing No. 1 global corruption threat: report ]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Global Integrity, "Canada is a really interesting case" in that while, it had a generally positive rating, there are "unique gaps in the system that are strange," including the fact that political financing loans to candidates are confidential.&lt;ref name="Lax rules on political financing No. 1 global corruption threat: report"/&gt;

According to Ottawa-based Democracy Watch: "Government integrity continues to be undermined by loopholes that allow secret donations to some candidates."&lt;ref name="Lax rules on political financing No. 1 global corruption threat: report"/&gt;

=== Loopholes in contributions limits ===

[[Elections Canada]] confirmed in 2007 that individuals could illegally contribute as much as $60,500 over the $1,100 limit and not be detected - simply by donating $200 to each of a party's 308 riding associations.&lt;ref name="Our Democracy for Sale, Still"&gt;[https://thetyee.ca/Views/2007/08/13/DemoSale/ Our Democracy for Sale, Still]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loophole tears lid off political donations"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070801.wdonationsloophole01/BNStory/National/?cid=al_gam_nletter_newsUp Loophole tears lid off political donations]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ottawa refuses to close donation loophole"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ottawa-refuses-to-close-donation-loophole/article20399805/ Ottawa refuses to close donation loophole]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections Canada claimed that it currently cannot track donations of $200 or less because "we do not get the receipts" from the individual riding associations.&lt;ref name="Loophole tears lid off political donations"/&gt;
Under current regulations, a party's individual riding associations are only required to report the identities of contributors with total contributions to the riding of over $200. Contributions of $200 or less are allowed to be reported in aggregate, with no break-down by contributor required that would allow for proper cross-checking across a party's ridings associations.&lt;ref name="Our Democracy for Sale, Still"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loophole tears lid off political donations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ottawa refuses to close donation loophole"/&gt;

At the time, the NDP called for the loophole to be plugged.
The Conservative government responded that
"this is no more a loophole than the fact that someone can break the law by fraudulently misstating their income on their income tax."
It rejected
calls by the opposition for Elections Canada to be given new measures
and tools to be able to detect multiple donations across a party's
ridings that exceed the contribution limit.&lt;ref name="Ottawa refuses
to close donation loophole"/&gt;

== Debate over the subsidies ==

The Conservative Party has targeted the [[#Per-vote subsidy|per-vote subsidy]] for elimination, while favouring the generous [[#Subsidy of political contributions|public subsidy of private political contributions]]. All of the other major Canadian parties - the Liberals, NDP, Bloc, and Green Party - oppose the elimination of the per-vote subsidy.&lt;ref name="Don't Scrap the Voter Subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservatives cutting wrong political subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PM targets party subsidies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Subsides for parties, for and against"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The per-vote subsidy: Political welfare or the great leveller?"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/the-per-vote-subsidy-political-welfare-or-the-great-leveller/article1968001/ The per-vote subsidy: Political welfare or the great leveller?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition outraged by party cuts"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/545144 Opposition outraged by party cuts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative government first tried to eliminate the per-vote subsidy in November 2008, just after the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|federal election of October 14, 2008]]. The Conservative party had not brought up the issue before Canadian voters during the election campaign, but on November 27 - only days into its new mandate that began November 18 - the Conservative government attempted to eliminate the per-vote subsidy through a provision tucked within a fiscal update - and designated the update as a [[confidence motion]] that would trigger the fall of the government, and the prospect of another election, unless passed.&lt;ref name="Subsides for parties, for and against"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition outraged by party cuts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Defence of subsidies for political parties not a sound-bite issue"&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Defence+subsidies+political+parties+sound+bite+issue/4548812/story.html Defence of subsidies for political parties not a sound-bite issue]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper’s plan to scrap per-vote subsidies to political parties would create two-party state, says Nanos"&gt;[http://www.thehilltimes.ca/dailyupdate/view/74 Harper’s plan to scrap per-vote subsidies to political parties would create two-party state, says Nanos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. cables dissect Canada’s leaders: WikiLeaks"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/05/01/wikileaks-canada-leaders.html U.S. cables dissect Canada’s leaders: WikiLeaks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NDP will ‘live with’ subsidy fate"&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/Canada/1245381.html NDP will ‘live with’ subsidy fate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper to axe political subsidies"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/996317--harper-to-axe-political-subsidies?bn=1 Harper to axe political subsidies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative government's move was seen by opposition members and other observers as a partisan attempt to bankrupt the other political parties and further increase his own party's financial advantage, and as a direct attack on the democratic process.&lt;ref name="Party subsidy is democracy in action"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservatives cutting wrong political subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Expanding the debate on party financing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Subsides for parties, for and against"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Killing vote subsidy bad for democracy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper, Quebec differ on per-vote subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition outraged by party cuts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. cables dissect Canada’s leaders: WikiLeaks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDP will ‘live with’ subsidy fate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper to axe political subsidies"/&gt;

The move and its packaging as a confidence motion prompted the Liberals and the NDP to take steps toward forming a [[coalition government]] in the event the confidence motion was defeated. Suddenly faced with losing power, Harper sought [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute|the prorogation of Canada's Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Subsides for parties, for and against"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper, Quebec differ on per-vote subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Opposition outraged by party cuts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Defence of subsidies for political parties not a sound-bite issue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper’s plan to scrap per-vote subsidies to political parties would create two-party state, says Nanos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. cables dissect Canada’s leaders: WikiLeaks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDP will ‘live with’ subsidy fate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper to axe political subsidies"/&gt;

Canada's Parliament was shut down from December 4, 2008, to January 26, 2009, allowing the Conservative government to avoid the [[confidence vote]] that it would have lost, and it backtracked on its attempt to eliminate the subsidy.&lt;ref name="U.S. cables dissect Canada’s leaders: WikiLeaks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDP will ‘live with’ subsidy fate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper to axe political subsidies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/parliament-shut-down-till-jan-26/article726676/singlepage/#articlecontent Parliament shut down till Jan. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-feldman/oy-canada-conservative-pm_b_148563.html Conservative PM Uses Rare Act To Suspend Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/961986---parliament-of-shutdowns A Parliament of shutdowns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/world/americas/05canada.html Canadian Leader Shuts Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, however, the Conservative government again brought back its aim to eliminate the per-vote subsidy, over the opposition of all the other major parties, while continuing to favour the generous public subsidy of political contributions.  Prime Minister Harper stated: "There are already generous credits and incentives in the tax system to encourage people to give to political parties today." He vowed that he would make the elimination of the per-vote subsidy a campaign pledge in the next federal election.&lt;ref name="PM targets party subsidies"/&gt;

Green Party Leader [[Elizabeth May]] spoke against the attempt to eliminate the per-vote subsidy, saying that doing so would once again concentrate influence in the hands of those with deeper pockets, instead of giving voters a voice, and she stated her belief that the 2004 campaign finance reforms that introduced the per-vote subsidy are the "one area we've gotten really right" compared with the United States. Liberal deputy leader [[Ralph Goodale]] stated: "Mr. Harper’s position is, essentially, let the big and the wealthy and the most privileged run the show and all the other voices should simply be silenced."&lt;ref name="PM targets party subsidies"/&gt;

In spite of the clear opposition by the other parties, in a campaign pledge in April 2011, Stephen Harper vowed to unilaterally eliminate the per-vote subsidy if he wins a majority.&lt;ref name="The per-vote subsidy: Political welfare or the great leveller?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Defence of subsidies for political parties not a sound-bite issue"/&gt; He stated: "Canadian political parties already have enormous tax advantages, there are credits when you donate to political parties, there are rebates when political parties do spending."&lt;ref name="Killing vote subsidy bad for democracy"/&gt;

Bloc Québécois leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] accused Harper of seeking to cripple all other parties, stating: "Its runs against democracy. Parties trying to break through, like the Greens, would have practically no means. That guy would be happy with no opposition and no Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/plocal/CTVNews/20110401/wrap-first-week-campaign-110401/20110401/?hub=OttawaHome Harper vows to scrap per-vote subsidies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other observers - including Canada's former [[Chief Electoral Officer (Canada)|Chief Electoral Officer]] [[Jean-Pierre Kingsley]]  - have suggested that the [[#Subsidy of political contributions|subsidy of political contributions]] and [[#Electoral expense reimbursement|subsidy of election expenses]] should also be examined, since both - to a far greater extent - have the effect of forcing taxpayers to fund parties they do not personally support.&lt;ref name="Political parties could be forced to return to big money corporate funding if per-vote subsidies scrapped, says Kingsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservatives cutting wrong political subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Expanding the debate on party financing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Defence of subsidies for political parties not a sound-bite issue"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hilltimes.com/dailyupdate/view/63# |title=Comparing the per-vote subsidies to all federal political subsidies |access-date=2011-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318163639/http://hilltimes.com/dailyupdate/view/63# |archive-date=2011-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level of participation in determining funding ===

In 2009, a national total of 181,858 individuals (out of 23,677,639 registered voters in 2008) made political contributions to a federal political party organization, resulting in a 0.77% fraction of registered voters directing over $33 million in [[#Subsidy of political contributions|subsidized contributions]] - almost two-thirds of it publicly funded - toward their preferred parties. Over 55% of these individuals were Conservative party supporters.&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

A national total of 96,762 individuals also made political contributions at the riding association level to a federal political party, resulting in a 0.4% fraction of registered voters directing over $12 million in subsidized contributions - over 60% of it from public funds - toward their preferred parties.&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

Combined, the number of unique individuals that made political contributions in 2009 to a federal political party, either at the national party organization level or riding level, or both, is somewhere between 196,186 and 278,620 individuals - representing between just 0.8% and 1.2% of the number of registered voters from 2008.&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

Rounding to the nearest percentage, only 1% of registered voters directed $46 million - representing over 62% of the primary funding received by parties - toward their preferred party, with nearly two-thirds of that - $28.5-$31 million - in public funds directed without the consent of 99% of registered voters.&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

=== Composition of participation ===

With the per-vote subsidy, 100% of voters of eligible parties (99% of all valid votes in 2009) participate in determining the distribution of the funds, and do so all on an equal basis. The participants are all the Canadian citizens over the age of 18 that voted in the preceding federal election, and numbered 13,675,146 Canadians in 2009.

With political contributions, the participants - numbering only a nationwide total of between 196,186 and 278,620 unique individuals in 2009, and representing less than 1.2% of the number of registered voters - tend to be individuals that have more disposable income. The poor, by and large, do not make political contributions, and, according to [[University of Calgary]] political finance expert Lisa Young, people that have more comfortable means, and that can expect to obtain a larger tax credit against their income, are more likely to make political contributions.&lt;ref name="Harper plan would undermine democracy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Subsides for parties, for and against"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The per-vote subsidy: Political welfare or the great leveller?"/&gt;

According to [[McMaster University]] political scientist Henry Jacek, political contributions tend to come from the wealthy, and not the poor. It is also clear from other jurisdictions in the world that political donors typically are people that have more disposable income.&lt;ref name="Subsides for parties, for and against"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The per-vote subsidy: Political welfare or the great leveller?"/&gt;

While political contributions can only be made by Canadian citizens, there is no age restriction in place, which allows political contributions to be made in the name of children to bypass contribution limits.

In 2006, Liberal leadership candidate Joe Volpe returned $27,000 in political contributions that had been made in the name of children - after it was revealed that his campaign donors included 11-year-old twin boys and a 14-year-old boy who donated $5,400 each, the allowed maximum. The children and several other donors that had contributed the maximum allowable $5,400 each - for a total of $108,000 - were all in some way connected to the top corporate executives of one pharmaceutical company. No law was broken.&lt;ref name="Political parties could be forced to return to big money corporate funding if per-vote subsidies scrapped, says Kingsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Political contributions: money, money, money"/&gt;

=== Magnification of the choices of contributors ===

While only a tiny fraction of registered voters make political contributions, their net contributions get magnified several times over by the public subsidy of political contributions and the public subsidy of election expenses.&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

Over half of all the public funding for federal parties in 2009 was effectively directed by less than 1.2% of the number of registered voters in Canada, without participation by 99% of registered voters.&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

Overall, the subsidy of political contributions resulted in 64.2% of all of the funding in 2009 being directed according to the partisan preferences of less than 1.2% of registered voters.&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

|alt=Political contributions to Canadian federal parties in 2009}}

=== Consequences of eliminating the per-vote subsidy ===

Elimination of the per-vote subsidy, with all other things remaining equal, would mean that a very small number of individuals - somewhere between 0.8% and 1.2% of registered voters in 2009 - would control and direct 100% of all the funding to their preferred political parties and candidates.&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;

By the same token, approximately 98-99% of all registered voters would no longer have any participation in how any of the funding is directed - including having no say at all in how any of the taxpayer money involved gets allocated.&lt;ref name="Elections Canada - Political Financing Reports and Database"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Killing vote subsidy bad for democracy"/&gt;

In April 2011, Canada's former [[Chief Electoral Officer (Canada)|Chief Electoral Officer]] [[Jean-Pierre Kingsley]], who served in the position for 17 years, stated that if the per-vote subsidy were to be eliminated, there would be an increased risk of Canada's political parties turning back toward corporations to obtain money, also to the detriment of Canadian democracy.&lt;ref name="Political parties could be forced to return to big money corporate funding if per-vote subsidies scrapped, says Kingsley"/&gt;

{| style="width:75%; border:1px solid #cccccc; margin:1em auto 1em auto; background-color:#f5f5f5" |- {{quote | 
"Parties will have to find ways of getting money. And there may well be pressure to come back to funding from corporate sources—the very things we've attempted to eliminate and have successfully eliminated. Which would bring us back to a regime where donations not by individuals but through other interests, political parties would be beholden to, other than normal Canadians."
|former Chief Electoral Officer [[Jean-Pierre Kingsley]], April 6, 2011&lt;ref name="Political parties could be forced to return to big money corporate funding if per-vote subsidies scrapped, says Kingsley"/&gt;}}
|}

The elimination of the per-vote subsidy could also have the effect of further reducing an already low [[voter turnout]] by removing an incentive that encourages many Canadian citizens to vote. Under the [[first-past-the-post system]], the per-vote subsidy ensures that a voter's participation at the ballot box will at least still make a difference even if their preferred riding candidate has very little chance of winning or is assured of a win.&lt;ref name="Don't Scrap the Voter Subsidy"/&gt;

=== Announced elimination of the per-vote subsidy ===

On May 25, 2011, just three weeks after the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|election]] that gave them majority power, the Conservatives announced that their June 6 federal budget would include the elimination of the per-vote subsidy.&lt;ref name="NDP will ‘live with’ subsidy fate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper to axe political subsidies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="June 6 budget will phase out per-vote subsidy"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/05/25/pol-flaherty-budget.html June 6 budget will phase out per-vote subsidy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/flaherty-to-hand-down-recycled-budget-49020 Opposition to contest recycled budget]&lt;/ref&gt;

NDP leader Jack Layton voiced his opposition to the plan, saying that "it's wrong", and "opens the door for big money to come back into politics," and he worried about the impact this will have on  democracy in Canada.&lt;ref name="NDP will ‘live with’ subsidy fate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="June 6 budget will phase out per-vote subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plan to phase out per-vote subsidies seen as ploy to kill Liberals"&gt;[http://www.kamloopsnews.ca/article/20110525/KAMLOOPS0101/110529907/-1/kamloops01/plan-to-phase-out-per-vote-subsidies-seen-as-ploy-to-kill-liberals Plan to phase out per-vote subsidies seen as ploy to kill Liberals]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative government's move was seen by many as motivated by a desire to destroy the Liberal party and cripple all other parties, not by concern over taxpayer dollars. According to [[University of Ottawa]] professor Errol Mendes: "You can see what's happening here, they're moving toward a process of eventually cutting the feet out from all the major opposition parties."&lt;ref name="Harper ‘trying to annihilate the opposition’ by killing per-vote subsidies"&gt;[http://www.hilltimes.com/dailyupdate/view/harper_trying_to_annihilate_the_opposition_by_killing_pervote_subsidies_says_grit_mp_easter_05-25-2011 Harper ‘trying to annihilate the opposition’ by killing per-vote subsidies, says Grit MP Easter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plan to phase out per-vote subsidies seen as ploy to kill Liberals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tory budget to chop per-vote subsidy"&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/Canada/1245225.html Tory budget to chop per-vote subsidy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement defends elimination of $2-per-vote"&gt;[http://www.cottagecountrynow.ca/news/article/1018011--clement-defends-elimination-of-2-per-vote Clement defends elimination of $2-per-vote]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parties face first cut to per-vote taxpayer subsidy"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/budget/news/parties-face-first-cut-to-per-vote-taxpayer-subsidy/article2046672/ Parties face first cut to per-vote taxpayer subsidy ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interim Liberal leader Bob Rae stated: "I can’t think of anything more wrong than a spirit of vindictiveness at the heart of a majority government." He said the Liberals would oppose the plan, and stated: "The notion that there’s public support for the political process and political parties is widely accepted in a great many democratic countries around the world."&lt;ref name="Harper ‘trying to annihilate the opposition’ by killing per-vote subsidies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plan to phase out per-vote subsidies seen as ploy to kill Liberals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tory budget to chop per-vote subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement defends elimination of $2-per-vote"/&gt;

"It is a mean-spirited attempt by the Harper government to limit the resources of other parties and to create a situation where the wealthiest will have the most influence. The simple and very inexpensive per-vote subsidy is a very fair way to ensure that parties would be funded based on their popular support, allowing them the resources to represent those that support their respective views."
|Glen Hodgson, Green Party, May 2011&lt;ref name="Harper ‘trying to annihilate the opposition’ by killing per-vote subsidies"/&gt;}}
|}

According to political scientist Ned Franks of [[Queen's University]], the elimination of the per-vote subsidy will mean that political parties with a rich support base will now be far better off than parties whose supporters are poorer or who are not the type to make political donations. He stated that the move greatly favours the Conservative party: "There's only one party who benefits, and — surprise, surprise — it's the Conservatives."

Layton stated the move was anti-democratic since it would benefit parties with access to rich people, and handicap parties with a lower-income voting base. "I think that our democracy is better served if ideas have equal opportunity in the competition for Canadians' consideration, and that's what public financing is designed to do. Take away public financing and what you're basically saying is those with the best ability to raise money get to have their ideas heard, and I don't think that's helpful for a democratic society."&lt;ref name="June 6 budget will phase out per-vote subsidy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://winnipeg.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110525/budget-date-flaherty-announcement-110525/20110525/?hub=WinnipegHome Budget due June 6 will phase out political subsidies]&lt;/ref&gt;

People who can’t afford to contribute to political parties would be cut out of this whole process. The people who are placing their vote are supporting a party and that’s what the per-vote subsidy is related to, how you vote. What better democratic way to finance parties, or to help finance parties, than that?"

(See also the Form-based section of the [[Zoning in the United States#Form-based|Zoning in the United States]] article.)

A '''Form-Based Code''' (FBC) is a means of regulating land development to achieve a specific urban form. Form-Based Codes foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing principle, with a lesser focus on [[land use]], through municipal regulations. A FBC is a regulation, not a mere guideline, adopted into city, town, or county law and offers a powerful alternative to conventional zoning regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Form-Based Codes Defined|url=http://formbasedcodes.org/definition|website=Form Based Codes Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Form-Based Codes are a new response to the modern challenges of [[urban sprawl]], deterioration of historic neighborhoods, and neglect of pedestrian safety in new development. Tradition has declined as a guide to development patterns, and the widespread adoption by cities of single-use [[zoning]] regulations has discouraged compact, walkable urbanism. Form-Based Codes are a tool to address these deficiencies, and to provide local governments the regulatory means to achieve development objectives with greater certainty.

==Scope==
Form-Based Codes address the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks. The regulations and standards in Form-Based Codes, presented in both diagrams and words, are keyed to a regulating plan that designates the appropriate form and scale (and therefore, character) of development rather than only distinctions in land-use types. This is in contrast to conventional [[zoning]]'s focus on the micromanagement and segregation of land uses, and the control of development intensity through abstract and uncoordinated parameters (e.g., [[floor area ratio]]s, dwelling units per acre, [[Setback (land use)|setback]]s, parking ratios) to the neglect of an integrated built form. Not to be confused with design guidelines or general statements of policy, form-based codes are regulatory, not advisory.

Form-Based Codes are drafted to achieve a community vision based on time-tested forms of urbanism. Ultimately, a Form-Based Code is a tool;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective Implementation Tools for Walkable Urban Places|url=http://opticosdesign.com/projects/form-based-code-tools-walkable-urban-places/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the quality of development outcomes is dependent on the quality and objectives of the community plan that a code implements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1: What Is a Form-Based Code?|url=http://plannersweb.com/2014/12/fbc1/|website=Planners Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Form-Based Codes are part of a long history of shaping the built landscape. Such efforts go back to the urban designs of [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], the planning of cities in ancient China, and Roman town planning. The [[Laws of the Indies]], promulgated by the Spanish Crown starting in the 16th century, established some basic urban form requirements for colonial towns in the Americas. [[William Penn]] when planning [[Philadelphia]] in the 17th century did not shy from precise urban form requirements when he said, "Let every house be in a line, or upon a line, as much as may be." {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

During the 18th century, Baroque [[urban design]] commonly brought buildings to the fronts of their lots with common facade treatments. [[Baron Haussmann]], appointed by [[Napoleon III]] to oversee the redevelopment of Paris in the 19th century, stipulated precise ratios of building heights to street widths; disposition and sizes of windows and doors on building facades; consistent planting of street trees; and standardization of material colors to bring unity and harmony to the public environment.

===Emergence===
Regulating urban form is a challenge in modern democracies. Design guidelines adopted by municipalities, without legal enforceability, often invite capricious observance, thus failing to produce the comprehensive changes required to produce satisfying public places. When public planning exercises fail to produce predictable results, citizens often rebel against any development. In addition, from early in the twentieth century to the present, attempts at regulating the built landscape have usually been done for reasons that neglect community form, that are more concerned with the uses of property and impacts of scale than the form that development takes.  And a planning profession that in recent decades has focused on policy, neglecting design, encouraged an abstract intellectual response to problems that are largely physical in nature. {{Citation needed|reason=Text includes conclusions without foundation.|date=December 2016}}

The development of modern Form-Based Codes was started by architects, urban designers, and physical planners frustrated by the ineffectiveness of past criticisms of sprawl development and the failure of critics to propose realistic alternatives. These professionals, used to thinking physically about community problems, began the search for systematic physical solutions in the 1970s. Architect [[Christopher Alexander]] published ''A Pattern Language'' in 1977, a compendium of physical rules for designing humane buildings and places. [[Ian McHarg]] developed systematic mapping tools to encourage deliberate development patterns sensitive to local environmental conditions. Traditional Neighborhood Development ordinances were drafted beginning in the early 1990s as sets of development regulations to promote traditional neighborhood forms in new development projects. TND ordinances were typically adopted as an optional regulatory procedure that developers could request in place of conventional zoning . But their design regulations were not mapped to parcels or streets in advance, so lacked predictability of outcomes; TND ordinances proved to be an instructive effort, but showed few results.

Meanwhile, the accelerating scale of worldwide urban growth and the rapid expansion of the extent of cities heightened the need for regulatory tools better equipped to deal with such growth. The first serious attempt at creating a modern form-based code was done in 1982 to guide the development of the Florida resort town of [[Seaside, Florida|Seaside]] by the husband and wife design team of [[Andres Duany]] and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]]. Realizing that designing an entire town would be an overwhelming task and would in the end lack the visual serendipity that only comes from myriad creative minds at work, they created a design code that established basic physical standards mapped to parcels, and then invited developers and architects to put their own distinctive stamp on their projects—but operating within those standards. The Seaside Code proved very successful; the resulting development of the town of Seaside is widely recognized as one of the most important and appealing planning efforts of the post-World War II era.

Duany/Plater-Zyberk's codes and the work of subsequent form-based code practitioners are not top-down mandates from imperial designers as in the baroque era or the wishful thinking of design guidelines that lack enforceability, but are instead legal regulations adopted by units of local government. As regulations they possess [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]; violators of the regulations can be cited, and their invocation or retraction must go through a legislative process. As such, the community plays a more forceful role in shaping its physical future.

[[Image:FBC-effect-animation.gif|frame|right|Form-based codes produce more consistent and predictable patterns of development in relationship to the public realm than typically achieved through conventional zoning regulations.]]

=== Recent developments ===
Although the Seaside code was commissioned by a private developer, most current codes are commissioned by counties and municipalities. Since Seaside, the scale of Form-Based Coding projects has grown. Form-Based Coding can be applied at many scales, from a two-block main street to a county-wide region. An early Form-Based Code was adopted for downtown West Palm Beach in 1995. A significant code for a major urban arterial, the Columbia Pike in Arlington County, Virginia, was adopted in 2003 (Ferrell Madden Associates). A regional FBC was adopted in 2006 by St. Lucie County, Florida (Spikowski Associates, Dover-Kohl Partners). Duany/Plater-Zyberk has drafted a model FBC that is also a [[transect (urban)|transect]]-based code that can be calibrated for local needs—the [[SMARTCODE]]. Its first attempted customization was done for Vicksburg, Mississippi in 2001 (Mouzon &amp; Greene). The lessons learned there led to the first California adoption of a citywide Form-Based Code for the City of Sonoma in March 2003 (Crawford Multari &amp; Clark Associates, Moule &amp; Polyzoides), followed on June 16, 2003, by the first SmartCode adopted in the U.S., for central Petaluma, California (Fisher and Hall Urban Design, Crawford Multari &amp; Clark Associates). SmartCodes are now being calibrated for Miami, Florida and Hurricane Katrina ravaged communities in Mississippi and Louisiana, along with cities as diverse as Taos, NM, Michigan City, IN, Jamestown, RI, Lawrence, KS, New Castle, DE, and Bran, Romania. Planetary climate change that must be mitigated by changes in the human environment will no doubt be an inducement to form-based and transect-based coding in the future.

The Cincinnati Form-Based Code adopted in 2013 is designed to be applied citywide in an incremental way, neighborhood by neighborhood. The code establishes transect zones and specifies standards for transects, building types, frontage types, walkable neighborhoods, and thoroughfares that can be adapted to each neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cincinnati Form-Based Code|url=http://formbasedcodes.org/codes/cincinnati-form-based-code|website=Form-Based Codes Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yung|first1=John|title=Here's how Cincinnati's form-based codes are designed to spur redevelopment|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/01/21/heres-how-cincinnatis-form-based.html?page=all|website=Cincinnati Business Courier|accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaufort County, South Carolina adopted one of the first multijurisdictional Form-Based Codes at the end of 2014:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starkey|first1=Jackie|title=Beaufort looks to develop different planning method|url=http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_ffd55024-9e95-11e4-916f-83892b1f4c00.html|website=Carteret County News-Times|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beaufort County Eliminates PUDs in Favor of Walkable Neighborhoods!|url=http://opticosdesign.com/beaufort-county-council-votes-9-1-adopt-new-development-code/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the County, the City of Beaufort and the City of Port Royal came together to hire Opticos Design, Inc. in Berkeley, California to draft the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steuteville|first1=Rob|title=Beaufort County, SC, commissions form-based code|url=http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/13617/beaufort-county-sc-commissions-form-based-code|website=Better Cities &amp; Towns|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the growing number of consultants advertising themselves as capable of writing FBCs but with little or no training, in 2004 the non-profit [http://formbasedcodes.org/ Form-Based Codes Institute] was organized to establish standards and teach best practices. In addition, SmartCode workshops are regularly scheduled by PlaceMakers.com, SmartCodePro.com, and SmartCodeLocal.com. In Spring 2014, a new graduate-level studio dedicated to Form-Based Coding was launched at California State Polytechnic University. “Form-Based Codes in the Context of Integrated Urbanism,” is one of the only full courses on the subject in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opticos Goes to School on Form-Based Codes|url=http://opticosdesign.com/opticos-goes-school-form-based-codes/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course is taught by Tony Perez,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Perez, Director of Form-Based Coding|url=http://opticosdesign.com/people/tony-perez/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of Form-Based Coding at Opticos Design; it is expected to be repeated for Spring 2015.

==Components==
Form-Based Codes commonly include the following elements:

* ''Regulating Plan.''  A plan or map of the regulated area designating the locations where different building form standards apply, based on clear community intentions regarding the physical character of the area being coded.
* ''Public Space Standards.'' Specifications for the elements within the public realm (e.g., sidewalks, travel lanes, on-street parking, street trees, street furniture, etc.).
* ''Building Form Standards''. Regulations controlling the configuration, features, and functions of buildings that define and shape the public realm.
* ''Administration.'' A clearly defined application and project review process.
* ''Definitions.'' A glossary to ensure the precise use of technical terms.

[[Image:FBC TypicalComponents.jpg|frame|center|At a minimum, a Form-Based Code, written to enable or preserve a specific urban form, consists of building form and public space standards keyed to a regulating plan. An urban design is the intention or goal, the form-based code is the regulatory tool to achieve it.]]&lt;br /&gt;
Form-based codes also sometimes include:
* ''Architectural Standards.'' Regulations controlling external architectural materials and quality.
* ''Landscaping Standards.'' Regulations controlling landscape design and plant materials on private property as they impact public spaces (e.g. regulations about parking lot screening and shading, maintaining sight lines, insuring unobstructed pedestrian movements, etc.).
* ''Signage Standards.'' Regulations controlling allowable signage sizes, materials, illumination, and placement.
* ''Environmental Resource Standards.'' Regulations controlling issues such as storm water drainage and infiltration, development on slopes, tree protection, solar access, etc.
* ''Annotation.'' Text and illustrations explaining the intentions of specific code provisions.

=== Building Form Standards ===
[[Image:FBC BldgFormStandards2.gif|frame|right|Building attributes that can be regulated in a Building Form Standard, in this case for a hypothetical street in a neighborhood center]]
The types of buildings that make for a lively main street are different from the types of buildings that make for a quiet residential street. Building Form Standards are sets of enforceable design regulations for controlling building types and how they impact the public realm. These Standards are mapped to streets on a Regulating Plan. Building Form Standards can control such things as: the alignment of buildings to the street; how close buildings are to sidewalks; the visibility and accessibility of building entrances; minimum and maximum buildings heights; minimum or maximum lot frontage coverage; minimum and maximum amounts of window coverage on facades; physical elements required on buildings (e.g. stoops, porches, types of permitted balconies); and the general usage of floors (e.g. office, residential, or retail). These regulations are less concerned with architectural styles and designs than in how buildings shape public spaces. If a local government also wishes to regulate the quality of architecture—for example to preserve the historic appearance of a neighborhood—then Architectural Standards should be drafted in addition to Building Form Standards.

=== Public Space Standards ===
[[Image:DPZ SmartCode9 OptionModule ThoroughfareAssemlies Page 21.png|right|thumb|An example of a Public Space Standard for public streets from the SmartCode 9.0]]
Public Space Standards control the physical form of squares, parks, the public right-of-way of streets, and other public spaces. Public spaces are typically under the control of public works, parks, and highway departments. Streets, being the most common public spaces in a community, are the most frequently regulated. Public Space Standards for streets are typically described with dimensioned cross-sections and/or plan views showing travel lane widths, sidewalk widths, street tree and street lamp placement, locations of transit lanes, and the placement of architecture. Plan view diagrams may also be included showing spacing of street trees and lamps, and the radii of the curves of street corners.

==Identification==
How does one determine if a development regulation is a form-based code and a well-crafted one? Form-based codes generally receive affirmative answers to all of the following questions:

* Is the code's focus primarily on regulating urban form and less on land use?
* Is the code regulatory rather than advisory?
* Does the code emphasize standards and parameters for form with predictable physical outcomes (build-to lines, frontage type requirements, etc.) rather than relying on numerical parameters (floor-area ratios, density, etc.) whose outcomes are impossible to predict?
* Does the code require private buildings to shape public space through the use of building form standards with specific requirements for building placement?
* Does the code promote and/or conserve an interconnected street network and pedestrian-scaled blocks?
* Are regulations and standards keyed to specific locations on a regulating plan?
* Are the diagrams in the code unambiguous, clearly labeled, and accurate in their presentation of spatial configurations? &lt;ref&gt;[http://formbasedcodes.org/take-quiz FBCI quiz]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
How are form-based codes incorporated into a local government's development regulations? There are three basic ways:

'''Mandatory codes.''' This is the most common adoption approach. It has the most regulatory  "teeth"—compliance is required. But it is the most ambitious of the approaches, making the new code a seamless part of, or a complete replacement for, the existing zoning ordinance. The form-based code can be adopted as a new zoning district or as an overlay district.

Unique to California and a few other states with appropriate enabling legislation, form-based codes can be contained within a planning document called a "specific plan," which can completely override the zoning ordinance for a given geographic area. Since it stands apart from the zoning ordinance, it can be more creative in its format, giving the coder greater freedom in designing for user-friendliness through page layout, diagrams, and illustrations. Also, the urban design plan and the implementing regulations are bundled together, greatly improving user comprehension. But since the specific plan is not securely integrated within the existing zoning ordinance, it may be more politically vulnerable to retraction.

Example adopted codes:
*''Winter Springs Town Center District Code'', [[Winter Springs, Florida]]
*''Farmers Branch Station Area Form-Based Code'', [[Farmers Branch, Texas]]
*''Central Petaluma Specific Plan and SmartCode'', [[Petaluma, California]]

'''Optional (parallel) codes.''' An optional or parallel form-based code serves as an alternative to, but doesn't replace, a present zoning ordinance. Compliance is voluntary. The developer has the choice of complying with the form-based code or the zoning ordinance, but it must be one or the other. This approach makes sense when compliance with the zoning ordinance is so difficult and time consuming that most development is stymied. Thus a developer has the option of following a form-based code that will streamline and simplify his development process. But, for a local government to maintain two different sets of development regulations for one area is added work which can be significant if the area is extensive. Also depending on the area being regulated, if some developers are choosing the form-based code and others nearby are not, the possibilities for integrated place-making can be compromised.

Example codes:
*''Columbia Pike Form-Based Code'', [[Arlington County, Virginia]]
*''Pike Road SmartCode'', [[Pike Road, Alabama]]
*''Pass Christian SmartCode'', [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]]

'''Floating-zone codes.''' Floating zones are most often written to facilitate master-planned suburban communities and are called PUDs (planned unit developments). However, floating-zone codes are now being written as form-based codes to facilitate urban development. A floating-zone form-based code does not contain a regulating plan but includes instructions and standards for developers to follow when they prepare a regulating plan for their property (e.g. maximum block dimensions, street types, building types, open space accessibility, sidewalk widths.) This distinguishes floating-zone codes from the other two approaches–developers rather than the local government create the regulating plans and the urban designs that they facilitate, but the local government sets the standards. Floating-zone codes allow local governments to establish urban form standards for development without incurring the expense of developing urban design and regulating plans. Developers are given the freedom, within clear parameters, to prepare regulating plans for their property that are likely to meet government approval. A developer submits his or her regulating plan for approval through the rezoning process. Upon rezoning, the floating zone replaces the prior zoning for that property and the regulating plan becomes binding.

Example codes:
*''Miami-Dade County TND District'', [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]
*''Towns, Villages, Countryside Land Development Regulations'', [[Saint Lucie County, Florida]]
*''Flowood SmartCode'', [[Flowood, Mississippi]]
*''Montgomery SmartCode'', [[Montgomery, Alabama]] (not to be confused with the mandatory SmartCode for downtown)

Initially a local government may wish to adopt a form-based code for its entire jurisdiction following one approach, but find this too ambitious with short-term resource and political limitations requiring a more focused effort. Instead it may wish to follow one approach for a smaller area, and then phase in other areas using the same or different approaches as needed. Or a floating-zone code could be adopted for large areas awaiting the public resources coming later that would allow the local government to draft its own regulating plans. Whatever approach is followed—or combination of approaches—simplicity and consistency helps at the permit desk where the code is implemented.

The '''Global Change Research Act''' 1990 is a [[United States]] law requiring research into [[global warming]] and related issues. It requires a report to Congress every four years on the environmental, economic, health and safety consequences of climate change.

According to a summary by the Congressional Research Service, the Act:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C56A.txt |deadurl=yes |series=Public Law 101-606(11/16/90) 104 Stat. 3096-3104 |title=Global Change Research Act of 1990 |year=1990 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218110850/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C56A.txt |archivedate=February 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|series=Bill Summary &amp; Status 101st Congress (1989 - 1990) S.169 |title=Global Change Research Act of 1990|editors=Sponsors: Sponsor: Sen Hollings, Ernest F.|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Directs the President, through the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering, and Technology (Council), to establish the Committee on Earth and Environmental Sciences to carry out Council functions under specified provisions of the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 relating to global change research, to increase the effectiveness and productivity of Federal global change research efforts.

:Directs the President to establish an interagency [[U.S. Global Change Research Program|United States Global Change Research Program]] to improve understanding of global change. Requires the Chairman of the Council, through the Committee, to develop a National Global Change Research Plan for implementation of the Program. Sets forth required Plan contents and research elements, including that the Plan provide recommendations for collaboration within the Federal Government and among nations.

:Requires the Chairman to enter into an agreement with the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] to: (1) evaluate the scientific content of the Plan; and (2) provide information and advice and recommended priorities for future global change research. Requires the Committee to provide general guidance each year to each Federal agency or department participating in the Program with respect to preparation of requests for appropriations related to the Program.

:Requires the Council, at least every four years, through the Committee, to submit to the President and the Congress an assessment regarding the findings of the Program and associated uncertainties, the effects of global change, and current and major long-term trends in global change.

:Requires that the research findings of the Committee and of Federal agencies and departments be made available to the Environmental Protection Agency and all Federal agencies and departments.

:Title II: International Cooperation in Global Change Research - International Cooperation in Global Change Research Act of 1990 - Declares that the President should direct the Secretary of State to initiate discussions with other nations on: (1) international agreements to coordinate global change research; and (2) an international research protocol for cooperation on the development of energy technologies which have minimally adverse effects on the environment. Directs the President to establish an Office of Global Change Research Information to disseminate to foreign governments and their citizens, businesses, and institutions scientific research useful in preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the effects of global change.

:Title III: Growth Decision Aid - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) conduct a study on the implications of growth and development on urban, suburban, and rural communities; and (2) based on the study, produce a decision aid to assist State and local authorities in planning and managing growth and development while preserving community character."

Following the publication of the first National Climate Assessment Report there were accusations that information was being suppressed, leading to complacency around [[public works]], such as [[Orleans Levee Board|New Orleans flood defences]]. [[Greenpeace]], the [[Center for Biological Diversity]] and [[Friends of the Earth]] challenged the delay in [[United States district court|federal district court]] on August 21, 2007. A judge ruled that an updated national assessment must be produced by May 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/swcbd/PROGRAMS/policy/energy/ccsp-order-08-21-2007.pdf |title=Center for Biological Diversity vs. Dr. William Brennan - No. C 06-7062 SBA |date=August 21, 2007 |publisher=Biological Diversity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Green Party of England and Wales}}
The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] has its roots in the [[PEOPLE Party]] started in Coventry in 1972/3 by four professional friends (Michael Benfield, Freda Sanders, Tony and Lesley Whittaker). It then changed its name to the more descriptive '''Ecology Party''' in 1975, and to the '''Green Party''' ten years later.   In the 1990s, the Scottish and Northern Ireland wings of the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]] in the United Kingdom decided to separate amicably from the party in England and Wales, to form the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the [[Green Party in Northern Ireland]]. The [[Wales Green Party]] became an autonomous regional party and remained within the new Green Party of England and Wales.

==1990 to 1997==
In 1991 Green Party spokesman and TV sports presenter [[David Icke]] created considerable embarrassment for the Party when he revealed his extreme political and spiritual beliefs.&lt;ref name=Ronson4&gt;Ronson, Jon. [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2912878405399014351&amp;q=DAVID+ICKE%3A+The+Lizards+and+the+Jews "David Icke, the Lizards, and the Jews"] (video), Channel 4 Television, retrieved 22 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently forced to leave the party.&lt;ref name=GPHistory&gt;Wall, Derek, ''Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the Green Party'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal divisions over the direction of the party in the early 1990s meant that the Green Party fell out of the limelight and failed to maintain its electoral momentum. In 1991, attempts to streamline the Party Constitution were proposed by a group called ''[[Green 2000]]'', who wanted to "modernise" the Party and make it into an organised electoral force that could become the ruling party in the UK by the year 2000. After the Green 2000 Constitution was adopted, a new Executive came into force to oversee the day-to-day business of the party. Many Green 2000 members were elected to the new Executive in 1991 but, by 1992, only two remained, with the others resigning or being recalled and forced to quit. These internal constitutional wranglings, and negative public statements released by supporters of both Green 2000 and decentralists who ran the recall campaigns, seriously hampered preparations for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 General Election]], in which 253 Green candidates received 1.3% of the vote.&lt;ref name=GPHistory/&gt; [[Sara Parkin]] and [[Jonathon Porritt]] left active involvement with the party.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The early and mid-1990s were difficult for the Greens, because of Britain's [[Plurality electoral system|first-past-the-post electoral system]], the recession of 1992–93 and the squeeze caused by the rising popularity of [[New Labour]]. Nevertheless, the party gained a handful of local councillors in [[Stroud]] and [[Oxford]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 General Election]], [[Cynog Dafis]] was elected on a [[Plaid Cymru]]–[[Wales Green Party]] ticket, gaining [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]] from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The Green Party argued that this made him the first Green representative in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. The electoral agreement that enabled this broke down by 1995.

==1997 to 2009==

The election of a Labour government in 1997 created opportunities and focus for the Green Party. New democratic institutions were created that offered electoral possibilities for the Greens, such as the [[London Assembly]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]] and – for the independent [[Scottish Green Party]] – the [[Scottish Parliament]], all of which use some form of [[proportional representation]], allowing smaller parties the chance of gaining representation. Labour also changed European Parliamentary elections to a form of proportional representation.

Combined with gradual council gains, the party quietly gained successes.

In the 1999 European elections, two Greens were elected [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs): [[Caroline Lucas]] ([[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]])&lt;ref name=Caroline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carolinelucasmep.org.uk |title=Dr. Caroline Lucas MEP's Website |publisher=Carolinelucasmep.org.uk |date= |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Lambert]] ([[London (European Parliament constituency)|London]]).&lt;ref name=Jean&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeanlambertmep.org.uk |title=Jean Lambert MEP's Website |publisher=Jeanlambertmep.org.uk |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They retained their seats in the [[European Parliament Election, 2004 (UK)|2004 European elections]], despite a reduction in number of seats available. Overall, the Party gained 1,033,093 votes in the 2004 European election.&lt;ref name=GPEWSite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk |title=Green Party Website |publisher=Greenparty.org.uk |date= |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the Greens did not manage to break through into other European electoral regions or the Welsh Assembly.
Three Greens were elected to the first [[London Assembly]].

The Green Party achieved its best ever UK General Election result to date in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] with a total of 281,780 votes, with [[Keith Taylor (British politician)|Keith Taylor]] receiving 22% of the vote in [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]].

The Party had 116 [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local councillors]] after a gain of 5 councillors during the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2008|2008 local elections]]. The Greens achieved significant representation on [[Brighton and Hove|Brighton &amp; Hove City Council]], [[City of Lancaster|Lancaster City Council]], [[Norwich]], [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]], [[Oxford City Council]], [[Oxfordshire County Council]], [[Kirklees|Kirklees Council]] and [[Stroud District Council]]. The Green Party were the official opposition on Norwich City Council; they formed part of the ruling coalition that controlled [[City of Lancaster|Lancaster City Council]] alongside the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], and shared control of [[Castle Morpeth]] Council as part of an all party administration.

In this period, the Green Party of England and Wales had representation in the [[House of Lords]], the (unelected) upper chamber of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]: in the person of  [[Timothy Beaumont, Baron Beaumont of Whitley|Lord Beaumont of Whitley]],&lt;ref name=GPEWSite/&gt; who died in 2008.

According to MORI in 2010, Green issues were rated as importantly as during the Green Party's previous high point in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=MORI&gt;[https://archive.is/20070205122448/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/polls/trends/issues.shtml MORI Polling Trends data] &lt;/ref&gt;

The party held its first ever leadership election in September 2008: [[Caroline Lucas]] was elected to the position of Leader, and [[Adrian Ramsay]] to the position of Deputy Leader.

==Since 2010==
The Green Party fielded more than 300 candidates for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].&lt;ref name="BBC-Hopeful"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8666445.stm|title=Election 2010: Green Party are 'hopeful for win' |date=7 May 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline Lucas became the first Green candidate to gain a seat in Westminster, after being elected MP for [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]] by a margin of 1,252 votes.&lt;ref name="BBC-election2010-brightonpavillion"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a69.stm|title=Election 2010 – Constituency – Brighton Pavilion|date=7 May 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week 600 new members had joined the Green Party bringing total membership to over 11,000. In previous years 600 new members was high for a whole year.

On 24 May 2012, the six Green Party councillors elected to Stroud District Council formed a power sharing administration  (a "constructive cooperation") with both the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RECONVENED COUNCIL ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING|url=http://www.stroud.gov.uk/info/members/cms_documentation/Cl_minsAGM_24May12.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, [[Molly Scott Cato]] became the party's third [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]].

The term was originally proposed by the researcher in [[gender studies]] [[Jasbir Puar|Jasbir K.

[[Bruno Perreau]] has criticized the premises of Puar's argument. While agreeing with her critique of nationalist claims among some LGBT groups, he shows that Puar idealizes those she calls the "sexually nonnormative racialized subject".&lt;ref name="homonationalism"/&gt; Perreau explains that "deconstruction of norms cannot be dissociated from their reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Perreau]], [http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=27481 ''Queer Theory: The French Response''], Stanford University Press, 2016, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Ritchie has also critiqued some of the ways homonationalism has been used, especially as a totalizing theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Jason|date=|title=Pinkwashing, Homonationalism, and Israel–Palestine: The Conceits of Queer Theory and the Politics of the Ordinary|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anti.12100/abstract|journal=Antipode|volume=47|pages=616–634|via=|doi=10.1111/anti.12100|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precedents in Queer Theory ==
In the essay ''Thinking Sex'' by Gayle S. Rubin, the author lays the work to understand homosexuality as possessing the same features and characteristics as those of an ethnic group. This claim laid the groundworks to the construction of what today is understood as queer nationalism. One of the main presmises of the essay is that homosexuals in Western societies share a common history, a culture, and a territory that they’ve had to defend against the hostilities and persecution of the heterosexual majority. She claims that: “… a modern gay man, who may migrate from rural Colorado to San Francisco in order to live in a gay neighborhood, work in a gay business, and participate in an elaborate experience that includes a self-conscious identity, group solidarity, a literature, a press, and a high level of political activity. In modern, Western, industrial societies, homosexuality has acquired much of the institutional structure of an ethnic group.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abelove|first=Henry|date=2012-10-02|title=The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203820575|doi=10.4324/9780203820575}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displacement and diaspora according to Rubin are the main ways in which a gay ethnicity can be identified in modern urban industrialized settings.

Rubin identifies as sexual migrants all those individuals who had the need to move across the country in order to flee persecution from police, education institutions, or even family, “In San Francisco, police and media waged war on homosexuals throughout the 1950s. Police raided bars, patrolled cruising areas, conducted street sweeps, and trumpeted their intention of driving the queers out of San Francisco. Crackdowns against ay individuals, bars, and socials areas occurred throughout the country.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and then provides an analysis that would help understand how homosexuals could be seen upon the light of a stateless, diasporic people. “By the late 1970s, sexual migration was occurring on a scale so significant that it began to have a recognizable impact on urban politics in the United States, with San Francisco being the most notable and notorious example.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Rubin explains that homosexuals have therefore needed to stand against the hostilities directed from the hegemonic majoritarian group of heterosexuals in Western societies, who she claims have been intolerant of sexual deviance due to an excessive weight put on sex and sexuality in their scale of values. Gay men had to organize in order to defend their territory and their institutions against the invasion, intrusion, and occupation inflicted by heterosexual institutions. “Like gay men, prostitutes occupy well-demarcated urban territories and battle with police to defend and maintain those territories. The legal persecution of both populations is justified by an elaborate ideology which classifies them as dangerous and inferior undesirables who are not entitled to be left in peace.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These claims by Gayle S. Rubin strengthen the idea that the gay nation may be similar to the Hebrew diaspora before the foundation of the State of Israel, or as every indigenous nation in North and Latin America, struggling to survive and achieve self-determination within the limits and boundaries imposed by the hegemonic state apparatuses of the societies they live in. While the awareness and pride in belonging to this “gay nation” may be understood as an instance of queer nationalism, this may become problematic as it may easily fall under the category of homonationalism instead.

== Homonationalism and the Pulse Nightclub Mass Shooting ==
At the [[Orlando nightclub shooting|mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub]] in Orlando, FL in 2016, the perpetrator was Omar Mateen who in a 9-1-1 phone call  [[Bay'ah|swore allegiance]] to the leader of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], and said the U.S. killing of [[Abu Waheeb]] in Iraq the previous month "triggered" the shooting. Pulse was hosting a "Latin Night," and thus, most of the victims were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]]. It is the deadliest incident of [[History of violence against LGBT people in the United States|violence against LGBT people]] in U.S. history and the deadliest terrorist attack in the U.S. since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. At the time, it was the deadliest [[mass shooting]] by a single shooter in the U.S., being surpassed by the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|Las Vegas shooting]] a year later.

In ''Terrorist Assemblages'', Jasbir Puar sustains that “sexual deviance is linked to the process of discerning, othering, and quarantining terrorist bodies, but these racially and sexually perverse figures also labor in the service of disciplining and normalizing subjects worthy of rehabilitation away from these bodies, in other words, signaling and enforcing the mandatory terms of patriotism.” Puar claims that the binary reinforced by the othering involved in the War on Terror together with the othering of LGBT bodies “has rehabilitated some—clearly not all or most—lesbians, gays, and queers to U.S. national citizenship within a spatial-temporal domain I am invoking as “homonationalism,” short for “homonormative nationalism.”&lt;ref name="homonationalism" /&gt; 

In the wake of the Orlando shooting of the Pulse Nightclub in 2016, the outcome and the responses by U.S. officials and politicians demonstrated Puar’s claim of the use of LGBT bodies towards the demonization of “others” designated as terrorists. Puar states that de alignment with the nationalist discourses against terrorist groups and countries serves de purpose of strengthening the American nationalist projects across the political spectrum: “I argue that the Orientalist invocation of the terrorist is one discursive tactic that disaggregates U.S. national gays and queers from racial and sexual others, foregrounding a collusion between homosexuality and American nationalism that is generated both by national rhetorics of patriotic inclusion and by gay and queer subjects themselves: homonationalism. For contemporary forms of U.S. nationalism and patriotism, the production of gay and queer bodies is crucial to the deployment of nationalism, insofar as these perverse bodies reiterate heterosexuality as the norm but also because certain domesticated homosexual bodies provide ammunition to reinforce nationalist projects.”&lt;ref name="homonationalism" /&gt;

Gaetano Venezia III argues that the Pulse shooting in Orlando, Florida in 2016 provides a prime example of homonationalist narratives at work. Several reports emerging after the shooting declared this the Most reports on the Pulse shooting have described it as the largest mass shooting in US history. “However, the state sanctioned massacre of American Indians at Sand Creek in 1864, Clear Lake in 1850, and Wounded Knee in 1890 all had more victims. Furthermore, critiques of this misleading attribution have noted that “death tolls…were much higher in other shootings more than a century ago, including race riots and labor disputes in the early 1900s and massacres perpetrated by the U.S. Army or settlers in the American West.” Thus, describing the Pulse shooting as the worst mass shooting obscures state violence, protects the image of the state, and minimizes or erases the oppression of indigenous people and racial minorities.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://c4ss.org/content/46496|title=Homonationalism in the Wake of the Pulse Shooting|work=Center for a Stateless Society|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the Pulse shooting served the purpose of both othering the shooter as a terrorist and at the same time softening the involvement of the state’s nation building project in the extermination of native populations.

== Homonationalism in the U.S. 2016 Presidential Campaign Trail ==
Gaetano Venezia III addresses the responses by American politicians after the shooting. Venezia argues that the responses to the Pulse shooting strengthen and protect not only the image of the state but its officials. “Police and politicians often get good press by expressing their sympathy and solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community, even as they remain unapologetic and unresponsive in regards to oppressive policies and actions, like the Stonewall riots, abuse of trans folk, and restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights and protections. The discrepancy between rhetoric and actual treatment reveals the hypocrisy of their “support” for the LGBTQ+ community. This hypocrisy often strengthens their public image, making it even more difficult to gain allies, counter injustice, and secure equal rights and protections.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The responses of the presidential frontrunners in the U.S. 2016 election are evidence of the homonationalist sentiment that emerged after the shooting. The Republican and the Democrat leading candidates both responded a few days after the tragedy by delivering speeches addressing national security. 

Donald Trump and other Republicans embraced this sentiment in their response to the shooting to argue that they were supporters of LGBT rights because of their support for immigration restrictions aimed at Muslims. This is what he said on his speech of June 13, 2016: “This is a very dark moment in America’s history. A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation.” “We want to live in a country where gay and lesbian Americans and all Americans are safe from radical Islam, which, by the way, wants to murder and has murdered gays and they enslave women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/transcript-donald-trump-national-security-speech-224273|title=Transcript: Donald Trump's national security speech|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the Republican National Convention, candidate Trump used the Orlando tragedy in his nomination acceptance speech in order to justify his antimuslim platform. “Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted the LGBTQ community. No good. And we’re going to stop it. As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974|title=Full text: Donald Trump 2016 RNC draft speech transcript|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, leading candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to fight the terrorist virus in its origins, and therefore justified her party’s platform of military intervention in the Middle East. She othered these Muslim majority countries by describing heinous acts directed against the LGBTQ population: “The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. And we must attack it with clear eyes, steady hands, unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values. […] we know already the barbarity that we face from radical jihadists is profound. In the Middle East, ISIS is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities. They are slaughtering Muslims who refuse to accept their medieval ways. They are beheading civilians, including executing LGBT people. They are murdering Americans and Europeans, enslaving, torturing and raping women and girls. […] The terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry. And an attack on any American is an attack on all Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4367046/orlando-shooting-hillary-clinton-transcript/|title=Read Clinton's Speech About the Orlando Shooting|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The promise of both candidates made to the American LGBT communities was that they would work to favor their rights while at the same time advance their respective parties’ political agendas regarding Jihadi terrorism. While Clinton promised to terminate the virus of Islamic terrorism by attacking its origins, this would only mean that as an elected official she would be furthering the U.S. neoliberal foreign policy of intervention in the Middle East and the military invasion of foreign countries, Syria to be specific, justified by the War on Terror. Trump’s pledge in the light of the Orlando shooting was to argue that they were true pro-LGBTQ advocates because of their support for immigration restrictions aimed towards Muslims embodied by the Travel Ban. In their respective speeches, the bodies of the fallen queer people in the Pulse tragedy had been used by both presidential candidates as ammunition to strengthen the sense of urgency for their own political national projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5274">'''Influence peddling''' is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favours or preferential treatment for another, usually in [[Money trail|return for payment]]. Also called '''traffic of influence''' or '''trading in influence'''. In fact, influence peddling is not necessarily illegal as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has often used the term "undue influence peddling" to refer to illegal acts of lobbying. [http://www.oecd.org/document/32/0,3343,en_2649_37443_42694048_1_1_1_1,00.html] However, influence peddling bears the stench of corruption that may de-legitimise democratic politics with the general public.

'''Michel Guillaume Jean de Crèvecœur''' ({{IPA-fr|miʃɛl ɡijom ʒɑ̃ də kʁɛvkœʁ}}; December 31, 1735 – November 12, 1813), naturalized in New York as '''John Hector St. John''', was a [[French-American]] writer. He was born in [[Caen]], [[Normandy]], [[France]],  to the '''Comte and Comtesse de Crèvecœur''' (Count and Countess of Crèvecœur).

==Biography==
He was born December 31, 1735, to a family of minor nobility in Normandy, France. In 1755 he migrated to [[Quebec|New France]] in North America. There, he served in the [[French and Indian War]] as a cartographer in the French Colonial Militia, rising to the rank of lieutenant. Following the British defeat of the French Army in 1759, he moved to the [[Province of New York]], where he took out citizenship, adopted the English-American name of John Hector St. John, and in 1770 married an [[United States|American]] woman, Mehitable Tippet, the daughter of a New York merchant. He bought a sizable farm in [[Orange County, New York]], called "Pine Hill", where he prospered as a farmer. He also traveled about working as a surveyor.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.0642292.0039.013 Moore, Andrew. "The American Farmer as French Diplomat", ''Journal of the Western Society for French History'', Vol. 39, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; He started writing about life in the American colonies and the emergence of an American society.

In 1779, during the [[American Revolution]], St. John tried to leave the country to return to France because of the faltering health of his father. Accompanied by his son, he crossed British-American lines to enter British-occupied New York City, where he was imprisoned as an American spy for three months without a hearing. Eventually, he was able to sail for Britain, and was shipwrecked off the coast of Ireland.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt; From Britain, he sailed to France, where he was briefly reunited with his father. After spending some time recuperating at the family estate, he visited Paris and the salon of [[Sophie d'Houdetot]].&lt;ref&gt;"Houdetot", ''Dictionnaire de Rousseau'', (ed. Raymond Trousson and Frédéric S. Eigeldinger), Paris: Champion, 1996, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author===
In 1782, in London, he published a volume of narrative essays entitled the ''[[Letters from an American Farmer]]''. The book quickly became the first literary success by an American author in Europe and turned Crèvecœur into a celebrated figure. He was the first writer to describe to Europeans – employing many American English terms – the life on the American frontier and to explore the concept of the [[American Dream]], portraying American society as characterized by the principles of equal opportunity and self-determination. His work provided useful information and understanding of the "New World" that helped to create an American identity in the minds of Europeans by describing an entire country rather than another regional colony. The writing celebrated American ingenuity and the uncomplicated lifestyle. It described the acceptance of religious diversity in a society being created from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. His application of the Latin maxim "[[Ubi panis ibi patria]]" (Where there is bread, there is my country) to early American settlers also shows an interesting insight. He once praised the middle colonies for "fair cities, substantial villages, extensive fields...decent houses, good roads, orchards, meadows, and bridges, where an hundred years ago all was wild, woody, and uncultivated."

===Diplomat===
The success of his book in France had led to his being taken up by an influential circle, and he was appointed the French consul for New York, including the areas of New Jersey and Connecticut. Crèvecœur returned to New York City as the newly appointed French consul in November 1783. Anxious to be reunited with his family, he learned that his farm had been destroyed in an Indian raid, his wife was dead, and his two younger children missing. He stayed in the house of his friend [[Elizabeth Ann Seton#Marriage and motherhood|William Seton]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i3lHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA353&amp;lpg=PA353&amp;dq=J.+Hector+St.+John+de+Cr%C3%A8vec%C5%93ur+%2B+St.+Peter's&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K0a0AG0Lv_&amp;sig=rP7MH1Z2HT60gqo5viRbiKu2Wj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB4MfXuuTYAhVhc98KHSPWAuY4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=J.%20Hector%20St.%20John%20de%20Cr%C3%A8vec%C5%93ur%20%20%20St.%20Peter's&amp;f=false De Courcy, Henry.

Principal of the import-export mercantile firm the William Seton Company, Seton helped Crevecoeur locate his children, who were safe and living with a family in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Julia Post. ''St. Jean de Crèvecoeur'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1916){{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following spring, he was able to reunite with his children. For most of the 1780s, Crèvecœur lived in New York City.

====St. Peter's, New York====
At that time, New York City was the national capital and most of the resident Catholics were connected to the diplomatic corps. Initially they met for services at the home of the Spanish consul. Their numbers increased with seafaring people, merchants, emigrants from the Spanish West Indies, and a few Acadians. They then rented space at [[New York Vauxhall Gardens|Vauxhall Gardens]], a garden and entertainment venue located along the North River on Greenwich Street between Warren and Chambers Streets.&lt;ref name=Meehan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1rQOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA438&amp;lpg=PA438&amp;dq=J.+Hector+St.+John+de+Cr%C3%A8vec%C5%93ur+%2B+St.+Peter's&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=of8Xnnndrc&amp;sig=hZyw1JHs8UIE1khL3d3pXwvR4Xs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH1tmFpuXYAhXSRt8KHdz-BG84ChDoAQg0MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=J.%20Hector%20St.%20John%20de%20Cr%C3%A8vec%C5%93ur%20%2B%20St.%20Peter's&amp;f=false Meehan, Thomas F., "a Century of Catholic Laymen in New York", ''Messenger'', 1908, p. 438]{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1785 Portuguse consul Jose Roiz Silva, Spanish consul Tomas Stoughton and others sought to rent the vacant Exchange building and deemed Crevecoeur the best one to make the approach.

Although Crevecoeur was relatively indifferent to religion, he was sympathetic to the idea of liberty of conscience, and a friend of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]]. When the proposal was rejected, Crevecoeur was insulted and became very active in working for the establishment of the first Catholic church in the city. He later served as president of the first Board of Trustees of [[St. Peter Catholic Church (Manhattan)|St. Peter's Church]] on Barclay Street.&lt;ref name=Meehan/&gt;

===Later life===
In 1784, he published a two-volume version of his ''[[Letters from an American Farmer]]'', enlarged and completely rewritten in French. A three-volume version followed in 1787. Both his English and his French books were translated into several other European languages and widely disseminated throughout Europe. For many years, Crèvecœur was identified by European readers with his fictional narrator, James, the 'American farmer', and held in high esteem by readers and fellow-writers across Europe.

By the time he published another three-volume work in 1801, entitled ''Voyage dans la Haute-Pensylvanie et dans l'état de New-York'', however, his fame had faded and the damages of the French Revolution and its aftermath had made people less interested in the United States. His book was ignored. An abbreviated German translation appeared the following year. An English translation was not published until 1964. Much of de Crevecoeur's best work has been published posthumously, most recently as ''More Letters from the American Farmer: An edition of the Essays in English Left Unpublished by Crèvecœur'', edited by Dennis D. Moore (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 1995).

Particularly concerned about the condition of [[slaves]], he joined the ''Société des Amis des Noirs'' (Society of the Friends of the Blacks), founded in Paris.

In 1789, during a stay in France, he was trapped by the political upheaval that was quickly turning into the French Revolution. At risk as an aristocrat, he went into hiding, while secretly trying to gain passage to the United States. The necessary papers were finally delivered to him by the new American ambassador to France, [[James Monroe]]. At the end of his life Crèvecœur returned to France and settled permanently on land he inherited from his father.  On November 12, 1813, he died in [[Sarcelles]], [[Val d'Oise]], [[France]].

The town of [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont]], is named after him, as suggested by [[Ethan Allen]].

== Outline of ''Letters From an American Farmer'' ==
*'''Letter I''': Introduction – This letter introduces the persona of James, an American Farmer, and his epistolary dialogue with a minister.
*'''Letter II''': This letter describes the creatures, plants, and activities on and around the farm owned by James. Its main focus is on the "bee's, wasps, hornets, and birds" (Patterson) and illustrates the abundance of life and the dependence on good soil in the American land.
*'''Letter III''': "What is an American?" – This letter compares people to plants and leads the reader to pursue the idea of whether or not the soil has anything to do with the prosperity of the person living there.
*'''Letters IV–VIII''': These letters illustrates in detail the utopian (Patterson) society that the European Americans have created and also the land which they inhabit. It also describes the conditions in which they live and the customs of whaling villages of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Nantucket Sequence in Crèvecoeur's Letters from an American Farmer |author= [[Nathaniel Philbrick]] |journal= New England Quarterly |volume= 64 |year=1991 |jstor=366350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Letter IX''': This letter gives an account of Charleston, South Carolina. The letter then quickly moves to the notion of slavery in the South. It argues about the destruction that revolves around the slave-master relationships and makes an appeal to the North, in particular, that slavery is a truly evil practice in the midst of the new nation of America.
*'''Letter X''': This letter talks extensively  about a wide variety of snakes and even speaks to the American Indians practices of eating them. It also mentions their habits and stories that have been told in America, warning people about certain ones. At the end of this letter, it speaks about the hummingbirds found around James' land and their habits and varieties as well.
*'''Letter XI''': This letter is supposedly narrated by a Russian, but is almost indistinguishable from James himself. It describes a visit to the famous Pennsylvanian botanist, Mr. [[John Bartram|John Bertram]]. The narrator tells of the new methods of fertilizing and irrigation that Bertram has invented and used on his own plants.
*'''Letter XII''': "Distresses of a Frontier Man" – This letter describes the Revolutionary War from the narrator's perspective and the stress of being caught between forces beyond his own control. This particular letter is the only one written that has any traces of anti-British ideas and opinions. The letter also includes James' view of the American Indians around him and his plan to run away with his family and live among them until the fighting ceased.

'''Janet''' is a high-speed network for the UK research and education community provided by [[Jisc]], a not-for-profit company set up to provide computing support for education.&lt;ref name=JANET30&gt;{{cite web|title=1984-2014: 30 years of the Janet network|url=https://www.jisc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/janet-news-24-pull-out-april-2014.pdf|publisher=Disc|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves 18 millions users and is the busiest [[National Research and Education Network]] in Europe by volume of data carried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janet Network|url=https://www.jisc.ac.uk/janet|publisher=Jisc|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; JANET was previously a private, UK government-funded organisation, which provided the Janet [[computer network]] and related collaborative services to UK research and education.

All further- and higher-education organisations in the UK are connected to the Janet network, as are all the [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]]; the majority of these sites are connected via 20 [[metropolitan area network]]s across the UK (though Janet refers to these as regions, emphasising that Janet connections are not just confined to a metropolitan area&lt;ref name="regional delivery options"&gt;[http://www.ja.net/products-services/janet-connect/janet-connections/janet-connected-sites/regional/ Regional Delivery Options]&lt;/ref&gt;). The network also carries traffic between schools within the UK, although many of the schools' networks maintain their own general Internet connectivity. The name was originally a contraction of Joint Academic NETwork but it is now known as Janet in its own right.

The network is linked to other European and worldwide [[National Research and Education Network|NREN]]s through [[GEANT]] and [[Peering|peers]] extensively with other [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] at [[Internet Exchange Point]]s in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peeringdb.com/view.php?asn=786 Peering Networks Detailed View]&lt;/ref&gt; Any other networks are reached via [[Internet transit|transit services]] from commercial [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] using Janet's Peering Policy.&lt;ref name="Janet Peering Policy"&gt;[http://www.ja.net/about-janet/janet-peering-policy/ Janet Peering Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Janet network is operated by Jisc Services Limited, part of Jisc.  Janet is also responsible for the .ac.uk and .gov.uk [[Domain Name System|domain]]s. On 1 December 2012, Janet and Jisc Collections joined together to form Jisc Collections and Janet Limited, as subsidiary organisations to Jisc. In March 2015,&lt;ref name="Companies House"&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02881024 Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; Jisc Collections and Janet Limited was renamed to Jisc Services Limited. Jisc Services continues to operate under the brand name of Janet, with the same remit. Janet was previously known as the JNT Association, and prior to that, UKERNA (the United Kingdom Education and Research Networking Association).

==History==

Janet developed out of a number of local and research networks dating back to the 1970s. By 1980, a number of national computer facilities serving the [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] community had developed, each with their own star network ([[University of London Computer Centre|ULCC London]], UMRCC Manchester, [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]]). There were also regional networks centred on Bristol, Edinburgh and Newcastle, where groups of institutions had pooled resources to provide better computing facilities than could be afforded individually. These networks were each based on one manufacturer's standards and were mutually incompatible and overlapping. In the early 1980s a standardisation and interconnection effort started, hosted on an expansion of the  [[SERCnet]] [[X.25]] research network. The system first went live on 1 April 1984,&lt;ref name=JANET30/&gt; hosting about 50 sites with line speeds of 9.6&amp;nbsp;[[kbit/s]]. In the mid-80s the backbone was upgraded to a 2&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] backbone with 64&amp;nbsp;kbit/s access links, and a further upgrade in the early 1990s sped the backbone to 8&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s and the access links to 2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, making Janet the fastest [[X.25]] network in the world.

The Janet effort resulted in the standardisation known as the [[Coloured Book protocols]], which provided the first complete X.25 standard. The naming scheme used on Janet ([[JANET NRS]]) had similarities to the [[Internet]]'s [[Domain Name System]], but with domains specified in [[big-endian]] format rather than the [[little-endian]] style used by DNS. There had been some talk of moving Janet to [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] protocols in the 1990s, but changes in the networking world meant this never happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===JIPS and SuperJanet===

In January 1991 the JANET IP Service (JIPS) was set up as a pilot project to host [[Internet Protocol|IP]] traffic on the existing network. Within ten months the IP traffic had exceeded the levels of X.25 traffic, and the IP support became official in November. Today Janet is primarily a high-speed IP network.

In order to address speed concerns, several hardware upgrades have been incorporated into the Janet system. In 1989 SuperJanet was proposed, to re-host JANET on a [[fibre optic]] network. Work started in late 1992, and by late 1993 the first 14 sites had migrated to the new 34&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] system. SuperJanet also moved solely to IP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = Bob | year = 1990 | title = From Janet to SuperJanet: The Development of a High Performance Network to Support UK Higher Education and Research | publisher = The Computer Board for Universities and Research Councils}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 SuperJanet2 started, adding 155&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s ATM backbones and a 10&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s [[SMDS]] network encompassing some of the original JANET nodes. JANET's mandate now included running metropolitan area networks centred on these sites.

SuperJanet3 created new 155&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s ATM nodes to fully connect all of the major sites at [[London]], [[Bristol]], [[Manchester]] and [[Leeds]], with 34&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s links to smaller sites around the country.

In March 2001 SuperJanet4 was launched. The key challenges for SuperJanet4 were the need to increase network capacity and to strengthen the design and management of the JANET network to allow it to meet a similar increase in the size of its userbase.

SuperJanet4 saw the implementation of a 2.5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s core backbone from which connections to regional network points of presence were made at speeds ranging between 155&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s to 2.5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s depending upon the size of the regional network. In 2002 the core SuperJanet4 backbone was upgraded to 10&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s.

SuperJanet4 also saw an increase in the userbase of the JANET network, with the inclusion of the Further Education Community and the use of the SuperJanet4 backbone to interconnect schools' networks.  The core point of presence (Backbone) sites in SuperJanet4 were [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Warrington]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Bristol]], [[Portsmouth]], [[London]] and [[Leeds]].

In October 2006 the SuperJanet5 project was launched after £29 million of investment. It provides a 10Gbit/s backbone, with an upgrade path to 40Gbit/s over the next few years. The new backbone as a result of the SuperJanet5 project is a hybrid network offering, providing both a high speed IP transit service and private bandwidth channel services provisioned over a dedicated fibre network. It is designed not only to fully accommodate the requirements of the traditional JANET user base - all research institutes, universities and further education - but also to meet the needs of a new userbase in the UK's primary and secondary schools.

In April 2011 Verizon helped Janet upgrade 4 central locations to run at 100Gbit/s bringing it to a national research and education network performance parity with [[Internet2]] (which upgraded its backbone to 100Gbit/s in October 2007). As of October 2011 they have over 18 million end-users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ja.net/about-janet/about-us|title=About Janet|accessdate=8 October 2011|publisher=Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janet6 started to go live in July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ja.net/sites/default/files/Janet6%20Migration%20Timetable%20v11.pdf|title=Janet6 Migration Timetable|accessdate=20 September 2013|publisher=Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially launched at an event at the [[London Film Museum]] on the 26 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ja.net/events/janet6-launch|title=Janet6 Launch|accessdate=20 September 2013|publisher=Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt; At launch, Janet6 had an initial capacity of 2Tbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ja.net/sites/default/files/J5524%20Janet6%20Brochure%20with%20Diagram%20Amend%20201212MR.pdf|title=Janet6 Brochure and Diagram|accessdate=20 September 2013|publisher=Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regions ==
The Janet network is implemented through 18 regions which connect universities, colleges and schools to the Janet network.  Most regions are operated by Janet, although a few operate as independent entities working under contract.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2342">This is a '''list of [[anarchist literature]] for children''', a subgenre of [[children's literature]] which encourages children to explore [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosophy. Individual characters within non-anarchist aligned works may also be used to present anarchist philosophy within larger works of fiction. A list of such characters is also documented below.

==Novels==
* ''[[The Secret World of Terijian]]''
* ''[[The Book of Merlyn]]''

==Characters==
*[[Anarky]]
*[[Merlin|Merlyn]] (as portrayed by the author in ''[[The Book of Merlyn]]'' 1941, by [[T. H. White]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=T.H. |coauthors= |title=The Book of Merlyn |location=United Kingdom |publisher=[[Ace Books]]|year=1987|isbn=0-441-00663-9|page=193}} Merlyn self-identifies as an anarchist with the line "I am an anarchist, like any other sensible person." The character further elaborates upon his philosophy, railing against collectivist ideologies such as [[communism]] and [[fascism]]. The character also rebukes the notion that a communist state can "wither away" to lead to a condition of anarchy, and takes a firm [[Antimilitarism|antimilitarist]] stance. ''The Book of Merlyn'' is the final part of ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' series.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of national [[Capital (city)|capitals]] ordered by [[elevation]]. Higher elevations typically have social, economic, and architectural effects on cities, in particular colder temperatures in winter. Low elevation cities are often [[Port|seaports]] or are close to the sea.

The first country on the main list, [[Bolivia]], is a [[List of countries with multiple capitals|country with multiple capitals]]; La Paz is the [[Government|seat of the government]] while Sucre is the [[constitution]]al capital. If [[La Paz]] is considered the national capital, then it is ranked number one on the list. However, if Sucre is specified, then [[Ecuador]]'s capital, [[Quito]], is the national capital at the highest elevation.

The second list below contains several [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]]. [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] , which is internationally recognized as a [[Provinces of China|province]]-level [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous region]] in southwest [[China]], is first on the list.

The CPC established the People's Republic. As such, the [[Political status of Taiwan|political status]] of the ROC and the [[legal status of Taiwan]] (alongside the [[Free Area of the Republic of China|territories]] currently under ROC jurisdiction) are in dispute. In 1971, the [[United Nations]] gave the [[China and the United Nations|China seat]] to the PRC instead of the ROC: most states recognize the PRC to be the [[One-China policy|sole legitimate representative of all China]], and the UN classifies Taiwan as "[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan, Province of China]]". The ROC has ''de facto'' relations with most sovereign states. A significant political movement within Taiwan advocates [[Taiwan independence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1127">'''''Marketing assistance loans''' are nonrecourse loans made available to producers of [[loan commodities]] (wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley oats, upland and extra-long staple (ELS) cotton, rice, soybeans, other oilseeds, honey, wool, mohair, dry peas, lentils, and small chickpeas) under the [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1201-1205).  The new law largely continued the commodity loan programs as they were under previous law.  Loan rate caps are specified in the law.  Marketing loan repayment provisions apply when market prices drop below the loan rates.  For farmers who forgo the use of marketing assistance loans, [[loan deficiency payment]] (LDP) rules apply (but not for ELS cotton).''

The '''Megatons to Megawatts Program''', successfully completed in December 2013, is the popular name given to the program which is also called the [[United States]]-[[Russia]] Highly Enriched Uranium Purchase Agreement. The official name of the program is the "Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the United States of America Concerning the Disposition of Highly-Enriched Uranium Extracted from Nuclear Weapons", dated February 18, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armscontrol.ru/start/docs/heu93t.htm Arms Control website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this Agreement, Russia agreed to supply the United States with low-enriched [[uranium]] (LEU) obtained from high-[[enriched uranium]] (HEU) found to be in excess of Russian defense purposes. The United States agreed to purchase the low-enriched [[uranium fuel]].

The original proposal for this program was made by Thomas Neff, a physicist at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], in an October 24, 1991 Op-Ed in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neff|first=Thomas L.|title=A Grand Uranium Bargain|url=http://fissilematerials.org/library/A_Grand_Uranium_Bargain.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 October 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 28, 1992, in Moscow, U.S. and Russian negotiators initialed the 20-year agreement and President [[George H. W. Bush]] announced the agreement on August 31, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times September 6, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the agreement was signed and initiated by President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and the commercial implementing contract was then signed by both parties.

==Terms of the program==

Under this Agreement, United States and Russia agreed to commercially implement a 20-year program to convert 500 metric tons of HEU (uranium 235 enriched to 90 percent) taken from Soviet era [[Nuclear-warhead|warheads]], into LEU (less than 5 percent uranium 235). The terms of the agreement required that it be implemented on commercial terms without government funds. The agreement named the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] as the executive agent for the US side.&lt;ref&gt;RUSSIAN-U.S. HEU AGREEMENT [Russian-U.S. agreement concerning the disposition of highly enriched uranium extracted from nuclear weapons]. February 18, 1993. Retrieved 28 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The DOE appointed the newly privatized [[United States Enrichment Corporation]] (USEC) as the commercial agent, its executive program contractor. The Russian Federation designated [[Techsnabexport]] (TENEX), a commercial subsidiary of its [[Ministry for Atomic Energy]] (Minatom), as the agent to implement the program on commercial terms. On January 14, 1994, the commercial contract between USEC and TENEX (HEU-LEU Contract) was signed. The terms also required that the HEU be converted by dilution (downblending) to LEU in Russian nuclear facilities. USEC would then purchase the low-enriched fuel and transport it to its facilities in the US. The first shipment of LEU took place in May 1995.

The value of the process is in two components: the LEU Feed (feed component of natural uranium) and the work involved in the conversion process, measured as [[separative work units]] (SWU). Both have separate commercial values. Early disagreements on interpretations of the terms of the governmental and commercial agreements on this issue led to controversy and some delays. Although each shipment contains LEU, the commercial nature of the global uranium market defines the uranium and the enrichment components as separate commercial values and costs. The solution reached was for USEC to continue payments for the SWU component it purchased and also to transfer the equivalent of the LEU feed component to the Russian side. In March 1999, Minatom and the US Department of Energy signed the Agreement Concerning the Transfer of Source Material to the Russian Federation (the Transfer Agreement), and at the same time TENEX signed a Contract with a Group of Western Companies (Cameco, Canada; Cogema, France; Nukem, Germany/US) regarding the purchase of the LEU Feed. As years passed, numerous commercial contract terms were renegotiated and revised to accommodate mutual interests.

== Summary of program ==

The Megatons to Megawatts program was initiated in 1993 and completed on schedule in December 2013. A total of 500 tonnes of Russian warhead grade HEU (equivalent to 20,008 nuclear warheads) were converted in Russia to nearly 15,000 tonnes tons of LEU (low enriched uranium) and sold to the US for use as fuel in American nuclear power plants. The program was the largest and most successful nuclear non-proliferation program to date. The first [[nuclear power plant]] to receive low-enriched fuel containing uranium under this program was the [[Cooper Nuclear Station]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gJHtHlm9r4YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Nuclear Shadowboxing: Legacies and Challenges|last=DeVolpi|first=Alexander|last2=Minkov|first2=Vladimir E.|publisher=DeVolpi|year=2005|isbn=0-9777734-1-8|volume=2|location=Kalamazoo, Mich.|page=VII-54|display-authors=etal|authorlink=|author2-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20-year Megatons to Megawatts program, as much as 10 percent of the electricity produced in the United States was generated by fuel fabricated using LEU from Russian HEU.&lt;ref name="MtoM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usec.com/megatonstomegawatts.htm|title=Megatons to Megawatts|date=|publisher=U.S. Enrichment Corp.|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716044207/http://www.usec.com/megatonstomegawatts.htm|archivedate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, on a comparatively modest basis, the US government has also been converting some of its excess nuclear warhead HEU into power plant fuel. Efforts have also been undertaken to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of converting warhead [[plutonium]] into fuel to augment nuclear fuel for US power plants.

Nuclear industry sources forecasted high demand trends that would require finding other uranium supply sources after the completion of the Megatons to Megawatts agreement.&lt;ref name=MtoM/&gt; In 2011, TENEX and USEC signed a long-term contract (Transitional Supply Agreement – TSA) for the provision of enrichment services to the United States that could see annual deliveries after 2015 reaching a level of around half the annual supply volume under the HEU Deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenex.ru/wps/wcm/connect/tenex/site.eng/press/media/07a5ef00407b163599ecfbeb14017f9b TENEX Celebrates 50 Years in the Nuclear Energy Business].

The '''Ministry of Culture and Tourism''' ({{lang-tr|Kültür ve Turizm Bakanlığı}}) is a government ministry of the [[Republic of Turkey]], responsible for culture and tourism affairs in Turkey. Revolving fund management of the ministry is carried by [[DÖSİMM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dosim.kulturturizm.gov.tr/en/aboutus DÖSİMM page]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25, 2013, [[Ömer Çelik]] was appointed as minister following a cabinet change succeeding [[Ertuğrul Günay]], who was in office since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Ministry functions==
One of the responsibilities of the ministry is the [[Digital preservation|preservation]] of manuscripts, so they are available and accessible to researchers.&lt;ref name="digitizing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Manuscripts|url=http://www.yazmalar.gov.tr/index.php?dill=eng|website=Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In promoting the country, the ministry often created promotional films for the country. In 2015, the ministry gained controversy after axing a scene from a $4 million-dollar promotional involving [[Julianne Moore]] due to her allegedly "poor acting".&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Benjamin|title=Julianne Moore cut from Turkey tourist board ad for 'poor acting'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/01/julianne-moore-cut-from-turkey-tourist-board-ad-for-poor-acting|work=The Guardian|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruhsar Demirel, of the [[Nationalist Movement Party]], asked social affairs minister [[Ayşenur İslam]]: "How reasonable do you find promoting Turkey with the body of such names and women? How do you find, as a woman, giving plenty of money to a Hollywood star to promote Turkey, as if it were the 19th century?", and other politicians criticised her for a "depressive persona".&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt; In 2017, alongside [[Turkish Airlines]] and Turkish tourism companies, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism helped finance [[Non-Transferable (film)|''Non-Transferable'']], a [[romantic comedy]] film produced by [[Brendan Bradley (actor)|Brendan Bradley]].&lt;ref name="GutelleTubefilter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutelle|first1=Sam|title=Turkish Airlines Gets In On The YouTuber Film Trend With ‘Non-Transferable’|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2015/12/10/turkish-airlines-non-transferable-film/|website=Tubefilter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LazarHuffpo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lazar|first1=Shira|title=How Do You Make a Movie in Europe With Almost No Budget?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/how-do-you-make-a-movie-i_b_9298634.html|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the Ministry has sent a directive to the head of the excavations team in Turkey notifying them that according to a new regulation, 51 percent of archeological excavation teams led by foreign crews should consist of Turkish nationals, the key posts in excavations such as archeologist, anthropologist, art historian, restaurateur, architect, and photographer, should be reserved for Turkish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/new-regulation-imposes-turkish-majority-crew-rule-for-archeological-excavations-133598 New regulation imposes ‘Turkish majority crew’ rule for archeological excavations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:国民政府经济部旧址，2017年11月.jpg|thumb|Former Ministry of Economic Affairs building in [[Nanjing]].]]
MOEA was initially established in June 1931 as '''National Economic Council''' by the [[Executive Yuan]]. In December 1931, the council was merged with other organizations to create the '''Ministry of Basic Industries'''. In December 1937, the ministry was reorganized as the '''Ministry of Economic Affairs'''. The MOEA continued to function in Taiwan since 1949 after the [[Kuomintang]] was defeated on the [[mainland China|mainland]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]].

The '''National Corporate Party''' ({{lang-ir|Páirtí Náisiúnta Corparáidíoch}}, PNC) was a [[Fascism|fascist]] political party in [[Ireland]] founded by General [[Eoin O'Duffy]] in June 1935 at a meeting of 500.&lt;ref&gt; https://books.google.ie/books?id=qps14mSlghcC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=national+corporate+party&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAn4nclLXcAhUHe8AKHeCPBvMQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20corporate%20party&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/eoin-oduffys-blueshirts-and-the-abyssinian-crisis/&lt;/ref&gt; It split from [[Fine Gael]] when O'Duffy was removed as leader of that party, which had been founded by the merger of O'Duffy's [[Blueshirts]], formally known as the National Guard or Army Comrades Association, with [[Cumann na nGaedheal]], and the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]].&lt;ref name="org"&gt;Barberis, Peter, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, 2005. ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organisations''. London: Continuum International Publishing Group. {{ISBN|0-8264-5814-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-5814-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Corporate Party wished to establish a [[corporatism|corporate]] state in Ireland and was strongly [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]].&lt;ref name="org"/&gt; Its military wing was the [[Greenshirts (National Corporate Party)|Greenshirts]].&lt;ref name="org"/&gt; The party raised funds through public dances. &lt;ref&gt;https://irishelectionliterature.com/2013/05/27/a-number-of-ads-for-events-to-do-with-eoin-oduffys-national-corporate-party/&lt;/ref&gt;

It failed to gain much support however, with the majority of Fine Gael members remaining loyal to that party and O'Duffy only securing a handful of loyal supporters for his group.&lt;ref name="regan"&gt;John M. Regan, ''The Irish Counter-Revolution 1921-1936'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1999, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Duffy left Ireland in 1936 to become involved in the [[Spanish Civil War]], a fact which led to further decline in the National Corporate Party.&lt;ref name="regan"/&gt; The party was defunct by 1937.&lt;ref name="org"/&gt;

'''National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation''' is a ceremony that takes place at the [[White House]] every year shortly before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. The [[President of the United States]] is presented with a live [[domestic turkey]] by the [[National Turkey Federation]], usually of the [[Broad Breasted White]] variety. The early years also included a joint presentation with the Poultry and Egg National Board. The ceremony dates back to the 1940s, with presidents occasionally sparing the bird presented to them; since 1989, during [[George H. W. Bush]]'s first Thanksgiving as president, it has been an annual tradition for the president to "pardon" the turkey.&lt;ref name="Hesse"&gt;Hesse, Monica. 2007. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/20/AR2007112002331.html?sub=AR&amp;sid=ST2007112002354 Turkey Pardons, The Stuffing of Historic Legend].

==History==
[[File:President Ronald Reagan receives the 40th White House Thanksgiving Turkey 1987.jpg|275px|thumb|right|"If they'd given me a different answer on Charlie and his future, I would have pardoned him." ―[[Ronald Reagan]], 1987.]] On various occasions, turkeys had been donated to the President as gifts from private citizens. Henry Vose, a Rhode Island turkey farmer, presented a turkey to the President each year from 1873 until his death in 1913.&lt;ref name=kirkpatrick&gt;Kirkpatrick, Melanie. [https://nypost.com/2016/11/20/the-turkey-pardoning-tradition-may-have-started-with-a-raccoon/ The turkey pardoning tradition may have started with a raccoon]. ''The New York Post'' (November 20, 2016). Retrieved November 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official presentation of a turkey to the President each year began in 1947 under President [[Harry Truman]], and many sources erroneously attribute the origin of the turkey pardon to Truman. However, the [[Truman Library]] says that no documents, speeches, newspaper clippings, photographs or other contemporary records are known to exist that specify that he ever "[[pardoned]]" a turkey; But the first official turkey pardoning was with President George Bush. There are records that Truman publicly admitted to eating at least some of them.&lt;ref name="Hesse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;Edwards, Cynthia. 2003. Did Truman pardon a Turkey? http://www.trumanlibrary.org/trivia/turkey.htm (accessed November 24, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation was partially borne out of a [[lobbying]] campaign: the Truman Administration, in an effort to conserve grain for foreign aid campaigns, began promoting "[[Meatless Monday|Meatless Tuesdays]]" and "Poultryless Thursdays" in the autumn of 1947. Not only did American citizens quickly grow frustrated with the (voluntary, but strongly encouraged) restrictions and begin disregarding them in short order, the National Poultry and Egg Board, incensed at the attack on their industry, noted that not only was Thanksgiving on a Thursday (thus making the annual Thanksgiving turkey a taboo), but [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Day]] also landed on a Thursday that year. A truce was called in the dispute in early November, before the Thanksgiving holiday, but "Eggless Thursdays" continued to be promoted for the rest of the year, meaning that [[pumpkin pie]], another Thanksgiving staple, was still on the forbidden foods list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/the-way-we-ate-the-year-harry-truman-passed-on-pumpkin-pie/|title=The Way We Ate: The Year Harry Truman Passed on Pumpkin Pie|first=Michele|last=Humes|work=Diner's Journal|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 23, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eisenhower Presidential Library]] says documents in their collection reveal that President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] ate the birds presented to him during his two terms. President [[John F. Kennedy]] spontaneously spared a turkey on November 18, 1963, just four days before his [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]].  The bird was wearing a sign reading, "Good Eating Mr. President". Kennedy returned the massive {{convert|55|lb|kg|adj=on}} turkey to the farm, saying "we'll let this one grow."&lt;ref name=marybruce&gt;Bruce, Mary (November 22, 2013).

The first President on record issuing a "pardon" to his turkey was [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan had been sending the turkeys presented to him to farms and zoos since at least 1982,&lt;ref name=monkman/&gt; and 1987's turkey, Charlie, was likewise headed to a [[petting zoo]]. At the time, Reagan was facing questions over the [[Iran-Contra affair]], on whether or not he would consider pardoning [[Oliver North]] (who had yet to be tried for his involvement in the affair); Reagan conjured the notion of the turkey pardon as a joke to deflect those questions.&lt;ref name="Hesse"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/the-origin-of-presidential-turkey-pardoning-574548547710 The actual, surprising origin of presidential turkey pardoning]. ''MSNBC''. November 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan did not pardon a turkey in his final year as President in 1988, but his successor, [[George H. W. Bush]], instituted the turkey pardon as a permanent part of the presentation beginning his first year in office, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President 'Pardons' Thanksgiving Turkey|url=http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/thanksgiving/featured/4|work=Los Angeles Times via Associated Press|date=18 November 1989|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kirkpatrick/&gt;

The phrase "presidential pardon" in that ceremony was apparently inserted by a speechwriter; Bush initially was indifferent to the terminology, saying {{"'}}Reprieve', 'keep him going', or 'pardon': it's all the same for the turkey, as long as he doesn't end up on the president's holiday table."&lt;ref name=monkman/&gt; Since then, at least one of the turkeys presented to the President has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life. For many years the turkeys were sent to [[Frying Pan Farm Park]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]]. From 2005 to 2009, the pardoned turkeys were sent to either the [[Disneyland]] Resort in [[California]] or the [[Walt Disney World]] Resort in [[Florida]], where they served as the honorary grand marshals of Disney's [[Thanksgiving Day]] Parade.

==Selection process==
The turkeys are raised in the same fashion as turkeys designated for slaughter and are fed a grain-heavy diet of fortified corn and soybeans to increase the birds' size.&lt;ref name=danmerica/&gt; A flock of between 50 and 80 birds, typically from the farm of the current National Turkey Federation chairperson, are selected to be acclimated to handle loud noises, flash photography and large crowds; from the flock, the 10 to 20 best-preened and best-behaved are chosen and eventually narrowed down to two finalists, whose names are chosen by the White House staff from suggestions by school children from the state where they were raised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.time.com/2013/11/26/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-presidential-turkey-pardons/ 10 things you didn't know about Presidential turkey pardons]. ''Time''. Retrieved November 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The two finalists are then transported to Washington, where they stay at the [[Willard InterContinental Washington]] Hotel at National Turkey Federation expense before being pardoned in a ceremony at the White House.  Turkey hens are usually marketed at 14 weeks and weigh {{convert|15.5|lb|kg}} when processed. This compares to the tom, which takes 18 weeks to reach a market weight of {{convert|38|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatturkey.com/content/farm]&lt;/ref&gt; The turkeys for the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation are usually 21 week-old toms (males) weighing 45 pounds by the time of their White House visit, compared to the shorter growing period for turkeys destined for market.

[[Broad Breasted White turkey]]s are bred for size at the expense of longer life, making them prone to [[Obesity-associated morbidity|health problems associated with obesity]] such as heart disease, respiratory failure and joint damage.

==Popular culture==
In ''[[The West Wing]]'' episode "Shibboleth," when [[C. J. Cregg|C.J.]] learns the alternate turkey is to be slaughtered, she appeals to [[Josiah Bartlet|President Bartlet]] to save it. He points out that he cannot pardon a turkey, as it had committed no crime and he has no "judicial jurisdiction over birds". So, he drafts the turkey into military service to spare its life. In real life, both the turkey and the alternate are spared.

The animated film ''[[Free Birds]]'' centers around a turkey who was pardoned, then is recruited to go back in time in an attempt to change history and remove turkey from the menu of the first Thanksgiving dinner at [[Plymouth Colony]].

In David Mamet's play ''[[November (play)|November]]'', an incumbent president losing his bid for reelection uses the yearly tradition to extort the turkey manufacturers to add to his lacking campaign fund.

[[Image:Baker Charleston.jpg|thumb|[[Josephine Baker]] dancing the Charleston at the Folies Bergère, Paris, in 1926]] The word '''''negrophilia''''' is derived from the French ''négrophilie'' that means ''love of the negro''&lt;ref&gt;According to {{fr}} [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/n%C3%A9grophilie CNRTL], the word was coined around 1803.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was a term that [[avant-garde art]]ists used amongst themselves to describe their passion for black culture. During 1920-1930s Paris, negrophilia was a craze when to collect [[African art]], to listen to [[jazz]], and to dance the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]], the [[Lindy Hop]] or the [[Black Bottom (dance)|Black Bottom]], were signs of being modern and fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;A Double Edged Infatuation, ''The Guardian,'' UK, Saturday 23 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of inspiration were inanimate African art objects (''l'art nègre'') that found their way into Paris as a result of colonial trade with Africa as well as live performances by African-Americans, many of whom were ex-soldiers remaining in European cities after [[World War I]], who turned to entertainment for a source of income. Perhaps the most popular revue and entertainer during this time was'' La Revue Nègre'' (1925) starring [[Josephine Baker]].

This interest in exotic cultures had already been established within France due to the regular expositions the country held to showcase the objects and people of the French colonies. The fascination with specifically black culture and the "primitivised" existence associated with it flourished in the combined aftermath of the [[First World War]] (1914–1918) and the [[Paris Colonial Exposition|1931 Colonial Exposition]] when artists yearned for a simpler, idyllic lifestyle to counter modern life's mechanistic violence.&lt;ref&gt;Jodie Blake, Le Tumulte Noir: Modernist Art and Popular Entertainment in Jazz-Age Paris, 1900–1930, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Avant-garde artists recognised for their negrophilia interests include poet and art critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], artists [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Man Ray]], [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], surrealists [[George Bataille]]&lt;ref&gt;Georges Bataille (ed), ''Document'' No. 4, Paris, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michel Leiris]],&lt;ref&gt;''L'Afrique fantôme'', Gallimard, Paris, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and political activist [[Nancy Cunard]].&lt;ref&gt;JNancy Cunard, Hugh G. Ford (ed.),'' Negro: An Anthology'', 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Bal Nègre''==
Due to World War I, France saw an influx of African colonials migrate into Paris. This sudden rise in diversity led white Parisians to become fascinated by the introduction and immersion of black cultures in the city. During the late 1920s, several Parisian nightclubs began hosting bals, or authentic African-inspired dances, which were very popular among both the black and white French crowds. These bals became one of the leading interracial social spaces in France.

While African immigrants went to a ''bal colonial'', or bal nègre, for recreation and fun, French surrealists often came for the scientific observation of black culture. The jazz music and sensual dancing found in black nightclubs were studied and appreciated by surrealists as major components of black civilization. Unfortunately, the "scandalous" night lifestyle of [[Black people in France|Black Africans]] and [[African Americans in France]] often provoked the French sexualization and fetishization of [[black people|black culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Colonial Metropolis: The Urban Grounds of Anti-Imperialism and Feminism in Interwar Paris|last = Boittin|first = Jennider Anne|publisher = University of Nebraska Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = 51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bals were also one of the most prominent areas for interracial exchanges and relationships to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Colonial Metropolis: The Urban Grounds of Anti-Imperialism and Feminism in Interwar Paris|last = Boittin|first = Jennifer Anee|publisher = University of Nebraska Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hidden in the dark of night, young French and African adults could socialize and interact in ways that were highly controversial in average European society.

To the average Frenchman, the bal nègre was considered an opportunity for exotic experiences and sexual freedom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ambivalent Desire: The Exotic Black Other in Jazz-Age France|last = Berliner|first = Brett A.|publisher = University of Massachusetts Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 206–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black party-goers were no longer thought to be in these bals for their own enjoyment, but for the interests of white guests. As the appeal of exoticism rose, the opportunity for white people to interact and dance with black people became very attractive. This promise of "exotic experimentation" made these nightclubs very popular with the French bourgeois and turned them into tourist attractions. Interracial dancing gave the French a sense of liberation from the conventions of modern society, especially since the French depiction of Africa and Africans was primitive and passionate.

These progressive interracial relations did not surpass the walls of the Parisian nightclubs, though. The racial and social structures remained the same for blacks and whites in France during the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum'''|沖縄県立平和祈念資料館|Okinawa Kenritsu Heiwa Kinen Shiryōkan}} is a [[museum]] in [[Itoman, Okinawa]]. It was established on June 11, 1975. The [[Cornerstone of Peace]], a monument similar to the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], is located here.

==Background==

During [[World War II]], the United States invaded the [[Ryukyu Islands]] to use as a staging area for the [[Invasion of Japan]]. Fighting occurred between March and September of 1945, resulting in over 250,000 casualties, including 150,000 [[Ryukyuan people|Okinawan]] civilians. The [[Battle of Okinawa]] has been described as the deadliest battle of the war. The United States controlled the islands until 1972, when they were returned to Japan and [[Okinawa Prefecture]] was reestablished.

==Description==

The Peace Memorial Museam, Peace Prayer Park, and the Cornerstone of Peace were established in 1975 on Mabuni Hill, next to the “Suicide Cliffs” where the Battle of Okinawa ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peace-museum.pref.okinawa.jp/english/|title=Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum|website=www.peace-museum.pref.okinawa.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornerstone of Peace is a semi-circular avenue of stones engraved with the names of all the dead from the Battle of Okinawa, organized by nationality (or by ethnicity for Chinese, Taiwanese, Koreans, and Okinawans). The Memorial Path includes 32 memorial monuments as well as the place where Lieutenant General Ushima committed suicide. There are a number of separate memorials including the Okinawa Peace Hall, a large tower erected in 1978, and individual monuments for each [[Prefecture of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japanvisitor.com/japan-museums/peace-memorial-park-okinawa|title=Peace Memorial Park Okinawa - JapanVisitor Japan Travel Guide|website=www.japanvisitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Olof Palme Peace March''' was a transnational peace march/demonstration that took place in the [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]] during September 1987.

The peace march involved people from three countries, [[West Germany]], East Germany and [[Czechoslovakia]].   It began at [[Stralsund]] on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic Sea (in German Sources "East Sea") coast]],  and crossed the territory of East Germany, taking a far from direct route, to end, officially, at [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name=Ilko-SachaK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/Wissen/Aktenfunde/Palme-Friedensmarsch/palme-marsch_node.html |publisher=[[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records|Federal Commission for the Stasi Records (BStU)]] |title=1. bis 18. September 1987:  Olof-Palme-Friedensmarsch|author=[[Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk]]: ' |accessdate= 19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It was considered remarkable because members of East German political opposition groups were permitted to participate in the march legally.

The march was named to honour the former prime minister of [[Sweden]], [[Olof Palme]], who had been shot dead by an unidentified assailant on a [[Stockholm]] street the previous year, on 28 February 1986.   Palme had opposed the [[nuclear arms race]] and advocated a [[Nuclear-weapon-free zone|nuclear weapons-free corridor]] in central Europe.

==Background==
The Olof Palme Peace March was initiated by the [[German Peace Society]] in the [[German Federal Republic|German Federal Republic (West Germany)]], the [[:de:Friedensrat der DDR|Peace Council]] in the [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]] and the Peace Committee in [[Czechoslovakia]].   Along with national representatives from the three national peace movements, following pressure from the West German side, the [[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|East German confederation of Evangelical churches]] were also permitted to take part in the Peace March.&lt;ref name=EhrhartNeubert&gt;Ehrhart Neubert: ''Geschichte der Opposition in der DDR 1949–1989.'' Bonn 2000, pages 690-692&lt;/ref&gt;   The Peace March was announced early in 1987 in [[Neues Deutschland]], the national mass-circulation newspaper of East Germany's ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED (party)]].   Its timing coincided with a scheduled visit by East German leader [[Erich Honecker]] to meet with [[Helmut Kohl|his West German counterparts]] in [[Bonn]] between 7 and 11 September 1987.

==Events==
The Peace March started on 1 September 1987 at the (recently renamed) [[:de:Olof-Palme-Platz (Stralsund)|Olof-Palme Platz]] in [[Stralsund]], and traveled (predominantly) south, passing through places such as [[Burow]], [[Potsdam]], [[Wittenberg]] und [[Meißen]] before reaching [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name=Ilko-SachaK/&gt;

At the same time all sorts of supportive events took place independently in towns and villages away from the route of the march, most of which were organised by [[:de:Evangelische Kirche|the Church]].   A major demonstration took place on 5 September in [[Prenzlauer Berg]] on the south side of Berlin, with around 1,000 participants proceeding from the [[:de:Zionskirche (Berlin)|Zion Church]] in Berlin's [[:de:Rosenthaler Vorstadt|Rosenthaler suburb]] to the [[Gethsemane Church]] in [[Pankow]].&lt;ref name=EhrhartNeubert/&gt;
[[File:1987-09-19 Christine Lieberknecht am Megaphon.jpg|thumb|350px|The Kappelendorf marchers included [[Christine Lieberknecht]] who 22 years later became the [[Minister-President|regional prime minister.]] in [[Thuringia]]]]
The highpoint came at the suggestion of an organisation called "Action Reconciliation Service for Peace" (''"Aktion Sühnezeichen Friedensdienste"'') and involved several days of "pilgrimage" from the former [[concentration camp]] at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]] to that at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]].   The route was intended to recall [[Death marches (Holocaust)|Death marches]] of concentration camp victims in 1945.   Peace March participants were greeted in some of the places through which they passed by mayors and church ministers, with a local ceremony, typically involving prayers followed by the joint planting of a "Peace Tree" (''"Friedensbaum"'').  Along their pilgrim route these protesters carried with them banners carrying peace messages about [[Swords to ploughshares|turning swords into poughshares]], and others urging the wider availability of "[[:de:Sozialer Friedensdienst|social/peace service (''"Sozialen Friedensdienst"'')]]" as an alternative to the [[Conscription in Germany|compulsory military service]] that young Germans were obliged to undertake.   Other protest banners called for an end to [[Indoctrination|military indoctrination]] in the country's kindergartens and schools, an end to East German military-style fortification against would-be emigrants along the [[Inner German border|frontier between the two Germanys]]&lt;ref name=EhrhartNeubert/&gt; or an end to [[nuclear power]].

The Olof-Palme Peace March was originally scheduled to proceed from [[Stralsund]] to [[Dresden]] and to take place between 1 and 18 September.&lt;ref name=Ilko-SachaK/&gt;   Of the other related peace-protest events that took place across the country during those days, one of the most widely reported took place on 19 September, when approximately 500 people marched from the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald National Commemoration and Admonition Centre (ie the former concentration camp at Buchenwald)]] to the [[:de:Kapellendorf#Thomas-Müntzer-Standbild|Evangelical "Thomas Müntzer" Community Centre]] at [[Kapellendorf]].   Marchers included a local Lutheran pastor's daughter, [[Christine Lieberknecht]] who more recently, in 2009, became the [[Minister-President|regional prime minister]] in [[Thuringia]].   The pastors from the Church of the Good Shepherd in [[Weimar]] and from nearby [[:de:Denstedt|Denstedt]] welcomed the peace pilgrims and the banners which they carried, which here carried mainly messages with a particularly local resonance, calling for a corridor through central Europe free of chemical and nuclear weapons;  something that Olof Palme and Erich Honecker had reportedly proposed.   This march was organised by the Thuringia branch of the [[Christian Peace Conference|Christian Peace Conference (CFK)]].

==Importance==
Many opposition activists in East Germany hoped that the Peace March might herald a more relaxed approach to political demonstrations by [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|The Party]].   Earlier demonstrations had been violently suppressed, whereas the Olof Palme Peace March triggered only sporadic attacks on the peace activists.   However, it soon became apparent that the authorities' strangely permissive reaction to this Peace March had resulted above all from the unusual circumstances presented by Honecker's visit to Bonn, and the government's unwillingness to risk the loss of face implicit in highly publicised assaults on peace marchers in the east while the eyes of the world's media were focused on Honecker's diplomacy in the west.&lt;ref name=Ilko-SachaK/&gt;

Honecker returned home on 11/12 September and the police tactics became more aggressive regarding posters critical of government, which were confiscated in raids and/or banned in population centres such as [[Leipzig]], [[Torgau]] and [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name=Ilko-SachaK/&gt;  Roughly two months after the Olof Palme Peace March, in late November 1987, the [[Stasi]] raided the [[:de:Umwelt-Bibliothek|Environment Library]] in Berlin, which had been set up in the cellar of a church building at the beginning of September 1987, just as peace activists were setting out on their march in the north of the country.   The Environment Library was already becoming known as a meeting point for East German opposition groups, and in their raid the Stasi arrested a number of activists.  They displayed an absence of their habitual discretion, which served notice on any who might have doubted it that no new freedom had been established for political opposition in East Germany.

The '''Party for Freedom''' ({{lang-nl|Partij voor de Vrijheid}}, '''PVV''') is a Dutch [[Nationalism|nationalist]]&lt;ref name="Pauwels"/&gt; and [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]]&lt;ref name="Pauwels"/&gt; [[list of political parties in the Netherlands|political party]] in the [[Netherlands]].

Founded in 2006 as the successor to [[Geert Wilders]]' one-man party in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], it won nine seats in the [[Dutch general election, 2006|2006 general election]] making it the fifth-largest party in parliament. In the [[Dutch general election, 2010|2010 general election]] it won 24 seats, making it the third-largest party. At that time the PVV agreed to support the [[minority government]] led by [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] [[Mark Rutte]] without having ministers in the [[First Rutte cabinet|cabinet]]. However the PVV withdrew its support in April 2012 due to differences over budget cuts at the Catshuis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423035742/http://www.euronews.com/newswires/1490908-dutch-elections-loom-as-budget-talks-collapse/|archivedate=23 April 2012|title=Dutch elections loom as budget talks collapse|url=http://www.euronews.com/newswires/1490908-dutch-elections-loom-as-budget-talks-collapse/|publisher=''[[Euronews]]''|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came third in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Netherlands)|2014 European Parliament election]], winning four out of 26 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/652748-cda-5-zetels-d66-en-pvv-4.html|title=Meeste stemmen D66, CDA grootst|work=nos.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=25 May 2014 |title=CDA met vijf zetels grootste partij |url=http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/special/cda-met-vijf-zetels-grootste-partij |website=RTL Nieuws |accessdate=26 May 2014 |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2017 election, the Party for Freedom won 20 seats, making it the second-largest party in [[Dutch Parliament|Parliament]].

The PVV calls for items like [[administrative detention]] and a strong [[Cultural assimilation|assimilationist]] stance on the [[Integration law for immigrants to the Netherlands|integration]] of immigrants into Dutch society, differing from the established [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] parties in the Netherlands (like the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], VVD). The PVV has also proposed banning the [[Quran]] and shutting down all [[mosque]]s in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=politico/&gt;&lt;ref name=voa/&gt; In addition, the party is consistently [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=José M. |last=Magone |title=Comparative European Politics: An Introduction |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |page=17| url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=g73UtvxJsFcC }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Daniele |last1=Albertazzi |first2=Duncan |last2=McDonnell |title=Twenty-first century populism: The spectre of Western European democracy |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2008 |page=164 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=tCGIAAAAMAAJ }} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and since early July 2012, according to the platform it presented prior to elections in September, it strongly advocates withdrawal from the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/390859-pvv-nederland-moet-uit-eu.html |title=PVV: Nederland moet uit EU.

Party for Freedom is an association with Geert Wilders as its sole member. The party is ineligible for Dutch government funding and relies on donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bolopion |first=Philippe |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/geert-wilders-far-right-party-suffers-donation-downturn/ |title=Geert Wilders' far-right party suffers donation downturn  |publisher=Politico.eu |date=8 March 2017|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== 2004–2005 ===
The party's history began with Geert Wilders' departure from the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] in September 2004. Wilders could not accept the VVD's positive stance towards [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's possible accession to the European Union]], and left the party disgruntled.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Although the VVD expected Wilders to return his parliamentary seat to the party, he refused, and continued to sit in parliament as a one-man party, ''Groep Wilders'' (Wilders Group).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In June 2005, Wilders was one of the leaders in the campaign against the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], which was rejected by Dutch voters by 62%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch say 'No' to EU constitution|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4601439.stm| publisher= BBC News |date=2 June 2005|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006–2010 ===
[[File:Slotdebat verkiezingen (final debate elections) 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Geert Wilders]] (left) with other politicians at the final television debate before the [[Dutch general election, 2006]]]]

On 22 February 2006, the Party for Freedom was registered with the Electoral Council.&lt;ref name="parlementparty"/&gt;

[[Bart Jan Spruyt]], director of the [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Edmund Burke Foundation]], joined Wilders in January 2006 in order to formulate a party programme and to train its prospective representatives for the forthcoming national election (then still scheduled for 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spruyt sluit zich aan bij Geert Wilders|language=Dutch|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/1062338/Nieuws/Politiek/Spruyt-sluit-zich-aan-bij-Geert-Wilders.htm|publisher=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]]|date=4 January 2006|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spruyt left the party in the summer of 2006 after it proved unable to build broad conservative backing, and people like [[Joost Eerdmans]] and [[Marco Pastors]] proved unwilling to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Historische kans voorbij |language=Dutch |url=http://www.refdag.nl/artikel/1271047 |publisher=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]] |date=17 August 2006 |first=Addy |last=de Jong |accessdate=4 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526150442/http://www.refdag.nl/artikel/1271047 |archivedate=26 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Dutch general election, 2006|2006 elections]], Spruyt said he was not surprised that the Party for Freedom had gained seats but maintained that, if the Party for Freedom had sought cooperation with Eerdmans and Pastors, it would have won more, even enough to bring about a [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]]-[[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] [[Dutch general election, 2006#Possible coalitions|majority]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spruyt: Negeren van Wilders onverstandig|language=Dutch|url=http://www.refdag.nl/artikel/1282578/Spruyt%3A+Negeren+van+Wilders+onverstandig.html|publisher=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]]|date=23 November 2006|first=Jacob|last=Hoekman|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, Spruyt commented that the PVV had a 'natural tendency' toward fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weimar in aanbouw (deel 1)|language=Dutch|url=http://bartjanspruyt.blogspot.com/2007/01/weimar-in-aanbouw-deel-1.html|publisher=The weblog of Bart J. Spruyt|first=Bart|last=Spruyt|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later qualified the statement, though he didn't withdraw it. Former PVV candidate [[Lucas Hartong]] called Spruyt's claims 'a cheap insinuation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Het is me wat!| url=http://www.hetvrijevolk.com/?pagina=2295&amp;titel=Het_is_me_wat|first=Lucas|last=Hartong|date=2 January 2007|accessdate=4 April 2009|language=Dutch|publisher=[[Het Vrije Volk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an ''[[HP/De Tijd]]'' profile dated December 2006, the party was described as a [[cult]], with an extremely distrustful Wilders only accepting fellow candidates completely loyal to him, and compared the PVV to the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] led by [[Jan Marijnissen]] but without reaching that degree of organisational perfection.&lt;ref name=HP2006&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Haagse Sekte| language=Dutch| author=van der Horst, Alain |author2=Munk, Kirsten |author3=Niemoller, Joost|publisher=[[HP/De Tijd]]|date=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2007, the PVV announced it would not field candidates at the forthcoming Provincial elections. This meant it would be unrepresented in the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Partij Wilders doet niet mee aan Statenverkiezingen|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article386300.ece/Partij_Wilders_doet_niet_mee_aan_Statenverkiezingen|publisher=[[Volkskrant]]|date=10 January 2007|language=Dutch|accessdate=4 April 2009|work=[[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 January 2007, ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' reported that a PVV intern had solicited for signatures on the website forums ''Dutch Disease Report'' and ''Polinco'', the latter a forum described as far-right by various organisations, among them the Dutch Complaints Bureau for Discrimination on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meldpunt.nl/dl/mdi-jaarverslag-2003.pdf|title=Meldpunt Discriminatie Internet|language=Dutch|publisher=Magenta Foundation|date=1 March 2004|accessdate=4 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040808184259/http://www.meldpunt.nl/dl/mdi-jaarverslag-2003.pdf|archivedate=8 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any party participating in this election was required to collect at least 30 signatures from supporters in each of the 19 electoral districts; of the 1500 signatures the PVV received, the [[Antifaschistische Aktion|Dutch Antifascist]] group identified 34 known far-right supporters. In a response, Wilders said he regretted that far-right sympathisers had provided signatures, denied any personal responsibility for them and reasserted his dislike of far-right parties like [[National Front (France)|National Front]] of France and [[Vlaams Belang|Flemish Interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]]| language=Dutch| date=13 January 2007|accessdate=4 April 2009|title=PVV riep steun van extreem-rechts in| url= http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article598698.ece/PVV_riep_steun_van_extreem-rechts_in| first=Joep| last=Dohmen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[Trouw]]|language=Dutch|date=13 January 2007| title=Wilders ontkent oproep tot steun extreem rechts|url=http://www.trouw.nl/laatstenieuws/laatstenieuws/article598962.ece/Wilders_ontkent_oproep_tot_steun_extreem_rechts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[de Volkskrant]]| date=15 January 2007|title=Extreem-rechtse steun verdriet Wilders|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article387621.ece/Extreem-rechtse_steun_verdriet_Wilders|accessdate=5 April 2009| language= Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Noted writer and columnist [[Leon de Winter]] later declared the affair to be the result of a campaign of [[demonization|demonisation]] against Geert Wilders led by ''NRC Handelsblad'' and ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' newspapers, as well as the broadcaster [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.elsevier.nl/opinie/weblog/asp/artnr/134700/weblogid/4/index.html|title=De demonisering van Geert Wilders|language=Dutch|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|date=15 January 2007|accessdate=4 April 2009| first=Leon| last=de Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilders.jpg|thumb|left|[[Geert Wilders]] in 2007]]

Former [[trade union]] leader and prominent [[Christian Democratic Appeal|Christian Democrat]] Doekle Terpstra proposed an initiative against Geert Wilders and the PVV on 30 November 2007, in the newspaper ''[[Trouw]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Doekle|last=Terpstra|title=’Nee’ tegen kwade boodschap Wilders| language=Dutch| url=http://www.trouw.nl/opinie/podium/article1518091.ece|publisher=[[Trouw]]|date=30 November 2007| accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terpstra sees Wilders as promoting intolerance, and discrimination against Muslims.

Approximately 17 minutes in length, it shows selected excerpts from [[Surah|Suras]] of the [[Quran|Qur'an]], interspersed with media clips and newspaper cuttings showing or describing acts of violence or hatred by Muslims. The film attempts to demonstrate that the Qur'an motivates its followers to hate all who violate Islamic teachings. Consequently, the film argues that Islam encourages acts of terrorism, [[antisemitism]], [[violence against women]] and homosexuals, and Islamic [[universalism]]. A large part of the film deals with [[Islam in the Netherlands|the influence of Islam on the Netherlands]]. The film's title, the Arabic word "[[fitna (word)|fitna]]", means  either "disagreement and division among people" or a "test of faith in times of trial".&lt;ref name="hatred"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=137624|title=Hold your breath: ‘Fitna' spreading seeds of hatred|date=29 March 2008|accessdate=1 April 2008|work=[[Today's Zaman]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402234115/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=137624|archivedate=2 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilders described the film as "a call to shake off the creeping tyranny of [[Islamization|Islamisation]]".&lt;ref name="foxiranwarn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324406,00.html|title=Iran Warns Netherlands Not to Air Controversial 'Anti-Muslim' Film|publisher=Fox News|first=Michael|last=Park|date=21 January 2008|accessdate=8 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polling by [[Maurice de Hond]] published in March 2009 indicated that the PVV was the most popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted that the party would take 21 per cent of the national vote, giving it 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If the polling results were to be replicated at a genuine election, Wilders would be a major power broker and could become Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/news/zijlijn/6235703/Geert-Wilders-Freedom-Party-rises-to-32-seats |title=Geert Wilders' Freedom Party rises to 32 seats |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2009 |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402002907/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/news/zijlijn/6235703/Geert-Wilders-Freedom-Party-rises-to-32-seats |archivedate=2 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/4933687/Geert-Wilders-leads-Dutch-polls.html|title=Geert Wilders leads Dutch polls |first=Bruno|last=Waterfield|date=3 March 2009|accessdate=4 April 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nisnews.nl/public/030309_1.htm|title=Wilders Now a Celebrity in US and Prime Minister in Poll|publisher=NIS News Bulletin|date=3 March 2009|accessdate=4 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722014951/http://www.nisnews.nl/public/030309_1.htm|archivedate=22 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, De Hond's results were not uncontroversial, as they were based on a panel of people who have signed up for the election poll on the Internet and thus were not a [[random sample]]. According to Joop van Holsteyn, professor of election research, therefore, De Hond's polls were not [[Face validity|representative]] of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/opinie/article2168483.ece/De_peiling_van_Maurice_de_Hond_deugt_niet|title=De peiling van Maurice de Hond deugt niet; De waarde van een peiling staat of valt met een representatieve steekproef|publisher=NRC Handelsblad|author=Joop van Holsteyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Dutch polls (Politieke Barometer and TNS NIPO) have shown contrasting results, with the PVV often getting less support, though still remaining very popular.

On 15 May 2009, the PVV asked Balkenende to support the foundation of a [[Greater Netherlands]] actively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pvv.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1975&amp;Itemid=1|title=Partij Voor de Vrijheid|work=pvv.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=January 2012}}

By February 2010, the PVV had once more become the most popular party, according to a poll by Maurice de Hond which said it would win 27–32 parliameary seats in the next election, up two from the previous poll in early January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/35028/dutch_party_for_freedom_recovers_top_rank/ |title=Dutch Party for Freedom Recovers Top Rank |publisher=Angus-reid.com |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://digitalehofstad.wordpress.com/2010/01/31/2e-kamerverkiezingen-2010-%E2%80%93-peilingen-31-01-2010-maurice-de-hond-pvv-de-grootste/ |title=2e Kamerverkiezingen 2010 – Peilingen 31.01.2010 Maurice de Hond PVV de Grootste |publisher=Digitalehofstad.wordpress.com |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2010, elections for the local councils were held in the municipalities of the Netherlands. The PVV only contested these in [[The Hague]] and [[Almere]], because of a shortage of good candidates. MP Raymond de Roon headed the campaign in his home town of Almere. Fellow MP Sietse Fritsma was appointed head of the local election campaign in The Hague. Both men would continue to serve as MPs as well as local councillors after their election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2009/12/pvv_picks_second_mp_for_local.php |title=PVV picks second MP for local elections |publisher=Dutchnews.nl |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PVV made big gains, suggesting that the party and Wilders might dominate the political scene in the run-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled on 9 June 2010. The PVV won in Almere and came second to the Labour Party in The Hague. In Almere, the PVV won 21 percent of the vote to Labour's 18 percent, preliminary results showed. In The Hague, the PVV had 8 seats – second to Labour with 10 seats. The local elections were the first test of public opinion since the collapse of the 4th Balkenende cabinet in February 2010. The municipal elections were overshadowed by the fall of the cabinet and the forthcoming parliamentary elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/Features/article2497139.ece/Local_elections_overshadowed_by_national_politics |title=Local elections overshadowed by national politics |publisher=Nrc.nl |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March 2010, Wilders announced he would take a seat on The Hague city council, after it became clear that he had won 13,000 preference votes. Earlier he had said he would not do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/03/wilders_to_take_council_seat_i.php |title=Wilders to take council seat in the Hague |publisher=Dutchnews.nl |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-anti-Islam-MP-Wilders-wins-council-seat |title=Anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders has announced he will take up a seat on the local council of the city of The Hague |publisher=Rnw.nl |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week after these local elections, the PVV called for an inquiry into the elections in The Hague, since a YouTube clip allegedly showed irregularities, including more than one person entering polling booths at the same time and a voter not putting the ballot paper into the box. These calls were rejected. The Hague council said the municipal elections had gone well and that any complaint should anyway have been lodged immediately after the results were announced. In [[Rotterdam]], a full recount was held after a protest by [[Livable Rotterdam|Leefbaar Rotterdam]], a local party with a programme broadly similar to that of the PVV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/calls-local-poll-recount-hague |title=Calls for local poll recount in The Hague |publisher=Rnw.nl |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/rotterdam-investigate-proxy-voting |title=Rotterdam to investigate proxy voting |publisher=Rnw.nl |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2010, the PVV gave up trying to form a governing coalition in Almere. In a press release, the party said most of the other parties had refused to give ground to PVV demands on what it describes as ''"essential issues"''. These include what the party calls ‘city commandos’: street patrols to keep order in the face of inadequate proper law enforcement. Other obstacles were the PVV's demands for reduced taxes for Almere residents and its fight against what the party sees as ''"the increasing influence of Islam in Dutch society"''. The PVV complained that it was forced to stay in the opposition through the manoeuvring of the political elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/dutch-rss-news/wilders-pvv-party-kept-in-almere-opposition_31769.html |title=Wilders' PVV party 'kept in Almere opposition' |publisher=Expatica.com |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parliamentary elections of 9 June 2010, the PVV went from 9 to 24 seats (of 150), winning over 15% of the votes, making the PVV the third largest party in parliament.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

By July 2010, the PVV again became the biggest party in the polls after the [[Dutch general election, 2010|parliamentary elections]], following difficulties in forming a new coalition and the PVV technically being excluded from the coalition talks because the CDA showed reluctance to cooperate with the PVV. According to the polls, the PVV would get 35 seats in a new election, which is a record high number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/politiek/2295043/pvv-historisch-hoog-in-peiling.html |title=PVV historisch hoog in peiling |publisher=www.nu.nl |date=18 July 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, during the difficult cabinet formation following the elections, the PVV emerged as a prominent player in a proposal for a new minority government in the Netherlands. While the party would not gain a ministerial appointment, the PVV would tolerate a centre-right minority government coalition: a proposed deal that would make the party one of the most influential forces. Led by [[Ivo Opstelten]], a former mayor of Rotterdam who was appointed mediator for the next stage of negotiations, the forming of a government of VVD and [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) with support of the PVV was negotiated; the resulting coalition agreement "included elements it pushed for, such as a [[Islamic dress in Europe#Netherlands|burqa ban]]," though the ban was never put in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Dutch government collapses after far right pulls plug| url= http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/23/world/europe/netherlands-politics/ |date= 23 April 2012| publisher= CNN| quote= The Party for Freedom did not get control of any government ministries, but the coalition agreement included elements it pushed for, such as a burqa ban.

With this deal the Netherlands would follow the "Danish model", since in Denmark the anti-immigration [[Danish People's Party]] also stayed out of government but supported a minority center-right [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal]]-[[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Castle |first=Stephen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/world/europe/06dutch.html |title=Outspoken Dutch Politician Makes Inroads |location=Netherlands |publisher= The New York Times |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very fact of the participation of the PVV in these coalition negotiations has caused fierce discussions in political circles{{which|date=December 2017}} and was considered{{by whom|date=December 2017}} very unlikely until recently.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After the elections, CDA parliamentary fraction president Maxime Verhagen first had stated that as a matter of principle he refused to negotiate with VVD and PVV about a centre-right government, saying that the PVV represented views that could not be reconciled with Dutch law. These objections on principle disappeared in five weeks and Verhagen turned out to be willing to negotiate over a cabinet whose fate would (also) lie in the hands of Wilders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/opinie/commentaar/article3153262.ece/Vooral_het_CDA_heeft_niets_te_zoeken_in_zo_rsquo_n__rsquo_bijzonder_rsquo__kabinet_.html |title=Vooral het CDA heeft niets te zoeken in zo’n ’bijzonder’ kabinet |publisher=Trouw.nl |language=Dutch| accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It believes that the [[Judeo-Christian]] and [[humanism|humanist]] traditions should be taken as the dominant culture in the Netherlands, and that immigrants should adapt accordingly. The party wants a halt to immigration especially from non-Western countries. It is hostile towards the EU, is against future [[Enlargement of the European Union|EU enlargement]] to Muslim-majority countries like Turkey and opposes a dominant presence of Islam in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pvv-europa.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410003337/http://pvv-europa.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 April 2009|title=Standpunten|language=Dutch|work=Voor Nederland in Europa|publisher=Party for Freedom|date=1 April 2009|accessdate=7 April 2009|df=dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the party has called for a banning the [[Quran]], and shutting down all mosques in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=politico&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch party wants to outlaw mosques, Islamic schools, Koran|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-dutch-politician-backs-mosques-koran-ban-islamic-schools/|publisher=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch Far-right Leader Seeks Ban on Quran, Mosques|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/netherlands-wilders-mosque-quran-ban/3482009.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Netherlands' most popular party wants to ban all mosques|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/netherlands-pvv-leader-geert-wilders-koran-islam-mosque-ban-holland-dutch-pm-favourite-a7214356.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is also opposed to [[dual citizenship]] (see below).

The study claims that the PVV holds [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] ideas, but not antisemitic ideas – the PVV describes its culture as [[Judeo-Christian|Jewish-Christian]] humanistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Hans Moors|author2=Lenke Balogh|author3=Jaap van Donselaar|author4=Bob de Graaff|title=Polarisatie en radicalising in Nederland.

They described the PVV as the "new radical right", a party with a national democratic ideology but without extreme right-wing roots. In particular, the report stated that the party's pro-Israel stance showed that it was not [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]]. It tends however towards a national democratic ideology. Wilders called the report "scandalous"—in particular the link between defending the national interest and the radical right.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

An alleged earlier version of the report, leaked to the Dutch daily newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' in November 2009, said that Wilders' party is an extreme right-wing grouping and a threat to social cohesion and democracy. The paper claimed at the time the researchers were under pressure to water down the conclusions because of their political sensitivity.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The Dutch [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] [[Guusje ter Horst]], (2007–2010), [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour (PvdA)]], who commissioned the research, denied exerting any interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/01/wilders_party_is_new_radical_r.php |title=Wilders' party is 'new radical right' |publisher=Dutchnews.nl |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/putting-geert-wilders-political-map |title=Putting Geert Wilders on the political map |publisher=Rnw.nl |accessdate=18 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529054622/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/putting-geert-wilders-political-map |archivedate=29 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Wilders accused her of "playing a dirty game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extra.volkskrant.nl/opinie/artikel/show/id/5059/WC-eend_adviseert_Guusje_ter_Horst |title=WC-eend adviseert Guusje ter Horst |publisher=Extra.volkskrant.nl |accessdate=18 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202133613/http://extra.volkskrant.nl/opinie/artikel/show/id/5059/WC-eend_adviseert_Guusje_ter_Horst |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Politiek/257065/Wilders-Minister-Ter-Horst-speelt-vuil-spelletje.htm |title=Wilders: Minister Ter Horst speelt vuil spelletje |publisher=Elsevier.nl |date=30 January 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152439/http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Politiek/257065/Wilders-Minister-Ter-Horst-speelt-vuil-spelletje.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators and international scholarly publications have argued that the party is far-right; for example, the ex-prime minister [[Dries van Agt|Van Agt]] regards the party as ultra-right-wing, and [[Bert de Vries]] (CDA) draws comparisons with the small [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Hans Moors|author2=Lenke Balogh|author3=Jaap van Donselaar|author4=Bob de Graaff|title=Polarisatie en radicalisering in Nederland.

==Positions==

===Dual nationality===
In February 2007, PVV parliamentarian Fritsma introduced a motion that would have prohibited any parliamentarian or executive branch politician from having [[dual citizenship]]. The PVV claimed that dual nationals have unclear loyalty. The motion would have made it difficult, if not impossible for [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour]] MPs [[Ahmed Aboutaleb]] and [[Nebahat Albayrak]] to become members of the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]]. The motion had to be withdrawn, however, after objection from the [[List of Speakers of the House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Speaker]] of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], Gerdi Verbeet (Labour Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MPs unimpressed with motion from PVV|url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/mps-unimpressed-with-motion-from-pvv-36615.html|publisher=Expatica|date=16 February 2007|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maastricht University]] law professor [[:nl:Twan Tak|Twan Tak]] has commented on the risk in executive branch officials having dual citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Smoren discussie dubbel paspoort schandalig'|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/10112390/Nieuws/Politiek/Smoren-discussie-dubbel-paspoort-schandalig.htm|language=Dutch|publisher=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]]|date=15 February 2007|accessdate=4 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152348/http://www.elsevier.nl/web/10112390/Nieuws/Politiek/Smoren-discussie-dubbel-paspoort-schandalig.htm|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] as reviewed in 2010 ECtHR jurisprudence has reaffirmed that form of discrimination is a violation of a human right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-98428|title=HUDOC Search Page|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007 the PVV planned to call for a vote of no confidence against junior ministers Aboutaleb and Albayrak when the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet|new cabinet]] had its first meeting with the House of Representatives, claiming that their respectively Moroccan and Turkish passports put their loyalties into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch politician doubts Muslim ministers' loyalty|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL242937120070224|agency=Reuters  |date=24 February 2007|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the motion was only supported by the PVV itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opposition criticises cabinet in debate|url=http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=37138|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103132/http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=37138|archivedate=29 September 2007|publisher=Expatica|date=1 March 2007|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of dual nationality, however, was not over yet. On 2 March 2007, [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] reported that Labour Party MP [[Khadija Arib]], who had been sworn into parliament the day before, was sitting on a commission appointed by the [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|king of Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch MP to serve as advisor to Moroccan king|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/dut070302mc|publisher=[[Radio Netherlands]]|date=2 March 2007|author=el Ayoubi, Mohammed|author2=den Boer, Nicolien|accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PVV said that this commission work endangers Arib's loyalty to the Netherlands, and that she should choose between being a member of the Dutch parliament or the Moroccan commission. Geert Wilders said that Arib's remark on national television that her loyalty lay neither with the Netherlands nor Morocco was shameful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kamer akkoord met Marokkaans advieswerk Arib|language=Dutch|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/10115100/Nieuws/Politiek/Kamer-akkoord-met-Marokkaans-advieswerk-Arib.htm|publisher=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]]|date=8 March 2007|accessdate=5 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152355/http://www.elsevier.nl/web/10115100/Nieuws/Politiek/Kamer-akkoord-met-Marokkaans-advieswerk-Arib.htm|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liberal VVD party similarly remarked that her "double orientation would hurt Dutch integration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kamp: Nevenfunctie Arib schaadt integratie|language=Dutch|url=http://www.refdag.nl/artikel/1294450/Kamp:+Nevenfunctie+Arib+schaadt+integratie.html|publisher=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]]|work=[[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]]|date=8 March 2007|accessdate=5 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526215256/http://www.refdag.nl/artikel/1294450/Kamp:+Nevenfunctie+Arib+schaadt+integratie.html|archivedate=26 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other parties were appalled by the PVV and VVD's comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lange dag in de Kamer met veel hatelijkheden|language=Dutch|url=http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article1777410.ece/Lange_dag_in_de_Kamer_met_veel_hatelijkheden|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905102032/http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article1777410.ece/Lange_dag_in_de_Kamer_met_veel_hatelijkheden|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 September 2012|publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|first=Derk|last=Stokmans|date=9 March 2007|accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps in the light of the ''Moldova'' ruling, in the first Rutte government in 2010 chaired by the VVD leader, supported by the PVV, [[Marlies Veldhuijzen van Zanten]] became the new State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sport, having both Dutch and [[Sweden|Swedish]] nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Politiek/278676/Nieuwe-CDAstaatssecretaris-heeft-dubbele-nationaliteit.htm |title=Nieuwe CDA-staatssecretaris heeft dubbele nationaliteit |publisher=Elsevier.nl |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
The party fielded a controversial motion in the 2007 ''[[prinsjesdag|general deliberations]]'' on the immigration budget, calling for a stop to immigration from Muslim countries. The [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] at first declined to bring the motion forward for debate. Justice Minister [[Ernst Hirsch Ballin]] said it was in violation of the Dutch constitution and international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister: Wilders' moslimmotie is onmogelijk|language=Dutch|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/10147551/Nieuws/Politiek/Minister-Wilders-moslimmotie-is-onmogelijk.htm|publisher=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]]|date=22 November 2007|accessdate=5 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152402/http://www.elsevier.nl/web/10147551/Nieuws/Politiek/Minister-Wilders-moslimmotie-is-onmogelijk.htm|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another motion by the PVV, against police officers wearing [[veil]]s, did gain a parliamentary majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Agente met hoofddoek absoluut onwenselijk'|language=Dutch|url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/1342274/agente-met-hoofddoek-absoluut-onwenselijk.html|publisher=[[NU.nl]]|date=4 December 2007|accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the PVV party launched a website named ''Reporting Centre on Central and East Europeans'' to receive complaints about Central and East European immigrants in the Netherlands. 'Do you have problems with people from Central and Eastern Europe? Have you lost your job to a Pole, a Bulgarian, a Romanian or another East European? We want to know,' the website states. It displays newspaper headlines such as 'Wouldn't it be better if you went back home?' and 'East Europeans, increasingly criminal'. The European Commission has condemned the website, and EU Justice Commissioner [[Viviane Reding]] declared, "We call on all citizens of the Netherlands not to join in this intolerance. Citizens should instead clearly state on the PVV's website that Europe is a place of freedom."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/02/problems_with_poles_report_the.php Problems with Poles?

''Reuters.'' 10 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The website caused a lot of controversy within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sofiaecho.com/2012/02/16/1767592_controversy-continues-over-wilders-anti-eastern-european-website Sofiaecho.com 16 February 2012]". {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217125414/http://www.sofiaecho.com/2012/02/16/1767592_controversy-continues-over-wilders-anti-eastern-european-website |date=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing political parties===
PVV declared that, since it is against state subsidies, it rejects its own party to be financially supported by the government and believes the "tax payer should not pay for political parties they don't support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/video/407199-zomergesprek-geert-wilders-pvv.html |title=Zomergesprek: Geert Wilders (PVV) - NOS Nieuws |publisher=Nos.nl |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Dutch Parliament discussed tightening the financial rules for political parties, forcing them to become more transparent. The PVV indicated that it would use any means available not to disclose its donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/3587/POLITIEK-BINNENLAND/article/detail/3139689/2012/01/26/PVV-zoekt-mazen-in-wet-over-giften.dhtml |title=PVV zal alles doen om bekendmaking donateurs te vermijden - POLITIEK BINNENLAND - PAROOL |publisher=Parool.nl |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name and symbols ==
The name 'Party for Freedom' (''Partij voor de Vrijheid'') is a reference to the [[Freedom Party (Netherlands)|Freedom Party]] (''Partij van de Vrijheid''), a Dutch political party founded in 1946, shortly after [[World War II]]. In 1948, the Freedom Party went on as the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (''Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie''), which is the party Wilders split from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Groep Wilders wordt Partij voor de Vrijheid|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/politiek/artikel/asp/artnr/88062/index.html|language=Dutch|publisher=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]]|date=23 February 2006|accessdate=5 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200935/http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/politiek/artikel/asp/artnr/88062/index.html|archivedate=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party logo consists of the party name and a [[gull]] in red, white, and blue, which are the colors of the [[Flag of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]].&lt;ref name="parlementparty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sargasso"&gt;Willem Visser, "[http://sargasso.nl/kleur-en-symboliek-nederlandse-politiek/ Kleur en symboliek in de Nederlandse politiek]" (in Dutch), ''Sargasso.nl'', 2017.

Retrieved 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The gull had also been used as a symbol by the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] on propaganda posters and for their youth wing, but Wilders claimed it was not inspired by Nazi usage.&lt;ref name="historischnieuwsblad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/20624246/__Wilders_woedend_na_NSB-vergelijking__.html Wilders woedend over vergelijking met NSB]" (in Dutch), ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', 2008.

== Organisation ==
In order to register for elections in the Netherlands, a political party needs to be an [[Voluntary association|association]] ({{Lang-nl|vereniging}}), which can be founded by two or more members.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/democratie/vraag-en-antwoord/hoe-richt-ik-een-politieke-partij-op Hoe richt ik een politieke partij op?]" (in Dutch), ''[[Government of the Netherlands]]''. Retrieved 4 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.notaris.nl/een-vereniging-oprichten Hoe richt ik een vereniging op?]" (in Dutch), ''Notaris.nl''. Retrieved 4 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vereniging Groep Wilders (Association Group Wilders) was founded by the [[natural person]] Geert Wilders and Stichting Groep Wilders ([[Foundation (nonprofit)|Foundation]] Group Wilders), of which Wilders is the only board member.&lt;ref name="montesquieu"&gt;Koen Vossen, "[http://www.montesquieu-instituut.nl/id/vj5eflkxm6yg/een_unieke_partij_de_organisatie_van_de Een unieke partij.

Retrieved 4 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The association was later renamed to Partij voor de Vrijheid (Party for Freedom).&lt;ref name="parlementparty"/&gt; After the creation of the association, Wilders disabled new member registration, resulting in his remaining the sole member of the party.&lt;ref name="parlementparty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="montesquieu"/&gt; The party does not organise public [[party conference]]s and does not have local departments, a [[youth wing]], or a [[Think tank|research institute]].&lt;ref name="parlementparty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="montesquieu"/&gt;

==Financing==
In the Netherlands, a political party needs to have 1,000 members or more to be eligible for government funding, a requirement which the Party for Freedom does not meet with Wilders being the only member.&lt;ref name="parlementparty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="financinglaw"&gt;"[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0033004/2016-01-01 Wet financiering politieke partijen]" (in Dutch), ''[[Government of the Netherlands]]'', 2016. Retrieved 9 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On several instances the PVV applied for and received European Union funding.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/09/pvv_wrongly_claims_13000_from.php PVV wrongly claims €13,000 from Brussels for euro report: tv show]", ''DutchNews.nl'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Financially, the party has been largely relying on donations. The party has not disclosed any of its finances until 2013. According to [[Hero Brinkman]], a former MP for the party, the PVV received most of its finances from certain foreign (American) lobby-groups.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nu.nl/politiek/2768411/lobbykantoren-vs-steunen-pvv.html 'Lobbykantoren VS steunen PVV']" (in Dutch), ''[[NU.nl]]'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Reuters]], [[Daniel Pipes|Daniel Pipes']] [[Middle East Forum]] paid for the trials and security of Geert Wilders and [[David Horowitz]] paid Wilders "a good fee" for two speeches given in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Deutsch &amp; Mark Hosenball, "[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-dutch-wilders-us-idUSBRE8890Q820120910 Exclusive: U.S. groups helped fund Dutch anti-Islam politician Wilders]", ''[[Reuters]]'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://vorige.nrc.nl/binnenland/article2544752.ece/Partners_Wilders_in_VS_verdienen_aan_acties_tegen_moslimextremisme Partners Wilders in VS verdienen aan acties tegen moslimextremisme]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012085802/http://vorige.nrc.nl/binnenland/article2544752.ece/Partners_Wilders_in_VS_verdienen_aan_acties_tegen_moslimextremisme |date=12 October 2011 }} (in Dutch), ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">The '''Patient Information Advisory Group''' (PIAG) was established in the [[United Kingdom]] under section 61&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/10015--g.htm#61 section 61 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Health and Social Care Act 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010015.htm Health and Social Care Act 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Patient Information Advisory Group (Establishment) Regulations 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2001/20012836.htm Statutory Instrument 2001 No. 2836: Patient Information Advisory Group (Establishment) Regulations 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; to provide advice on issues of national significance involving the use of patient information and to oversee arrangements created under section 60&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/10015--g.htm#60 Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Act.  Its membership was drawn from patient groups, health care professionals and regulatory bodies.  Following the implementation of the Health and Social Care Act 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/pdf/ukpga_20080014_en.pdf Health and Social Care Act 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; PIAG was abolished and its responsibilities transferred to a new body, the [[National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care]], with effect from January 2009.

==Terms of reference==

The terms of reference for the PIAG were to:

#Advise the [[Secretary of State for Health|Secretary of State]] on use of powers provided by section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, and in particular on:
#*applications and proposals for use of these powers;
#*draft regulations made under s60(1) of the Act;
#*proposals to vary or revoke such regulations following the [[Secretary of State for Health|Secretary of State]]'s required annual review of existing provisions.
#Advise the [[Secretary of State for Health|Secretary of State]] on key issues, particularly those of national significance, relating to the processing of patient information.

==Legal framework==

Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 (subsequently Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006) provided a power to ensure that patient identifiable information needed to support essential [[National Health Service|NHS]] activity could be used without the consent of patients. The power could only be used to support medical purposes that were in the interests of patients or the wider public, where consent was not a [[wikt:practicable|practicable]] alternative and where [[anonymised]] information would not suffice. It was intended largely as a transitional measure whilst consent or anonymisation procedures were developed, and this was reinforced by the need to review each use of the power annually.

This was developed to cover situations where [[informed consent]] could not be obtained, for example research projects of such a size as to make contacting each patient impracticable, where the public good derived from the research was agreed to outweigh the individual [[right to privacy]].

The '''praetorian prefect''' ({{lang-la|praefectus praetorio}}, {{lang-el|{{lang|grc|ἔπαρχος/ὕπαρχος τῶν πραιτωρίων}}}}) was a high office in the [[Roman Empire]]. Originating as the commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], the office gradually acquired extensive legal and administrative functions, with its holders becoming the Emperor's chief aides. Under [[Constantine I]], the office was much reduced in power and transformed into a purely civilian administrative post, while under his successors, territorially-defined [[praetorian prefecture]]s emerged as the highest-level administrative division of the Empire. The prefects again functioned as the chief ministers of the state, with many laws addressed to them by name. In this role, praetorian prefects continued to be appointed by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (and the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]) until the reign of [[Heraclius]] in the 7th century AD, when wide-ranging reforms reduced its power and converted it to a mere overseer of provincial administration. The last traces of the prefecture disappeared in the [[Byzantine Empire]] by the 840s.

The term ''praefectus praetorio'' was often abbreviated in inscriptions as 'PR PR' or 'PPO'.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley and Roy Adkins. ''Handbook to life in Ancient Rome.''[[Oxford University Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|0-19-512332-8}}. page 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. C. J. Miller. ''Abbreviations in Latin''.Ares Publishers, inc., 1998. {{ISBN|0-89005-568-8}}. Pages xxcii and xcvi, ''sub vocibus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Commander of the Praetorian Guard ===
Under the empire the praetorians or imperial guards were commanded by one, two, or even three praefects (praefecti praetorio), who were chosen by the emperor from among the [[equites]] and held office at his pleasure. From the time of [[Alexander Severus]] the post was open to senators also, and if an equestrian was appointed he was at the same time raised to the senate. Down to the time of Constantine, who deprived the office of its military character, the prefecture of the guards was regularly held by tried soldiers, often by men who had fought their way up from the ranks. In course of time the command seems to have been enlarged so as to include all the troops in Italy except the corps commanded by the city praefect (''cohortes urbanae'').&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Praefect |volume=22 |pages=241–242 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special position of the praetorians made them a power in their own right in the Roman state, and their [[prefect]], the ''praefectus praetorio'', soon became one of the more powerful men in this society. The emperors tried to flatter and control the praetorians, but they staged many [[coup d'état|coups d'état]] and contributed to a rapid rate of turnover in the imperial succession. The praetorians thus came to destabilize the Roman state, contrary to their purpose. The praetorian prefect became a major administrative figure in the later empire, when the post combined in one individual the duties of an imperial chief of staff with direct command over the guard also. [[Diocletian]] greatly reduced the power of these prefects as part of his sweeping reform of the empire's administrative and military structures.

[[File:Notitia dignitatum - insignia praefecti praetorio per illyricum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The insignia of the praetorian prefect of Illyricum, as depicted in the [[Notitia Dignitatum]]: the ivory inkwell and pen case (''theca''), the codicil of appointment to the office on a blue cloth-covered table, and the state carriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Ruling the later Roman Empire | first=Christopher |last=Kelly | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-674-01564-7 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=HhXx67fX7hoC | page = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In addition to his military functions, the praetorian prefect came to acquire jurisdiction over criminal affairs, which he exercised not as the delegate but as the representative of the emperor. By the time of Diocletian he had become a kind of grand-vizier as the emperor's vice-regent and 'prime minister.' Constantine removed active military command in 312. The prefect remained as chief quarter-master general responsible for the logistical supply of the army. The prefect was the chief financial officer whose office drew up the global imperial budget. His office drew up the state liturgical obligations laid on the richer inhabitants of the Empire. He ceased to be head of administration which had to be shared with the master of the offices attached to the palace. Constantine in 331 confirmed that from the sentence of the praetorian praefect there should be no appeal. A similar jurisdiction in civil cases was acquired by him not later than the time of [[Septimius Severus]]. Hence a knowledge of law became a qualification for the post, which under [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Commodus]], but especially from the time of Severus, was held by the first jurists of the age, (e.g. [[Papinian]], [[Ulpian]], [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]) and, under [[Justinian I|Justinianus]], [[John the Cappadocian]], while the military qualification fell more and more into the background.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[tetrarchy]] reform of [[Diocletian]] (c. 296) multiplied the office: there was a praetorian prefect as chief of staff (military and administrative)—rather than commander of the guard—for each of the two Augusti, but not for the two Caesars. Each praetorian prefect oversaw one of the four quarters created by Diocletian, which became regional [[praetorian prefecture]]s for the young sons of Constantine ca 330 A.D. From 395 there two imperial courts, at [[Rome]] (later [[Ravenna]]) and [[Constantinople]], but the four prefectures remained as the highest level of administrative division, in charge of several  [[Roman diocese|diocese]]s (groups of [[Roman province]]s), each of which was headed by a [[Vicarius]].
 
Under [[Constantine I]], the institution of the [[magister militum]] deprived the praetorian prefecture altogether of its military character but left it the highest civil office of the empire.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

=== Germanic era ===
The office was among the many maintained after the [[Western Roman Empire]] had succumbed to the Germanic invasion in Italy, notably at the royal court of the [[Ostrogothic]] king [[Theoderic the Great]], who as a nominal subject of Constantinople retained the Roman-era administration intact.

== List of known prefects of the Praetorian Guard ==
The following is a list of all known prefects of the Praetorian Guard, from the establishment of the post in 2 BC by Augustus until the abolishment of the Guard in 314. The list is presumed to be incomplete due to the lack of sources documenting the exact number of persons who held the post, what their names were and what the length of their tenure was. Likewise, the Praetorians were sometimes commanded by a single prefect, as was the case with for example [[Sejanus]] or [[Sextus Afranius Burrus|Burrus]], but more often, the emperor appointed two commanders, who shared joint leadership. Overlapping terms on the list indicate dual command.

{{one source|date=November 2017}}
On Friday 31 July 1925 the [[Conservative Government 1924–1929|British government]] agreed to the demands of the [[Miners Federation of Great Britain]] to provide a subsidy to the mining industry to maintain miners' wages.   The ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' called this day '''Red Friday'''; a union defeat four years earlier had been called "[[Black Friday (1921)|Black Friday]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw |1975 |pp= 122–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]] followed nine months later.

==Background==
There had been a long history of labour unrest in the [[Great Britain|British]] [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|coal mining]] industry.  A triple alliance had been formed in 1914 of the Miners Federation, the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]], for mutual support in trade disputes, but had been unable to undertake united action due to [[World War I]].  In 1916, at the height of [[World War I]], [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George's]] [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916–1922)|government]] had taken control of the industry, but with [[inflation]] the purchasing power of miners' wages had fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw |1975 |pp= 53–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war government control was relaxed, and the triple alliance was revived.  In 1919, as a conciliatory measure, the government appointed a [[royal commission]] to investigate the industry under [[John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey|Mr Justice Sankey]], which recommended the nationalisation of mining royalties but did not explain how this would be achieved. The government, citing the lack of unanimity of the commission, declined to implement its report.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw |1975 |pp= 59–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government responded to a strike by the Yorkshire miners in July 1919 by planning measures to maintain the mines during the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw |1975 |pp= 65–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1921 the miners went on strike, seeking equalisation of wages between coalfields, but the unity of the triple alliance collapsed, leaving the miners to fight on until hunger drove them back to work on Black Friday, leaving the employers (who had come together in the Mining Association) in control.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw|1975|pp=22–3 82–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a small concession to the miners of a temporary subsidy of £10M, but their average pay fell by 30% during 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw |1975 |pp= 88–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red Friday==
In April 1925 Britain returned to the [[gold standard]].  This was effectively a revaluation of sterling, and led to deflation in the British economy over the following years.  This made it difficult for the coal owners to export coal profitably in the face of resurgent German exports.  On 30 June the Mining Association gave notice to terminate the 1924 wage agreement, after which wages would be cut (with no national minimum) and hours increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw |1975 |pp= 117–8}}  &lt;/ref&gt;   Negotiations took place, but it was soon apparent that, without a subsidy, a strike or lock-out was inevitable.  The miners had secured an agreement from the railwaymen that they would not handle coal.  This was likely to result in the railway companies sacking those who refused, leading to a railway strike.  

The government reviewed emergency arrangements and Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]] concluded, "We were not ready".  In consequence the government backed down, and negotiated a subsidy for the coal industry to last nine months to enable the employers to maintain wages and conditions.  This cost £23M.  It seems that an emergency plan existed on paper, but would require the recruitment of many volunteers to implement it, and the staff did not exist.

==Reaction==
The subsidy could only be a temporary measure.  The government immediately put in hand measures to be implemented in the event of a general strike, which seemed inevitable when the subsidy ended.

A "'''Red Scare'''" is promotion of widespread fear by a society or state about a potential rise of [[communism]], [[anarchism]], or [[radical leftism]]. The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States with this name. The [[First Red Scare]], which occurred immediately after [[World War I]], revolved around a perceived threat from the [[Labor history of the United States|American labor movement]], [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchist]] [[revolution]] and [[political radicalism]]. The [[McCarthyism|Second Red Scare]], which occurred immediately after [[World War II]], was preoccupied with national or foreign communists [[espionage|infiltrating]] or [[subversion|subverting]] U.S. society or the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].

==First Red Scare (1917–1920)==
{{main|First Red Scare}}
[[File:1919 Political Cartoon (14759129762) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Political cartoon from 1919 depicting the Russian revolution's impact on the Paris peace talks]]
The first Red Scare began following the [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the intensely patriotic years of World War I as anarchist and left-wing social agitation aggravated national, social, and political tensions. Political scientist, and former member of the Communist Party [[Murray Levin|Murray B. Levin]] wrote that the Red Scare was "a nationwide anti-radical hysteria provoked by a mounting fear and anxiety that a Bolshevik revolution in America was imminent—a revolution that would change Church, home, marriage, civility, and the American way of Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levin | first = Murray B.| title = Political Hysteria in America: The Democratic Capacity for Repression | publisher = Basic Books | year = 1971 | page = 29 | isbn = 0-465-05898-1|oclc=257349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnKFAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers exacerbated those political fears into anti-foreign sentiment because varieties of radical [[anarchism]] were becoming popular as possible solutions to poverty, often by recent European immigrants (cf. [[hyphenated-Americans]]). When the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) backed several [[Strike action|labor strike]]s in 1916 and 1917, the press portrayed them as "radical threats to American society" inspired by "left-wing, foreign ''agents provocateurs''". Those on the side of the IWW claim that the press "misrepresented legitimate labor strikes" as "crimes against society", "conspiracies against the government", and "plots to establish communism".&lt;ref&gt;''Political Hysteria in America: The Democratic Capacity for Repression'' (1971), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents, on the other hand, saw these as an extension of the radical, anarchist foundations of the IWW, which contends that all workers should be united as a [[social class]] and that [[capitalism]] and the [[wage system]] should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/culture/official/preamble.shtml |title=Preamble to the IWW Constitution |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Come unto me, ye opprest.jpg|thumb|left|205px|A "European [[Anarchist]]" attempts to destroy the [[Statue of Liberty]] in this 1919 political cartoon.]]
[[File:Palmer Bombing.jpg|thumb|right|A bomb blast badly damaged the residence of Attorney General Mitchell Palmer in the spring of 1919.]]
In April 1919, authorities discovered a plot for mailing 36 bombs to prominent members of the U.S. political and economic [[The Establishment|establishment]]: [[J. P. Morgan Jr.]], [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]], and immigration officials. On June 2, 1919, in eight cities, [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|eight bombs simultaneously exploded]]. One target was the [[Washington, D.C.]], house of [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] Palmer, where the explosion killed the bomber, who evidence indicated was an [[Italian-American]] radical from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Afterwards, Palmer ordered the U.S. Justice Department to launch the [[Palmer Raids]] (1919–21).&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;

Yet, in 1918, before the bombings, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] had pressured the Congress to legislate the anti-anarchist [[Sedition Act of 1918]] to protect wartime morale by deporting putatively undesirable political people. Law professor [[David D. Cole]] reports that President Wilson's "federal government consistently targeted alien radicals, deporting them&amp;nbsp;... for their speech or associations, making little effort to distinguish terrorists from ideological [[dissident]]s."&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cole | first = David D. | authorlink = David D.

Initially, the press praised the raids; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "There is no time to waste on hairsplitting over [the] infringement of liberty", and ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the injuries inflicted upon the arrested were "souvenirs of the new attitude of aggressiveness which had been assumed by the Federal agents against Reds and suspected-Reds".&lt;ref&gt;

Defensively, Palmer then warned that a government-deposing left-wing [[revolution]] would begin on 1 May 1920 — [[International Workers Day|May Day]], the International Workers' Day. When it failed to happen, he was ridiculed and lost much credibility. Strengthening the legal criticism of Palmer was that fewer than 600 deportations were substantiated with evidence, out of the thousands of resident aliens arrested and deported.

==Second Red Scare (1947–57)==
{{main|McCarthyism}}
[[Image:Joseph McCarthy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[US Senate|Senator]] [[Joseph McCarthy]], namesake of [[McCarthyism]]]]
The second Red Scare occurred after [[World War II]] (1939–45), and was popularly known as "McCarthyism" after its most famous supporter, [[US Senate|Senator]] [[Joseph McCarthy]]. McCarthyism coincided with increased popular fear of communist [[espionage]] consequent to a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–49), the [[Chinese Civil War]], the confessions of spying for the Soviet Union given by several high-ranking U.S. government officials, and the [[Korean War]].

===Internal causes of communist fear===
The events of the late 1940s, early 1950s - the trial of [[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]] (1953), the trial of [[Whittaker Chambers#The Hiss case|Alger Hiss]], the [[Iron Curtain]] (1945–1991) around [[Eastern Europe]], and the [[Soviet Union]]'s first [[Nuclear testing|nuclear weapon test]] in 1949 ([[RDS-1]]) - surprised the American public, influencing popular opinion about U.S. National Security, that, in turn, connected to fear of the Soviet Union hydrogen-bombing the United States, and fear of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party of the United States of America]] (CPUSA).

In Canada, the 1946 [[Kellock–Taschereau Commission]] investigated espionage after top secret documents concerning [[RDX]], [[radar]] and other weapons were handed over to the Soviets by a domestic spy-ring.&lt;ref&gt;Canada. The report of the Royal Commission appointed under Order in Council P. C. 411 of February 5, 1946 to investigate the facts relating to and the circumstances surrounding the communication, by public officials and other persons in positions of trust, of secret and confidential information to agents of a foreign power, June 27, 1946. Ottawa: E. Cloutier, Printer to the King, 1946.{{verify source|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], former [[CPUSA]] members and NKVD spies, [[Elizabeth Bentley]] and [[Whittaker Chambers]], testified that Soviet [[espionage|spies]] and communist sympathizers had penetrated the U.S. government before, during and after World War II. Other U.S. citizen spies confessed to their acts of espionage in situations where the statute of limitations on prosecuting them had run out. In 1949, anti–communist fear, and fear of American traitors, was aggravated by the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] winning the [[Chinese Civil War]] against the Western-sponsored [[Kuomintang]], their founding of the [[People's Republic of China]], and later [[Korean war#Chinese intervention|Chinese intervention]] in the [[Korean War]] (1950–53) against U.S. ally [[South Korea]].

A few of the events during the Red Scare were also due to a power struggle between director of FBI [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Hoover had instigated and aided some of the investigations of members of the CIA with "leftist" history, like [[Cord Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKmockingbird.htm Mocking Bird] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619050903/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKmockingbird.htm |date=2006-06-19 }}, John Simkin, Spartacus Schoolnet&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict could also be traced back to the conflict between Hoover and [[William J. Donovan]], going back to the first Red Scare, but especially during World War II. Donovan ran the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] (CIA's predecessor). They had differing opinions on the nature of the alliance with the Soviet Union, conflicts over jurisdiction, conflicts of personality, the OSS hiring of communists and criminals as agents, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''[[Wedge: The Secret War between the FBI and CIA]]'', by Mark Riebling&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
{{See also|Smith Act trials of communist party leaders}}
By the 1930s, communism had become an attractive economic [[ideology]], particularly among labor leaders and intellectual elites. By 1939, the CPUSA had about 50,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnpoll |first=Bernard K.|year=1994 |title=A Documentary History of the Communist Party of the United States: Volume III Unite and Fight, 1934–1935|publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |pages=xv |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=99389227|isbn=978-0-313-28506-6 |oclc=27976811}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, soon after World War II began in Europe, the U.S. Congress legislated the [[Smith Act|Alien Registration Act]] (aka the '''Smith Act''', 18 USC §&amp;nbsp;2385) making it a crime to "knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise or teach the duty, necessity, desirability or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States or of any State by force or violence, or for anyone to organize any association which teaches, advises or encourages such an overthrow, or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association"—and required Federal registration of all [[alien (law)|foreign nationals]]. Although principally deployed against communists, the Smith Act was also used against [[right-wing]] political threats such as the [[German-American Bund]], and the perceived racial disloyalty of the [[Japanese-American]] population, (''cf.'' [[hyphenated-Americans]]).

In 1941, after [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Soviet Union, the CPUSA's official position became pro-war, opposing [[labor strike]]s in the weapons industry and supporting the U.S. war effort against the [[Axis Powers]]. With the slogan "Communism is Twentieth-Century Americanism", the chairman, [[Earl Browder]], advertised the CPUSA's integration to the political mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Countryman|first=Edward|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|chapter=Communism|editor1-last=Kazin|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-first=Rebecca|editor2-last=Edwards|editor3-first=Adam|editor3-last=Rothman|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-12971-1|oclc=320801248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hqpJEJp7cUC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=%22Communism+is+Twentieth-Century+Americanism%22+1941#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Communism%20is%20Twentieth-Century%20Americanism%22%201941&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 3, 2011|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] opposed U.S. participation in the war and supported labor strikes, even in the war-effort industry. For this reason, [[James P. Cannon]] and other SWP leaders were convicted per the Smith Act.

In March 1947, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9835]], creating the "Federal Employees Loyalty Program" establishing political-loyalty review boards who determined the "Americanism" of Federal Government employees, and recommended termination of those who had confessed to spying for the Soviet Union, as well as some suspected of being "Un-American". It also was the template for several state legislatures' loyalty acts, such as California's [[Levering Act]]. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC)]] and the committees of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] ([[U.S. Republican Party|R.]], [[Wisconsin|Wisc.]]) conducted character investigations of "American communists" (actual and alleged), and their roles in (real and imaginary) espionage, propaganda, and subversion favoring the Soviet Union—in the process revealing the extraordinary breadth of the Soviet spy network in infiltrating the federal government; the process also launched the successful political career of [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]],&lt;ref name="NYUhistory"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hiss Case in History |url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/history.html |work=The Hiss Case in Story |publisher=[[Harvard]], [[NYU]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPvH8ee3?url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/history.html |archivedate=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as that of Joseph McCarthy.

Senator McCarran introduced the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] of 1950 that was passed by the U.S. Congress and which modified a great deal of law to restrict civil liberties in the name of security. President Truman declared the act a "mockery of the Bill of Rights" and a "long step toward totalitarianism" because it represented a government restriction on the freedom of opinion. He vetoed the act but his veto was overridden by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lane|first=Frederick S.|title=American Privacy: The 400-year History of Our Most Contested Right|year=2009|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-8070-4441-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoD25PQk5y0C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=%22long+step+toward+totalitarianism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22long%20step%20toward%20totalitarianism%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 3, 2011|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the bill eventually was repealed.

The Second Red Scare profoundly altered the temper of American society. Its later characterizations may be seen as contributory to works of feared communist espionage, such as the film ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952), about parent's suspicions their son is a spy. Abundant accounts in narrative forms contained themes of the infiltration, subversion, invasion, and destruction of American society by un–American ''thought''. In [[science fiction]] movies like ''[[The Thing from Another World|The Thing]]'' (1951), tales of alien humanoid beings abounded. Even a baseball team, the [[Cincinnati Reds]], temporarily renamed themselves the "Cincinnati Redlegs" to avoid the money-losing and career-ruining connotations inherent in being ball-playing "Reds" (communists).

In 1995, the American government revealed details of the [[Venona Project]], which when combined with the opening of the [[USSR]] [[ComIntern]] archives, provided substantial validation of intelligence gathering, outright spying, and policy influencing, by Americans on behalf of the Soviet Union, from 1940 through 1980.&lt;ref name="NYUvenona"&gt;{{cite web |title=Venona and the Russian Files |work=The Hiss Case in Story |publisher=[[Harvard]], [[NYU]] |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/venona.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPw0sDhn?url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/venona.html |archivedate=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/commissions/secrecy/pdf/12hist1.pdf| format=PDF| title=A Brief Account of the American Experience| author=Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy| work=Report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy.

'''Religion and peacebuilding''' refers to the study of religion's role in the development of peace. Scholars generally accept that religion has been, at different points in history, both advantageous and [[religion and violence|ruinous to the promotion of peace]]&lt;ref&gt;John Siebert, "Religion and Violent Conflict: A Practitioner's Functional Approach," The Ploughshares Monitor, Vol 28, No.2 (Summer 2007),pp9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many approaches to explaining this variability.

Nathan C. Funk and Christina J. Woolner categorize these approaches into three models. The first is “peace through religion alone”. This proposes to attain world peace through devotion to a given religion. Opponents claim that advocates generally want to attain peace through their particular religion only and have little tolerance of other ideologies. 
The second model, a response to the first, is “peace without religion”. Critics claim that it is overly simplistic and fails to address other causes of conflict as well as the peace potential of religion. It is also said that this model excludes the many contributions of religious people in the development of peace. Another critique claims that both approaches require bringing everyone into their own ideology.

The third and final approach is known as “peace with religion”. This approach focuses on the importance of coexistence and interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan C. Funk and Christina J. Woolner, "Religion and Peace and COnflict Studies," in Critical Issues in Peace and Conflict Studies, ed. Thomas Matyok, Jessica Senehi, and Sean Byrne (Toronto: Lexington Books, 2011), pp 351-358.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerrie ter Haar suggests that religion is neither inherently good nor bad for peace, and that its influence is undeniable.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrie ter Haar, "Religion: Source of Conflict or Resource for Peace?" in Bridge or Barrier: Religion, Violence and Visions for Peace, ed. Gerrie ter Haar and James J. Busuttil (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2005), pp. 18-36&lt;/ref&gt; Peace with religion, then, emphasises promoting the common principles present in every major religion.

A major component of religion and peacebuilding is faith-based [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs). Douglas Johnston points out that faith-based NGOs offer two distinct advantages. The first is that since faith-based NGOs are very often locally based, they have immediate influence within that community. He argues that “it is important to promote indigenous ownership of conflict prevention and peacebuilding initiatives as early in the process as possible.” The second advantage Johnston presents is that faith-based NGOs carry [[moral authority]] that contributes to the receptivity of negotiations and policies for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Johnston, "Faith-Based Organizations: The Religious Dimension of Peacebuilding." in People Building Peace II: Successful Stories of Civil Society, ed Paul van Tongeren, et al (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner, 2005), pp. 209-218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism and peacebuilding==

===Hebrew Bible===

The Hebrew Bible contains many sources for religious peacebuilding. Some of which include:

*The [[Priestly Blessing]] ({{bibleverse||Numbers|6:24–26|HE}}) ends with: "May God lift up his face onto you and give you '''peace'''"
*{{bibleverse||Leviticus|26:6|HE}}: "And I shall place '''peace''' upon the land"
*{{bibleverse||Numbers|25:12|HE}}: "Behold I give him my covenant of '''peace'''"
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|57:19|HE}}: '''Peace, peace''' to the distant and the close"
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|11:5|HE}}: The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion.
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|34:15|HE}}: "Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it"
*{{bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|9:17-18|HE}}:" The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools. Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:6-9|HE}}:The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together;and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
* {{Bible verse||Isaiah|2:4|121}} &amp; {{Bible verse||Micah|4:3|121}} They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.

===Project Ploughshares===
{{Main|Project Ploughshares}}
[[Project Ploughshares]] is a Canadian non-government organization concerned with the prevention of war, the [[disarmament]] of weapons, and peacebuilding. Though it is an agency of the [[Canadian Council of Churches]] and is sponsored by the nine national churches of Canada, Project Ploughshares is run by and for people of a variety of different faith backgrounds. Project Ploughshares works with various NGOs operating abroad to develop research and complete analyses of government policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/faq#FAQ5|title=FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Project Ploughshares' work has included meeting with prime ministers to discuss nuclear disarmament, establishing and coordinating an agency for disarmament and security of the Horn in Africa, working with the UN and NATO on policy-making, and publishing research papers, one of which was endorsed by over 40 000 Canadians and had a serious influence over Canada's decision not to declare war on Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/accomplishments|title=Accomplishments|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Ploughshares takes its name from Isaiah 2:4 where it is written "God shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their [[swords into ploughshares]], and spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pax Christi===
{{Main|Pax Christi}}
[[Pax Christi]] is the "official international Catholic peace movement" as recognized by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Marie, [http://www.cmsm.org/forum/forum_summer08_psi.html “Pax Christi International”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304180629/http://www.cmsm.org/forum/forum_summer08_psi.html |date=2014-03-04 }} ‘’CMSM Forum," Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded after [[World War II]] as reconciliary movement by French citizens including Bishop [[Pierre-Marie Théas]] of [[Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes|Tarbes and Lourdes]]. First goal was the reconciliation between [[France]] and [[Germany]]; the German branch or section later concentrated on reconciliation with [[Poland]] and initiated the foundation of the [[:de:Maximilian-Kolbe-Werk]].

Today the Pax Christi network membership is made up of 18 national sections and 115 Member Organizations working in over 50 countries,
focusing on five main issues: human rights, human security, disarmament and demilitarisation, just world order, and religion and peace.

==The Bahá'í Faith and peacebuilding==

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] requires believers to avoid prejudice in daily life, to be friendly to people of all [[religions]], social statuses, nationalities or various [[culture|cultural]] traditions. At the nation's level, it calls for negotiation and dialogue between country leaders, to promote the process of world peace. For world peace, the Bahá'í Faith has the notion of "the Lesser Peace" and "the Great Peace". The previous one is considered the level of political peace, that a peace treaty is signed, and wars are eliminated; the latter refers to [[God]]'s kingdom on earth, the world reaches its unity and in cooperation, all world's people uses an auxiliary language, a unified currency system, achieves economic justice, a world tribunal is available, and massive disarmament of all countries.

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], discouraged all forms of violence, including religious violence, writing that his aim was to: ``quench the flame of hate and enmity" and that the ``religion of God is for love and unity; make it not the cause of enmity or dissension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kitab-i-Ahd|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-16.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned of the dangers of religious fanaticism describing it as a ``world devouring fire",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah|pages=288|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-132.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited holy war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Bisharat|pages=21|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and condemned the shedding of blood, the burning of books, the shunning of the followers of other religions and the extermination of communities and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Tablet of the World|pages=91|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] promoted the concept of the oneness of the world and human beings describing the Earth as "but one country, and mankind its citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Tablet of Maqsud|pages=167|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] identified the elimination of disunity as a necessary pre-requisite to peace.  "The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah|pages=286|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-131.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, as a contribution to the 1986 International Year of Peace, the international governing body of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[the Universal House of Justice]], released a major statement on the promotion of peace, that was distributed worldwide by the Bahá'í community. The statement sets out an analysis and strategy for creation of a more peaceful world. It identifies the following barriers to peace: racism, economic injustice, uncontrolled nationalism, religious strife, inequality between man and women, an absence of universal education, and the need for an international auxiliary language. The statement concludes with a call for establishment of the "oneness of humanity", a call which implies "no less than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized world — a world organically unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the national characteristics of its federated units."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Promise of World Peace|url=http://www.bahai.org/documents/the-universal-house-of-justice/promise-world-peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engaged Buddhism===
{{Main|Engaged Buddhism}}

'''Engaged Buddhism''' is a term coined by [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] in the 1960s to describe a more socially active form of Buddhism. Originating during the [[Indochina Wars]] with Nhat Hanh and the [[Unified Buddhist Church]], adherents of Engaged Buddhism became participants in the war, not against the Americans or the Vietnamese, but against the violence itself, which they saw as unnecessary. They attempted to draw attention to the injustices of the war by placing themselves directly between the lines of battle and even engaging in [[self immolation]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Queen, "The Peace Wheel: Nonviolent Activism in the Buddhist Tradition," in Subverting Hatred: The Challenge of Nonviolence in Religious Traditions, ed. Daniel L. Smith-Christopher (Cambridge, MA: Boston Research Center for the 21st Century, 1998)pp38-43&lt;/ref&gt;

Engaged Buddhism represents a socially aware non-violent movement within the larger Buddhist community. Inspired by the Buddhist tradition of the Peace Wheel and the teachings of non-violence of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], Engaged Buddhism has since spread to other conflicts in other countries, with groups in Tibet, struggling for self-determination; in Burma and Cambodia, advocating for human rights; in [[Sri Lanka]], promoting the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]]; and in India, working with [[Dalit|untouchables]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S.

[[File:Charles I of Austria.jpg|thumb|Emperor Charles I.]]
[[File:Ottokar Graf Czernin - Project Gutenberg eText 17998.jpg|thumb|Count Ottokar Czernin]]

The '''Sixtus Affair''' ({{Lang-de|Sixtus-Affäre}}) was a failed attempt by Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] to conclude a separate peace with the allies in [[World War I]]. The affair was named after his brother-in-law and intermediary, Prince [[Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]].

==Affair==
In 1917 the War was dragging on towards its fourth year, and Charles decided to secretly enter into peace negotiations with France. He used his brother-in-law, Prince [[Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian army, as intermediary as well as enlisting the help of his loyal childhood friend and [[aide-de-camp]] [[Tamás Erdődy (born 1866)|Tamás Erdődy]]. Charles initiated contact with the Prince via contacts in neutral [[Switzerland]], and [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Empress Zita]] wrote a letter inviting him to Vienna.  Zita's mother [[Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal|Maria Antonia]] delivered the letter personally.
[[File:Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma (1930)]]

Sixtus arrived with French-agreed conditions for talks: the restoration to France of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] (annexed by Germany after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870); restoration of the independence of Belgium; independence for the kingdom of Serbia; and the handover of [[Constantinople]] to [[Russia]]. Charles agreed, in principle, to the first three points and wrote a letter dated 25 March 1917, to Sixtus giving "the secret and unofficial message that I will use all means and all my personal influence" to the President of France.

This attempt at dynastic diplomacy eventually foundered.  Germany refused to negotiate over Alsace-Lorraine and, seeing a Russian collapse on the horizon, was loath to give up the war. 

In April 1918, after the German-Russian [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], the Austrian Foreign Minister [[Count Ottokar von Czernin]] made a speech attacking the incoming French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] as being the main obstacle to a peace favouring the [[Central Powers]]. Clemenceau was incensed and had Emperor Charles' 24 March 1917 letter published. For a while, there were fears that Germany might occupy Austria. Czernin persuaded Charles to send a 'Word of Honour' to Austria's allies saying that Sixtus had not been authorised to show the letter to the French Government, that Belgium had not been mentioned, and that Clemenceau had lied about the mentioning of the Alsace. Czernin had actually been in contact with the German Embassy throughout the whole crisis, and was attempting to persuade the Emperor to step down because of the Affair.  After this failed, Czernin resigned himself.

This affair was an embarrassment to Charles and forced Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with regard to its German ally.

== Beatification of Charles I ==
For his role as a peacemaker during 1917-1918, Emperor Charles I of Austria was solemnly declared blessed in a Mass of Beatification on 3 October 2004 by [[Pope John Paul II]].

Since the late 1940s, it was headed by interrogator [[Julia Brystiger]] (née Prajs) who personally directed the operation to arrest and detain the Primate of Poland, Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszyński]].&lt;ref name=B-F&gt;Barbara Fijałkowska, [http://www.abcnet.com.pl/node/2338  RÓŻAŃSKI "LIBERAŁEM"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 15 December 2002, Fundacja Orientacja ''abcnet''; see also: B.

Przyczynek do dziejów stalinizmu w Polsce'', {{ISBN|83-85513-49-3}}. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department specialized in the persecution and torture of Polish religious personalities. Brystygier, born to a Jewish family in Stryj (now Ukraine), dedicated herself to ideological struggle against all forms of religion.&lt;ref name="D-D" /&gt; Nicknamed ''Bloody Luna'' by the victims of her torture techniques, Brystygier was responsible for the arrest of 2,000 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] for their religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="D-D" /&gt;

The trial was a key element in the subsequent wave of repressions against the Church. First, on February 9, 1953, the communist government issued ''The decree on appointments of clergy to church positions'', assuming total control over the way in which positions in the Church were filled. A month later, on March 8, 1953 the authorities stopped publication of the Catholic weekly ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' in reprisal for its alleged refusal to include a eulogy commemorating the death of [[Joseph Stalin]]. The magazine was taken over (until October 1956) by a pro-government secular group ''[[PAX Association]]''. Finally, on September 14, 1953, the communist apparatus launched a separate show-trial of Bishop [[Czesław Kaczmarek]], coupled with a series of the so-called ''splinter trials'' of various "informants" sentenced to an average of 12–15 years. Kaczmarek, tortured in custody before being forced to sign a confession and admit his guilt, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on September 22, 1953. On September 25, 1953, Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]] was arrested.&lt;ref name="ipn-418" /&gt; Three days later, on September 28, 1953, a deeply intimidated Catholic Bishops' Conference issued an official condemnation of sabotage against the state. In parallel, the Office of the Council of Ministers (Urząd Rady Ministrów) organized its own ceremony on December 17, 1953, welcoming the ''government-approved'' Bishops, Diocesan administrators ([[Diocesan administrator|Vicar capitulars]]), and [[Suffragan diocese|Suffragans]].&lt;ref name="ipn-418" /&gt;

==Resolution of the Union of Polish Writers==
The Union of Polish Writers gathering of February 8, 1953 in Kraków, produced a damning statement regarding the Trial of the Curia. The Resolution was signed by 53 members, some of whom went on to become leading figures in Polish literary circles, bestowed with medals and awards.&lt;ref name="Małachowski"&gt;Aleksander Małachowski, [http://www.przeglad-tygodnik.pl/pl/artykul/pisarze "Zapiski polityczne.

;''Resolution of the Union of Polish Writers in Kraków regarding the Kraków trial''
&lt;var style="font-family: serif; font-size: 1.1em;"&gt;In recent days, a trial has taken place in Kraków, of a group of American spies associated with the Kraków Metropolitan Curia. We, the members of Kraków branch of the Polish Writers Union, meeting on 8 February 1953, express our absolute condemnation of those traitors to our Homeland, who used their spiritual position and influence to dupe the young, gathered around KSM; and who acted with malice toward the nation and our people's country – and engaged in espionage and subversion – for American money.

We condemn those Church officials of the Catholic hierarchy, who welcomed the anti-Polish machinations, gave their support to the traitors, and went on to destroy our cultural monuments.

Given these facts, we commit ourselves in our own creative work, to even more aggressively and with greater depth than ever, tackle the current problems of our struggle for Socialism, vehemently.&lt;/var&gt;

My zebrani w dniu 8 lutego 1953 r. członkowie krakowskiego Oddziału Związku Literatów Polskich wyrażamy bezwzględne potępienie dla zdrajców Ojczyzny, którzy wykorzystując swe duchowe stanowiska i wpływ na część młodzieży skupionej w KSM działali wrogo wobec narodu i państwa ludowego, uprawiali – za amerykańskie pieniądze – szpiegostwo i dywersję.

Potępiamy tych dostojników z wyższej hierarchii kościelnej, którzy sprzyjali knowaniom antypolskim i okazywali zdrajcom pomoc, oraz niszczyli cenne zabytki kulturalne.

Wobec tych faktów zobowiązujemy się w twórczości swojej jeszcze bardziej bojowo i wnikliwiej niż dotychczas podejmować aktualne problemy walki o socjalizm i ostrzej.&lt;/var&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Rezolucja_Związku_Literatów_Polskich_w_Krakowie_w_sprawie_procesu_krakowskiego  Rezolucja Związku Literatów Polskich w Krakowie w sprawie procesu krakowskiego.] Full text of document in [[Polish language|Polish]].

The Kraków trial, on the one hand, was the culmination of the Stalinist anti-ecclesiastical offensive; on the other hand, it was also the highest point in an attack led by MBP against the Polish emigration circles. In December 1952, two major operations were concluded by the security forces: one against the remnants of the [[Cursed soldiers|anti-communist underground]] ("Cezary"), and the other, against its own political opponents ("Ośrodek").&lt;ref name="ipn-418" /&gt;

[[File:Campaign's logo.png|thumbnail|right|'''Campaign's Official Logo''']]

'''The Global Campaign to Return to Palestine''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الحملة العالمية للعودة إلى فلسطين) is an umbrella organization for [[NGOs]] that support the [[Palestinian cause]], both in the [[Arab region]] and the world, and has representatives and partners in over 45 countries around the world to set up events and movements to advocate the '''Palestinian cause''' and specially the '''right of return'''

==About The Campaign==

From the campaign’s perspective, the commemoration of the occasions currently derives its importance from the dangerous reality facing the "cause" and affecting it in its core, in a time where the Arab and Islamic concerns have drifted away from the Zionist plans that continue to rob the [[Palestinians]] of their rights day after day.

The '''Campaign''' has partners and members in over 45 countries around the world including: [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[Scotland]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], [[Nigeria]], [[Albania]] and others; and organizes movements and events in support of the Palestinian Cause, with a special focus on the '''right of return'''. Therefore, it has chosen the"Day of Return" (aka [[Nakba|An-Nakba]] day),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bTd4ZGSEfg|title=الحملة العالمية للعودة الى فلسطين - يوم العودة 2014 - YouTube|date=12 May 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on May 15 of each year, as a central occasion to commemorate on the largest scale possible.

The '''Campaign''' held its first preparatory meeting between 14 and 16 April 2013, for initiating the commemoration of the Day of Return, 2013.

In its organized activities, the campaign tends to depend on personal initiatives and civil society organizations, as well as young volunteers in an attempt to envelop, and properly direct, the enormous energy youngsters hold in the domain of activism for Palestine.

==Objectives==

'''1-'''	Retrieving the Palestinian cause as a central unifying issue.

'''2-'''	Attracting the utmost possible number of NGOs to join the umbrella organization, in an attempt to harmonize the movements and magnify their effectiveness worldwide.

'''3-'''	Emphasizing the right of the Palestinian people to [[Palestinian right of return|return]] to their homeland.

'''4-'''	Confirming the right of return as an indisputable claim in the global awareness and standing up against all the attempts that intend to mislay or weaken this right.

==Establishment==

More than 45 events were arranged around the world in affiliation with international NGOs that support the Palestinian Cause. The Campaign issued a statement of establishment and the statement was signed by all participating NGOs' representatives.

==Activities==

=== [[International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People|The International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People]] Conference,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al-akhbar.com/node/195842&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 ===

Out of the Campaign’s sincere belief in the importance of communication and cooperation among NGOs that support the Palestinian Cause, and in the light of the need for an [[umbrella organization]] that facilitates and guarantees such cooperation, the Campaign set up a conference in [[Beirut]], Lebanon, on the Solidarity Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkVgAufQB4A|title=الحملة العالمية للعودة إلى فلسطين Global Campaign to Return to Palestine - YouTube|date=9 December 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the 27th, 28th, 29th, of November, 2013. The Conference attracted more than 45 guests from around the world, mostly representatives of international NGOs working for the Palestinian Cause, and was concluded by the establishment of an umbrella organization with the membership of all those present.

[[File:Day of return.jpg|thumbnail|left|"Destination Palestine" Poster Designs, displayed on Billboards in several countries on the "Day of Return", 2014]]

[http://topalestine.com/ '''The Global Campaign to Return to Palestine'''] has chosen 15 May as a central occasion to commemorate each year under the name "The Day of Return".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=14052014&amp;id=efa53d86-e6bb-4685-8673-8194b9446b97|title=الحملة العالمية للعودة إلى فلسطين تحيي "ذكرى النكبة" بلبنان|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this day the Campaign evokes the Palestinian catastrophe (An-Nakba 1948) and what have occurred during it; the horrible massacres, the oppression and persecution of Palestinians, and the land confiscations which resulted in the displacement of more than 840000 Palestinians from their homeland (out of 1.4 million Palestinians at that time).

American [[John Carpenter (athlete)|John Carpenter]] was disqualified, and teammates [[John Taylor (athlete)|John Baxter Taylor]] and [[William Robbins (athlete)|William Robbins]] refused to race in protest.]]
A '''walkover''', also '''W.O.''' or '''w/o''' (originally two words: "walk over") is the awarding of a victory to a contestant because there are no other contestants or the other contestants have been disqualified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PAP team points out error in RP form, averting possible walkover in West Coast GRC|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/pap-team-points-out-error-in-rp-form-averting-possible-walkover-in-west-coast-grc|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=The Straits Times|date=1 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or have [[forfeit (sport)|forfeited]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The term can apply in [[sport]] but also to [[election]]s, when it is also referred to as winning "by default". The word is used more generally by extension, particularly in politics, for a contest in which the winner is not the only participant but has little or no competition.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.: walkover&lt;/ref&gt; The narrow and extended meanings of "walkover" as a single word are both found from 1829.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

==Sports==
{{see also|Forfeit (sport)}}
The word originates from [[Horseracing in Great Britain|horseracing]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where an entrant in a one-horse race run under [[Jockey Club]] rules has at least to "walk over" the course before being awarded victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=2nd |at=walk 16e, walk over}}&lt;/ref&gt; This outcome was quite common at a time when there was no guaranteed prize money for horses finishing second or third, so there was no incentive to run a horse in a race it could not win. The eighteenth century champion racehorse [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]] was so dominant over his contemporaries that he was allowed to walk over on nine occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Bios/Eclipse.htm|title=Eclipse|website=www.bloodlines.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1828 [[Epsom Derby]] winner [[Cadland]] walked over on at least six occasions.

The term is also used in [[tennis]], in reference to a player's unopposed victory as a result of the opponent's failing to start the match for any reason, such as injury.

The only Olympic Games walkover for a gold medal was at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]]: [[Wyndham Halswelle]] won a rerun of [[Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men's 400 metres|the 400 m race]] as the two other athletes refused to take part in the rerun. The only time it has happened at the [[FIFA World Cup]] was in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 edition]], when [[Austria national football team|Austria]] was [[Anschluss|annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]] before the former was scheduled to play [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. After the [[England national football team|England team]] declined to take Austria's entry, FIFA gave Sweden a walkover.

==Use in elections==
A walkover is usually the sign of a very strong [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] or [[unanimity|unanimous support]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teh|first1=Shi Ning|title=Chan Chun Sing: The practical politician|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/chan-chun-sing-practical-politician|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=AsiaOne|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can, however, be interpreted by critics of the faction the walkover is awarded to as a suspicious sign of [[electoral fraud]] or [[gerrymandering]] to prevent other candidates from participating. The circumstances of such an interpretation are usually controversial. Walkovers can thus often be a sign of an [[illiberal democracy]].

In civic organisations and civic societies, where personal charisma and personal politics often dominate, while parties or factions are often interested in a seat, they may not contest a seat that is being held by a long-standing or very popular individual, for fear of being seen as "rocking the boat". In elections for these societies, there is often "pre-election politics" where candidates attempt to figure out who is running for which positions; in this cat and mouse game, elected positions are thus often effectively decided by internal politics before a single vote is cast.

Many [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] in history, including the [[history of United States|United States]], have had uncontested elections because support for one candidate was so strong. In the [[United States presidential election, 1788–89|United States presidential elections of 1789]] and [[United States presidential election, 1792|1792]], [[George Washington]] ran uncontested for [[President of the United States|President]], although in the latter election the ballot for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] was contested by both [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] and [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republicans]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820 election]], [[James Monroe]] also ran unopposed, though
New Hampshire elector [[William Plumer]] cast a vote for [[John Quincy Adams]] as a symbolic measure.

Election walkovers are called [[acclamation]] in [[Canada]].

Other multi-party systems that have held uncontested presidential elections include [[Germany]], [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ong|first1=Justin|title=Melvin Yong, Joan Pereira join PAP’s Tanjong Pagar GRC team|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/melvin-yong-joan-pereira/2052302.html|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=Channel NewsAsia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Algeria]], [[Iceland]], and [[Zimbabwe]].

Running without opponents is not always a guarantee of winning. Many elections require that the winner has not only the most votes of all candidates but a defined fraction of all votes cast, or of the electorate. In this case electors may be able to cast a [[blank vote]] or [[none of the above]] vote, [[spoiled vote|spoil their papers]], or [[Abstention|abstain from voting]], preventing the one candidate from winning and forcing a new election. In the [[Philippines]], the sole candidate in an uncontested election must have at least one vote in order to win the seat; this is also true in general elections in the United States, and there are cases in local government races where the sole candidate on the ballot finished with zero votes (as almost all U.S. government seats require candidates to reside in the municipality they seek to represent, this means the candidate themselves must, usually out of forgetfulness or lack of time on election day, fail to vote for themselves) and thus lose an uncontested election. In such cases, the other members of the body usually appoint someone to the vacant seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2015/09/10/man-loses-election-when-nobody-votes-including-himself/72008048/|title=Man loses election when nobody votes, including himself|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is not true in primary elections.) In theory, if a candidate is unopposed on the ballot but lacks support of their constituency, a [[draft campaign]] could outvote the unopposed candidate with any [[write-in candidate]], regardless of whether that write-in name is actively seeking the seat.

”Winning by default” can also happen when there are less candidates than what is required. For example, if a group requires 7 people, and only 4 people go for the role, the candidates may be elected by default.

==Use in poker==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
In [[poker]] games that use [[blind bet|blinds]], a hand is considered a walkover (usually shortened to ''walk'') when no other players call or raise the big blind, resulting in the player who posted the big blind winning the hand by default. Walks are most often seen in tournament play. [[Cash games]] often allow the players to "split the blinds" (i.e. take back their blind bets in case there are no callers or raisers by the time the action gets to the small blind), but this is usually not permitted in tournaments.

'''Wayfinding''' encompasses all of the ways in which people (and animals) [[Orientation (mental)|orient]] themselves in physical space and [[navigate]] from place to place.

==Basic process==
The basic process of wayfinding involves four stages:

# ''Orientation'' is the attempt to determine one's location, in relation to objects that may be nearby and the desired destination. 
# ''Route decision'' is the selection of a course of direction to the destination. 
# ''Route monitoring'' is checking to make sure that the selected route is heading towards the destination.
# ''Destination recognition'' is when the destination is recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Lidwell, William, Kritina Holden and Jill Butler. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0QPECGQySYC&amp;pg=PA260 Universal Principles of Design]''. (Rockport Publishers, Beverly, MA, 2010) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
Historically, wayfinding refers to the techniques used by travelers over land and sea to find relatively unmarked and often mislabeled routes. These include but are not limited to [[dead reckoning]], [[map]] and [[compass]], [[astronomical]] positioning and, more recently, [[global positioning]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Wayfinding can also refer to the traditional [[Polynesian navigation|navigation method used by indigenous peoples of Polynesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ Polynesian Voyaging Society (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Polynesians and Pacific Islanders mastered the way of wayfinding to explore and settle on the islands of the Pacific, many using devices such as the [[Marshall Islands stick chart]].  With these skills, some of them were even able to navigate the ocean as well as they could navigate their own land.  Despite the dangers of being out at sea for a long time, wayfinding was a way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lin, [http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/03/03/hokulea-the-art-of-wayfinding-interview-with-a-master-navigator/ "Hokule{{okina}}a: The Art of Wayfinding (Interview with a Master Navigator),"] ''National Geographic'' website, 3 March 2014, retrieved on 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, The Polynesian Voyaging Society tries-out
the traditional Polynesian ways of navigation. In October 2014, the crew of the
Hokuleʻa arrived on another island in [[Tonga]].

==Modern usage of the term==

Recently, wayfinding has been used in the context of [[architecture]] to refer to the user experience of orientation and choosing a path within the [[built environment]]. [[Kevin A. Lynch]] used the term for his 1960 book ''The Image of the City'', where he defined wayfinding as "a consistent use and organization of definite sensory cues from the external environment."

In 1984 environmental psychologist Romedi Passini published the full-length "Wayfinding in Architecture" and expanded the concept to include the use of signage and other [[graphic communication]], visual clues in the built environment, audible communication, tactile elements, including provisions for special-needs users.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The wayfinding concept was further expanded in a further book by renowned Canadian graphic designer Paul Arthur, and Romedi Passini, published in 1992, "Wayfinding:  People, Signs and Architecture." The book serves as a veritable wayfinding bible of descriptions, illustrations, and lists, all set into a practical context of how people use both signs and other wayfinding cues to find their way in complex environments. There is an extensive bibliography, including information on exiting information and how effective it has been during emergencies such as fires in public places.&lt;ref&gt;Originally published 1992, McGraw Hill, reissued in a limited commemorative edition in 2002 by SEGD. {{ISBN|978-0075510161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayfinding also refers to the set of architectural or design elements that aid orientation. Today, the term '''wayshowing,''' coined by [[Per Mollerup]],&lt;ref&gt;Per Mollerup, Wayshowing, A Guide to Environmental Signage (Lars Muller Publisher)&lt;/ref&gt; is used to cover the act of assisting way finding.&lt;ref&gt;Per Mollerup, Wayshowing&gt;Wayfinding: Basic &amp; Interactive (BIS Publishers)&lt;/ref&gt; describes the difference between wayshowing and way finding, and codifies the nine wayfinding strategies we all use when navigating in unknown territories. However, there is some debate over the importance of using the term wayshowing, some argue that it merely adds confusion to a discipline that is already highly misunderstood.

In 2010 AHA Press Published "WAYFINDING FOR HEALTHCARE Best Practices for Today's Facilities", written by Randy R. Cooper. The book takes a comprehensive view of Wayfinding specifically for those in search of medical care.&lt;ref&gt;AHA Press, Health Forum Inc.,  An American Hospital Association Company – Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst wayfinding applies to cross disciplinary practices including architecture, art and design, signage design, psychology, environmental studies, one of the most recent definitions by Paul Symonds et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Symonds |first2=David H. K. |last2=Brown |first3=Valeria |last3=Lo Iacono |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.5153/sro.4185 |title=Wayfinding as an Embodied Sociocultural Experience |journal=Sociological Research Online |volume=22 |issue=1 |page=5 |doi=10.5153/sro.4185 |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines wayfinding as "The cognitive, social and corporeal process and experience of locating, following or discovering a route through and to a given space". Wayfinding is an embodied and sociocultural activity in addition to being a cognitive process in that wayfinding takes places almost exclusively in social environments with, around and past other peoples and influenced by stakeholders who manage and control the routes through which we try to find our way. The route is often one we might take for pleasure, such as to see a scenic highway, or one we take as a physical challenge such as trying to find the way through a set of underground caves. Wayfinding is a complex practice that very often involves techniques such as people-asking (asking people for directions) and crowd following and is thus a practice that combines psychological and sociocultural processes.

In addition to the built environment, the concept of wayfinding has also recently been applied to the concept of career development and an individuals attempt to create meaning within context of career identity. This was addressed in late August in the NPR podcast You 2.0: How Silicon Valley Can Help You Get Unstuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/28/546716951/you-2-0-how-silicon-valley-can-help-you-get-unstuck |title=How Silicon Valley Can Help You Get Unstuck |date=August 28, 2017 |work=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wayfinding in architecture, signage and urban planning==

Modern wayfinding has begun to incorporate research on why people get lost, how they react to signage and how these systems can be improved.

===Urban planning===

An example of an urban wayfinding scheme is the [[Legible London]] Wayfinding system.

Nashville, Tennessee has introduced a live music wayfinding plan. Posted outside each live music venue is a guitar pick reading Live Music Venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitmusiccity.com/Visitors |title=Visitors |website=Nashville Music City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor wayfinding===

Indoor wayfinding in public buildings such as hospitals is commonly aided by kiosks,&lt;ref&gt;
Raven, A., Laberge, J., Ganton, J. &amp; Johnson, M., [http://uxpamagazine.org/wayfinding-in-a-hospital/ Wayfinding in a Hospital: Electronic Kiosks Point the Way], [http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/14-3/ UX Magazine 14.3], September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; indoor maps, and building directories. Such spaces that involve areas outside the normal vocabulary of visitors show the need for a common set of language-independent symbols.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
Offering indoor maps for handheld mobile devices is becoming common, as are digital information [[Interactive kiosk#Building directory and wayfinding kiosk|kiosk systems]].  Other frequent wayfinding aids are the use of color coding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelwayfinding.com/colours/ |title=Using Colours in Wayfinding and Navigation |first=Paul |last=Symonds |website=travelwayfinding.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signage clustering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelwayfinding.com/clustering-and-signage/ |title=Clustering and Signage in Wayfinding |website=travelwayfinding.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) represented a milestone in helping to make spaces universally accessible and improving wayfinding for users.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">The '''World Uranium Hearing''' was held in [[Salzburg, Austria]] in September 1992. [[Anti-nuclear]] speakers from all continents, including indigenous speakers and scientists, testified to the health and environmental problems of [[uranium mining]] and processing, [[nuclear power]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[nuclear tests]], and [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste disposal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclear-free.com/english/hearing.htm |title=World Uranium Hearing, a Look Back |author= [[Nuclear-Free Future Award]]  |date= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who spoke at the 1992 Hearing include: [[Thomas Banyacya]], [[Katsumi Furitsu]], [[Manuel Pino]] and [[Floyd Red Crow Westerman]]. They said they were deeply dismayed by the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and highlighted what they called the inherently destructive nature of all phases of the nuclear supply chain. They recalled the disastrous impact of nuclear weapons testing in places such as the [[Nevada Test Site]], [[Bikini Atoll]] and [[Eniwetok]], [[Tahiti]], [[Maralinga]], and [[Central Asia]]. They highlighted the threat of [[radioactive contamination]] to all peoples, especially indigenous communities and said that their survival requires self-determination and emphasis on spiritual and cultural values. Increased [[renewable energy commercialization]] was advocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclear-free.com/english/salzburg.htm |title=The Declaration of Salzberg |author= [[Nuclear-Free Future Award]]  |date= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
