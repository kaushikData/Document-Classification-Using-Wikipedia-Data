      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4845">'''Agios Andreas''' is a small settlement near the town of [[Katakolo]], in [[Elis (regional unit)|Elis]], [[Greece]]. It is situated on the site of ancient [[Pheia (Elis)|Pheia]], at a bay of particular natural beauty, opposite the islet of Ichthys or Tiganonisi and the island of [[Zakynthos]]. Agios Andreas is located 13 kilometers northwest of [[Pyrgos, Elis|Pyrgos]] and just 2&amp;nbsp;km from the port of Katakolo. It owes its name to an old church, now ruined, dedicated to [[Andrew the Apostle]], who is said to have passed from the place on his journeys. The church was built on the ruins of an ancient temple, which was rebuilt in 1930.&lt;ref name=Kotsanas&gt;{{cite book|last=Κοτσανάς|first=Κωνσταντίνος|script-title=el:Τουριστικός Οδηγός Ηλείας|date=2007-05-16|publisher=Πύργος [GR]|isbn=978-960-89792-1-5|page=57|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ancient town of [[Pheia (Elis)|Pheia]] occupied the site of the modern village of Agios Andreas, most of which today lies submerged in the sea. Dating back to Homeric times, it is mentioned twice by [[Homer]] (''[[Iliad]]'', VIII.135, ''[[Odyssey]]'', XV.297, 298), [[Thucydides]] in his ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' (II.25), in [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Hellenica]]'' (3, 2, 30), [[Strabo]]'s  ''[[Geographica]]'' (VIII.343), as well as the works of [[Polybius]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

[https://web.archive.org/web/20140802123146/http://www.ciesm.org/online/monographs/Santorin.pdf Pheia] was sunk by an earthquake in the 6th century AD, the same which largely destroyed the city of [[Patras]], and which is credited with the final ruin of the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and probably with the formation of Lake Agoulinitsa (in [[Epitalio]]).

In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, a fortress, [[Pontikokastro|Pontikon or Pontikokastro]], was built on the site of the ruined ancient [[acropolis]]. Archaeological excavations in the area were undertaken in 1957 by Nikos Gialouris, and the findings are exhibited in the [[Archaeological Museum of Olympia]]. They include ''[[ostraca]]'' from prehistoric up to Roman times, clay lamps, bowls, [[cylix]]es, amphorae, columns, an [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]]-era ''[[kouros]]'' from [[Naxos]], and [[Cycladic art|Cycladic]] statues, all testimonies to the site's role as a major port. An extensive Roman-era cemetery was also found on the islet of Ιchthys or Tiganonisi. However, most of the graves were found looted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Κοτσανάς|first=Κωνσταντίνος|script-title=el:Τουριστικός Οδηγός Ηλείας|date=2007-05-16|publisher=Πύργος [GR]|isbn=978-960-89792-1-5|page=59|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Fourth Crusade]], the castle was conquered by the [[Frankokratia|Frankish]] Crusaders who established the [[Principality of Achaea]] in ca. 1205.{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=66, 663}} Known as ''Beauvoir'' in French, ''Belveder'' in Italian and ''Bellovidere'' or ''Pulchrumvidere'' in Latin,{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=328–330}} it originally formed part of the princely domain of Achaea, and along with the fortress and princely mint of [[Glarentza]] it was one of the two major sites from which Elis was governed.{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=87, 104, 330}} Beauvoir was granted in 1289 to [[Hugh, Count of Brienne]], in exchange for his half of the [[Barony of Karytaina]], but Hugh soon exchanged it with [[John Chauderon]] for lands in [[Conversano]]. By 1303, however, it had returned to direct princely control.{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=161, 164, 330}} During [[Ferdinand of Majorca]]'s attempt to seize the Principality in 1315–16, Beauvoir was captured and held by his forces until after his defeat and death in the [[Battle of Manolada]].{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=192–193}} Beauvoir ceased to play an important role thereafter, and is scarcely mentioned in the subsequent periods of Ottoman and Venetian rule.{{sfn|Bon|1969|p=330}} In 1391 it was taken over by the [[Navarrese Company]], in 1427 by [[Constantine Palaiologos]], and after that by [[Thomas Palaiologos]]. It was burned down by the Turks in 1470.

==Historical reference ==
The earliest attested use of the [[American (word)|term “American”]] to identify an ethnic or cultural identity dates to the late 1500s, with the term signifying "the indigenous peoples discovered in the Western Hemisphere by Europeans.”&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= American, ''n.'' and ''adj.''|encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/6342?redirectedFrom=American&amp;|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following century, the term “American” was extended as a reference to colonists of European descent.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; The Oxford English Dictionary identifies this secondary meaning as “historical” and states that the term "American" today “chiefly [means] a [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|native (birthright)]] or [[United States nationality law|citizen of the United States]].”&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

[[File:Knownothingflag.jpg|thumb|upright| Flag of the [[Know Nothing|Know Nothing or American Party]], c. 1850]]

President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], a prominent [[Natural history|naturalist]], asserted an "American race" had been formed on the [[American frontier]], one distinct from other ethnic groups, such as the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Anglo-Saxons]].&lt;ref name="Dyer1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas G.

Kauffman  contends American nativism cannot be understood without reference to the theorem of the age that an ''"American" national ethnic group'' had taken shape prior to the large-scale [[History of immigration to the United States#Immigration 1850 to 1930|immigration of the mid-19th century]].&lt;ref name=Kaufmann&gt;{{cite journal |title=American Exceptionalism Reconsidered: Anglo-Saxon Ethnogenesis in the "Universal" Nation, 1776–1850 |last=Kaufmann |first=E. P. |pages=437–57 |journal=Journal of American Studies |volume=33 |issue=3 |jstor=27556685 |date=1999|quote=In the case of the United States, the national ethnic group was Anglo-American Protestant ("American"). This was the first European group to "imagine" the territory of the United States as its homeland and trace its genealogy back to New World colonists who rebelled against their mother country. In its mind, the American nation-state, its land, its history, its mission and its Anglo-American people were woven into one great tapestry of the imagination. This social construction considered the United States to be founded by the "Americans", who thereby had title to the land and the mandate to mould the nation (and any immigrants who might enter it) in their own Anglo-Saxon, Protestant self-image.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativism gained its name from the "Native American" parties of the 1840s and 1850s.&lt;ref name="KennedyCohen2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David M.

According to [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S census]] data, an increasing number of United States citizens identify simply as "American" on the question of ancestry.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stanley |last=Lieberson |first2=Lawrence |last2=Santi |title=The Use of Nativity Data to Estimate Ethnic Characteristics and Patterns |journal=Social Science Research |volume=14 |issue=1 |year=1985 |pages=44–46 |doi=10.1016/0049-089X(85)90011-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieberson" /&gt; The Census Bureau reports the number of people in the United States who reported "American" and no other ancestry increased from 12.4 million in 1990 to  20.2 million in 2000.&lt;ref name=Ancestry2000p7 /&gt; This increase represents the largest numerical growth of any ethnic group in the United States during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Ancestry2000p3 /&gt;

In the 2000 United States Census 6.9% of the American population chose to self-identify itself as having "American ancestry".&lt;ref name=Ancestry2000p3&gt;{{Harvnb|Ancestry: 2000|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four states in which a [[wikt:plurality|plurality]] of the population reported American ancestry are [[Arkansas]] (15.7%), [[Kentucky]] (20.7%), [[Tennessee]] (17.3%), and [[West Virginia]] (18.7%).&lt;ref name=Ancestry2000p7&gt;{{Harvnb|Ancestry: 2000|2004|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizable percentages of the populations of [[Alabama]] (16.8%), [[Mississippi]] (14.0%), [[North Carolina]] (13.7%), [[South Carolina]] (13.7%), [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (13.3%), and [[Indiana]] (11.8%) also reported American ancestry.&lt;ref name=Atlas/&gt;

In the [[Southern United States]] as a whole 11.2% reported "American" ancestry, second only to [[African American]]. American was the 4th most common ancestry reported in the Midwest (6.5%) and West (4.1%). All Southern states except for Delaware, Maryland, Florida, and Texas reported 10% or more American, but outside the South, only Missouri and Indiana did so. American was in the top 5 ancestries reported in all Southern states except for [[Delaware]], in 4 Midwestern states bordering the South (Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio) as well as [[Iowa]], and 6 Northwestern states (Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming), but only one Northeastern state, [[Maine]].

In the 2014 [[American Community Survey]], [[German American]]s (14.4%), [[Irish American]]s (10.4%), [[English American]]s (7.6%) and [[Italian American]]s (5.4%) were the four largest self-reported [[European Americans|European ancestry groups]] in the United States forming 37.8% of the total population.&lt;ref name="2014 ACS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_14_1YR_DP02&amp;prodType=table |title=Selected Social Characteristics in the United States (DP02): 2014 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=November 10, 2016|df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, English, [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]], and [[British Americans|British American]] demography is considered to be seriously undercounted, as the 6.9% of U.S. Census respondents who self-report and identify simply as "American" are primarily of these ancestries (and of the Scotch-Irish ancestry in particular).&lt;ref name="Pulera2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dominic Pulera|title=Sharing the Dream: White Males in Multicultural America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&amp;pg=PA57|date= 2004|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-1643-8|pages=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leyburn|first=James G.|title=The Scotch-Irish: A Social History|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|place=[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill, NC]]|year=1962|isbn=978-0807842591|quote=[The Scotch-Irish] were enthusiastic supporters of the American Revolution, and thus were soon thought of as Americans, not as Scotch-Irish; and so they regarded themselves.|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Michael P.|title=American Catholics in the Protestant Imagination: Rethinking the Academic Study of Religion|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|place=[[Baltimore]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8018-8683-6|quote=...the character traits associated with 'being Irish,' in the minds of Protestant Americans, continue to resonate with the rhetoric of the American Revolution and with the emphases of evangelical Christianity.

=== Academic analysis ===
Reynolds Farley writes that “we may now be in an era of optional ethnicity, in which no simple census question will distinguish those who identify strongly with a specific European group from those who report symbolic or imagined ethnicity.”&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Reynolds |last=Farley |title=The New Census Question about Ancestry: What Did It Tell Us? |journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]] |volume=28 |issue=3 |year=1991 |pages=411 |doi=10.2307/2061465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Lieberson]] and [[Mary C. Waters]] write: "As whites become increasingly distant in generations and time from their immigrant ancestors, the tendency to distort, or remember selectively, one’s ethnic origins increases.… [E]thnic categories are social phenomena that over the long run are constantly being redefined and reformulated."&lt;ref name="Lieberson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieberson2"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stanley |last=Lieberson |title=The Use of Nativity Data to Estimate Ethnic Characteristics and Patterns |journal=Social Science Research |volume=14 |issue=1 |year=1985 |pages=44–46 |doi=10.1016/0049-089X(85)90011-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary C. Waters contends that white Americans of European origin are afforded a wide range of choice: "In a sense, they are constantly given an actual choice—they can either identify themselves with their ethnic ancestry or they can 'melt' into the wider society and call themselves American."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waters|first=Mary C. |title=Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u0g4EG0NCg4C|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07083-7|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors Anthony Daniel Perez and Charles Hirschman write: "European national origins are still common among whites—almost 3 of 5 whites name one or more European countries in response to the ancestry question. ... However, a significant share of whites respond that they are simply “American” or leave the ancestry question blank on their census forms. Ethnicity is receding from the consciousness of many white Americans. Because national origins do not count for very much in contemporary America, many whites are content with a simplified Americanized racial identity. The loss of specific ancestral attachments among many white Americans also results from high patterns of intermarriage and ethnic blending among whites of different European stocks."&lt;ref name=Perez/&gt;

An '''annual calendar''' is a representation of the year that expires with the year represented, or that must be altered annually to remain current. The term takes different but related meanings across two contexts. One is for static (synchronic) calendars, such as wall calendars or calendar systems. The other is for dynamic (diachronic) calendars, such as digital calendars or timepieces. Static representations of the [[Gregorian calendar]] year are annual, because the weekdays of Gregorian dates vary from year to year. The calendar representing one year will not serve for the next year. With [[perennial calendar]]s, the same representation of the year serves for every year. [[Perpetual calendar]]s, in this context, are computation devices for determining the weekdays of dates in any given year, or for representing a wide range of annual calendars. 

An annual calendar in the dynamic context of [[watchmaking]] is a feature of a [[mechanical watch]]. A [[timepiece]] with an annual calendar displays the hour, day, date and month, with the first of the month automatically adjusted following months of 30 or 31 days. Manual correction will often be required for the first of March, however, following the 28 days of February, or 29 in [[leap year]]s. An annual timepiece calendar is less complicated and expensive than a perpetual timepiece calendar, which will not require manual adjustment till 2100. That year will not be a leap year, even though its number is evenly divisible by 4.

==Brief history==
Ancient calendars (static) may always have been annual, even after the length of the calendar year was fixed at (avg.) 365.25 days by the [[Julian Calendar]] (46 BC). Early Romans observed an 8-day market week, called the [[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinal cycle]], until the seven-day week was adopted during the reign of Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] (306-337). A goal of modern [[calendar reform]] has been to gain wide acceptance of some form of [[perennial calendar]], based on a typically 364-day year.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

In the world of [[watchmaking]], the first annual calendar indicator introduced for a wristwatch was patented in 1996 by [[Patek Philippe]]. Since 1996, the mechanism of an annual calendar was continuously improved. It is now used in [[watch]] manufacture by several watchmaking companies. The annual calendar is not a common feature. It can be found in: [[Breitling SA|Breitling]] (Navitimer Olympus), [[Bvlgari]] (Bvlgari Annual Calendar), [[Ulysse Nardin]] (Marine Chronograph), Patek Philippe (Ref. 5035, 5135, 5146, 5147, 5396 and 5960), and [[Zenith]] (Captain Winsor).

==1870s–1920s==
While individually Arabs have been immigrating to North America since before the United States became a nation, the first significant period of Arab immigration began in the 1870s and lasted until 1924 when the [[Immigration Act of 1924|Johnson-Reed Quota Act]] was passed nearly ending immigration from this region for the time being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Becoming American: The Early Arab Immigrant Experience|last=Naff|first=Alixa|publisher=Southern Illinois University|year=1993|isbn=|location=|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, an estimated 110,000 immigrants entered the United States predominantly from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province of Syria, which currently encompasses the countries of [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]] , and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15366708|title=Crossing the waters : Arabic-speaking immigrants to the United States before 1940|last=Hooglund|first=Eric|date=1987|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|others=|year=|isbn=0874745489|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|oclc=15366708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabs immigrating prior to that decade from modern-day Lebanon were regarded as [[Syrian American|Syrians]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; and were a predominantly Christian population. These early immigrants were variously classified as Turk, Greek, Armenian, and/or Arab,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/156822834|title=Race and Arab Americans before and after 9/11 : from invisible citizens to visible subjects|last=Naber|first=Nadine|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|others=Jamal, Amaney A., Naber, Nadine Christine.|year=|isbn=9780815631774|location=Syracuse, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=156822834}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1899 when the Immigration and Naturalization Service created a Syrian category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kayyali|first=Randa|date=2013|title=US Census Classifications and Arab Americans: Contestations and Definitions of Identity Markers|url=|journal=Journal of Ethnic and Migration Services|volume=39|pages=1299–1318|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, with the Lebanese nationalist movement and the establishment of Lebanon as an independent nation state, immigrants from what is now modern Lebanon started adopting a Lebanese national identity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47010059|title=Arabs in America : building a new future|last=Michael|first=Suleiman|date=1999|publisher=Temple University Press|others=|year=|isbn=9781566397278|location=Philadelphia|pages=|oclc=47010059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, there was also a small percentage of Arab Muslim and [[Druze]] immigrants, though the size of these groups is hard to determine.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; Arab Christians historically had a much easier time immigrating to the United States than did Muslims.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; During this first wave of immigration, greater Syria was still under Ottoman control, but tensions existed between the Arab Muslim and Christians. Out of this environment, many "Syrians" seized this opportunity to emigrate in hopes of a better life, and many came to the United States.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many of the early Arab immigrants thought of themselves as sojourners or ''al-Nizaleh,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30358175|title=The development of Arab-American identity|last=Suleiman|first=Michael|date=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|others=McCarus, Ernest N.|year=|isbn=9780472104390|location=Ann Arbor|pages=|oclc=30358175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established themselves as peddlers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt;

===Statistics===
* [[New York City|New York]] and [[Ellis Island]] were the gateways for a large number of immigrants coming from greater Syria. By 1900 more than half of all Syrians in America resided in New York while a great many others lived across the [[Hudson River]] in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the first immigrants from this region became involved in the New York and New Jersey garment industry. By 1924 there were 25 Syrian owned and operated silk factories in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] and [[West Hoboken, New Jersey|West Hoboken]], New Jersey alone.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
* During the first wave of immigration, Arab men outnumbered Arab women at least four to one over time causing a very high intermarriage rate. In fact, the 1990 census showed that more than 80 percent of US born Arab-Americans had non-Arab spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although only accounting for less than 10 percent of the total number of Arab immigrants to the United States, they had relatively large numbers in certain [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] towns. The majority were "attracted to the great booming midwestern factories of steel, tin automobiles, and trains in cities such as [[Pittsburgh]], [[New Castle, Pennsylvania|New Castle]] (Pennsylvania), [[Detroit]], and [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naff|first=Alixa|title=Becoming American: The Early Arab Immigrant Experience|year=1993|publisher=Southern Illinois University|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920s–1960s==

Though the end of the first wave of Arab immigration is often marked by the end of [[World War I]] and the restrictive immigration policies put in place by the United States in the interwar period, including the [[Immigration Act of 1917]] (or Asiatic Barred Zone), [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921, and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] (or Johnson-Reed Act). Though the Greater Syria region was not impacted by the Asiatic Barred Zone,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Arab immigration slowed greatly due to these restrictive quotas and the [[Great Depression]] from the late 1920s to the end of the 1940s reducing immigration to the United States to less than 1,000 persons per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During this period, many Arabs in the United States focused establishing businesses, especially dry good stores, grocery stores, and began entering manufacturing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; Similarly, there was an increase in civic participation, community mobilization, and political activism.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1948 war had broken out between Arab states and [[Yishuv]] forces. The [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] sparked a mass migration of Arabs, primarily Palestinians. The war, which ended in 1949, displaced over 750,000 Palestinians, from a population of only 1.3 million, from their homeland.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 until 1966, only 80,000 Arabs officially immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 80,000, the majority were ethnic [[Palestinian American|Palestinians]] while the second largest group was made up of [[Egyptian American|Egyptians]]. Many of the Arabs that immigrated between 1950–1965 were members of the established elite in countries like Egypt, Syria, and [[Iraq]] who fled due to popular revolutions and the new regimes that came with them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a trend that continues to the present, contributing to the “[[brain drain]]” problem throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, whereas first wave immigrants tended to go directly to the United States from their country of origin, for second wave immigrants, the United States was often the second or third destination. Palestinian immigrants during this time commonly went to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, or Egypt before making the journey to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s–2010s==
The number of immigrants remained relatively small during the second wave of Arab immigration, primarily due to the restrictive immigration policies of the US. However, in 1965, the United States passed new immigration reforms, including the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], allowing a new wave of Arabs to immigrate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This new group of Arab immigrants was demographically similar to those that immigrated during the past 20 years; however, this wave differed largely in its scope and in their reasons for immigrating. In particular, Arab immigrants during this period were largely well-educated Muslims&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and children of previous immigrants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Between 1967 and 2003 some 757,626 Arabs came to the United States, nearly eleven times the number of immigrants during the second wave.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, during this time, in addition to increasingly regular conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors, this era was marked by widespread "intra-Arab warfare" and a general increase in religious, ethnic and sectarian tensions in the region.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Also, the rise of [[Islamism]] in the [[Middle East]] during the past few decades helped further drain the region of its native Christian populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kayyali|first=Randa|title=The Arab Americans|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as with the previous influx of Arab immigrants, the third major Arab immigration trend consisted of more Palestinians than any other group.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The actual number of Palestinians who immigrated to the US during this time is not known because often the United States was not their first destination. Perhaps as many as a quarter of the nearly 800,000 Arabs that period were of Palestinian descent. The massive Palestinian exodus was further motivated by the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Further spurring Palestinian immigration were the intifada uprisings of [[First Intifada|1987–1993]] and [[Second Intifada|2000–2005]].

Aside from Palestinians, Lebanese made up the next biggest group of immigrants during this time. From 1965 to 2005 around 135,000 Lebanese came to the United States. The overwhelming majority, roughly 120,000, came after the commencement of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthering the emigration from Lebanon was Israel's 1982 invasion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Egyptians and Iraqis also immigrated to the United States in large numbers during this period. From 1967 to 2003 more than 120,000 Egyptians have immigrated to the US. Of this population, around 50,000 were [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, since 1967, 108,000 [[Iraqi American|Iraqis]] have come to the US.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006 |publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fled during the country's [[Iran–Iraq War|drawn-out war with Iran lasting from 1980–1988]]. Again, in keeping with the "brain-drain" trend of the region, a large portion of these immigrants were educated professionals not willing to serve in the army. Harsh United Nations sanctions following the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] further deteriorated Iraq's economy, increasing emigration. Between the [[Gulf War|first]] and [[Iraq War|second]] US invasions of Iraq roughly 53,000 Iraqis immigrated to the United States.  Large numbers of Syrians and [[Yemeni American|Yemenis]] immigrated to the United States during this wave as well. Since 1967, some 36,000 Syrians have immigrated to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|title=The Arab Americans: A History|year=2006|publisher=Olive Branch Press|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bucchero''' ({{IPA-it|ˈbukkero}}) is a class of [[ceramic]]s produced in central Italy by the region's [[History of Italy#Etruscans|pre-Roman]] [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] population.  This [[Italian language|Italian]] word is derived from the Latin ''poculum'', a drinking-vessel, perhaps through the Spanish ''búcaro'', or the Portuguese ''púcaro''.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Zingarelli, Vocabolario della Lingua Italiana, 2011. The Spanish word ''búcaro'' also means an odorous kind of clay formerly chewed by women, and from which those vessels were made. (María Moliner, Diccionario del uso del Español, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded as the "national" pottery of ancient [[History of Italy#Etruscans|Etruria]], bucchero ware is distinguished by its black fabric as well as glossy, black surface achieved through the unique "[[Reducing atmosphere|reduction]]" method in which it was [[Pit fired pottery|fired]]. After the leather-hard unfired ware was arranged in the [[kiln]] and the fire started, the vent holes were closed, thus reducing the supply of [[oxygen]] required in a normal kiln firing. In the smoke-filled atmosphere of the kiln, the oxygen-starved flames drew oxygen molecules from the [[iron oxide]] of the pottery. This process caused the fabric of the clay to change color from its natural red to black. Thus, in contrast to the black-[[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] [[Campanian]] ware of the [[Greeks|Greek]] colonists in [[southern Italy]], the [[lustrous]], shiny, black surface of many bucchero pots was achieved by diligent [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ing (polishing) or, occasionally, through the application of a thin slip (clay [[emulsion]]).

==Etymology==
The term ''Bucchero'' derives from the Portuguese word ''búcaro'', meaning "odorous clay", because this type of pottery was reputed to emit a special odor.

In the 18th and 19th century in [[Europe]] a lot of interest was shown for a particular type [[Pre-Columbian]] pottery in a black color. These ceramics were therefore shipped in large numbers from South America to Europe, where they were traded and were imitated.

At the same time, in Italy, 'etruscheria' (Etruscan-style artefacts) was in large demand and major digs were organized in [[Tuscany]] and [[Umbria]] in the quest for Etruscan antiquities. Because of the similarities with the popular South American ceramics, the striking black pottery that was found in Etruscan tombs was called 'bucchero'. This Italianate form became established in archaeological terminology and even today the designation 'bucchero' is still common in the scientific literature.

==Development==
[[File:MMA etruscan pottery 12.jpg|thumb|upright|Oinochoe from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (inv. 91.1.454)]]

The first appearance of a [[ceramic]] type that can clearly be classified as bucchero occurred around 675 BCE at the coastal community of [[Caere]] (the modern-day [[Cerveteri]]), with somewhat later centers of production to be found at [[Veii]] and [[Tarquinia]], both cities, like Caere, located in the southern part of the Etruscan heartland. Bucchero ware would seem to have been the natural sequel to the [[impasto (pottery)|impasto pottery]] associated with the earlier [[Villanovan culture]] from which the Etruscan civilization, itself, had evolved. Etruscan pottery is distinguished from Villanovan impasto by the more sophisticated processing of the clays used which were finely levigated to remove the traces of grit common in the earlier pottery, by its being uniformly turned on a [[potter's wheel]], by its [[Carbonization|carbonized]] black fabric in contrast to the brown or tan color found in impasto pottery.

Although the shapes of Villanovan pots provided the basics for the Etruscan potters, they added new types and forms largely inspired through intensified trade with the more advanced cultures at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, in particular the areas of [[Cyprus]], [[Syria]], and [[Phoenicia]], as well as [[Egypt]]. Many of the new, exotic shapes were in imitation of the [[tinware|metalwares]] imported from these cultures. The potters of Etruria were able to offer their customers a locally produced and less-expensive ceramic equivalent to the desirable but costly metal products arriving from the east. Some of the Etruscan potshops even carried metalware imitation to the point of covering the surface of bucchero vessels with thin sheets of [[silver]] in an attempt to visually duplicate the luxurious imports.

==Styles==
The [[Orientalizing]] manner is most apparent in the earliest phase of bucchero production which also is distinguished by the remarkable thinness of the walls of the vessels. Known as ''bucchero sottile'', or delicate bucchero, this ware represents a technical achievement elevating the potters who turned them to the ranks of the very finest [[ceramicist]]s.  So thin-walled are some of bucchero sottile vessels (in some cases, less than 2mm in thickness), such as the products of the [[Cornacchiola Tomb]] Potter of Caere, that it is probable that they were turned specifically for funereal purposes rather than for general household use.  On the other hand, the broad distribution of bucchero [[sherd]]s at ancient Caere, [[Veii]], and [[Tarquinia]] and at other area sites points to less extreme examples of bucchero sottile as having had a more practical function in the daily life of the Etruscans.

[[File:Bucchero chalice Louvre C627.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High-legged bucchero [[chalice]] with relief decoration, early 6th century BC ''(Louvre)'']]
During the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], the ever-increasing impact of the [[Ancient Greek art|Greek aesthetic]] on Etruscan culture can be noted in the influence of Greek vase shapes on the design choices of the bucchero potters. Etruscan potters, however, made their own contributions to the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic]] ceramic vocabulary by adding the form of the two-handled drinking cup, the [[kantharos]], and that of the related single-handled cup, the [[kyathos]], to the list of Greek vase types. The [[Nikosthenic amphora]] with its wide, flat handles was yet another example of Greek potters looking to Etruscan prototypes.  The bucchero wares of Etruria even offered some export competition to Greek pottery.

In the production of bucchero sottile, the shape of the pot held pride of place, with surface decoration playing a supporting role. When decoration was used, it was usually limited to enhancing the profile of a [[chalice]], a kantharos, or a kyathos with a row of crisply defined hook notches at the point of [[Siana cup|carination]]. The bowl of an [[oinochoe]] (pitcher) might be emphasized by closely spaced vertical lines incised into the soft clay before firing.  Further decoration could be added before the [[Pottery#Physical stages of clay|green ware]] was loaded into the kiln by using a toothed wheel or a comb-like instrument to create rows of dots arranged in fan patterns. On later examples a roller with recessed reliefs was used to transfer figures of deities or even narratives to the surface of the vessel.

During the Orientalizing period and on into the Archaic, bucchero sottile production continued but gradually lost its unique character as Etruria became increasingly Hellenized. As Rome began to nibble away at the territories of southern Etruria, centers for producing bucchero shifted northwards to the cities of [[Chiusi]] and [[Vulci]]. There, during the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], potters put their stamp upon the bucchero tradition by introducing a new variety of the ceramic known as ''bucchero pesante'', or heavy bucchero.  In this final phase in the history of bucchero pottery, vessel walls become thicker and proportions squater.  The decoration of bucchero pesante ware typically consisted of mold-formed figures applied to the still-damp surface of the pot.  By the beginning of the fifth century B.C.E., in part due to the growing availability of the elegant pottery of Greece, the demand for native bucchero ware was in a steep decline.  Bucchero no longer was exported and, at home, consumers preferred the colorful pottery of the Greek artisans with their narrative and figurative panels. Etruscan potters now devoted their attention to the production of provincial imitations of Greek red-figure vases.

Like most physicians in the early [[Abbasid]] courts, they came from the [[Academy of Gondishapur]] in [[Persia]] (in modern-day southwestern Iran). They were well versed in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hindi]] sciences, including those of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Pythagoras]], and [[Galen]], which they aided in translating while working in [[Gondishapur]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Meyerhof, "An Arabic Compendium of Medico-Philosophical Definitions," Isis 10, no. 2(1928): 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of their integration into the changing society after the [[Islamic invasion of Persia]], the family acquired Arabic while preserving [[Persian language|Persian]] as oral language for about 200 years.&lt;ref name="Lutz Richter-Bernburg 1990"/&gt;

The family was originally from [[Ahvaz]], near Gondeshapur, however they eventually moved to the city of [[Baghdad]] and later on to [[Nsibin]] in Northern [[Syria]], which was part of the [[Persian Empire]] in the [[Sassanid]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R.

There are no known remaining records of the first two members of the family. And the remaining records of the chain start from '''Jurjis'''. But the genealogical sequence follows as:{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Bukhtishu I (بختیشوع اول)===

===Jibrail I (جِبرائیل اول)===

===Jurjis (جرجیس)===
Jurjis, the father of Bukhtishu II and grandfather of Jibril ibn Bukhtishu, was a scientific writer and was the director of the hospital in Gondeshapur, which supplied physicians to courts in Iraq, Syria, and Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Fakhry, "Philosophy and Theology," The Oxford History of Islam, ed. by John L. Esposito. Oxford Islamic Studies Online, http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article.&lt;/ref&gt;   He was called to Baghdad in 765 CE to treat the stomach complaint of the [[Al-Mansur|Caliph al-Mansur]].  After successfully curing the caliph, he was asked to remain in attendance in Baghdad, which he did until he fell ill in 769 CE.&lt;ref&gt;H.A.R Gibb, J.H. Kramers, E. Levi-Provencal, and J. Schacht, eds. Encyclopedia of Islam, New Edition, vol. 1, (Leiden, Netherlands: E.J. Brill, 1960), s.v. "Bukhtishu."&lt;/ref&gt;   Before allowing him to return to Gondeshapur, the caliph invited him to convert to Islam but he declined, saying that he wanted to be with his fathers when he died.  Amused by his obstinacy, the caliph sent an attendant with Jurjis to ensure he reached his destination.  In exchange for the attendant and a 10,000 [[dinar]] wage, Jurjis promised to send his pupil Isa ibn Sahl to the caliph, since his son, Bukhtishu II, could not be spared from the hospital at Gondeshapur.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Browne, Arabian Medicine (Cambridge: University Press, 1921), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bukhtishu II (بختیشوع دوم)===
Bukhtishu II was the son of Jurjis ibn Bukhtishu and the father of Jibril ibn Bukhtishu.  He was left in charge of the hospital at Gondeshapur when his father was summoned to treat the stomach complaints of Caliph al-Mansur.  Jurjis never intended for Bukhtishu II to go to Baghdad and tend to the caliphs and had offered to send one of his pupils in his stead.  Nevertheless, Bukhtishu II was in turn called to the city to treat the [[Al-Hadi|Caliph al-Hadi]], who was gravely ill. He was unable to establish himself in Baghdad until 787 CE, when [[Harun al-Rashid|Caliph Harun al-Rashid]] was suffering violently painful headaches. He successfully treated Harun al-Rashid and in gratitude the caliph made him physician-in-chief, a post he held onto until his death in 801 C.E.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;H.A.R. Gibb, ed. Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Jabril ibn Bukhtishu]] (جبرائیل دوم)===
'''Alternate Spellings:'''
'''Djibril b. Bukhtishu’,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Jibril ibn Bakhtishu',&lt;ref&gt;Andras Hamori, "A Sampling of Pleasant Civilities," Studia Islamica, no. 95(2002): 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jibra’il ibn Bukhtyishu,&lt;ref&gt;[[De Lacy O'Leary]], How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs (London: William Clowes and Sons, Lmtd, 1957), 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  Djabra’il b. Bakhtishu&lt;ref&gt;Timothy S. Miller, "The Knights of Saint John and the Hospitals of the Latin West," Speculum 53, no. 4(1978):725.&lt;/ref&gt;'''

Jibril ibn Bukhtishu was the son of Bukhtishu II, who served the caliphs in Baghdad from 787 CE until his death in 801 CE.  In 791 CE, Bukhtishu II recommended Jibril as a physician to [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar the Barmakid]], the [[vizier]] of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid.  Despite the recommendation, Jibril did not succeed his father until 805 CE, after he successfully treated one of Harun al-Rashid’s slaves, thereby winning the confidence of the caliph.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   
	
During Jibril’s time in Baghdad, he advised Harun al-Rashid in the building of its first hospital.&lt;ref name="Timothy S. Miller, The Knights"&gt;Timothy S. Miller, "The Knights"&lt;/ref&gt;  The hospital and connected observatory was modeled after the one in Gondeshapur where Jibril had studied medicine and served as the director.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Fahkry, "Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;   Jibril also served as the director of this new hospital, which Harun al-Rashid named after himself.&lt;ref name="Timothy S. Miller, The Knights"/&gt;
	
The Abbasid court physicians gained high standing and trust once accepted and employed by the caliph, as illustrated by the anecdote in which Harun al-Rashid used Jibril to try to humble his vizier Yahya al-Barmaki on an occasion when Yahya entered the caliph’s presence without first gaining permission.  In his collection of prose, [[Tha'alibi]] cites a story he heard from al-Babbagha:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Bakhtishu’ ibn Jibril relates from his father…Then al-Rashid turned to me and said, ‘Jibril, is there anyone who would come before you without your permission in your own house?’  I said: ‘No, nor would anyone hope to do that.’  He said: ‘So what is the matter with us that people come in here without permission?’"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After this exchange, Yahya skillfully reminds Harun al-Rashid that he had been granted the privilege of entering his presence without permission by asking the caliph if a change had been made in court etiquette.&lt;ref&gt;Andras Hamori, "A Sampling"&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Being a part of such court interactions, Jibril would occasionally approach the caliph with a level of frankness not allowed most attendants.  During Harun al-Rashid’s final illness, Jibril’s matter-of-fact responses to the caliph won him disgrace and soon after he was condemned to death.  He was saved from execution by [[Fadl ibn al-Rabi]] and subsequently became the physician of [[al-Amin]].  After [[al-Ma'mun]] gained power, Jibril again faced imprisonment, but was needed to treat Hasan ibn Sahl and thus was released in 817 CE.  Three years later he was replaced by his son-in-law, Mikha’il, but was again called to Baghdad in 827 CE when Mikha’il was unable to treat the caliph.  He died in the favor of the caliph sometime between 827 and 829 CE and, being Christian, was buried in the Monastery of St. Sergius in [[Ctesiphon]] which is in modern-day Iraq, on the east bank of the Tigris.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
	
During the ninth and tenth century, the Bukhtishus had a virtual monopoly on the practice of medicine in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Holt, Ann K.S. Lambton, and Bernard Lewis, eds. The Cambridge History of Islam, vol. 2, The Further Islamic Lands, Islamic Society and Civilization (Cambridge: University Press, 1970), 767.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jibril is estimated to have a career income of 88,800,000 [[dirham]]s for serving Harun al-Rashid for 23 years and the Barmakids for 13, which does not include his fees from lesser patients.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Browne, Arabian Medicine, 57&lt;/ref&gt;
	
[[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] gained Jibril's his recommendation after studying Greek for several years, which allowed him to become known in later centuries in both the Near East and in Europe for his translations.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Browne, Arabian Medicine, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bukhtishu III (بختیشوع سوم)===

===Yuhanna ibn Bukhtishu===

===Ubeidullah ibn Bukhtishu (عبیدالله اول)===

===Jibrail III (جبرائیل سوم)===
Jibrail III was the son of [[Abdollah ibn Bukhtishu|Ubayd Allah ibn Bukhtishu]], a finance official for the Caliph al-Muktadir. After his father’s death, his mother married another physician. Jibrail III began studying medicine exclusively in Baghdad, where he went penniless after the death of his mother.  After treating an envoy from [[Kirman]], he was called to [[Shiraz]] by the [[Buyid]] ruler [['Adud al-Dawla]] but soon after he returned to Baghdad. He only left Baghdad for short consultations, even declining an offer from the [[Fatimid]] [[al-Aziz]] who wished to establish him in [[Cairo]]. Jibrail III died on June 8, 1006.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

It runs from Robert's Linn ({{Coord|55|18|56.7|N|2|43|47.56|W|type:landmark}}), a burn (stream) flowing into the [[Slitrig Water]], westward and north-westward to the head of the Dean Burn ({{Coord|55|24|3.74|N|2|59|0.18|W|type:landmark}}), a tributary of the [[Borthwick Water]]. It is about {{convert|11.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} long (as the crow flies), and consists of a ditch and bank. The [[Deil's Dyke]] was once considered to extend to the Catrail.

== Description ==
The Catrail is discontinuous and although the various sections are not fully aligned they are considered parts of a single structure on the grounds that the profile is similar from section to section. Between sections, the line generally seems to follow the courses of streams and rivers. 

In profile, the earthwork consists of a ditch about 6–12&amp;nbsp;ft wide and 2–4.5&amp;nbsp;ft deep, and a parallel embankment about 8–13&amp;nbsp;ft wide and 2&amp;nbsp;ft high. There is generally a lesser bank running along the other side of the ditch which is quite wide but only a few inches high. The main bank is on the north-east side of the ditch. 

The Catrail cuts across the upper Teviot valley, separating the low-lying farmland to the north-east around Hawick in Teviotdale from the hillier up-river country to the south-west.

== Interpretation ==
It is not known when or by whom the Catrail was made, or for what purpose. However, since it is not substantial enough to be an effective military barrier, it seems likely to have been a territorial boundary marker, possibly dating from the [[Early Middle Ages]].

'''''Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past''''' ({{lang-de|Erinnerungen an die Zukunft: Ungelöste Rätsel der Vergangenheit}}; in English, ''Memories of the Future: Unsolved Mysteries of the Past'') is a book written in 1968 by [[Erich von Däniken]] and translated from the original German by Michael Heron. It involves the [[hypothesis]] that the [[technologies]] and [[religion]]s of many [[ancient civilization]]s were given to them by [[ancient astronauts]] who were welcomed as [[deity|gods]].

The first draft of the publication had been rejected by a variety of publishers. The book was extensively rewritten by its editor, [[Wilhelm Roggersdorf]] (a [[pen name]] of the German screenwriter [[Wilhelm "Utz" Utermann]]). Utermann had been a Nazi bestselling author, and had held a leading position with the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]].''&lt;ref name="revealed"&gt;{{cite book | last = Story | first = Ronald | title = The space-gods revealed : a close look at the theories of Erich von Däniken | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = New York | year = 1976 |page= 2| isbn = 0-06-014141-7 }} Citing ''Der Spiegel,'' in issue 12/1969 (March 17, 1969), p. 184 and issue 12/1973 (March 19, 1973), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book1" /&gt;

''Chariots of the Gods'' posits a variety of hypotheses dealing with the possibility of extraterrestrial beings influencing ancient technology. Von Däniken suggests that some ancient structures and artifacts appear to represent higher technological knowledge than is presumed to have existed at the times they were manufactured. Von Däniken maintains that these artifacts were produced either by extraterrestrial visitors or by humans who learned the necessary knowledge from them.&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THT"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Legrand |first1=H.E.|last2=Boese |first2=Wayne E. |date=May 1975 |title=Chariots of the Gods?

The book also suggests that ancient artwork throughout the world could be interpreted as depicting astronauts, air and space vehicles, extraterrestrials, and complex technology. Von Däniken describes elements that he believes are similar in art of unrelated cultures.&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Book2"&gt;{{citation|last = Krassa|first = Peter|title = Erich von Däniken: Disciple of the Gods|publisher = W.H.

The book goes on to suggest that the origins of religions, including interpretations of the Old Testament of the [[Bible]], are reactions to contact with an alien race. According to von Däniken, humans considered the technology of the aliens to be [[supernatural]] and the aliens themselves to be gods. Von Däniken asks if the oral and literal traditions of most religions contain references to visitors from stars and vehicles traveling through air and space. These, he says, should be interpreted as literal descriptions which have changed during the passage of time and become more obscure.&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{citation|title= Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-religions|first= Ronald H. |last= Fritze|year= 2009|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|isbn= 978-1-86189-817-3|pages= 206, 212, footnote 76 in p. 286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eschhofen|first=Dave|title =Stellar Spectra| newspaper =[[The Bryan Times]]| location =|pages =|language =|publisher =|date =25 March 1974|url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&amp;dat=19740325&amp;id=aLhaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JFMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=977,5421677&amp;hl=en|accessdate =20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include [[Ezekiel]]'s vision of the angels and the wheels, which Von Däniken interprets as a description of a [[spacecraft]], the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which is explained as a communication device with an alien race, and the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] by fire and brimstone, which is interpreted as a [[nuclear explosion]].&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArkBook"&gt;{{cite book | last =Price | first =Randall | title =Searching for the Ark of the Covenant: Latest Discoveries and Research | publisher =[[Harvest House]] | series = | volume = | edition = | date =15 February 2005| location = | pages = | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=fTTwrChPOCEC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Chariots+of+the+Gods%22+%22ark+of+the+covenant%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kWEsv4Qbbu&amp;sig=tRQD90dq8fROpjd5bnewXFIOWxg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrtpW1-OHRAhXjjlQKHVnPCGQQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Chariots%20of%20the%20Gods%22%20%22ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0736910521 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney"&gt;{{cite news | last=Ingray| first=G.M.| title ='Chariots' theory – how valid?| newspaper =[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =24 September 1972 | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19720924&amp;id=FKApAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eOUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=838,9986133&amp;hl=en| accessdate =20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Däniken attempts to draw an analogy with the "[[cargo cult]]s" that formed during and after [[World War II]], when once-isolated tribes in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] mistook the advanced American and Japanese soldiers for gods.&lt;ref name="Book1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Book2"/&gt;

Von Däniken also spends around one-third of the book discussing the possibility that humans could theoretically offer primitive civilizations on interstellar worlds advanced technology by the year 2100. This would, he writes, mimic the ancient extraterrestrial contact von Däniken believed to have happened on Earth.&lt;ref name="PS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comic"/&gt;

Von Däniken's book, and such of his subsequent publications as ''Gods From Outer Space'' and ''The Gold Of The Gods,'' have drawn largely negative receptions from the academic mainstream despite being popular best-sellers. Many scientists and historians have rejected his ideas, claiming that the book's conclusions were based on faulty, [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] evidence, some of which was later demonstrated to be fraudulent or fabricated, and under illogical premises. For example, Ronald Story wrote a book rebutting von Däniken's ideas in 1976 titled ''[[The Space Gods Revealed]].'' A similar internationally bestselling book, titled ''Crash Go The Chariots'' and written by Clifford Wilson, had already been published in 1972.

=== Plagiarism controversies ===
Soon after the publication of ''Chariots of the Gods?'', von Däniken was accused of stealing the ideas of French author [[Robert Charroux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | magazine=Der Spiegel | date=March 17, 1969 | title=Däniken: Wer von Wem? | pages=184–185 | url=http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=45763499&amp;aref=image036/2006/02/03/PPM-SP196901201840185.pdf&amp;thumb=false | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306190531/http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=45763499&amp;aref=image036%2F2006%2F02%2F03%2FPPM-SP196901201840185.pdf&amp;thumb=false | archivedate=March 6, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 article in ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcolavito.tripod.com/lostcivilizations/id26.html|title=Charioteer of the Gods|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that von Däniken plagiarized many of the book's concepts from ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]],'' that this book in turn was heavily influenced by the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], and that the core of the [[ancient astronaut]] theory originates in [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s stories "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]" and ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]].''

=== Discredited artifacts ===
[[File:QtubIronPillar.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[iron pillar of Delhi]], erected by Chandragupta II the Great, which von Däniken claimed did not rust.]]
One artifact offered as evidence in the book has been disclaimed by von Däniken himself. ''Chariots'' asserts that a supposedly rust-free [[Iron pillar of Delhi|iron pillar]] in India was evidence of extraterrestrial influence, but von Däniken admitted in a ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' interview that the pillar was man-made and that as far as supporting his theories goes "we can forget about this iron thing." Neither this nor any other discredited evidence, however, has been removed from subsequent editions of ''Chariots of the Gods?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/163029|title=The Case of the Ancient Astronauts|work=BBC 2 | date=1977|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | magazine=Playboy | title=Playboy | page=64 | volume=21 | issue=8 | date=August 1974 | quote='''von Däniken:''' "Oh, God, I have so many times tried to correct things, and my experience has been that the corrections are almost never made."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One book commonly cited in support of von Däniken is ''[[The Spaceships of Ezekiel]]'' by former NASA design engineer Josef F. Blumrich (March 17, 1913 – February 10, 2002), who also wrote a summary article, "The Spaceships of the Prophet Ezekiel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceshipsofezekiel.com/other/Blumrich-article-The-spaceships-of-the-prophet-Ezekiel-linked.pdf] ''Impact of Science on Society'', Volume XXIV, Number 4 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular response ===
''Chariots of the Gods?'' was on [[The New York Times]] bestseller list and helped to launch von Däniken's career as a public speaker. Von Däniken had sold 70 million copies of his books as of January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A UFO convention is heading for Manchester|url=http://aboutmanchester.co.uk/whats-on/a-ufo-convention-is-heading-for-manchester/|accessdate=27 March 2017|publisher=About Winchester|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTGenesis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Aliens will return to Earth within 20 years’, Chariots of the Gods author predicts|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/aliens-will-return-to-earth-within-20-years-chariots-of-the-gods-author-predicts-141829853.html|accessdate=27 March 2017|publisher=Yahoo UK|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted as a German documentary film, ''[[Chariots of the Gods (film)|Chariots of the Gods]],'' produced by Terra-Filmkunst. The film was released in 1970 in [[West Germany]] and first appeared in the [[United States]] the following year. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="NYTReview"&gt;{{cite news | last=Weiler| first=A.H.| title =Sifting Past for Space Visitors' Tracks| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =28 February 1974 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C07E6DA1031EF34BC4051DFB466838F669EDE| accessdate =15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oscars1971"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1971 |title=The 43rd Academy Awards (1971) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=15 March 2017|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, an edited version of the film appeared as a TV documentary called ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of]] Ancient Astronauts'' on [[NBC]] and was produced by [[Alan Landsburg Productions]]. The documentary was narrated by [[Rod Serling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133018/|title=In Search of Ancient Astronauts (TV Movie 1973)|author=|date=January 5, 1973|work=IMDb|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up called ''In Search of Ancient Mysteries'' aired the following year, and it was also narrated by Rod Serling.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;{{cite news| last =Lambert| first =David| title =In Search of... - High-Res Package Art and Exciting New Details for 'The Complete Collection' DVDs!| newspaper =| location =| pages =| language =| publisher =TVShowsonDVD| date =7 September 2012| url =http://tvshowsondvd.com/n/17470| accessdate =15 March 2017| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20180419120556/http://tvshowsondvd.com/n/17470| archivedate =April 19, 2018| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mysr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272134/ |title=In Search of Ancient Mysteries|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary series ''In Search Of...,'' which [[Leonard Nimoy]] hosted after Serling proved to be unavailable, was premiered on the basis of those two "pilot" films.

A different TV documentary, ''The Case of the Ancient Astronauts'' directed by Graham Massey, was released in 1977 and is based on von Däniken's work.&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/163029|title=The Case of the Ancient Astronauts|work=BBC 2 | date=1977|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1977-11-25 |title=Horizon Special |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, von Däniken produced a 25-part series entitled ''Auf den Spuren der All-Mächtigen (Pathways of the Gods)'' for German television station, [[Sat.1]]. In 1996, a one-hour television special called, ''Chariots Of The Gods - The Mysteries Continue'', aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and was produced by ABC/Kane. ABC/Kane produced another television special with von Däniken the following year called ''The Mysterious World – Search for Ancient Technology''. It aired on the [[Discovery Channel]] in the United States and on [[RTL Television|RTL]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Auf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2350796/ |title=Auf den Spuren der All-Mächtigen |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cont"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187779/ |title=Chariots of the Gods?

The global media rights to the book have since been purchased by Media Invest Entertainment which is developing a "360-degree entertainment" franchise entitled ''Chariots of the Gods''.&lt;ref name="Jung"&gt;{{cite news | last=Ostojic| first=Magdalena| title =Von Däniken wieder fest im Sattel| newspaper =Jungfrau Zeitung| location = | pages = | language =German | publisher = | date =18 October 2013 | url =http://www.jungfrauzeitung.ch/artikel/127311/| accessdate =20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kinofilm, Videospiel, TV-Serie: Ufologe von Däniken bald übernatürlich präsent|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/kino_tv/verkauf-von-rechten-kinofilm-videospiel-tv-serie-ufologe-von-daeniken-bald-uebernatuerlich-praesent_id_4115463.html|accessdate=30 January 2017|publisher=Focus|date=9 July 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Chariots of the Gods?'' spawned multiple sequels, including ''Gods from Outer Space'' and ''The Gods Were Astronauts''. The theory in the original book is said to have influenced a variety of science fiction books, films, and television series. For instance, it is considered the inspiration for the [[History Channel]] television series, ''[[Ancient Aliens]]''.&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite news | last=Shermer| first=Michael| title =How Beliefs in Extraterrestrials and Intelligent Design Are Similar| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | work =[[Scientific American]] | date =July 2013 | url =https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-beliefs-extraterrestrials-and-intelligent-design-are-similar/| accessdate =15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a plot element in television shows and movies like ''[[Star Trek]]'' (which actually addressed the question ''before'' von Däniken's book was published), ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' franchise (most notably, ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''), and the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchise (specifically, ''Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull'').&lt;ref name="Comic"&gt;{{cite news | last=Frederiksen| first=Seth| title =Book Review: Chariots Of The Gods| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =ComiConverse | date =29 May 2016 | url =http://comiconverse.com/chariots-of-the-gods-by-erich-von-daniken-review-10454| accessdate =15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tele"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =50 best cult books| newspaper =[[The Daily Telegraph]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =12 March 2016 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/50-best-cult-books/| accessdate =15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Armstrong| first=Laura| title = ET TO PHONE HOME: Aliens are 'watching us and could arrive on Earth in the next 20 years'| newspaper =[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =12 October 2016 | url =https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1964070/aliens-are-watching-us-and-could-arrive-on-earth-in-the-next-20-years/| accessdate =15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =Secrets of Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus': An Earthquake, Never-Seen Photos and Nightmarish Monster | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | work =[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date =16 May 2012 | url =http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ridley-scott-prometheus-alien-blade-runner-324779| accessdate =15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite news | last=Darlage| first=Dale| title =Odyssey of the Gods: The History of Extraterrestrial Contact in Ancient Greece| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =The SF Site | date =2011 | url =https://www.sfsite.com/12b/og358.htm| accessdate =15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Copán Bench Panel''' or ''Copan Bench Panel'' is the name of an important sculpted platform that was originally located in Temple 11 at the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Copán]] in [[Honduras]]. Discovered by the English archaeologist [[Alfred Maudslay]] in the late nineteenth century, it now forms part of the British Museum's extensive collection of ancient artefacts from [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3428767&amp;partId=1&amp;place=9697&amp;plaA=9697-3-1&amp;page=1 British Museum  Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dated to the late 8th Century AD, the panel is both a work of art and a significant historical record of royal authority.

==Description==
The stone bench is composed of two long panels that when aligned together are over 5 metres in length.  Both panels depict twenty seated individuals, split into two groups of ten facing each other, between which is engraved a central panel with [[Maya script|hieroglyphic]] text. The scene portrayed on this enormous sculpture is thought to depict King [[Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat|Yax-Pac]]'s accession to the throne, overseen by his ancestors from previous dynasties. Yax-pac is shown seated to the right of the central text; it is conjectured that the deceased kings' presence helped to justify his claim to the royal throne. The iconagraphy of the bench panel is very similar to the famous [[Copán Altar Q]].

==Provenance==

Maudslay found this bench panel in pieces above a raised platform inside Temple 11 at Copán in 1881. He shipped it to [[England]] along with a number of other sculptures from the site and later donated most of his collection to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], which in turn transferred Maudslay's original sculptures and extensive range of casts to the [[British Museum]] in 1923.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1545">'''Countersigning''' means writing a second [[signature]] onto a [[document]]. For example, a contract or other official document signed by the representative of a company may be countersigned by his supervisor to verify the [[Agency (law)|authority of the representative]]. Also, a [[money order]] or other [[financial instrument]] may be signed once upon receipt, then signed again by the same person when presented for payment, as an indication that the bearer is the same person who originally received the item, and not a thief who has stolen the item before it could be carried to the place where it was to be presented.

An example of where a countersignature is needed is with [[UK]] [[passport]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.gov.uk/passport/apply-countersign.asp |author=UK Identity and Passport Service |title=Who can countersign my application? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420224723/http://www.ips.gov.uk/passport/apply-countersign.asp |archivedate=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] and [[parliamentary republic]]s, an order by the [[head of state]] (monarch or president) is not valid unless countersigned by another authorised relevant person such as the [[head of government]], a responsible minister, or in case of [[promulgation]] of a parliamentary resolution, a [[Chairman|presiding officer]] of the [[legislature]].

==Origin of Name==
[[File:Devils Tower Darton 1900.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Devils Tower, 1900]]
The name Devil's Tower originated in 1875 during an expedition led by Colonel [[Richard Irving Dodge]], when his interpreter reportedly misinterpreted a native name to mean "Bad God's Tower".&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;"Why is it called Devils Tower? Some Indians called it Mato Tipila, meaning Bear Lodge. Other American Indian names include Bear's Tipi, Home of the Bear, Tree Rock and Great Gray Horn. In 1875, on an expedition led by Col. Dodge, it is believed his interpreter misinterpreted the name to mean Bad God's Tower, later shortened to Devils Tower." [http://www.nps.gov/deto/faqs.htm NPS Frequently Asked Questions], accessed July 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; All [[information sign]]s in that area use the name "Devils Tower", following a geographic naming standard whereby the apostrophe is omitted.&lt;ref&gt;"Since its inception in 1890, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names has discouraged the use of the possessive form—the genitive apostrophe and the 's'. The possessive form using an 's' is allowed, but the apostrophe is almost always removed. The Board's archives contain no indication of the reason for this policy." {{cite web

In 2005, a proposal to recognize several Native American ties through the additional designation of the monolith as ''Bear Lodge National Historic Landmark'' met with opposition from United States Representative [[Barbara Cubin]], arguing that a "name change will harm the tourist trade and bring economic hardship to area communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/cubin/news/2005/March08e.html |title=Cubin Fights Devils Tower Name Change |access-date=July 22, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226230212/http://www.house.gov/cubin/news/2005/March08e.html |archivedate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, one Arvol Looking Horse again proposed renaming the geographical feature "Bear Lodge", and submitted the request to the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]].

The landscape surrounding Devils Tower is composed mostly of [[sedimentary rock]]s. The oldest rocks visible in Devils Tower National Monument were laid down in a shallow sea during the mid- to late-[[Triassic]] period, 225 to 195 million years ago. This dark red [[sandstone]] and maroon [[siltstone]], interbedded with [[shale]], can be seen along the [[Belle Fourche River]]. [[Redox|Oxidation]] of iron minerals causes the redness of the rocks. This rock layer is known as the [[Spearfish Formation]].

Above the Spearfish Formation is a thin band of white [[gypsum]], called the [[Gypsum Springs Formation]]. This layer of gypsum was deposited during the [[Jurassic]] period, 195 to 136 million years ago.

Created as sea levels and climates repeatedly changed, gray-green shales (deposited in low-oxygen environments such as marshes) were interbedded with fine-grained sandstones, [[limestone]]s, and sometimes thin beds of red [[mudstone]]. This composition, called the Stockade Beaver member, is part of the [[Sundance Formation]]. The Hulett Sandstone member, also part of the Sundance Formation, is composed of yellow fine-grained sandstone. Resistant to weathering, it forms the nearly vertical cliffs that encircle the Tower.

During the [[Paleocene]] Epoch, 56 to 66 million years ago, the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Black Hills]] were uplifted. [[Magma]] rose through the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], intruding into the existing sedimentary rock layers.&lt;ref name=NPSGeo&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/deto/naturescience/geologicformations.htm National Park Service: Devils Tower: Geologic Formations]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of formation===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
[[File:Phonolite Porphyry of Devils Tower in Wyoming in USA - with scale.jpg|thumb|alt=Coarse gray rock surface in close-up|[[Porphyritic]] [[phonolite]], the rock type of which Devils Tower is made]]
[[File:DevilsTowerCloseupByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|Close-up of the columns]]
Geologists Carpenter and Russell studied Devils Tower in the late 19th century and came to the conclusion that it was formed by an [[Igneous rock|igneous]] [[Intrusive rock|intrusion]]. Modern geologists agree that it was formed by the intrusion of igneous material, but not on exactly how that process took place. Several believe the molten rock composing the Tower might not have surfaced; others are convinced the tower is all that remains of what once was a large explosive [[volcano]].

In 1907, scientists Darton and O'Hara{{who|date=October 2018}} decided that Devils Tower must be an eroded remnant of a [[laccolith]].{{fact|date=October 2018}} A laccolith is a large mass of igneous rock which is intruded through sedimentary rock beds without reaching the surface, but makes a rounded bulge in the sedimentary layers above. This theory was quite popular in the early 20th century, since numerous studies had earlier been done on laccoliths in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]].

Other theories have suggested that Devils Tower is a [[volcanic plug]] or that it is the neck of an extinct volcano. Some pyroclastic material of the same age as Devils Tower has been identified elsewhere in Wyoming.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The igneous material that forms the Tower is a [[phonolite]] [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] intruded about 40.5 million years ago,&lt;ref name=Bassett&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.134.3487.1373| issn = 0036-8075| volume = 134| issue = 3487| pages = 1373–1373| last = Bassett| first = W. A.| title = Potassium-Argon Age of Devils Tower, Wyoming| journal = Science| date = October 1961| bibcode = 1961Sci...134.1373B| pmid=17807346}}&lt;/ref&gt; a light to dark-gray or greenish-gray igneous rock with conspicuous crystals of white [[feldspar]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, A. R. (1987) ''Alkaline Rocks and Carbonatites of the World, Part 1: North and South America'', London, British Museum (Natural History), page 126&lt;/ref&gt; As the magma cooled, [[hexagon]]al (and sometimes 4-, 5-, and 7-sided) [[columnar jointing|columns]] formed, each about six feet in diameter. As the rock continued to cool, the vertical columns shrank in width and cracks began to occur at 120-degree angles, generally forming compact 6-sided columns. The nearby [[Missouri Buttes]], {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} to the northwest of Devils Tower, are also composed of columnar phonolite of the same age. [[Devils Postpile National Monument]] in [[California]] and [[Giant's Causeway]] in [[Northern Ireland]], are also [[Basalt|columnar basalt]], which are superficially similar, but with columns typically {{convert|2|ft|m}} in diameter.

Devils Tower did not visibly protrude out of the landscape until the overlying sedimentary rocks [[erosion|eroded]] away. As the elements wore down the softer sandstones and shales, the more resistant igneous rock making up the tower survived the erosional forces. As a result, the gray columns of Devils Tower began to appear as an isolated mass above the landscape.

As rain and snow continue to erode the sedimentary rocks surrounding the Tower's base, more of Devils Tower will be exposed. Nonetheless, the exposed portions of the Tower still experience certain amounts of erosion. Cracks along the columns are subject to water and ice erosion. Erosion due to the expansion of ice along cracks and fractures within rock formations is common in colder climates, a prime example being the columnar “hoodoo” formations at [[Bryce Canyon National Park]]. Portions, or even entire columns, of rock at Devils Tower are continually breaking off and falling. Piles of broken columns, boulders, small rocks, and stones, called [[scree]], lie at the base of the tower, indicating that it was once wider than it is today.&lt;ref name=NPSGeo /&gt;

==Native American culture==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
[[File:2003-08-16 Devils Tower advisory.jpg|thumb|A sign informs visitors of the Native American heritage.]]
According to the Native American tribes of the [[Kiowa]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]], a group of girls went out to play and were spotted by several giant bears, who began to chase them. In an effort to escape the bears, the girls climbed atop a rock, fell to their knees, and prayed to the [[Great Spirit]] to save them. Hearing their prayers, the Great Spirit made the rock rise from the ground towards the heavens so that the bears could not reach the girls. The bears, in an effort to climb the rock, left deep claw marks in the sides, which had become too steep to climb. Those are the marks which appear today on the sides of Devils Tower. When the girls reached the sky, they were turned into the stars of the [[Pleiades]].

Another version tells that two [[Sioux]] boys wandered far from their village when Mato the bear, a huge creature that had claws the size of [[tipi]] poles, spotted them, and wanted to eat them for breakfast. He was almost upon them when the boys prayed to [[Wakan Tanka]] the Creator to help them. They rose up on a huge rock, while Mato tried to get up from every side, leaving huge scratch marks as he did. Finally, he sauntered off, disappointed and discouraged. The bear came to rest east of the [[Black Hills]] at what is now [[Bear Butte]]. Wanblee, the eagle, helped the boys off the rock and back to their village. A painting depicting this legend by artist [[Herbert A. Collins]] hangs over the fireplace in the visitor's center at Devils Tower.

In a [[Cheyenne]] version of the story, the giant bear pursues the girls and kills most of them. Two sisters escape back to their home with the bear still tracking them. They tell two boys that the bear can only be killed with an arrow shot through the underside of its foot. The boys have the sisters lead the bear to Devils Tower and trick it into thinking they have climbed the rock. The boys attempt to shoot the bear through the foot while it repeatedly attempts to climb up and slides back down leaving more claw marks each time. The bear was finally scared off when an arrow came very close to its left foot. This last arrow continued to go up and never came down.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marquis|Marquis]], pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wooden Leg]], a Northern Cheyenne, related another legend told to him by an old man as they were traveling together past the Devils Tower around 1866–1868. An Indian man decided to sleep at the base of Bear Lodge next to a buffalo head. In the morning he found that both he and the buffalo head had been transported to the top of the rock by the Great Medicine with no way down. He spent another day and night on the rock with no food or water. After he had prayed all day and then gone to sleep, he awoke to find that the Great Medicine had brought him back down to the ground, but left the buffalo head at the top near the edge. Wooden Leg maintained that the buffalo head was clearly visible through the old man's spyglass. At the time, the tower had never been climbed and a buffalo head at the top was otherwise inexplicable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marquis|Marquis]], pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

The buffalo head gives this story special significance for the Northern Cheyenne. All the Cheyenne maintained in their camps a sacred teepee to the Great Medicine containing the tribal sacred objects. In the case of the Northern Cheyenne, the sacred object was a buffalo head.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marquis|Marquis]] p. 106 and p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Fur trappers may have visited Devils Tower, but they left no written evidence of having done so. The first documented Caucasian visitors were several members of Captain [[William F. Raynolds]]' 1859 [[Raynolds Expedition|expedition to Yellowstone]]. Sixteen years later, Colonel [[Richard Irving Dodge|Richard I. Dodge]] escorted an Office of Indian Affairs scientific survey party to the massive rock formation and coined the name Devils Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodge|first=Richard|title=The Black Hills journals of Colonel Richard Irving Dodge|year=1996|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-2846-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggv-JLih54AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Wayne R. Kime|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing its unique characteristics, the [[United States Congress]] designated the area a U.S. forest reserve in 1892 and in 1906 Devils Tower became the nation's first [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]].&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite web|title=Listing of National Park System Areas by State |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/nps/nps/part2.htm#deto |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=June 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629022806/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/nps/nps/part2.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climbing==
{{Main|Durrance Route}}
[[File:Devls Tower Ladder.jpg|thumb|left|Old climbing ladder on Devil's Tower]]
In recent years, climbing Devils Tower has increased in popularity. The first known ascent of Devils Tower by any method occurred on July 4, 1893, and is accredited to William Rogers and Willard Ripley, local ranchers in the area. They completed this first ascent after constructing a ladder of wooden pegs driven into cracks in the rock face. A few of these wooden pegs are still intact and are visible on the tower when hiking along the {{convert|1.3|mi|km|adj=on}} Tower Trail at Devils Tower National Monument. Over the following thirty years many climbs were made using this method before the ladder fell into disrepair.

The first ascent using modern climbing techniques was made by [[Fritz Wiessner]] with William P. House and Lawrence Coveney in 1937. Wiessner led almost the entire climb [[free climbing|free]], placing only a single piece of fixed gear, a [[piton]], which he later regretted, deeming it unnecessary.

In 1941 George Hopkins parachuted onto Devils Tower, without permission, as a publicity stunt resulting from a bet. He had intended to descend by a 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft (300&amp;nbsp;m) rope dropped to him after successfully landing on the butte, but the package containing the rope, a sledge hammer and a car axle to be driven into the rock as an anchor point slid over the edge. As the weather deteriorated, a second attempt was made to drop equipment, but Hopkins deemed it unusable after the rope became snarled and frozen due to the rain and wind. Hopkins was stranded for six days, exposed to cold, rain and 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds before a mountain rescue team led by [[Jack Durrance]], who had successfully climbed Devils Tower in 1938, finally reached him and brought him down.&lt;ref&gt;John Darwin Dorst, ''Looking West'', p.202, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0812214404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6zwcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=01oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4384,3275166 "Parachutist gains five pounds while stranded on rock"], ''The Victoria Advocate'', October 7, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; His entrapment and subsequent rescue was widely covered by the media of the time.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0915F73A5B147B93C5A9178BD95F458485F9 "Alpinists bring down man on Devil's Tower; 'rather go back than face crowd,' he says"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. 25, October 7, 1941.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, hundreds of climbers scale the sheer rock walls of Devils Tower each summer. The most common route is the [[Durrance Route]], which was the second [[free climbing|free]] route established in 1938. There are many established and documented [[climbing route]]s covering every side of the tower, ascending the various vertical cracks and columns of the rock. The difficulty of these routes range from relatively easy to some of the most challenging in the world. All climbers are required to register with a park ranger before and after attempting a climb. No overnight camping at the summit is allowed; climbers return to base on the same day they ascend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devilstowerclimbing.com/climbing/ devilstowerclimbing.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tower is sacred to several Plains tribes, including the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Cheyenne]] and [[Kiowa]]. Because of this, many Indian leaders objected to climbers ascending the monument, considering this to be a desecration. The climbers argued that they had a right to climb the Tower, since it is on federal land. A compromise was eventually reached with a voluntary climbing ban during the month of June when the tribes are conducting ceremonies around the monument. Climbers are asked, but not required, to stay off the Tower in June. According to the [[PBS]] documentary ''In the Light of Reverence'', approximately 85% of climbers honor the ban and voluntarily choose not to climb the Tower during the month of June. However, several climbers along with the [[Mountain States Legal Foundation]] sued the Park Service, claiming an inappropriate government entanglement with religion.&lt;ref name=test&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040820181334/http://www.sacredland.org/ITLOR_pages/three_stories.html Sacred Land Film Project], Devils Tower.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disease burden''' is the impact of a [[health problem]] as measured by [[financial cost]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], [[morbidity]], or other indicators. It is often quantified in terms of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs) or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs), both of which quantify the number of years lost due to disease (YLDs). One DALY can be thought of as one year of healthy life lost, and the overall disease burden can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current health status and the ideal health status (where the individual lives to [[old age]] free from disease and [[disability]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease.pdf | last1=Prüss-Üstün | first1=Annette | last2 = Corvalán | first2=Carlos|year =2006 |title=Preventing disease through healthy environments: Towards an estimate of the environmental burden of disease | publisher =World Health Organization | work = Quantifying environmental health impacts }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kay00"&gt;{{cite conference| first1=David |last1=Kay | first2=Annette |last2=Prüss |first3=Carlos |last3=Corvalán |title=Methodology for assessment of Environmental burden of disease |booktitle=ISEE session on environmental burden of disease |location=Buffalo |date=23–24 August 2000 |url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/methods/en/wsh0007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in June 2015, low back pain and major depressive disorder were among the top ten causes of YLDs and were the cause of more health loss than diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma combined.

==History==

The first study on the [[global burden of disease]], conducted in 1990, quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the DALY as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

==Modifiable risk factors==

In 2006, the WHO released a report which addressed the amount of global disease that could be prevented by reducing environmental risk factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; The report found that approximately one fourth of the global disease burden and more than one third of the burden among children was due to modifiable environmental factors. The "environmentally-mediated" disease burden is much higher in developing countries, with the exception of certain [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[cardiovascular disease]]s and cancers, where the [[per capita]] disease burden is larger in [[developed countries]]. Children have the highest death toll, with more than 4 million environmentally-caused deaths yearly, mostly in [[developing countries]]. The [[infant death rate]] attributed to environmental causes is also 12 times higher in developing countries. 85 out of the 102 major diseases and injuries classified by WHO were due to environmental factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

To measure the environmental health impact, ''environment'' was defined as "all the physical, chemical and biological factors external to a person, and all the related behaviours".&lt;ref name="whatisenv"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease2.pdf|title=What is the environment in the context of health?|work=Environmental burden of disease series|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of ''modifiable environment'' included:
*Air, soil, and water pollution with [[chemical]]s or [[biological agent]]s
*[[Ultraviolet]] and [[ionizing radiation]]
*[[Noise pollution|Noise]] and [[electromagnetic field]]s
*[[Built environment]]
* Agricultural methods and [[irrigation]] schemes
*[[Human impact on the environment|Man-made climate change]] and ecosystem degradation
*[[Occupational hazard|Occupational risks]]
*Individual behaviors, such as hand-washing and [[food contamination]] due to unsafe water or dirty hands&lt;ref name="whatisenv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantification of the disease burden attributable to environmental risk factors|year=2010|work=Programme on quantifying environmental health impacts|author=Department of Public Health and Environment|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/summaryEBD_updated.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain environmental factors were excluded from this definition:
*Indoor smoke from [[solid fuel]] use
*Lead
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]&lt;ref name="oberg10"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Öberg, M.|author2=Jaakkola, M.S.|author3=Prüss-Üstün, A.|author4=Schweizer, C.|author5=Woodward, A.|year=2010|title=Second-hand smoke: Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels|publisher=World Health Organization|work=Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimation==

The WHO developed a methodology to quantify the health of a population using summary measures, which combine information on mortality and non-fatal health outcomes. The measures quantify either health gaps or health expectancies; the most commonly used health summary measure is the DALY.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification" /&gt;

The exposure-based approach, which measures exposure via [[pollutant]] levels, is used to calculate the environmental burden of disease.&lt;ref name="knol05"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knol|first1=A.B.|last2=Staatsen|first2=B.A.M.|title=Trends in the environmental burden of disease in the Netherlands, 1980–2020|date=8 August 2005|publisher=National Institute of Public Health and the Environment|url=http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/500029001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires knowledge of the outcomes associated with the relevant risk factor, exposure levels and distribution in the [[study population]], and [[dose-response relationship]]s of the pollutants.

A dose-response relationship is a function of the exposure parameter assessed for the study population.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt; Exposure distribution and dose-response relationships are combined to yield the study population's ''health impact distribution'', usually expressed in terms of [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]. The health impact distribution can then be converted into health summary measures, such as DALYs. Exposure-response relationships for a given risk factor are commonly obtained from [[epidemiological studies]].&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt; For example, the disease burden of outdoor air pollution for [[Santiago, Chile]], was calculated by measuring the concentration of [[atmospheric particulate matter]] (PM10), estimating the susceptible population, and combining these data with relevant dose-response relationships. A reduction of particulate matter levels in the air to recommended standards would cause a reduction of about 5,200 deaths, 4,700 respiratory [[hospital admission]]s, and 13,500,000 days of restricted activity per year, for a total population of 4.7 million.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;

In 2002, the WHO estimated the global environmental burden of disease by using [[risk assessment]] data to develop environmentally attributable fractions (EAFs) of mortality and morbidity for 85 categories of disease.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fewtrell07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241595759_eng.pdf|last1=Fewtrell|first1=Lorna|last2=Prüss-Üstün|first2=Annette|last3=Bos|first3=Robert|last4=Gore|first4=Fiona|last5=Bartram|first5=Jamie|title=Water, sanitation and hygiene: quantifying the health impact at national and local levels in countries with incomplete water supply and sanitation coverage|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2007|work=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, they released the first country-by-country analysis of the impact environmental factors had on health for its then 192 member states. These country estimates were the first step to assist governments in carrying out [[preventive action]]. The country estimates were divided into three parts:

;Environmental burden of disease for selected risk factors
:This presents the yearly burden, expressed in deaths and DALYs, attributable to: [[Indoor air quality|indoor air pollution]] from [[solid fuel]] use; outdoor air pollution; and unsafe water, [[sanitation]], and [[hygiene]]. Results are calculated using the exposure-based approach.
;Total environmental burden of disease for the relevant country
:The total number of deaths, DALYs per capita, and the percentage of the national burden of disease attributable to the environment represent the disease burden that could be avoided by modifying the environment as a whole.
;Environmental burden by disease category
:Each country summary was broken down by the disease group, where the annual number of DALYs per capita attributable to environmental factors were calculated for each group.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;

==Implementation and interpretation==

The public health impacts of air pollution (annual means of PM10 and ozone), noise pollution, and radiation ([[radon]] and UV), can be quantified using DALYs. For each disease, a DALY is calculated as:
:DALYs = number of people with the disease × duration of the disease (or loss of [[life expectancy]] in the case of mortality) × severity (varying from 0 for perfect health to 1 for death)

Necessary data include [[prevalence]] data, exposure-response relationships, and weighting factors that give an indication of the severity of a certain disorder. When information is missing or vague, experts will be consulted in order to decide which alternative data sources to use. An uncertainty analysis is carried out so as to analyze the effects of different assumptions.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Uncertainty===

When estimating the environmental burden of disease, a number of potential sources of error may arise in the measure of exposure and exposure-risk relationship, assumptions made in applying the exposure or exposure-risk relationship to the relevant country, health statistics, and, if used, expert opinions.

Generally, it is not possible to estimate a formal [[confidence interval]], but it is possible to estimate a range of possible values the environmental disease burden may take based on different input parameters and assumptions.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; When more than one definition has to be made about a certain element in the assessment, multiple analyses can be run, using different sets of definitions. [[Sensitivity analysis|Sensitivity]] and [[Decision analysis|decision analyses]] can help determine which sources of uncertainty affect the final results the most.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

==Representative examples==

===The Netherlands===

In [[the Netherlands]], air pollution is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and exposure to certain forms of radiation can lead to the development of cancer. Quantification of the health impact of the environment was done by calculating DALYs for air pollution, noise, radon, UV, and indoor dampness for the period 1980 to 2020. In the Netherlands, 2–5% of the total disease burden in 2000 could be attributed to the effects of (short-term) exposure to air pollution, noise, radon, natural UV radiation, and [[dampness]] in houses. The percentage can increase to up to 13% due to uncertainty, assuming no threshold.

Among the investigated factors, long-term PM10 exposure have the greatest impact on [[public health]]. As levels of PM10 decrease, related disease burden is also expected to decrease. Noise exposure and its associated disease burden is likely to increase to a level where the disease burden is similar to that of traffic accidents. The rough estimates do not provide a complete picture of the environmental health burden, because data are uncertain, not all environmental-health relationships are known, not all environmental factors have been included, and it was not possible to assess all potential health effects. The effects of a number of these assumptions were evaluated in an uncertainty analysis.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Canada===

Exposure to environmental hazards may cause [[chronic disease]]s, so the magnitude of their contribution to the Canada's total disease burden is not well understood. In order to give an initial estimate of the environmental burden of disease for four major categories of disease, the {{abbr|EAF|environmentally attributable fractions}} developed by the WHO, EAFs developed by other researchers, and data from Canadian public health institutions were used.&lt;ref name="wigmore"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wigmore, Cameron|date=2 November 2007|title=Study: Environmental burden of disease in Canada|url=https://greenparty.ca/fr/node/3079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed a total of 10,000–25,000 deaths, with 78,000–194,000 hospitalizations; 600,000–1.5 million days spent in hospital; 1.1–1.8 million restricted activity days for sufferers of [[asthma]]; 8000–24,000 new cases of cancer; 500–2,500 babies with low [[birth weight]]s; and [[Canadian dollar|C$]]3.6–9.1 billion in costs each year due to respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, cancer, and congenital affliction associated with adverse environmental exposures.&lt;ref name="wigmore" /&gt;

==Criticism==

There is no consensus on the best measures of the public’s health. This is not surprising because measurements are used to accomplish diverse functions (e.g., population health assessment, evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions, formulation of health policies, and projection of future resource need).  The choice of measures may also depend on individual and societal values.  Measures that only consider premature death will omit the burden of living with a disease or disability, and measures that combine both in a single measure (i.e. DALYs) need to make a judgment to the significance of these measures compared to each other. Other metrics such as economic costs will not capture pain and suffering or other broader aspects of burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0033-3549 | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=14–22 | last=Thacker | first=Stephen B |author2=Stroup, Donna F |author3=Carande-Kulis, Vilma |author4=Marks, James S |author5=Roy, Kakoli |author6= Gerberding, Julie L  | title=Measuring the Public's Health | journal=Public Health Reports | year= 2006 |pmc=1497799 | pmid=16416694 | doi=10.1177/003335490612100107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DALYs are a simplification of a complex reality, and therefore only give a crude indication of environmental health impact. Relying on DALYs may make donors take a narrow approach to health care programs. [[Foreign aid]] is most often directed at diseases with the highest DALYs, ignoring the fact that other diseases, despite having lower DALYs, are still major contributors to disease burden. Less-publicized diseases thus have little or no funding for health efforts. For example, maternal death (one of the top three killers in most poor countries) and pediatric respiratory and intestinal infections maintain a high disease burden, and safe pregnancy and the prevention of coughs in infants do not receive adequate funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0015-7120 | issue=January/February 2007 | last=Garrett | first=Laurie | title=The Challenge of Global Health | journal=Foreign Affairs | date=1 January 2007 | url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/doc/2010_GARRETT_Challenge_of_Global_Health.pdf|volume=86|pages=14–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ellipsoid revolution oblate aab auxiliary sphere.svg|thumb|right|200px |A sphere of radius ''a'' compressed to an oblate ellipsoid of revolution.]]
'''Flattening''' is a measure of the compression of a [[circle]] or [[sphere]] along a diameter to form an [[ellipse]] or an [[ellipsoid]] of revolution ([[spheroid]]) respectively. Other terms used are '''ellipticity''', or '''oblateness'''. The usual notation for flattening is ''f'' and its definition in terms of the semi-axes of the resulting ellipse or ellipsoid is
::&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{flattening} = f =\frac {a - b}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The compression factor is ''b/a'' in each case. For the ellipse, this factor is also the aspect ratio of the ellipse.

There are two other variants of flattening (see below) and when it is necessary to avoid confusion the above flattening is called the '''first flattening'''. The following definitions may be found in standard texts&lt;ref name=maling&gt;{{cite book | last=Maling |first=Derek Hylton | title=Coordinate Systems and Map Projections |edition=2nd |year=1992 | publisher =[[Pergamon Press]]|location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-08-037233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{cite book |author=Snyder, John P. | title=Map Projections: A Working Manual |series=U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper |volume=1395 | year=1987| publisher =[[United States Government Printing Office]] |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/pp/pp1395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=torge&gt;Torge, W.

== Definitions of flattening ==
In the following, ''a'' is the larger dimension (e.g. semimajor axis), whereas ''b'' is the smaller (semiminor axis).  All flattenings are zero for a circle (''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'').

==Identities involving flattening==
The flattenings are related to other parameters of the ellipse. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
b&amp;=a(1-f)=a\left(\frac{1-n}{1+n}\right),\\
 e^2&amp;=2f-f^2 = \frac{4n}{(1+n)^2}.\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]].

==Numerical values for planets==
For the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid to model [[Earth]], the ''defining'' values are&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350_2.html The WGS84 parameters are listed in the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication TR8350.2] page 3-1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
::''a'' (equatorial radius): 6 378 137.0&amp;nbsp;m
:: 1/''f'' (inverse flattening): 298.257 223 563
from which one derives
:: ''b'' (polar radius): 6 356 752.3142&amp;nbsp;m,
so that the difference of the major and minor semi-axes is {{convert|21.385|km|0|abbr=on}}. (This is only &amp;nbsp;0.335% of the major axis, so a representation of Earth on a computer screen would be sized as 300px by 299px. Because this would be virtually indistinguishable from a sphere shown as 300px by 300px, illustrations typically greatly exaggerate the flattening in cases where the image needs to represent Earth's oblateness.)

Other values in the Solar System are [[Jupiter]], &amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/16; [[Saturn]], &amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/10, the [[Moon]] &amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/900. The flattening of the [[Sun]] is about {{val|9|e=-6}}.

==Origin of flattening==
In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' in which he included a proof that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate [[ellipsoid]] of revolution (a [[spheroid]]).&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Isaac Newton:''Principia'' Book III Proposition XIX Problem III, p. 407 in [https://archive.org/stream/ost-physics-newtonspmathema00newtrich/newtonspmathema00newtrich#page/n411/mode/2up Andrew Motte translation]&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of flattening depends on the [[density]] and  the balance of [[gravitational force]] and [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]].

It is a member of the Southern branch of English-based Eastern Atlantic Creoles, along with [[Antiguan Creole]] ([[Antigua and Barbuda]]), [[Bajan Creole]] ([[Barbados]]), [[Guyanese Creole]] ([[Guyana]]), [[Tobagonian Creole]], [[Trinidadian Creole]] ([[Trinidad and Tobago]]), [[Vincentian Creole]] ([[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]), and [[Virgin Islands Creole]] ([[Virgin Islands]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90706 Ethnologue report for Southern&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the common [[Vernacular|vernacular]] and the native language of nearly all inhabitants of Grenada, or approximately 89,000 native speakers in 2001.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gcl Ethnologue report for language code:gcl&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The older '''Grenadian Creole French''' is a variety of [[Antillean Creole French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=acf Ethnologue report for language code:acf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In Grenada, and among Grenadians, it is referred to as ''Patois'' or ''[[French language|French]] [[Patois]]''. This was once the lingua franca in Grenada.  In the 18th and 19th centuries the large majority of the inhabitants spoke French or Creole French, despite that the new British administrators spoke English.

Creole French was commonly heard as recently as 1930, when children in rural areas could speak it. In the twenty-first century, it can only be heard among elderly speakers in a few small pockets of the country.  Senior citizens still speak Creole French, but they are becoming fewer and fewer because, unlike [[St. Lucia]] and [[Dominica]] (which lie close to the French islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]), Grenada does not have French-speaking neighbours to keep that language alive. Nevertheless, conversations in Grenadian English are liberally sprinkled with [[French-based creole languages|Creole French]] words and phrases.

==History==
The first successful settlement by a western colonial power was in 1650, when the [[France|French]] from [[Martinique]] established friendly contact with the native [[Island Caribs|Caribs]]. Grenada was colonised successfully, for the first time, by the French in 1650 and there was an unbroken period of French administration until 1763, one hundred and thirteen years, before the island passed into British hands. After the British had been in possession for about sixteen years, the French recaptured the island in 1779 after a bloody battle. [[St. George's, Grenada|Fort Royal]] (later St. George) was sacked and pillaged. Tensions were high. The new French occupiers made things very rough for the British settlors and French customs, French traditions and the French language were predominant.

The [[Great Britain|British]] took control of the island in the 18th century, and ruled until its independence in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grenadaguide.com/History.htm Grenada - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the long history of British rule, Grenada's French heritage is still evidenced by the number of French [[loanword]]s in Grenadian Creole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grenada-history.org/french.htm French Creole in Grenada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The francophone character of Grenada was uninterrupted for more than a century before British rule.  This ensured that language in Grenada could never be seen unless in that light.

The Grenada Creole Society, founded in 2009, implemented the mission to research and document the language in Grenada. The initial findings were published in 2012 in the publication ''Double Voicing and Multiplex Identities'' ed. Nicholas Faraclas et al. A comprehensive history of the francophone Creole language in Grenada is presented in ''Lingering Effects of an Ancient Afro-Romance Language on Common Speech in the Caribbean Island of Grenada '' (2012) Auth. Marguerite-Joan Joseph.

'''Hecatomnus of [[Mylasa]]''' or  '''Hekatomnos''' ({{lang-el|Ἑκατόμνος}}) was an early 4th-century BC ruler of [[Caria]]. He was the [[satrap]] (governor) of Caria for the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid]] king [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] (404&amp;ndash;358 BC). However, the basis for Hecatomnus' political power was twofold: he was both a high appointed Persian official and a powerful local dynast, who founded the hereditary dynasty of the [[Hecatomnids]].

==Biography==
Hecatomnus was the son and successor of Hyssaldomus, a dynastic ruler of Mylasa. It is likely that Hecatomnus had been a supporter of [[Tissaphernes]] and might have been employed by him in the subordinate office of hyparch.&lt;ref&gt;Ruzicka, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

At some time after 395 BC &lt;ref&gt;Tissaphernes who was satrap of Lydia and Caria was executed in 395.&lt;/ref&gt; Hecatomnus became the first satrap of Caria, which was until then part of other satrapies, usually that of Lydia. The designation of Caria as a separate satrapy was part of a reorganization of Persian power in western Anatolia by [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] in the aftermath of [[Cyrus the Younger|Cyrus]]'s revolt. Hecatomnus was the first non-Persian official to be elevated to the position of satrap.

He acceded as satrap perhaps in 394 BC,&lt;ref&gt;John Hazel, ''Who's Who in the Greek World'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; but no later than 390 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Sherwin-White, ''Ancient Cos'', 1978, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; when he was appointed by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king to command the naval forces destined to take part in the war against [[Evagoras I]] of [[Cyprus]]{{r|phot_diod_14.98}}.

[[Isocrates]]{{r|isoc}} states that he was still ruling in 380 BC. Stephen Ruzicka places his death in 377/376 BC &lt;ref&gt;Ruzicka, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

He left three sons, [[Mausolus]], [[Idrieus]] and [[Pixodarus of Caria|Pixodarus]], and two daughters, [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]] and [[Ada of Caria|Ada]], who were married to their brothers, Mausolus and Idrieus{{r|strab_14_arr_1.23}}, all five of whom in turn succeeded him as rulers.

==Alleged collusion with Evagoras==
[[File:Moneta di hekatomnos, 392-377 ac..JPG|thumb|Hecatomnus coin, [[Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology]].]]
Two ancient sources, Diodorus {{r|diod_15.2}} and Isocrates, report that Hecatomnus secretly supplied [[Evagoras I|Evagoras]] with sums of money to raise mercenary troops and was in fact ready to rise against the Persian King. However, Ruzicka strongly doubts the veracity of these reports.&lt;ref&gt;Ruzicka, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Hecatomnus had not shown at any other time insubordination or disaffection towards the Persian monarchy. Unlike other rebellious satraps ([[Cyrus the Younger]] or Pissuthnes, for example) Hecatomnus was not a Persian of noble or royal blood and could not hope to win the allegiance of other Persian officials. Thus, it seems highly unlikely that he would have engaged in treasonous activity without any tangible hope to benefit from it.

Ruzicka offers two possible explanations for the reports by Diodorus and Isocrates, which must have been based on some contemporary rumours. In both cases he names Evagoras as the likely source of the rumours.

(i) Evagoras might have wanted to compromise Hecatomnus in the eyes of his master, Artaxerxes. Later, he managed to engineer the recall and disgrace of another satrap ([[Orontes I|Orontes]]) who was campaigning against him.&lt;ref&gt;Ruzicka, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

(ii) Evagoras might have wanted to create the impression that Hecatomnus was his secret ally in order to impress the Egyptian king [[Hakor]] with whom he was negotiating for support against Artaxerxes. From Egypt the rumour could have filtered to Athens through the Athenian general [[Chabrias]] who was then serving with Hakor as a military adviser.&lt;ref&gt;Ruzicka, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coinage==
Hecatomnus was a native of [[Milas|Mylasa]], and made that city his capital and the seat of his government. Hence the figure of [[Zeus]] Labrandenos appears on his coins walking and carrying a [[labrys]] over his shoulder, from the celebrated temple of that name near Mylasa.{{r|strab_14}}

==Tomb==
[[File:Hekatomnos tomb frescoe.jpg|thumb|Hekatomnos tomb fresco.]]
In 2010 police arrested looters digging for antiquities in what later was believed to be the tomb of Hecatomnus.&lt;ref name="tomb"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gW3NXMpqaEDIu9Hu5YaCREYuwxeAD9HIJI5O0 "Turkey Discovers Ancient Underground Tomb."] ''[[Associated Press]].'' August 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A marble sarcophagus and numerous frescoes were discovered in the tomb, although many relics had already been taken from the tomb and sold on the black market.&lt;ref name="tomb" /&gt; The Mausoleum is now classified as a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.&lt;ref&gt;Mausoleum and Sacred area of Hecatomnus: http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5729/&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered very important for understanding of Carian art and craftsmanship as it was built by their best architects and sculptors and was a predecessor of the magnificent [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]].

Recently a golden crown stolen from the tomb has been identified and agreed to be returned to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Golden crown of Hecatomnus to be returned to Turkey: https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2017/12/golden-crown-of-hecatomnus-to-be.html#H4j4Ai1DMFq2gekO.99&lt;/ref&gt;

These areas are known for their often mountainous terrain which is in some areas covered by thick forests, while in others it has been heavily affected by [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Thailand.htm Forest data: Thailand Deforestation Rates]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hill dwelling peoples have traditionally been primarily [[subsistence farmers]] who use [[slash-and-burn]] [[agricultural]] techniques to farm their heavily [[forest]]ed communities.&lt;ref name=Highlanders-Intro&gt;{{cite book|last=Geddes|first=W. R.|title=Highlanders of Thailand|year=1983|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Kuala Lumpur|editor=John McKinnon and Wanat Bhruksasri|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular perceptions that slash and burn practices are environmentally destructive, government concerns over borderland security, and population pressure has caused the government to forcibly relocate many hill tribe peoples.&lt;ref name="Border Lanscapes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturgeon|first=Janet C.|title=Border Landscapes: The Politics of Akha Land Use in China and Thailand|year=2005|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, hill tribes were also a migratory people, leaving land as it became depleted of [[natural resource]]s or when trouble arose.

A 2013 article in ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' said that "Nearly a million hill peoples and forest dwellers are still treated as outsiders—criminals even, since most live in protected forests. Viewed as national security threats, hundreds of thousands of them are refused citizenship although many are natives to the land".&lt;ref name=Thainess&gt;[http://bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/366720/time-ripe-for-whole-new-take-on-thainess Time ripe for whole new take on 'Thainess']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term "hill tribe"==
In the 19th century, the tribes living in the mountain ranges were the largest non-Buddhist group in Thailand. Their mountain locations were then considered remote and difficult to access.&lt;ref name="Sukrittaya"/&gt; In Thai official documents, the term ''hill tribe'' (''Chao Khao'') began to appear in the 1960s. This term highlights a ''Hill and Valley'' [[dichotomy]] that is based on an ancient social relationship existing in most of [[Thai Highlands|Northern]] and [[Western Thailand]], as well as in [[Sipsongpanna]] and [[Northern Vietnam]]. For the most part, the [[Dai people|Dai]]/[[Tai peoples|Tai]]/[[Thai people]] occupied the more fertile [[intermontane basin]]s and the valleys, while the less powerful groups lived in the poorer, higher altitudes. This dichotomy was often also characterized by a master/[[Serfdom|serf relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;Kusuma Snitwongse &amp; W Scott Thompson eds. ''Ethnic Conflicts in Southeast Asia'', Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (October 14, 2005) {{ISBN|978-9812303370}}, pg. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, ''Highland Thais'' is a more recent term also used to designate groups living in the mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="Sukrittaya"&gt;Sukrittaya Jukping, ''Mae Khru Khong Chaat: A study of women teachers of Thai hilltribe children.'' University of Iowa, 2008, {{ISBN|9780549750161}}, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven major hill tribes within Thailand are the [[Akha people|Akha]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Hmong people|Hmong/Miao]], [[Yao people|Mien/Yao]], [[Lisu people|Lisu]], [[Palaung people|Palaung]] each with a distinct language and culture.

===The Akha===

{{main|Akha people}}

The Akha are closely related to the [[Hani people|Hani]] of China's [[Yunnan]] province.&lt;ref name=Hilltribe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/|title=The Akha|publisher=HillTribe.org|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known derogatorily in [[Thai language|Thai]] as the Gaw or the E-gaw. The Akha are one of the dominant cultural influences in the area. There are two to three million Akha and Akha-Hani in total, 70,000 of whom live in Thailand. The Akha speak a language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] language group, but have no traditional written language.

Although many Akha, especially younger people, profess [[Christianity]], Akha Zang (The Akha Way) still runs deep in their consciousness. The Akha are a shamanic group that share the ancient universal archetype that the Goddess spins a universe where nature is not distinguished from humankind. They embody the essence of its consciousness into a holistic continuum where there is no dichotomy between themselves and the natural world. The Akha Way, a prescribed lifestyle derived from religious chants, combines [[animism]], [[ancestor worship]], shamanism and a deep relationship with the land. The Akha Way emphasizes [[rituals]] in everyday life and stresses strong family ties and the hymn of creation; every Akha male can recount his [[genealogy]] back over fifty generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. AFECT NGO ([http://www.akhathai.org akhathai.org]) is the oldest [[non-governmental organization]] for tribes in Asia helping to protect the deeply shamanic tribal culture. Akha Asia ([http://www.akhaasia.org akhaasia.org]) runs an Akha cultural school.

The Bwa G'Naw,({{Lang-ksw|ပှၤကညီကစၢၢ်ခိၣ်}}) known to many as Karen, and to others as [[Kariang]] or Yang, are one of the largest hill tribes in [[Southeast Asia]]. The total population of Karen people is unknown, since they are spread throughout Burma, Laos and Thailand, and no reliable census has been conducted in Burma since the 1930s. Population estimates range from 7.5 million to 14 million people. (The more conservative estimate makes their population equivalent to that of Switzerland). The approximately 320,000 Karen in Thailand comprise half of the country's total hill tribe population.

While the Karen still practice slash and burn farming as other hill tribes do, they differ in that they live in permanent villages at lower elevations and have been aggressive in developing environmentally sustainable terraced rice fields. These factors have allowed the Karen to better integrate themselves into Thai society.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

===The Hmong===

{{main|Hmong people}}

The Hmong are believed to have been the original inhabitants of the [[Yellow River Valley]] in ancient China. The expansion of the neighboring Chinese from the north, caused a disruption in the Hmong culture and forced them to migrate southwards to Laos and Vietnam to escape oppression and persecution. Over the centuries, many wars have been waged against the Chinese. Greatly outnumbered, the Hmong suffered heavy casualties.

The futile efforts to establish themselves as an independent people apart from the expanding Chinese led to their mass exodus further south of China, and eventually into Southeast Asia. From here, they made their way into the territories of the European colonies that later gained independence and became known as Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. While the Hmong came to inhabit the hillside of Thailand because of helping the Americans fight the Vietnam War and lost, the country had always maintained its sovereignty from the colonists.

Today, the Hmong are located in the [[Thai Highlands]], although some are found elsewhere within the country. Among the hilltribes, the Hmong are becoming well integrated into Thai society as well as being among the most successful. The current population of Hmong in Thailand is estimated to be roughly 151,080.

'''Historical archaeology''' is a form of [[archaeology]] dealing with places, things, and issues from the past or present when written records and oral traditions can inform and contextualize cultural material. These records can both complement and conflict with the archaeological evidence found at a particular site. Studies focus on literate, historical-period societies as opposed to non-literate, [[prehistory|prehistoric]] societies. While they may not have generated the records, the lives of people for whom there was little need for written records, such as the [[working class]], slaves, indentured labourers, and children but who live in the historical period can also be the subject of study. The sites are found on land and underwater. [[Industrial archaeology]], unless practiced at industrial sites from the prehistoric era, is a form of historical archaeology concentrating on the remains and products of industry and the Industrial era.

==Definition==
According to the overall definition given here based on methodological and theoretical aspects [[classical archaeology]] or [[egyptology]] as well as [[medieval archaeology]] are disciplines of historical archaeology. In practice however – mainly in the Americas – historical archaeology refers to the modern, post-1492 period, which in Europe is often referred to as [[postmedieval archaeology]].

"'''Homer's Enemy'''" is the twenty-third episode in the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] of the American [[animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 4, 1997. The episode's plot centers on the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]'s hiring a new employee named [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Frank Grimes|Frank Grimes]]. Despite [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s attempts to befriend him, Grimes is angered and irritated by Homer's laziness and incompetence despite leading a comfortable life. He eventually declares himself Homer's enemy and tries to publicly humiliate him to expose his flaws. Meanwhile, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] buys a run-down factory for a dollar.

"Homer's Enemy" was directed by [[Jim Reardon]] and the script was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], based on an idea pitched by executive producer [[Bill Oakley]]. The episode explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong [[work ethic]] hired for a job where he has to work alongside a man like Homer. He was partially modeled after [[Michael Douglas]] as he appeared in the film ''[[Falling Down]]''. [[Hank Azaria]] provided the voice of Frank Grimes, and based some of the character's mannerisms on actor [[William H. Macy]]. [[Frank Welker]] guest stars as the voice of the Executive Vice President dog.

In its original broadcast on the Fox network, "Homer's Enemy" acquired a 7.7 [[Nielsen rating]]. It was viewed in approximately 7.5 million homes, finishing the week ranked 56th. "Homer's Enemy" is considered to be one of the darkest episodes of ''The Simpsons'', and it split critical opinion. It is a favorite of several members of the production staff, including Bill Oakley, [[Josh Weinstein]] and [[Matt Groening]], but it is one of the least favorites of [[Mike Reiss]]. Although Grimes is never shown alive after this episode, he was later named one of the "Top 25 ''Simpsons'' Peripheral characters" by [[IGN]]. He has since been referenced many times in the show, most notably in the [[The Simpsons (season 14)|season fourteen]] episode "[[The Great Louse Detective]]", in which his vengeful son plots to kill Homer.

==Plot==
A new employee, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Frank Grimes|Frank Grimes]], who spent most of his life alone and working hard to make ends meet, is hired at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] and put into Sector 7G, where he must work alongside [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Lenny and Carl|Lenny, and Carl]]. Grimes is aghast at Homer's laziness and general irresponsibility. When Grimes prevents Homer from drinking a beaker of sulfuric acid by slapping it out of his hands and into a wall, a passing Mr. Burns admonishes Grimes for the damaged caused and gives him a pay cut. Grimes angrily declares to Homer that they are now enemies.

At [[Moe Syzlak]]'s suggestion, Homer invites Grimes to his home for a lobster dinner, hoping to make them friends. However, Grimes is only further incensed by Homer's ability to live such a comfortable life and earn so many accomplishments despite his slothful and ignorant ways, while Grimes has little to show for his lifetime of hard work. Declaring Homer a fraud, Grimes leaves in anger. 

The next day, Homer, after getting advice from Marge, tries to earn Grimes' respect by acting as a model employee, but his efforts fail. Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, who both insist that despite his faults, Homer is a decent person. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children. However, Grimes' plan backfires as Homer's model, which is almost the same as the current plant with just two minor modifications, wins the contest. Moreover, instead of laughing at Homer, his co-workers loudly cheer for him, causing Grimes to finally snap and run around the plant mimicking and mocking Homer's habits. Grimes sees a high voltage machine, declares that he doesn't need safety gloves, grabs the wires and is electrocuted. At Grimes' funeral, Homer falls asleep and talks in his dream, making all the attendees laugh as Grimes' coffin is lowered into the earth.

Meanwhile, Bart buys an abandoned factory for a dollar at a foreclosure auction at the Springfield Town Hall. He and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] spend their days wrecking the building until it collapses one night during Milhouse's watch, at which point the rats inside swarm into [[Moe's Tavern]].

"Homer's Enemy" was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], directed by [[Jim Reardon]] and executive produced by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]]. One of the goals of Oakley and Weinstein was to create several episodes in each season which would "push the envelope conceptually."&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; The idea for the episode was first conceived by [[Bill Oakley]] who thought that Homer should have an enemy. The thought evolved into the concept of a "real world" co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; The result was the character of Grimes, a man who had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;

"Homer's Enemy" explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong [[work ethic]] placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In an essay for the book ''Leaving Springfield'', Robert Sloane describes the episode as "an incisive consideration of ''The Simpsons'''s world. Although ''The Simpsons'' is known for its self-reflectivity, the show had never looked at (or critiqued) itself as directly as it does in ['Homer's Enemy']."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloane|2003 |p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99–106}} By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard-working and persevering "real American hero,"{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99–106}} is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99–106}} In an interview with ''Simpsons'' fan site NoHomers.net, Josh Weinstein said:

{{cquote|We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was "What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?" I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [on NoHomers.net] about the ending—we just did that because [(1)] it's really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of "sometimes, you just can't win"—the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned.&lt;ref name="NoHomers"&gt;[http://www.nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=51876&amp;page=2 Ask Bill &amp; Josh] ''NoHomers.net''. Published on November 2, 2005, Retrieved on March 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The animators and character designers had a lot of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut",&lt;ref name="Reardon"&gt;{{cite video |people=Reardon, Jim |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Enemy" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; but would later be modeled after [[Michael Douglas]] in the movie ''[[Falling Down]]''&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; and director Jim Reardon's college roommate.&lt;ref name="Reardon"/&gt; [[Hank Azaria]] provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; Azaria felt that the role should instead go to [[William H. Macy]]. According to Azaria, "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior."&lt;ref name="Azaria"/&gt; The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution."&lt;ref name="Azaria"&gt;{{cite video |people=Azaria, Hank |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Enemy" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josh Weinstein has expressed regret about killing off Grimes after only one episode, describing him as "such an amazing character."&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'', producer [[George Meyer]] said, "Grimes's cardinal sin was that he shined a light on Springfield. He pointed out everything that was wrongheaded and idiotic about that world. And the people who do that tend to become martyrs. He said things that needed to be said, but once they were said, we needed to destroy that person. I'll admit, we took a certain sadistic glee in his downfall. He was such a righteous person, and that somehow made his demise more satisfying."&lt;ref name="Believer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/200409/?read=interview_meyer |title=Interview with George Meyer |accessdate=2011-01-03 |work=[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]] |date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subplot, where Bart buys a factory, was added so that there would be some lighter scenes to split up the main plot. According to Weinstein, "We wanted to have a Bart or Lisa kids story to contrast the heaviness and reality of Frank Grimes."&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;

==Reception==
In its original broadcast on the Fox network, "Homer's Enemy" acquired a 7.7 [[Nielsen rating]]. It was viewed in approximately 7.5 million homes, finishing the week ranked 56th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='Ellen', 'Forrest Gump' boost ABC |author=The Associated Press |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |date=1997-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' was the sixth highest rated show on Fox the week it was broadcast, behind ''[[The X-Files]]'', a broadcast of the film ''[[The Mask (film)|The Mask]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[King of the Hill (TV series)|King of the Hill]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nielsen Ratings/Sept. 16–22 |date=1991-09-25 |publisher=The Associated Press |work=[[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Long Beach Press-Telegram]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Josh Weinstein, when the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, lacked humor and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which he thinks many fans "didn't get."&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; Weinstein also talks about a "generation gap"—he believes the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;

Critical opinion of the episode is mixed. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', described the episode as "one of the series' darkest episodes [that] ends on a real downer but is nevertheless also one of the wittiest and cleverest in ages."&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; In 2007, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' called "Homer's Enemy" the seventh best episode of ''The Simpsons''. John Orvted said it was, "the darkest Simpsons episode ever... To see [Grimes] fail, and ultimately be destroyed, once he enters Homer's world is hilarious and satisfying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Orvted |title=Springfield's Best |publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=2007-07-05 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/top10simpsons200708 |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Rick Mercer]] called it a "great episode, and one of the darkest ever produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20030201/RVSIMS/Arts/thearts/thearts_temp/5/5/44/ |title=My favourite episode |author1=Caldwell, Rebecca |author2=Shoalts David |accessdate=2008-09-11 |date=2003-03-01 |publisher=The Globe and Mail |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012115319/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20030201/RVSIMS/Arts/thearts/thearts_temp/5/5/44/ |archivedate=October 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon Bonné of [[MSNBC]] used "Homer's Enemy" as an example of a bad episode of the eighth season and wrote "even now [in 2000], when subsequent episodes have debased Homer in new and innovative ways, the Grimes episode stands out as painful to watch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3341527/ |title='The Simpsons' has lost its cool |author=Bonné, Jon |accessdate=2008-09-19 |date=2000-10-10 |publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, former ''Simpsons'' executive producer [[Mike Reiss]] listed "Homer's Enemy" as one of his two least favorite episodes, stating, "I just think the episode was in bad taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='Simpson' writer returns to a familiar scene |work=[[Bristol, Connecticut|The Bristol Press]] |date=2007-04-19 |author=Drzewiecki, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several members of the staff have included the episode among their favorites. In a 2000 ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' article, Matt Groening ranked it as his sixth favorite ''Simpsons'' episode.&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275114,00.html |title=Springfield of Dreams |accessdate=2007-02-28 |date=2000-01-14 |publisher=EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a favorite of Josh Weinstein, who cites the scene when Grimes visits the Simpson home as one of his favorite scenes,&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;{{cite video |people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Enemy" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' creator [[Ricky Gervais]] has called it "the most complete episode."&lt;ref name="EW2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1176431,00.html |title=Best in D'oh |accessdate=2007-02-28 |date=2006-03-31 |publisher=EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her autobiography ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'', [[Nancy Cartwright]], the voice of Bart, praises Azaria's performance as Grimes, and uses it as an example of how "Accent, pitch, pacing, range and intention" can allow an actor to voice many characters. She writes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cartwright|2000 |p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Sometimes [in voice acting], it isn't even a big change from your regular voice, but the attitude behind it makes all the difference. [...] We were going to have a guest star play Frank Grimes. [...] Hank, at the table-read, just filling in, created such a beautifully crafted character, beautifully psychotic, that no one was used to replace him.}}

In October 2006, IGN.com released a list of "The Top 25 ''Simpsons'' Peripheral characters", in which they ranked Frank Grimes at number 17, making him the least frequently-shown character to appear in that list.&lt;ref name="IGN2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p2.html |title=The Top 25 ''Simpsons'' Peripheral characters |accessdate=2007-03-15 |date=2006-10-06 |publisher=IGN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Frank Grimes has since been referenced many times in the show, often showing his tombstone, and occasionally mentioning him by name. In the [[The Simpsons (season 14)|season fourteen]] episode "[[The Great Louse Detective]]", it is revealed that he fathered a son named Frank Grimes, Jr., who tries and fails to kill Homer. The footage of Grimes' death is also shown during that episode.&lt;ref name="Louse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-14_episode-6 |title=The Great Louse Detective |accessdate=2007-05-07 |publisher=TheSimpsons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-canon [[The Simpsons (season 28)|season twenty-eight]] episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XXVII]]", the ghost of Frank Grimes joined [[Sideshow Bob]]'s army of the Simpsons' enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/08/simpsons-frank-grimes-600th-episode-treehouse-horror-homer |title=''The Simpsons'' to resurrect Frank Grimes for 600th episode |last=Snierson |first=Dan |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=2016-09-08 |accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/09/the-simpsons-to-revive-frank-grimes-in-annual-hall.html |title=''The Simpsons'' to Revive Frank Grimes in Annual Halloween Episode |last=Guilbault |first=Kristy |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |publisher=[[Wolfgang's Vault]] |date=2016-09-08 |accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief Summary==

'''''India Becoming''''', by the [[Harvard University]] trained social anthropologist, Akash Kapur, is an in-depth study of simple average people from a nondescript town in [[South India]], their mundane life and their struggle to survive the vicissitudes of the burgeoning society that modernization has thrown their way. In this debut attempt, Kapur chose to go to such great lengths to depict the real-life stories and  experiences of people that it took him five years to finish the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=KARTHIKEYAN|first=Aparna|title=Is India Becoming?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/is-india-becoming/article4070652.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Kapur, in this critically acclaimed book, also expresses his unbiased sentiments about the outcomes rapid urbanization brings in its wake, affecting people from all social strata, both the country and the bustling metropolis, be it his rural hometown in [[Tamil Nadu]] or the chaotic cities of [[Bombay]], [[Bangalore]] or [[Chennai]]. The real-life characters in his book successfully reflect the writer's views in graphic detail.&lt;ref name=Becoming&gt;{{cite web|last=Pilling|first=David|title=India Becoming|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/c5fb8fca-693d-11e1-9618-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2UWAEpraT|publisher=FINANCIAL TIMES|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to an Indian father and American mother, Kapur's early life was spent in [[India]]. He left for US when he was 16 and started his academic years there. He came back to India in 2003 to settle down permanently. "I was coming home, but in many ways, it was to a home I didn't recognize anymore" says the one-time  "Letter From India" columnist for the [[International Herald Tribune]] and the [[New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akash Kapur: India Becoming|url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-03-20/akash-kapur-india-becoming|publisher=The Diane Rehm Show|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=2012-03-20|}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book of hybrid nonfiction, ''India Becoming'' presents an imagined geography of 2010s Delhi and India as experienced and created by an Indian returnee migrant author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Lau|first2=Lisa|date=2018|title=The conjunctural spaces of ‘new India’: imagined geographies of 2010s India in representations by returnee migrants|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1474474018786033|journal=cultural geographies|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1177/1474474018786033|issn=1474-4740|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Mendes and Lau argue, Kapur's text reflects "some of the enduring key themes involved in the reinvention and restoration of imagined geographies, such as assimilation vs alienation/anomie and tradition vs modernity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Lau|first2=Lisa|date=2018|title=The conjunctural spaces of ‘new India’: imagined geographies of 2010s India in representations by returnee migrants|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1474474018786033|journal=cultural geographies|language=en|volume=|pages=5|doi=10.1177/1474474018786033|issn=1474-4740|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To quote an excerpt from his book: "Einstein once wrote of America that its people were "always becoming, never being", but it was in India now that I felt that sense of newness, of perpetual reinvention and forward momentum that I had felt when I first moved to America".&lt;ref name=Akash&gt;{{cite web|last=Rasul|first=Nadia|title=Book Excerpt: 'India Becoming' by Akash Kapur|url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/book-excerpt-india-becoming-akash-kapur|publisher=Asia Society|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian calligraphy''' is the [[Culture of India|Indian]] tradition of [[calligraphy]], or artistic writing. The art form has served multiple purposes since its inception in the second century BCE, including the duplication of religious texts and as a form of basic communication.

== History ==
===Early calligraphy (2nd century BCE-6th century CE)===
Beginning in the 2nd century AD, Indic language was transferred using [[Birch bark manuscript|birch bark]] as a writing surface. Locally, the birch bark was called Bhojpatra in [[India]] - patra meaning leaf/bark/sheet in [[Sanskrit]]. Palm leaves were used as a substitute to paper, even after paper was available for Indic manuscripts. The leaves were commonly used because they were a good surface for pen writing, which created the delicate and decorative handwriting that is known as calligraphy today. Both sides of these leaves were used and they were stacked on top of each other. People then created holes on the leaves and held them together by string, thus creating the early Indian manuscripts, common in Southeast Asia at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indic Calligraphy|last=Anderson|first=D.M.|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages (6th century-16th century)===
Indian calligraphy took off starting around 500 AD when Indian traders, colonists, military adventurers, [[Bhikku|Buddhist monks]] and missionaries brought the [[Indic script]] to Central Asia from [[South East Asia]]. Different concepts and ideas were being created throughout the late 400s to late 1400s, in a 1000-year span. The [[Gilgit]] scripts are the earliest notable form of calligraphy in India that date back to the 5th and 6th centuries. The earliest painted covers of manuscripts were created between the 7th and 9th centuries, and the earliest illustrated manuscript in South Asia was not formed until around the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Calligraphy of the East|last=Stevens|first=John|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=0877734585|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Qutb Minar Minaret Delhi India.jpg|160px|thumb|Inscriptions in the [[Kufic]] style of [[calligraphy]] form regular bands throughout the [[Qutb Minar]], [[Delhi]], built 1192 CE]]

The languages of South East Asia were influenced by Indic language and culture. The languages that were created came in the form of the basic internal structure, the arrangement and construction of syllabic units, manner of representation of characters, and the direction of writing (left to right). Before this left to right reading, the technique of [[Palm-leaf manuscript|Pothi]] was utilized, which is the format of a book that is written vertically. This was useful for the illustrations made in these early manuscripts. [[Persian people|Persian]] influence in Indian calligraphy gave rise to a unique and influential blend in Indian calligraphy, although a number of different calligraphic traditions existed in India already, and Indic scripts were fundamentally different from scripts used in Arabic and Persian traditions. The notable achievements of the [[Mughal era|Mughals]] included some of their fine manuscripts, which were usually autobiographies and chronicles of the noble class. They were initially written in flowing [[Persian language|Persian]] script, which was one of the main forms of communication during this time, and which showed a multi-directionality and mutuality of influence on Indic calligraphers.

From the 16th century onwards [[Sikhism]] played a key role in the history of Indian calligraphy. Sikhs have traditionally handwritten their holy book, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], and furnished it with illumination. [[Sikh]] calligrapher [[Pratap Singh Giani]] (1855–1920) is known for one of the first definitive translations of Sikh scriptures into [[English language|English]].[[Image:Asokan brahmi pillar edict.jpg|thumb|right|184x184px|A fragment of [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka's 6th pillar edict]].]]

=== Modern Period (16th century-today) ===
There was a bigger goal to this style of language than just to communicate with one another. There was no one true form of [[communication]] before this was created, and calligraphy helped to guide community members to connect in more than one aspect of life, that was not just language. A rich heritage of calligraphy was embraced as this was a time before [[printing]] technology was accessible to Indian counties. This brought people closer together as they began to communicate in the same ways. While it may be used as an art form today, it was essential for communication before the 16th century.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Features of Indian calligraphy ==
[[Religious text]]s are the most frequent vehicle for calligraphy in India. [[Monastic]] Buddhist communities had members trained in calligraphy and shared responsibility for duplicating sacred scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages|last=Salomon|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0195099843|location=Oxford, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jainism|Jaina]] traders incorporated illustrated manuscripts celebrating Jaina saints. These manuscripts were produced using inexpensive material, like palm leave and birch, with fine calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Art|last=Mitter|first=Partha|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Oxford, New York|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Jackson Johonnet"''' was the pseudonymous author of a [[wikt:spurious|spurious]] Indian [[captivity narrative]] that enjoyed much popularity in the mid-1790s and was thereafter incorporated into the “canonical” body of accounts of white imprisonments, tortures and sufferings due to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].

The narrative tells the story of a young man of 17 who leaves his family’s farm in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]] (now [[Maine]]), to seek his fortune in [[Boston]]. Unable to get work, he falls prey to the wiles of an army recruiter, enlists, and is despatched to the “West” (in this case [[Ohio]]) to serve with the army. He is almost immediately captured by Indians, taken to their villages on the upper [[Great Miami River|Miami River]], and witnesses the torture and death of fellow captives. He  escapes with an associate and makes his way back to the army in time to participate in the notorious and disastrous battle known variously as the [[St. Clair's Defeat|Battle of the Wabash]] or St. Clair's Defeat. Numerous points in the narrative contradict established facts in the history of the 1791 campaign, and other events seem to be embellishments supplied by someone unfamiliar with the western geography or actualities of Indian warfare.

The work was first published in ''[[Beers's Almanac and Ephemera]] ... for 1793'' ([[Hartford]], 1792). It proved exceedingly popular,  and had at least eight reprint editions in the following two years. Its publication followed two years of unsuccessful military campaigns against a coalition of Native Americans in Ohio, led by [[Little Turtle]] and [[Blue Jacket]], that included [[Miami]], [[Shawnee]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Piankashaw]], [[Wea]], and [[Delaware]] tribes. The [[Northwest Territory]] was rendered unsafe for settlement, and President [[George Washington]] and Congress were endeavoring to increase the standing army and provide for defense of the frontier. The “Johonnet” narrative packed much action and adventure in a relatively short space, and its portrayal of the Indians served to justify the efforts for the military conquest of their territories then under preparation.

The popularity of the Johonnet narrative is testified by its immediate reprinting in separate book form in seven separate editions in 1793—at Boston, MA; Keene, NH; Newburyport, MA (2); Providence, RI; Windsor, VT; and Concord, MA. The 1793 Providence edition claimed to be a reprint of one issued in 1791 in Lexington, Kentucky, but no other evidence of that earlier form has been found. Further editions were issued at Walpole, NH, in 1795, and at Salem, MA, in 1802. It was soon included in numerous anthologies of Indian captivity narratives, including ''Affecting History of the Dreadful Distresses of Frederic Manheim's Family, etc.'' (Philadelphia, 1800), Samuel L. Metcalfe’s ''A Collection of Some of the Most Interesting Narratives of Indian Warfare in the West'' (Lexington, KY, 1820), and others. Some later editions spell the last name as "Johonnot."

External evidence for the existence of “Jackson Johonnet” is lacking. The family does not appear in the 1790 census for Falmouth, Maine (then part of Massachusetts); nor has any trace of “Jackson Johonnet,” other than the printed narrative, been found. Internal evidence within the ''Remarkable Adventures'' suggests that the entire narrative is an invention, based in part upon published reports of the battle it describes (known generally as the [[St. Clair's Defeat|Battle of the Wabash]]). The chronology and geography of the narrative contain several points that contradict the known facts: 1. General [[Josiah Harmar]] had been relieved of command of the western army in March 1791 (before Johonnet left Falmouth); 2. [[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)|Fort Jefferson]] was not constructed until October 1791 (although the narrator claims to have arrived there September 18); and 3. the site of Braddock’s defeat, near present-day Pittsburgh, PA, is roughly 275 miles east of the site of Fort Jefferson (near present-day Greenville, Ohio). Other portions of the narrative (such as the narrator’s marksmanship with a musket at 40 yards, or the persistence of human remains after 36 years) also test the reader's credulity.

[[File:Jaina Island type figure, Art Institute.jpg|thumb|Handcrafted male figurine, 650-800 AD.]]'''Jaina Island''' is a [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] in the present-day [[Mexican state]] of [[Campeche]]. A small limestone island on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]'s [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] coast with only a tidal inlet separating it from the mainland, Jaina served as an elite Maya burial site, and is notable for the high number of fine [[ceramic]] [[figurine]]s [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Coe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Jaina" translates to "Temple in the Water".&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=85|url=http://artsbma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maya site northern Yucatan 800 AD.svg|left|thumb|Jaina Island and other major Classic Era Maya communities.]]

Both Jaina Island and nearby Piedras Island (Isla Piedras) were the sites of small towns or villages. Jaina was settled [[circa]] 300 [[Common Era|CE]],&lt;ref name="Muren"&gt;Muren.&lt;/ref&gt; lasting until its abandonment some time [[circa]] 1200 CE. The principal occupation occurred near the end of this period, during the Late Classic and Terminal Classic eras.&lt;ref&gt;Inurreta, [http://www.famsi.org/reports/03053/section13.htm sect. 13]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day ruins consist of two small plaza groups and a [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourt]].

Jaina Island's notability is tied to its estimated 20,000 graves, of which over 1,000 have been archaeologically excavated.&lt;ref name="Muren"/&gt; Within each grave, the human remains are accompanied by glassware, slateware, or pottery as well as one or more ceramic figurines, usually resting on the occupant's chest or held in their hands.

The name of this island [[necropolis]] probably comes from the Yucatán Maya phrase ''hail na'', or “watery house”. Its western location may have been tied to the setting sun, and therefore to death.&lt;ref name="Muren"/&gt;

The source of the burial population is as yet unknown, but likely comes from [[Edzna]], and the nearby [[Chenes]] and [[Puuc]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jaina style figurines ==
[[File:Jaina Figurine 1 (T Aleto).jpg|thumb|Handcrafted male figurine.]]
[[File:Jaina Figurine 2 (T Aleto).jpg|thumb|Molded female figurine.]]
[[File:Jaina figurine 3.jpg|thumb|Handcrafted male figurine.]]
Due to sheer numbers found here, these figurines have become known as "Jaina-style figurines" whether or not they were found on the Jaina Island. In fact, these figurines are far more numerous at inland Maya sites, such as the [[Usumacinta River]] delta, than on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, p 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Jaina-style figures are naturalistic, delicately detailed, and "generally regarded as the finest figurine art produced throughout the ancient Americas".&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p.438.&lt;/ref&gt; While both solid and hollow figurines have been found, the latter predominate and are usually fitted with a whistle, or with clay pellets that produce a rattle-like sound. Like the figurines themselves, it is not known what function(s) the whistles and rattles served.

Made of orange clay and originally painted, mostly in ochres and blues, the figurines are generally 10 - 25&amp;nbsp;inches (25 – 65&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, rarely more.&lt;ref name="Kubler, p. 266"&gt;Kubler, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

These figures also represent Mayan practices of scarification and the significance of class in Mayan society. Details such as marks on the figure's face as well as clothing and jewelry can be used to signify social status of the figure.&lt;ref name="BMA"/&gt;

All the figurines on Jaina Island seem to have been produced specifically as burial accompaniments.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; Due, if nothing else, to space considerations, few if any of these figurines could have been produced on the island itself. Many of the molded figurines have been linked to workshops at [[Jonuta (Mesoamerican site)|Jonuta]], some distance to the south and west.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Created in a realistic style, the figurines are an ethnographic treasure trove, affording a glimpse into the physical features, dress, and daily life of the late Classic Maya elite. Their delicate detail reveals hallmarks of social status and the figurines are often shown with tools and other accoutrements, providing us three-dimensional snapshots of long-vanished implements.

=== Portraiture? ===
The idiosyncratic details shown in the earlier phase figurines have led one researcher to declare that they are "genuine essays in portraiture",&lt;ref&gt;Corson.&lt;/ref&gt; while another adds that the figurines "faithfully describe age, status, and expression".&lt;ref name="Kubler, p. 266"/&gt; Expressive and individual as they are, it has thus far proven to be difficult to determine the subjects of these figurines.

For example, it is not possible to correlate the figurines with their associated burial. In particular, the gender of the figurines only randomly seem to match the gender of the burial—female figurines may accompany male burials and vice versa, while child burials are often accompanied by adult figurines.

Certain figurines, and styles of figurines, have been identified as deities. Others hint at myths or legends.&lt;ref name="Kubler, p. 266"/&gt; It has also been suggested that the figurines represent ancestors, distant or immediate. The question of portraiture may only be resolved when the function of these grave goods is itself resolved.

=== Chronological phases ===
In a 1975 article, Christopher Corson posited three phases based on the figurines' craftsmanship and production method:

:Phase I 	AD 600 – 800
:Phase II 	AD 800 – 1000
:Campeche phase AD 1000 – 1200

While proposed dates vary considerably from researcher to researcher,&lt;ref&gt;For example, Kubler's dates are 200 years earlier than Corson's.&lt;/ref&gt; such a division is useful for analyzing the changes in production methods and perhaps the cultural changes behind these.

Almost all Phase I figurines are hand-modeled, with pigment applied after the clay had dried, and show the greatest degree of craftsmanship. While certain recurring subjects and styles can be identified, there is a widespread uniqueness to the figurines from this phase.

Phase II is marked by the creation of figurines from molds. Often these molded figurines would be enhanced through incisions or the addition of thin clay strips and adornments. While casting increases productivity—no doubt at least a partial explanation for its adoption—it decreases artistic opportunities, and so Phase II figurines are generally less innovative, less detailed, and less idiosyncratic than those of Phase I.

The Campeche Phase was marked by the almost complete adoption of molded figurines, often whitewashed, preponderantly featuring a standing woman with upraised arms. This subject, variously identified with the goddesses [[Xochiquetzal]] or, mistakenly, [[Ix Chel]], is so prevalent during this phase that it outnumbers all other subjects combined, suggesting that burial practices had come under the influence of a new, perhaps imported, ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Corson, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; (See examples of a [http://anthro.amnh.org/anthropology/databases/common/image_dup.cfm?database=MIXDATA&amp;catno=%201%20%20/%20%20305&amp;site=P Jonuta Campeche phase figurine] and a [http://anthro.amnh.org/anthropology/databases/common/image_dup.cfm?database=MIXDATA&amp;catno=30.3/%202528&amp;site=P Jaina Campeche phase figurine]).

==Biography==
Ker Conway was born in [[Hillston, New South Wales|Hillston]], [[New South Wales]], in the outback of [[Australia]]. Together with her two brothers, Ker Conway was raised in near-total [[Solitude|isolation]] on a family-owned {{convert|73|km2|acre}} tract of land called Coorain (the [[indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] word for "windy place"), which eventually grew to encompass {{convert|129|km2|acre}}. On Coorain, she lived a lonely life, and grew up without playmates except for her brothers. In her early years, she was schooled entirely by her mother With the aid of correspondence class material for her primary school and early grade school education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/06/14/619953256/remembering-jill-ker-conway-the-first-female-president-of-smith-college |title=Remembering Jill Ker Conway, The First Female President Of Smith College |work=Fresh Air with Terry Gross |date=June 15, 2018 |accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ker Conway spent her youth working the sheep station; by age seven, she was an important member of the workforce, helping with such activities as herding and tending the sheep, checking the [[perimeter fence]]s and transporting heavy farm supplies. The farm prospered until it was crippled by a drought that lasted seven years. This and her father's worsening health put an increasing burden on her shoulders. When she was eleven, her father drowned in a [[Underwater diving|diving]] accident while trying to extend the farm's water piping.

Initially Jill Ker Conway's mother, a [[nurse]] by profession, refused to leave Coorain. But after three more years of [[drought]], she was compelled to move Jill and her brothers to [[Sydney]], where the children attended school.

Ker Conway found the local state school a rough environment. The [[United Kingdom|British]] manners and accent ingrained by her parents clashed with her peers' Australian habits, provoking [[wikt:taunt|taunts]] and [[wikt:jeer|jeers]]. This resulted in her mother enrolling her at [[Abbotsleigh]], a private girls school, where Ker Conway found [[intellectual]] challenge and social acceptance. After finishing her education at Abbotsleigh, she enrolled at the [[University of Sydney]], where she studied [[History]] and [[English studies|English]] and graduated with honours in 1958. Upon graduation, Ker Conway sought a trainee post in the [[Department of External Affairs]], but the all-male committee turned down her application.

After this setback, she travelled through Europe with her now emotionally volatile mother. In 1960, she decided to strike out on her own and move to the [[United States]]. At age 25, she was accepted into the [[Harvard University]] history program. There she assisted a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professor, John Conway, who became her husband until his death in 1995. Ker Conway received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at Harvard in 1969 and taught at the [[University of Toronto]] from 1964 to 1975. Her book ''[[Jill Ker Conway#True North|True North]]'' details her life in [[Toronto]].

From 1975 to 1985, Ker Conway was the president of Smith College. After 1985, she was a Visiting Professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. She received thirty-eight [[honorary degree]]s and awards from North American and Australian colleges, universities and women's organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jill Ker Conway, 83, Feminist Author and Smith President, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/obituaries/jill-ker-conway-83-feminist-author-and-smith-president-dies.html |accessdate=19 June 2018 |publisher=New York Times |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her career, Ker Conway served as director on a variety of corporate boards. These include stints of more than a decade on the boards of Nike, Colgate-Palmolive, and Merrill Lynch.&lt;ref name="Board Service"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=545664&amp;ticker=NKE&amp;previousCapId=24937&amp;previousTitle=APPLE+INC|title=Executive Profile: Jill Ker Conway |publisher=Bloomberg, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence |accessdate=June 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2011, Ker Conway served as the Board Chair of [[Community Solutions]].&lt;ref name="Community Solutions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmtysolutions.org/about/board |title=Community Solutions |date= |access-date=16 October 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141016172842/http://cmtysolutions.org/about/board |archive-date=16 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a non-profit organization with a focus on homelessness and related issues, based in New York City.

Conway died on 1 June 2018 at her home in Boston at the age of 83.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettenet.com/Smith-president-emerita-dies-17923891 |title=Smith’s first woman president, acclaimed scholar Jill Ker Conway, dies at 83 |last=Schmeidel |first=Stacey |date=2 June 2018 |newspaper=Daily Hampshire Gazette |access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==President of Smith College==
[[Image:Smith college campus center 20040912.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Smith College]] campus]]
In 1975, Ker Conway became the first female president of [[Smith College]], the largest [[women's college]] in the [[United States]]. Located in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], Smith, a private [[liberal arts college]], is the only women's college in the U.S. to grant its own degrees in [[engineering]].

One of Ker Conway's most notable accomplishments is a program she initiated to help students on [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]. At the time, many students who were also welfare mothers were not pursuing higher education, as accepting a [[scholarship]] would cause them to lose their welfare benefits. The students were forced to choose between supporting their children or furthering their education. By not giving them scholarships but paying their [[renting|rent]] instead, Ker Conway circumvented the state's system. She also gave the students access to an account at local stores, access to [[physician]]s and so on. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Good Morning America]] profiled graduates of the program, giving it national exposure. Eventually the state of [[Massachusetts]], convinced about the importance of the program, changed its welfare system so that scholarship students wouldn't lose their benefits.

Ker Conway also launched the Ada Comstock Scholars program, initially proposed by her predecessor [[Thomas C. Mendenhall (historian)|Thomas Mendenhall]]. This program allows non-traditional students, many with work and family obligations, to study full or part-time, depending on their family and work schedules. These women can take classes for a bachelor's degree over a longer period of time.

In 1975, Jill Ker Conway was named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as a [[Time Person of the Year|Woman of the Year]].

==''The Road from Coorain''==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:The Road from Coorain.gif|frame|right|]] --&gt;
Ker Conway started writing her first memoir after leaving Smith College, during her period at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. ''The Road from Coorain'' was published in 1989 ({{ISBN|0-394-57456-7}}) and details her early life, from Coorain in [[Australia]] to [[Harvard]] in the [[United States]].

The book begins with her early childhood at the remote sheep station Coorain near [[Mossgiel, New South Wales]]. Ker Conway writes about her teenage years in [[Sydney]] and especially her education at the [[University of Sydney]], where university studies were open to women but the culture was focused heavily on the men. She describes her [[intellect]]ual development and later her feelings when she realizes that there is a [[bias]] against women; based upon her sex, she is denied a [[traineeship]] at the [[Australia]]n foreign service.

In 2001, [[Chapman Pictures]] produced a [[Television movie|television film]], ''[[The Road from Coorain (film)|The Road from Coorain]]'', featuring [[Katherine Slattery]] as the grown-up Jill and [[Juliet Stevenson]] as her mother.

'''Laurie L. Patton''' (born November 14, 1961) is an [[Americans|American]] academic, author and poet who serves as the 17th President of [[Middlebury College]]. Previously, she was the Charles Howard Candler Professor of Early Indian Religions at [[Emory University]] before assuming the role of Robert F. Durden Professor of Religion and Dean of Arts and Sciences at [[Duke University]].

Patton was named Middlebury's 17th President on  November 18, 2014, and became Middlebury's first woman president upon taking office on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/help/mediaserv/stream&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2008-12-01 |title=Mumbai is Not 9/11 |first=Laurie |last=Patton |newspaper=Religious Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/797/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604090208/http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/797/ |archivedate=June 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton graduated from [[Choate Rosemary Hall]] in Wallingford, Connecticut, holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], a doctorate from the [[University of Chicago]], and was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 2000. She focuses her research on early Indian rituals, narrative and mythology, literary theory in religious studies, and [[Hinduism]] in modern India. She has published on the interpretation of early Indian ritual and narrative, comparative mythology, literary theory in the study of religion, women and Hinduism in contemporary India, and religion and conflict.

Her early Indological work applies literary theory and theory of canon to the texts of early India, particularly Vedic texts. Later, she used a theory of metonymy to rethink the application of mantras in early Indian ritual.  Her first edited work, ''Authority, Anxiety, and Canon'' (1994) surveyed the larger field of Vedic interpretation as it existed in various intellectual contexts throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunypress.edu/p-1849-authority-anxiety-and-canon.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

She was co-editor on ''Myth and Method'' an assessment of the state of the field in comparative mythology. Her co-edited work with Edwin Bryant (2005) brings together for the first time a variety of differing perspectives on the problem of Aryan origins.

Patton has also worked on gender questions, beginning with her edited volume, ''Jewels of Authority'' (2002), which examined early feminist stereotypes about women in Indian textual traditions as well as contemporary life.  Her recent articles on gender are derived from her present project, the first ethnography of women Sanskritists ever to be undertaken in India.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Her translation of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' in the [[Penguin Classics]] Series follows a free verse style constrained by eight line stanzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stainton|first1=Hamsa|title=Review: The Bhagavad Gita|url=http://www.saglobalaffairs.com/book-reviews/191-review-the-bhagavad-gita.html|website=SAGlobalAffairs.com|publisher=SAGlobalAffairs.com|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton regularly teaches in public venues nationally and internationally on interfaith issues, comparative religion, and religion and conflict.  In 2008–09 she co-hosted a TV series on "Faith and Feminism" for Atlanta Interfaith Broadcasting.  Patton served as Chair of the Department from 2000–07, as Co-convenor of the Religions and the Human Spirit Strategic Plan from 2005–07, and as Winship Distinguished Research Professor from 2003–06. She was the recipient of Emory’s highest award for teaching, the Emory Williams Award, in 2006. She co-convenes the Religion and Conflict Initiative at Emory University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovguide.com/laurie-l-patton-9202a8c04000641f8000000012e52aaa#&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22856">A '''literature circle''' is equivalent of an adult [[Book discussion club|book club]], but with greater structure, expectation and rigor. The aim is to encourage thoughtful discussion and a love of reading in young people.  The true intent of literature circles is "to allow students to practice and develop the skills and strategies of good readers" (DaLie, 2001).

==Background of literature circles==
Literature circles were first implemented in 1982 by Karen Smith, an elementary school teacher in Phoenix, Arizona.  Handed a box of odd-and-end novels by a fellow teacher, Karen took them and promptly forgot about them.  Later that year, some of her fifth grade students expressed an interest in reading them, organized themselves loosely into groups, and started to discuss the novels.  Smith was surprised at the degree of their engagement with the books and the complexity of their discussions, they had no outside help or instruction from their teacher (Daniels, 1994). From here literature circles evolved into reading, study and discussion groups based around different groupings of students reading a variety of different novels.  They differ from traditional English instruction where students in classroom all read one “core” novel, often looking to the teacher for the answers and the meaning and literary analysis of the text.  They highlight discussion, student response, free choice, and collaboration, "providing a way for students to engage in critical thinking and reflection" ([http://www.litcircles.org Literature Circles Resource Center] Schlick Noe, 2004).  Well-run literature circles highlight student choice; occur over an extended period of time as part of a [[Balanced Literacy]] program; involve numerous structured and unstructured opportunities for student response and interpretation; and incorporate assessment and evaluation that includes self-assessment and numerous extension projects.  Research on literature circles is conducted primarily by [[Harvey Daniels]] (1994, 2002, 2004), [[Katherine L. Schlick Noe]] (1995, 1999, 2001, 2003), Bonnie Campbell Hill (1995, 2001, 2003), and Nancy J. Johnson (1995, 1999, 2001);  they are credited with most of the research and teacher resources around this approach to student choice and reading; however, numerous other researchers, including Kathy Short and Kathryn Mitchell Pierce (1990), Jerome Harste, Kathy Short and Carolyn Burke (1988), Katherine Samway (1991), Suzi Keegan and Karen Shrake (1991)  have conducted research and classroom-based studies.  This approach to reading and learning looks to some of the best practices and theory from [[collaborative learning]] and [[scaffolding theory]].  [[Reader-response criticism]], [[independent reading]], and [[student-centered learning]]  comprise most of the theoretical underpinning of literature circles.

Literature circles combine the best practices of collaborative learning and student-directed learning.  They are not to be confused with [[book discussion club]]s, currently popular in some circles.  While both book clubs and literature circles focus on discussion of books in small group settings, book clubs have a more loosely structured agenda for discussions and are not usually tied into literary analysis such as thematic or symbolic analysis.{{cn|date=April 2014}}  Furthermore, literature circles are the domain of the classroom, both at the elementary and secondary level, and involve various types of [[Educational assessment|assessment]] (including [[self-assessment]], observations and conferences) and [[evaluation]] ([[Career portfolio|portfolios]], projects and student artifacts) by both the teacher and the student. Literature circles are a pedagogically sound alternative to teacher-centered discourse.{{cn|date=April 2014}}  They can be used at all grade and ability levels, and are often credited{{who|date=April 2014}} with instilling a love of reading and discussion in students.  Furthermore, current research indicates that peer collaboration has a positive effect on student learning and performance in Language Arts (Fall ''et al''., 2000), increases student learning, and also improves reading comprehension and content-knowledge (Klinger, Vaugn and Schumm, 1998, cited in Daniels, 2002).

==Key features of literature circles==
#Children choose their own reading materials.
#Small temporary groups are formed, based on book choice.
#Different groups read different books
#Groups meet on a regular predictable schedule.
#Students use written or drawn notes to guide both their reading and discussion.
#Discussion topics come from the students
#Group meetings aim to be open, natural conversations.  Often the conversations digress to topics relating to the students or loosely to the books, but should eventually return to the novel.
#The teacher serves as a facilitator, observer, listener and often a fellow reader, alongside the students.  The teacher is not an instructor.
#Students are given roles or jobs to complete for each group meeting.
#The teacher should model how students should facilitate each role or job.
#Evaluation is by teacher observation and student self-evaluation and should also include extension projects.
#A spirit of playfulness and fun pervades the room.
#New groups form around new reading choices.
(Daniels, 1994)

Discussion prompts can be given by the teacher to encourage a direction for the students' responses, such as "How does the setting affect the characters?"  "What are alternative solutions to the character's conflicts in the text?" "What connections can you make with regard to the character's situation(s)?"

==Implementation considerations==
Students begin literature circles by participating in mini-lessons on how to participate in a discussion group. To begin with they may be given role sheets to assist them in taking notes on their reading and preparing for the discussion.

Sticky notes (e.g. PostIt notes) are often distributed by teachers to assist students in recording their thoughts about text elements, as they make access easy to various pages in the book.  Clip boards may assist children in using their role sheets when groups use floor space to conduct their discussions. 

As group discussions evolve and improve, ideally the role sheets should eventually be used only for redirecting the discussion when students get off-track.  In fact, Daniels notes that "the goal of role sheets is to make the role sheets obsolete" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;75).  What he means by this is that role sheets help students stay on task and focus their discussions.  As students become more comfortable in their groups and learn the level of discourse and response that is expected of them, ideally they will no longer need the role sheets at all: "In many classrooms, the role sheets are abandoned as soon as groups are capable of lively, text-centered, multifaceted discussions" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;75).  Schlick Noe and Johnson note that role sheets take focus and energy away from group discussions:  "Students can learn collaborative and individual accountability strategies to make their discussions work without the constraints of role sheets" (Schlick Noe and Johnson, 1999, cited from [http://www.litcircles.org/Discussion/discussion.html Literature Circles Resource Center)] Most teachers starting out may, however, wish to assign roles to students to help them learn some of the structures of Literature Circles and to aid in classroom management.

==Roles in literature circles==
The following is a list of roles which give a thinking task to each group member.  Students divide the tasks among themselves in each group.  As the groups reconvene each session, students switch roles, so that by the end of the literature circles "unit," each student will have the opportunity to participate in each role.  Again, the ideal is to eventually do away with the roles, although many teachers opt to continue using the roles to assist group on-task behaviour.  One thing to keep in mind:  Readers who are deeply engaged with a book and eager to talk about it with others may not need the structure of roles.  Many teachers discover that the roles feel restrictive to some students and can become a disincentive to take part in literature circles.  Harvey Daniels always intended roles to be a temporary scaffold to support students as they learn to talk about books in small groups.

===Discussion facilitator===
This role involves developing a list of questions that the group might discuss about the section of the novel to be discussed for that meeting.  Questions should be designed to promote lively conversation and insights about the book; they should be [[open questions]].   A person with this task asks these questions of the group to prompt discussion; overall, the job is to keep the group talking and on-task.  Questions that a student might ask could be:  "What was going through your mind when you read this passage?" or "How did the main character change as a result of this incident?"{{sfrac|
|}}{{frac|{{frac|{{mvar|{{math|}}}}|}}|}}

===Commentator===

This role involves locating a few significant passages of text that are thought-provoking, funny, interesting, disturbing, or powerful.  The quotations are copied down with properly cited page numbers.  A student with this task can read the passages out loud him/herself or ask other group members to read as well.  Commentary and discussion will be generated from these passages.
and also draw a part of the scene that locates where the person took place

===Illustrator===

As the term implies, this job entails drawing, sketching, or painting a picture, portrait or scene relating to the appropriate section of the novel.  Collages from magazines, images from the internet, and other media can also be used.  The student with this role then shares the artwork with the group, explaining the passage(s) that relate to the art.  Often students who do not like to write do very well with this role.  The pictures usually generate interesting group conversations.

===Connector or Reflector===

This role involves locating several significant passages in the novel and connecting these passages to real life.  The connections might relate to school, friends or family, home, the community, or they might relate to movies, celebrities, the media etc.  Students should also feel free to connect incidents or characters with other books that they have read.  Of all the roles, this role is often the most personal in its focus.

===Summarizer===

This role involves preparing a brief summary of the reading that was assigned for that day's meeting.  The summary should include the main ideas or events to remember, major characters, symbols or other significant highlights of the passage.  Good summarizers are important to literature circles, as they can help their peers see the overall picture (DaLie, 2001). Also include important events and details.

===Vocabulary Enricher===

Also called the Word Master or Word Wizard, this role is to record important words for that day's reading.  Words that are unusual, unknown, or that stand out in some way are usually chosen by the student.  Their page number and definition is also recorded.  Often students do not see this role as particularly stimulating; however, it can be a role suited to students who are still developing confidence in English classes or textual analysis.

===Travel Tracer===

This role involves recording where the major shifts in action or location take place in the novel for the reading section.  Keeping track of shifts in place, time, and characters helps students keep track of important shifts in the novel.  Artistic students also are drawn to this role, as artwork can be incorporated into this role as well.  The student's role is to describe each setting in detail, using words or maps that illustrate the action.

===Investigator===

This role includes investigative work where background information needs to be found on any topic relating to the book.  Historical, geographical, cultural, musical or other information that would help readers connect to the novel is often researched and shared with the group.  The research is informal in nature, providing small bits of information in order that others can better understand the novel.

===Figurative Language Finder===

This role includes identification of various types of figurative language, including but not limited to simile, metaphor, personification, hyperbole, and idiom.  This may lead to discussion about the author's craft - why the author chose to use those particular words or phrases, and whether or not they were effective.  This in-context identification can be more relevant and memorable than isolated instruction by the teacher of these types of tools.

==Assessment and evaluation of literature circles==
Most teachers assess and evaluate what students do in Literature Circles. This may involve one or several of the following assessment(s) and evaluation(s):
*'''[[Self-Assessment]]'''
**Students should be involved in monitoring and recording their own level of response and engagement with their book and participation with their group as they meet each session. Often formal checklists are used for students to keep track of their progress.
*'''[[Peer group|Peer Assessment]]'''
**Students can also be empowered to assess their fellow group members over the course of their book talks.  As with self-assessment, checklists or other rubrics can provide structure.
*'''Observations'''
**On-going teacher observation and active participation in group discussions is critical in assessing student progress both individually and in whole group.  Daniels (1994) notes that most assessment should be formative, ensuring that students are provided with timely feedback to learn more effectively.  Observations can meet such formative assessment criteria.
*'''Conferences'''
**Face-to-face conversations between student and teacher can help to "access, track and monitor student growth" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;160).
*'''[[Career portfolio|Portfolios]]'''
**Collections of student products, collected and assembled in a meaningful fashion, provide the opportunity for reflection, discussion, response to the book, and displaying a student's best work.  Portfolios can take on many forms, ranging from writing, art, video/audiotapes, learning logs, student journals, personal responses etc. (Daniels, 1994).
*'''Extension Projects'''
**Extension Projects can take the form of numerous creative and artistic student products, from book jackets to visual media or printed forms.  Projects provide readers with "additional ways to revisit what they've read, continue the conversations (and the discoveries), and create even more meaning" (Schlick Noe &amp; Johnson, [http://www.litcircles.org Literature Circles Resource Center)].  More conversations about the books usually arise out of sharing of these projects with the group and the whole class.
*'''Student Artifacts'''
**Response logs, role sheets, and other process material that students have compiled over the course of the Literature Circle meetings can be also evaluated providing "a rich source of insight" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;164) for the teacher to assess growth and progress of students.
*'''Wikis and Blogs'''
**Students may blog on a teacher created website.  This blog will not only facilitate conversation, but implement technology.  The blog will also give teachers a means by which to grade and assess the quality of student comprehension. Blogs enable students to share ideas, read class notes, and give feedback to the class.

'''Michael James Swanton''' is a UK polymath: historian and linguist, archaeologist and [[literary critic]] specialising in [[Old English literature]] and the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon period]].

Born a Bow-bell Cockney at the outbreak of World War II, Michael emerged from ''blitz''-stricken London dockland: epileptic, somewhat deformed and wholly depressed. Disadvantaged, he was socially excluded and persistently bullied (see Keith Richards, ''Life'', 2010, p. 55). He failed the selective 11+ exams but was educated at a series of South London state secondary schools: Modern, Technical and Grammar (see BBC Two, 'Grammar Schools: Who will Get In?', parts 1-3, 2018); then student of the University of [[University of Durham|Durham]] (elected president of the students' union, and of the Standing Congress of Northern Student Unions) and later student of [[University of Bath|Bath]], gaining research degrees in both arts and science and a higher doctorate, [[D. Litt.]], [[University of Durham|Dunelm]]. He taught [[Old English language|English]] at the [[University of Manchester]], then [[Linguistics]] at [[Justus Liebig University Giessen]] in Germany, and at [[the University of Lausanne]] in Switzerland, and finally Medieval Studies at [[University of Exeter|Exeter]], where he also acted as the university's Public Orator for several years. During the 1960s–70s he was Honorary Editor of The Royal Archaeological Institute, and in 1971 founded the Exeter Medieval Texts &amp; Studies series (seventy-five titles to date). Reckoned an authority on Anglo-Saxon England, he was elected [[Fellow]] of both the [[Royal Historical Society]] and of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]. In retirement he remains [[Emeritus Fellow]] of The Royal Historical Society and [[Emeritus Professor]] of Medieval Studies at Exeter University. Now single, he lives in Devonshire writing creatively, under noms de plume.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

His wide range of scholarly publications included translations of ''[[Beowulf]]'', the ''[[Gesta Herewardi]]'' (a life of [[Hereward the Wake]]), ''[[Vitae duorum Offarum]]'' (''The Lives of Two Offas''), and ''[[The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' as well as books on early English literature, art, architecture, and [[archaeology]].

Since 2010, there has been growing evidence for [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|admixture]] between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans. This admixture is reflected in the genomes of modern European and Asian populations, but not in the genomes of most sub-Saharan Africans. This suggests that interbreeding between Neanderthals and [[anatomically modern humans]] took place after the [[Southern Dispersal|recent "out of Africa" migration]], likely between 60,000 and 40,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;

==Name and classification==
{{see|Human taxonomy}}
Neanderthals are named after one of the first sites where their fossils were discovered in the mid-19th century in the [[Neander Valley]], just east of [[Düsseldorf]], at the time in the [[Rhine Province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (now in [[Northrhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]).  The valley itself was named for [[Joachim Neander]], ''Neander'' being the graecicized form of the surname ''[[Neumann]]'' ("new man").&lt;ref name="KringsStone1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Krings | first1=Matthias | last2=Stone | first2=Anne | last3=Schmitz | first3=Ralf W | last4=Krainitzki | first4=Heike | last5=Stoneking | first5=Mark | last6=Pääbo | first6=Svante | title=Neandertal DNA Sequences and the Origin of Modern Humans | journal=Cell | volume=90 | issue=1 | year=1997 | pages=19–30 | issn=0092-8674 | pmid=9230299 | doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80310-4}}

The German spelling of ''Thal'' "Valley" was current in the 19th century (contemporary German ''Tal'').{{efn|
The German noun is cognate with English ''[[:wikt:dale|dale]]''.
The German [[Standard German phonology#Consonants|/t/ phoneme]] was frequently spelled ''th'' throughout the 15th to 19th centuries;  ''Tal'' became standardized with the [[2nd Orthographic Conference (German)|German spelling reform]] of 1901, thus the [[German language|German]] name ''Neandertal'' for both the valley and species/subspecies.}}&lt;ref name="naming"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Howell | first1=F.

[[Neanderthal 1]] was known as the "Neanderthal cranium" or "Neanderthal skull" in anthropological literature, and the individual reconstructed on the basis of the skull was occasionally called "the Neanderthal man".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Vogt | first=Karl C | year=1864 | title=Lectures on Man: His Place in Creation, and in the History of the Earth | place=London | publisher=Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts | pages=302, 473 | url=https://archive.org/stream/lecturesonmanhi00huntgoog#page/n330/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The binomial name ''Homo neanderthalensis''—extending the name "Neanderthal man" from the individual [[type specimen]] to the entire group—was first proposed by the Anglo-Irish geologist [[William King (geologist)|William King]] in a paper read to the [[British Association]] in 1863,&lt;ref name=King64&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=King |first1=W. |date=1864 |title=On the Neanderthal Skull, or reasons for believing it to belong to the Clydian Period and to a species different from that represented by man |journal=Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Notices and Abstracts, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1863 |pages=81–82 |url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/29371003 |accessdate=2018-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MurrNashSeoiMcCo15&gt;{{Citation |last1=Murray |first1=John |last2=Nasheuer |first2=Heinz Peter |last3=Seoighe |first3=Cathal |last4=McCormack |first4=Grace P. |last5=Williams |first5=D.

Popular English usage of "Neanderthal" as shorthand for "Neanderthal man", as in  "the Neanderthals" or "a Neanderthal", emerged in the popular literature of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter alia'', ''Boys' Life'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vfJR7p5uSFAC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22the+Neanderthals%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1830&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1925&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20Neanderthals%22&amp;f=false p. 18].

Since the historical spelling ''-th-'' in German represents the phoneme /t/ or /tʰ/, not the fricative /θ/, standard British pronunciation of "Neanderthal"  is with /t/ ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/niːˈændərtɑːl/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Illustrated Dictionary |page=564 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1976 |origyear=1975 |location=Great Britain |quote=(tahl)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?dict=CALD&amp;key=53135&amp;ph=on |title=Neanderthal adjective&amp;nbsp;– definition in British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=January 8, 2013 |accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=024672%23x1%23x1%23Neanderthal&amp;selected_word=Neanderthal&amp;|title=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries&amp;nbsp;– Find pronunciation, clear meanings and definitions of words|publisher=OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurtén|first=Björn|title=Dance of the Tiger: A Novel of the Ice Age|publisher=University of California Press|date=October 10, 1995|page=xxi|isbn=0-520-20277-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M60NJvkoA2YC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=neandertal+pronunciation#v=onepage&amp;q=neandertal%20pronunciation&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}{{cite journal |title=...And Etymology |first=Carl J. |last=Pollet |journal=Science News |volume=140 |issue=12 |date=September 21, 1991 |page=191 |jstor=3975867 |doi=10.2307/3975867}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the [[Pronunciation of English ⟨th⟩|usual sound]] represented by digraph ⟨th⟩ in English, "Neanderthal" is also pronounced with the voiceless fricative /θ/, at least in "layman's American English" (as {{IPA|/niːˈændərθɔːl/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Neanderthal?r=66 |title=Neanderthal &amp;#124; Define Neanderthal at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling ''Neandertal'' is occasionally seen in English, even in scientific publications.
Since "Neanderthal", or "Neandertal", is a [[common name]], there is no authoritative prescription on its spelling, unlike the spelling of the binominal name ''H. neanderthalensis'', which is [[Principle of Priority|predicated by]] King 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Neanderthal|encyclopedia= Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Human Evolution|date= |year= 2013 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |location= Chichester, West Sussex|id= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The common name in German is always invariably ''Neandertaler'' (lit. "of the valley of Neander"), not ''Neandertal'',
but the spelling of the name of the Neander Valley itself (''Neandertal'' vs. ''Neanderthal'') has been affected by the
species name, the names of the [[Neanderthal Museum]] and of [[Neanderthal station]] persisting with pre-1900 orthography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mettmann.de/neandertal/schreibweise.php|title=Neandertal oder Neanderthal?&amp;nbsp;– Was ist denn nun richtig?|website= mettmann.de|publisher=Neanderthal museum |accessdate= February 1, 2017|quote=Heute sollten Ortsbezeichnungen das 'Neandertal' ohne 'h' bezeichnen.

The question depends on the definition of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a [[chronospecies]], which has also been in flux throughout the 20th century. Authorities preferring classification of Neanderthals as subspecies have introduced the subspecies name ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' for the anatomically modern [[Cro-Magnon]] population which lived in Europe at the same time as Neanderthals, while authorities preferring classification as separate species use ''Homo sapiens'' as equivalent to "anatomically modern humans".

During the early 20th century, a prevailing view of Neanderthals as "simian", influenced by [[Arthur Keith]] and [[Marcellin Boule]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/lhommefossiledel00boul#page/n1/mode/2up | title =L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints – full text: Volume VI (pp. 11–172), Volume VII (pp. 21–56), Volume VIII (pp. 1–70), 1911–13 | publisher =Royal College of Surgeons of England | date= |accessdate=July 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; tended to exaggerate the anatomical differences between Neanderthals and Cro Magnon.
Beginning in the 1930s, revised reconstructions of Neanderthals increasingly emphasized the similarity rather than differences from modern humans. From the 1940s throughout the 1970s, it was increasingly common to use the subspecies classification of
''Homo sapiens neanderthalensis'' vs. ''Homo sapiens sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/our-neandertal-brethren/ | title =Our Neandertal Brethren: Why They Were Not a Separate Species | publisher =Scientific American  | date=August 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Neanderthals and [[anatomically modern humans]] were initially thought to have evolved from ''[[Homo erectus]]'' between 300,000 and 200,000 years ago.
''H. erectus'' had emerged around 1.8&amp;nbsp;million years ago, and had [[Out of Africa I|long been present]], in various [[Homo erectus subspecies|subspecies]] throughout Eurasia.

The divergence time between the Neanderthal and archaic ''Homo sapiens'' lineages is estimated at between 800,000 and 400,000 years ago.

The time of divergence between archaic ''Homo sapiens'' and ancestors of Neanderthals and [[Denisovan]]s caused by a [[population bottleneck]] of the latter was dated at 744,000 years ago, combined with repeated early admixture events and Denisovans diverging from Neanderthals 300 generations after their split from ''Homo sapiens'', was calculated by Rogers et al.

"The dating of that schism between the Neanderthals and the Denisovans is surprising because previous research had pegged it as much more recent: a 2016 study, for instance, set it at only 450,000 years ago. An earlier separation means we should expect to find many more fossils of both eventually. It also changes the interpretation of some fossils that have been found. Take the large-brained hominid bones belonging to a species called Homo heidelbergensis, which lived in Europe and Asia around 600,000 years ago. Paleoanthropologists have disagreed about how they relate to other human groups, some positing they were ancestors of both modern humans and Neanderthals, others that they were a nonancestral species replaced by the Neanderthals, who spread across Europe."
&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', dated 600,000 to 300,000 years ago, has long been thought to be a likely candidate for the last common ancestor of the Neanderthal and modern human lineages.
However, genetic evidence from the [[Sima de los Huesos]] fossils published in 2016 seems to suggest that ''H. heidelbergensis'' in its entirety should be included in the Neanderthal lineage, as "pre-Neanderthal" or "early Neanderthal", while the divergence time between the Neanderthal and modern lineages has been pushed back to before the emergence of ''H. heidelbergensis'', to about 600,000 to 800,000 years ago, the approximate age of ''[[Homo antecessor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Meyer, Juan-Luis Arsuaga, Cesare de Filippo, Sarah Nagel, Ayinuer Aximu-Petri, Birgit Nickel, Ignacio Martínez, Ana Gracia, José María Bermúdez de Castro, Eudald Carbonell, Bence Viola, Janet Kelso, Kay Prüfer &amp; Svante Pääbo, "Nuclear DNA sequences from the Middle Pleistocene Sima de los Huesos hominins", ''Nature'' 531, pp.&amp;nbsp;504–07 (March 24, 2016), {{doi|10.1038/nature17405}}.

The taxonomic distinctions between ''H. heidelbergensis'' and Neanderthals is mostly due to a fossil gap in Europe between
300,000 and 243,000 years ago ([[Marine isotope stage|MIS]] 8). "Neanderthals", by conventions, are fossils which date to after this gap.&lt;ref name = "Dean1998"&gt;{{cite article|author1=D.

Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, in the book ''The 10,000 Year Explosion'', investigated whether it is accurate to depict Neanderthals as having hair patterns similar to anatomically modern humans. They concluded that: {{cquote|We don't yet know for sure, but it seems likely that, as part of their adaptation to cold, Neanderthals were furry. Chimpanzees have ridges on their finger bones that stem from the way that they clutch their mothers' fur as infants.

In 2017, researchers using 3D reconstructions of nasal cavities and [[computational fluid dynamics]] techniques have found that Neanderthals and modern humans both adapted their noses (independently and in a convergent way) to help breathe in cold and dry conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Azevedo|first=S.|last2=González|first2=M.

In ''The Spread of Modern Humans in Europe'' (2002) John F. Hoffecker writes: {{cquote|Neanderthal sites show no evidence of tools for making tailored clothing.

A 2013 study of Neanderthal skulls suggests that their [[visual perception|eyesight]] may have been better than that of modern humans, owing to larger eye sockets and larger areas of the brain devoted to vision.&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130319093639.htm|title=Neanderthal brains focused on vision and movement leaving less room for social networking|publisher=Science Daily|date=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neanderthals are known for their large [[cranial capacity]], which at {{Convert|1600|cm3|cuin|abbr=on}} is larger on average than that of modern humans.

==Interbreeding with archaic and modern humans{{anchor|Interbreeding}}==

''[[Homo erectus]]'' spread from Africa to western Asia, then east Asia and Indonesia; its presence in Europe is uncertain, but it gave rise to ''[[Homo antecessor]]'', found in [[Spain]]. ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' originated from ''Homo erectus'' in an unknown location and dispersed across Africa, southern Asia and southern Europe (other scientists interpret fossils, here named ''heidelbergensis'', as late ''erectus''). ''[[Human|Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' spread from Africa to western Asia and then to Europe and southern Asia, eventually reaching Australia and the Americas. In addition to Neanderthals and Denisovans, a third [[gene flow]] of archaic Africa origin is indicated at the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/485033a |bibcode=2012Natur.485...33S |pmid=22552077 |title=Evolution: What makes a modern human |year=2012 |journal=Nature |last1=Stringer |first1=Chris |volume=485 |issue=7396 |pages=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}]]
An alternative to extinction is that Neanderthals were absorbed into the [[Cro-Magnon]] population by [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreeding]]. This would be counter to strict versions of the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|recent African origin theory]], since it would imply that at least part of the genome of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] would descend from Neanderthals.

Until the early 1950s, most scholars thought Neanderthals were not in the ancestry of living humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Boule|first= Marcellin|date=1911–1913 |title= L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|journal= Annales de Paléontologie|volume=6–8|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232–34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neanderthal Man Not Our Ancestor|author=G.E.

P. |last=Steensby |title=Racestudier i Danmark |trans-title=Race Studies in Denmark |language=Danish |url=http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0019-PDF/gto_0019_67206.pdf |work=Geographical Journal |publisher=Royal Library, Denmark |date=1907 |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that this would best fit observations, and challenged the widespread idea that Neanderthals were ape-like or inferior. Basing his argument primarily on cranial data, he noted that the Danes, like the Frisians and the Dutch, exhibit some Neanderthaloid characteristics, and felt it was reasonable to "assume something was inherited" and that Neanderthals "are among our ancestors."

Carleton Stevens Coon in 1962 found it likely, based upon evidence from cranial data and material culture, that Neanderthal and Upper Paleolithic peoples either interbred or that the newcomers reworked Neanderthal implements "into their own kind of tools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coon|first1=Carleton Stevens|title=The Origin of races|date=1962|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|pages=548–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Thomas Cairney in 1989 went further, laying out a rationale for hybridisation and adding a broader discussion of physical characteristics as well as commentary on interbreeding and its importance to adaptive European phenotypes. Cairney specifically discussed the "intermixture of racial elements" and "hybridisation."&lt;ref name="McFarland"/&gt;

By the early 2000s, the majority of scholars supported the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa hypothesis]],&lt;ref name=pmid16826514Quo&gt;{{harvp|Liu, Prugnolle et al.|2006}}. "Currently available genetic and archaeological evidence is supportive of a recent single origin of modern humans in East Africa. However, this is where the consensus on human settlement history ends, and considerable uncertainty clouds any more detailed aspect of human colonization history."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid12802315&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stringer, Chris |date=June 2003 |title=Human evolution: Out of Ethiopia |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=423 |issue= 6941 |pages =692–93, 695 |pmid=12802315 |doi=10.1038/423692a  |bibcode=2003Natur.423..692S }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which anatomically modern humans left Africa about 50,000 years ago and replaced Neanderthals with little or no interbreeding.

While some modern human [[nuclear DNA]] has been linked to the extinct Neanderthals, no [[mitochondrial DNA]] of Neanderthal origin has been detected,&lt;ref name="KringsStone1997"/&gt; which in primates is always maternally transmitted.

===Interbreeding with Denisovans===
Sequencing of the genome of a Denisovan, a distinct but related archaic hominin, from the Denisova cave in the Siberian Altai region has shown that 17% its genome represents Neanderthal DNA.&lt;ref name=Pennisi&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.340.6134.799 |pmid=23687020 |title=More Genomes from Denisova Cave Show Mixing of Early Human Groups |journal=Science |volume=340 |issue=6134 |page=799 |year=2013 |last1=Pennisi |first1=E }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unsurprisingly, the genome from a 120,000 year old Neanderthal bone found in the same cave more closely resembled the Neanderthal DNA present in the Denisovan genome than that of Neanderthals from the [[Vindija cave]] in Croatia or the [[Mezmaiskaya cave]] in the Caucasus, suggesting that the gene flow came from a local interbreeding.&lt;ref name=prualtai&gt;{{cite journal| last=Prüfer|first=K.|author2=Racimo, Fe. |author3=Patterson, N. |author4=Jay, F. |author5=Sankararaman, S. |author6=Sawyer, S. | title=The complete genome sequence of a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains| journal=Nature| year=2013| volume=505| issue=7481| pages=43–49| doi=10.1038/nature12886|display-authors=etal | bibcode=2014Natur.505...43P | pmid=24352235 | pmc=4031459}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[complete genome sequencing]] of DNA from a 90,000 year old bone fragment, [[Denisova 11]], showed it to have belonged to a Denisovan-Neanderthal hybrid, whose father was a typical Denisovan with the Altai Neanderthal component dating to an interbreeding more than 300 generations earlier, but the specimen's mother was a Neanderthal belonging to a population more closely related to the Vindija Neanderthal than to the sequenced Altai Neanderthal genome.

==Extinction==
{{Main|Neanderthal extinction}}
According to a 2014 study by [[Thomas Higham]] and colleagues of organic samples from European sites, Neanderthals died out in Europe between 41,000 and 39,000 years ago.{{efn|Higham et al did not study samples from sites outside Europe and they stated that further work was required to rule out later survival at Gorhams Cave, Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=higham2014/&gt;}} New dating in Iberia, where Neanderthal dates as late as 28,000 years had been reported, suggests evidence of Neanderthal survival in the peninsula after 42,000 years ago is almost non-existent.&lt;ref name=galvan2014/&gt;

===Climate change===
About 55,000 years ago, the climate began to fluctuate wildly from extreme cold conditions to mild cold and back in a matter of decades. Neanderthal bodies were well-suited for survival in a cold climate—their stocky chests and limbs stored body heat better than the Cro-Magnons. Neanderthals died out in Europe between 41,000 and 39,000 years ago, apparently coinciding with the start of a very cold period.&lt;ref name="BBC2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-28693371|title=New dates rewrite Neanderthal story|work=BBC News|first=Pallab |last=Ghosh|date=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{cite news|first= Kate|last= Wong|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-mysterious-downfall|title= The Mysterious Downfall of the Neandertals|newspaper=Scientific American|date=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raw material sourcing and the examination of faunal remains by Adler et al. (2006) in the southern Caucasus suggest that modern humans may have had a survival advantage during this period, being able to use social networks to acquire resources from a greater area. They found that in both the Late Middle Palaeolithic and Early Upper Palaeolithic more than 95% of stone artifacts were drawn from local material, suggesting Neanderthals restricted themselves to more local sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=Daniel S.|last2=Bar-Oz|first2=Guy|last3=Belfer-Cohen|first3=Anna|last4=Bar-Yosef|first4=Ofer|title=Ahead of the Game: Middle and Upper Palaeolithic Hunting Behaviors in the Southern Caucasus|journal=Current Anthropology|date=2006|volume=47|issue=1|pages=89–118|doi=10.1086/432455|jstor=10.1086/432455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011 tests conducted at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit in England on what were previously thought to be Neanderthal baby teeth, which had been unearthed in 1964 from the Grotta del Cavallo in Italy, were identified as the oldest modern human remains discovered anywhere in Europe, dating from between 43,000 and 45,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="NYT-20111103"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilford |first=John Noble|authorlink=John Noble Wilford |title=Fossil Teeth Put Humans in Europe Earlier Than Thought |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/science/fossil-teeth-put-humans-in-europe-earlier-than-thought.html?pagewanted=all |date=November 2, 2011 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=August 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the 2014 study by Thomas Higham of Neanderthal bones and tools indicates that Neanderthals died out in Europe between 41,000 and 39,000 years ago, the two different human populations shared Europe for as long as 5,000 years.&lt;ref name="BBC2014"/&gt; Nonetheless, the exact nature of biological and cultural interaction between Neanderthals and other human groups has been contested.&lt;ref name="Finlayson2007"/&gt;

Modern humans co-existed with them in Europe starting around 45,000 years ago and perhaps even earlier. Neanderthals inhabited that continent long before the arrival of modern humans. These modern humans may have introduced a disease that contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals, and that may be added to other recent explanations for their extinction. When Neanderthal ancestors left Africa potentially as early as over 800,000 years ago they adapted to the pathogens in their European environment, unlike modern humans, who adapted to African pathogens. This transcontinental movement is known as the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa model]]. If contact between humans and Neanderthals occurred in Europe and Asia the first contact may have been devastating to the Neanderthal population, because they would have had little, if any, immunity to the African pathogens. More recent historical events in Eurasia and the Americas show a similar pattern, where the unintentional introduction of viral or bacterial pathogens to unprepared populations has led to mass mortality and local population extinction.&lt;ref name="Wolff, H 2010"&gt;Wolff, H. "Result Filters." National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, July 2010. Web. October 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known example of this is the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] to the New World, which brought and introduced foreign diseases when he and his crew arrived to a native population who had no immunity.

Anthropologist Pat Shipman, of Pennsylvania State University, suggested that [[Origin of the domestic dog|domestication of the dog]] could have played a role in Neanderthals' extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKie |first=Robin |date=March 1, 2015 |title=How hunting with wolves helped humans outsmart the Neanderthals |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/01/hunting-with-wolves-humans-conquered-the-world-neanderthal-evolution |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neanderthal fossils were first discovered in 1829 in the [[Schmerling Caves|Engis caves]] (the partial skull dubbed [[Engis 2]]), in what is now Belgium by [[Philippe-Charles Schmerling]] and the [[Gibraltar 1]] skull in 1848 in the [[Forbes' Quarry]], [[Gibraltar]]. These finds were not, at the time,
recognized as representing an archaic form of humans.

The first discovery which was recognized as representing an archaic form of humans was made in August 1856, three years before [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published.
This was the discovery of the type specimen, [[Neanderthal 1]], in a [[limestone]] quarry ([[Kleine Feldhofer Grotte|Feldhofer Cave]]), located in [[Neandertal (valley)|Neandertal Valley]] in the German [[Rhineland]], about {{convert|12|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Düsseldorf]]).
The find consisted of a skull cap, two [[femur|femora]], three bones of the right arm, two of the left arm, parts of the left [[pelvis|ilium]], fragments of a [[scapula]], and ribs. The workers who recovered the objects originally thought them to be the remains of a cave bear. However, they eventually gave the material to amateur naturalist [[Johann Carl Fuhlrott]], who turned the fossils over to anatomist [[Hermann Schaaffhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neanderland.de|title=Ausflug und Urlaub im Kreis Mettmann|date=September 21, 2017|website=www.neanderland.de|language=de|access-date=December 5, 2017}}

''Remains of more than 300 European Neanderthals have been found. For the most important, see [[List of human evolution fossils]].''
* [[Neanderthal 1]]: The first human bones recognised as showing a non-modern anatomy. Discovered in 1856 in a limestone quarry at the Feldhofer grotto in Neanderthal, Germany, they consist of a skull cap, the two femora, the three right arm bones, two left arm bones, the ilium, and fragments of a scapula and ribs.
* [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1]]: Called the Old Man, a fossilised skull discovered in [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints]], France, by A. and J. Bouyssonie, and L. Bardon in 1908. Characteristics include a low vaulted cranium and large browridge typical of Neanderthals. Estimated to be about 60,000 years old, the specimen was severely arthritic and had lost all his teeth long before death, leading some to suggest he was cared for by others.
* [[La Ferrassie 1]]: A fossilised skull discovered in La Ferrassie, France, by R. Capitan in 1909. It is estimated to be 70,000 years old. Its characteristics include a large occipital bun, low-vaulted cranium and heavily worn teeth.
* [[Le Moustier]] 1: One of the rare nearly complete Neanderthal skeletons to be discovered, it was excavated by a German team in 1908, at Peyzac-le-Moustier, France. Sold to a Berlin museum, the post cranial skeleton was bombed and mostly destroyed in 1945, and parts of the mid face were lost sometime after then. The skull, estimated to be less than 45,000 years old, includes a large nasal cavity and a less developed brow ridge and occipital bun than seen in other Neanderthals. The [[Mousterian]] tool techno-complex is named after its discovery site.

===Notable Southwest Asian Neanderthals===
''Remains of more than 70&lt;!-- 72 fairly certain, 11 probable --&gt; Southwest Asian Neanderthals have been found. For a complete list see [[List of Southwest Asian Neanderthals]].''
* [[Shanidar Cave|Shanidar]] 1 to 10: Eight Neanderthals and two pre-Neanderthals (Shanidar 2 and 4) were discovered in the [[Zagros Mountains]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. One of the skeletons, Shanidar 4, was once thought to have been buried with flowers, a theory no longer accepted. To [[Paul B. Pettitt]] the "deliberate placement of flowers has now been convincingly eliminated", since "[a] recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent ''Meriones tersicus'', which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today".&lt;ref&gt;The Neanderthal Dead, exploring mortuary variability in middle paleolithic eurasia. Paul B. Pettitt (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amud 1]]: A male adult Neanderthal, dated to roughly 55,000 BP, and one of several found in a cave at [[Nahal Amud]], [[Israel]]. At {{Convert|178|cm|0|abbr=on}}, it is the tallest known Neanderthal. It also has the largest cranial capacity of all extinct hominins: 1,736&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=neanderrediscovered&gt;{{cite book|first= Dmitra|last= Papagianni|first2=Michael|last2=Morse|title=The Neanderthals Rediscovered|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2013|isbn=978-0-500-05177-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Homo-neanderthalensis|title=''Homo neanderthalensis'' – The Neanderthals|publisher=Australian Museum|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kebara 2]]: A male adult post-cranial skeleton, dated to roughly 60,000 BP, that was discovered in 1983 in [[Kebara Cave]], Israel. It has been studied extensively, for its hyoid, ribcage, and pelvis are much better preserved than in all other Neanderthal specimens.

===Notable Central Asian Neanderthal===
* [[Teshik-Tash 1]]: An 8–11-year-old skeleton discovered in [[Uzbekistan]] by [[Alexey Okladnikov|Okladnikov]] in 1938. This is the only fairly complete skeleton discovered to the east of Iraq. Okladnikov claimed it was a deliberate burial, but this is debated.

'''Neanderthal Museum''' is a [[museum]] in [[Mettmann]], Germany. Located at the site of the first [[Neanderthal man]] discovery in the [[Neandertal (valley)|Neandertal]], it features an exhibit centered on [[human evolution]]. The museum was constructed in 1996 to a design by the architects Zamp Kelp, Julius Krauss and Arno Brandlhuber and draws about 170,000 visitors per year. The museum also includes an archaeological park on the original discovery site, a [[Stone Age]] workshop, as well as an art trail named "human traces". All signs in the museum as well as the audio guide offered by the museum are available in German and English.

==History==
[[File:Neanderthal excavation site.JPG|thumb|right|The site located east of [[Erkrath]] where the [[Neanderthal]] type specimen was excavated by miners in the 19th century in [[Germany]], now maintained by the Neanderthal Museum.]]
The architectural plan for the museum was chosen through a competition held in the spring of 1993 in which 130 participants from Germany and other countries participated. The design submitted by Professor Günter Zamp Kelp, Julius Krauss and Arno Brandlhuber was chosen as it represented the importance of the location.&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/museum-valley/architecture/index.html|title= Architecture|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was established on 10 October 1996 near the site where the renowned Neanderthal [[fossil]] was found.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/about-us/index.html|title= The Neanderthal Museum |accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its multimedia exhibition was upgraded in 2006. Continuing donations, endowment or testamentary of funding are helpful for further development of the museum and for acquisition of many more exhibits.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;
The former hotel Neanderthaler Hof was demolished to make room for the museum's extension.&lt;ref name="PreeceFinlay2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Preece|first1=Julian|last2=Finlay|first2=Frank|last3=Owen|first3=Ruth J.|title=New German Literature: Life-Writing and Dialogue with the Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibl0ZfFcJT4C&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=11 November 2012|year=2007|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-03911-384-2|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
The museum gives a background of the migration of people from the [[savannas]] to the modern cities with emphasis of Neanderthals. Their life size models are cast and exhibited on the basis of fossils excavated from archaeological sites.&lt;ref name=tour&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/museum-valley/the-exhibition/tour/index.html|title=Museum and Valley:Take a tour around the Museum|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibits are displayed in the four floors of the building which are interconnected through a spiraling ramp. At the beginning of the ramp, in the first section, there are exhibits on the history of the Neanderthal named "A valley and its Secret", which provides information on relics of the skeleton of the Neanderthal. The next exhibit, “A journey through time”, is about crucial stages of human history. Based on the main subject "Evolution of Humankind",  the thematic areas spread over five sections exhibit sequentially the "Life and Survival", "Tools and Knowledge", "Myth and Religion", Environment and Nourishment" and "Communication and Society".&lt;ref name=valley&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/museum-valley/the-exhibition/index.html|title= The Exhibition |accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has a unique collection of casts of the original human fossils which represent the evolution of the [[hominids]] in general and that of the Neanderthals in particular. This cast collection, prepared on the basis of finds from various excavated sites in the world, was facilitated by the donations given by Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation.&lt;ref name=Cast&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/education-research/cast-collection/index.html|title= Cast Collection|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum also houses the NESPOS Society e.V. ([[Pleistocene]] People and Places) which provides an interactive database on all anthropological and archaeological data connected with the Neanderthals in the form of "3D–images of CT-Scans and surface scans, as well as high-resolution photographs of human fossils and artifacts”. Software, developed digitally by NESPOS on the basis of all fossil collections, is distributed freely, which includes scans of 600 fossils and artifacts from [[Belgium]], [[Croatia]], [[France]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Motion&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/education-research/sammlungen/abgusssammlung/index.html|title=Human fossil cast collection|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special exhibitions===
The museum houses special exhibitions. The last exhibition on monkeys finished in October 2012 was developed by the museum at a cost of €120,000. A total of 43,000 visitors saw this exhibition, which makes it one of the more popular ones, and it will next be able to be seen at the [[Naturhistorisches Museum (Braunschweig)|Naturhistorisches Museum]] in [[Braunschweig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hördemann |first=Jérôme |title=43 000 Besucher sehen die Affenausstellung |url= http://www.wz-newsline.de/lokales/kreis-mettmann/43-000-besucher-sehen-die-affenausstellung-1.1136899 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |newspaper=Westdeutsche Zeitung |date=26 October 2012 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next special exhibition at the Neanderthal Museum will feature wolves and was created by the [[Görlitz]] branch of the [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wolves|url=http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/museum-valley/special-exhibition/index.html|publisher=Neanderthal Museum|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it will open on 18 November 2012 and will be on display until 17 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Die Wölfe kommen ins Neanderthal Museum |url= http://www.wz-newsline.de/lokales/kreis-mettmann/mettmann/die-woelfe-kommen-ins-neanderthal-museum-1.1128749 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |newspaper=Westdeutsche Zeitung |date=17 October 2012 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of this exhibition, dog owners are allowed to take their dogs into the museum on four days; this initiative is based on the precedent by the [[Phaeno Science Center]] in [[Wolfsburg]] that has an annual dog day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kuhs |first=Corinna |title=Mit Hund ins Museum |url= http://www.rp-online.de/region-duesseldorf/mettmann/nachrichten/mit-hund-ins-museum-1.3043158 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |newspaper=Rheinische Post |date=25 October 2012 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==

===Research===
The Neanderthal Museum Foundation apart from its present [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro|museographic]] exhibits also supports research with an interdisciplinary academic approach with particular emphasis on research of the early history of humanity. International excavations and research projects are also actively pursued programmes. The museum encourages lay people to facilitate investigations on local prehistory. The Museum has the world’s largest database on glacial archaeology, under the title "NESPOS". Its activities include holding International conferences and symposiums on a regular basis, which "generate interdisciplinary contacts and spark new ideas and perspectives" and the proceedings of which are published in scientific series published by the museum.&lt;ref name=Research&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/education-research/research/index.html|title= Research Projects|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum’s work in archaeological and [[Paleolithic|palaeo]]-[[anthropological]] research is succinctly displayed through the audio visuals screened with the aid of several types of  multimedia equipment.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt; The museum has an exhaustive collection of scientific publications and movies related to the prehistory of Europe and western Asia and also many scientific journals and monographs which can referred at the media centre.&lt;ref name=Media&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/education-research/media-centre/index.html|title= Media Centre |accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education programmes===
The museum specifically operates a programme to disseminate knowledge to teachers (including pre-school teachers) through its Permanent Exhibition and Stone Age Workshop. Children are also encouraged to learn from the exhibits which are not part of the school curriculum. In this regard the display areas in the garden such as the Discovery Site, the “Human Traces” art trail and the Ice Age Game Reserve are very topical for children in particular.&lt;ref name=teacher&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/education-research/teachers-site/index.html|title= Information for teachers and pre-school teachers|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neanderthal Museum also conducts a workshop on the [[Stone Age]], which is educative not only to children but also to the youth and older people. In this workshop, access is provided to prehistoric fossils like bone, leather or [[sinew]], prehistoric tools and techniques used in the daily life of our ancestors.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthalmuseum.info/en/education-research/stone-age-workshop/index.html|title= Stone Age Workshop programme|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Neandertala skulptajho, 1928.jpg|thumbnail|right|A reconstructed sculpture Neanderthal man made in 1928 on display in the museum grounds.]]

==Grounds==
In the garden area, which is developed in the precincts of the museum to represent the [[Neander Valley]], there are many attractions along the labelled paths labelled such as Art trail "Human Traces”. Further, towards the Game reserve, the [[aurochs]] and the [[wild horse]]s can be seen. The original excavated site where fossils of Neanderthal man were found is also close to the museum.&lt;ref name=Neander&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neanderthal.de/en/museum-valley/in-the-valley/index.html|title=In the Neander Valley|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Official Website of Neanderthal Museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201064708/http://www.neanderthal.de/en/museum-valley/in-the-valley/index.html|archivedate=1 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], a '''negative income tax''' ('''NIT''') is a welfare system within an income tax where people earning below a certain amount receive supplemental pay from the government instead of paying taxes to the government.

Such a system has been discussed by economists but never fully implemented.

Negative income taxes can implement a [[basic income]] or supplement a [[guaranteed minimum income]] system.

In a negative income tax system, people earning a certain income level would owe no taxes; those earning more than that would pay a proportion of their income above that level; and those below that level would receive a payment of a proportion of their shortfall, which is the amount their income falls below that level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=Replace Welfare With a Negative Income Tax|url=http://economics21.org/commentary/replace-welfare-negative-income-tax|website=Economics 21|publisher=The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General welfare==
A negative income tax is intended to create a single system that would not only pay for government, but would also fulfill the social goal of making sure that there was a minimum level of income for all. It is theorized that, with an NIT, the need for [[minimum wage]], food stamps, welfare, social security programs and other government assistance programs could be eliminated, thus reducing the administrative effort and cost to a fraction of what it is under the current system, as well as eliminating the [[perverse incentive]]s created by these overlapping aid programs, e.g. when a minimum wage worker who earns a little more nets out with less income because they are newly ineligible for aid. Theoretically, the worker would then be stuck in a [[welfare trap]] and would have no incentive to seek higher wages.

A NIT does not disrupt low-wage markets, whereas a minimum wage law makes certain that people whose skills are not sufficient to justify that kind of wage will go unemployed. A NIT would therefore increase the availability of cheap labor, which would enable businesses to do domestically some of the work which they would otherwise have to outsource to other countries.

A NIT could reduce administrative overhead, since the large bureaucracies responsible for administering taxation and welfare systems, with the multitude of rules, thresholds and different applications required, could be greatly reduced or eliminated. The savings from this could then be returned to the people through spending on different government activities, via tax cuts, or any array of different ways.

== Specific models ==

Various different models of negative income tax have been proposed.

One model was proposed by [[Milton Friedman]].&lt;ref name=capitalism_and_freedom /&gt;&lt;ref name=essence_friedman /&gt;  In this version, a specified proportion of unused deductions or allowances would be refunded to the taxpayer. If, for a family of four the amount of allowances came out to $10,000, and the subsidy rate was 50%, and the family earned $6,000, the family would receive $2,000, because it left $4,000 of allowances unused, and therefore qualifies for $2,000, half that amount. Friedman feared that subsidy rates any higher would lessen the incentive to obtain employment. He also warned that the negative income tax, as an addition to the "ragbag" of [[Welfare state|welfare]] and assistance programs, would only worsen the problem of bureaucracy and waste. Instead, he argued, the negative income tax should immediately replace all other welfare and assistance programs on the way to a completely [[laissez-faire]] society where all welfare is privately administered. The negative income tax has come up in one form or another in [[United States Congress|Congress]], but Friedman eventually opposed it because it came packaged with other undesirable elements antithetical to the efficacy of the negative income tax. Friedman preferred to have no income tax at all, but said he did not think it was politically feasible at that time to eliminate it, so he suggested this as a less harmful income tax scheme.&lt;ref name=free_to_choose /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frank|first=Robert H|date=2006-11-23 |title=The Other Milton Friedman: A Conservative With a Social Welfare Program |journal=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/23/business/23scene.html?_r=2|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flat tax with negative income tax ===

The effort for reporting and supervision can be significantly reduced by combining basic income with flat income tax. The relationship between gross and net income for individuals can be adjusted to correspond roughly to current relationship at all income levels, implying that income tax is effectively progressive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-graz.at/~parncutt/BIFT2.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514152858/http://www.uni-graz.at/~parncutt/BIFT2.html |date=May 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[flat tax|flat rate income taxation]] with [[tax exemption]] implements a negative income tax as well as maintaining an actual tax rate progression at extremely low administrative cost. This is achieved by paying a ''tax on the tax exemption to all taxpayers'', e.g. in monthly payments. The tax on the tax exemption is computed by applying the nominal flat tax rate to the exemption. The tax on the income is drawn directly ''from the source'', e.g. from an employer. The tax on income is computed by applying the nominal flat tax rate to the income.

This simple method results in an effective progressive rate taxation (although the tax rate for the taxes drawn at the source is flat) which is positive once the income exceeds the tax exemption. If, however, the income is less than the tax exemption, the effective progressive rate actually becomes negative without any involvement by any tax authority. As for the positive progression, only very high incomes would lead to an actual tax rate which is close to the nominal flat tax rate.

The tax on tax exemption also can be understood as a [[tax credit]], which is paid back once an income has reached the level of the tax exemption. This level marks the point where paid taxes and the tax credit are equal. Above that point the state earns taxes from the taxpayer. Below that point the state pays taxes to the taxpayer.

Example:
* The income tax rate is 50%.
* The tax exemption is $30,000.
* The subsidy rate is 50% and equal to the income tax rate.

Under this scheme:
* A person earning $0 would receive $15,000 from the government.
* A person earning $25,000 would receive $2,500 from the government.
* A person earning $30,000 would neither receive any money nor pay any tax.
* A person earning $50,000 would pay a tax of $10,000.
* A person earning $100,000 would pay a tax of $35,000.

Flat tax implementations ''without'' the provision of a negative income tax actually need an ''additional'' effort in order to ''avoid'' negative taxation. For such a tax, the exemption only can be paid after knowing the earned income. Flat tax implementations ''with'' negative income tax allow the payment or crediting of the income tax at any interval, independent of the amount of the actual income.

==Implementation==

While the notion has long been popular in some circles, its implementation has never been politically feasible. This is partly because of the very complex and entrenched nature of most countries' current tax laws: they would have to be rewritten under any NIT system. However, some countries have seen the introduction of refundable (or non-wastable) [[tax credit]]s which can be paid even when there is no tax liability to be offset, such as the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] in the United States and [[working tax credit]] in the UK. 

In 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] proposed a negative income tax as the centerpiece of his welfare reform program, but the NIT was not approved by Congress; however, Congress did pass a bill establishing [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI), providing a guaranteed income for elderly and disabled persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A policy called negative income tax has been implemented for a certain bracket of low incomes in [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Experiments==

From 1968 to 1982, the US and Canadian governments conducted a total of five negative income tax experiments. They were the first major social science experiments in the world. The first experiment was the [[New Jersey Income Maintenance Experiment]], proposed by MIT Economics graduate student [[Heather Ross]] in 1967 in a proposal to the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urban.org/pubs/digest/introduction.html |title=An Overview of Social Experimentation and the Digest |publisher=Urban.org |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2013-02-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130101109/http://www.urban.org/pubs/digest/introduction.html |archivedate=2011-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocates==
In the United States, [[Milton_Friedman|Milton]] and [[Rose Friedman]] promoted the idea in 1980 in their book and television series ''[[Free to Choose]]''.
More recently, a negative income tax was advocated by the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] as part of their 2010 platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gp.org/committees/platform/2010/economic-justice.php |title=The Green Party of the United States |publisher=Gp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111917/http://www.gp.org/committees/platform/2010/economic-justice.php |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], a negative income tax is advocated by the [[Pirate Party (Australia)|Pirate Party]] as part of their tax policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/Platform#Basic_income_through_reverse_taxation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708083444/http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/Platform#Basic_income_through_reverse_taxation |date=July 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slovakia]], welfare and tax system reform based on NIT is proposed by [[classical liberal]] [[Freedom and Solidarity]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sulik.sk/media/contribution_bonus.pdf] {{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final book ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (1967), American civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King jr., ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=Replace Welfare with a Negative Income Tax|url=http://economics21.org/commentary/replace-welfare-negative-income-tax|website=Economics 21|publisher=The Manhattan Institute|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{"|I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.|from the chapter titled "Where We Are Going"}}

==Criticism==
A common criticism is that the NIT might reduce the incentive to work, since recipients of the NIT would receive a guaranteed minimum wage equal to the government payment in the absence of employment. A series of studies in the United States beginning in 1968 attempted to test for effects on work incentives. [[Jodie Allen]] summarizes the key studies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Stanford Research Institute (SRI), which analyzed the SIME/DIME findings, found stronger work disincentive effects, ranging from an average 9 percent work reduction for husbands to an average 18 percent reduction for wives. This was not as scary as some NIT opponents had predicted. But it was large enough to suggest that as much as 50 to 60 percent of the transfers paid to two-parent families under a NIT might go to replace lost earnings. They also found an unexpected result: instead of promoting family stability (the presumed result of extending benefits to two-parent working families on an equal basis), the NITs seemed to increase family breakup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Allen |first1=Jodie T. |editor= [[David R. Henderson]] (ed.) |encyclopedia=[[Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |title=Negative Income Tax |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NegativeIncomeTax.html |year=2002 |edition= 1st |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] }} {{OCLC|317650570|50016270|163149563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The link between NIT and divorce was later determined to be due to a statistical error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another criticism comes from the relative expense of the establishment of such a tax. According to a research project conducted by Rutgers University in 2002, a program of targeted job creation would produce similar wealth redistribution with significantly less cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Philip|title=The Relative Cost of a Universal Basic Income and a Negative Income Tax|journal=An International Journal of Basic Income Research|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pacific Islander|Pacific Islands]] Americans''', also known as '''[[Oceania]]n Americans''', '''Pacific Islander Americans''' or '''Native Hawaiian''' and/or other '''Pacific Islander Americans''', are [[Americans]] who have ethnic ancestry among the [[indigenous peoples of Oceania]] (viz. [[Polynesians]], [[Melanesians]] and [[Micronesian people|Micronesians]]). For its purposes, the U.S. Census also counts [[Indigenous Australians]] as part of this group.&lt;ref&gt;University of Virginia.  Geospatial and Statistical Data Center.

Pacific Islander Americans make up 0.5% of the U.S. population including those with partial Pacific Islander ancestry, enumerating about 1.4 million people. The largest ethnic subgroups of Pacific Islander Americans are [[Native Hawaiian]]s, [[Samoan American|Samoans]], [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]], [[Fijian American|Fijian]]s, [[Marshallese American|Marshallese]] and [[Tongan American|Tongan]]s. Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Tongans, and Chamorros have large communities in [[Hawaii]], [[California]], [[Utah]], [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], with sizable communities in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]], and [[Alaska]]. Fijians are predominantly based in [[California]].  

[[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] are [[insular area]]s ([[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]]), while [[Hawaii]] is a [[U.S. state|state]].

== Population ==
In the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census, the term "Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander" refers to people having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Tonga, Samoa, Fiji, the Marshalls or other Pacific Islands.

In the 2010 census 1,225,195 Americans claimed "'Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander'" as their race alone or in combination.

==Micronesian Americans==
[[Micronesian Americans]] are Americans of [[Micronesia]]n descent.

According to the 2010 census, the largest Chamoru populations were located in California, Washington and Texas, but their combined number from these three states totaled less than half the number living throughout the U.S. It also revealed that the Chamoru people are the most geographically dispersed Oceanic ethnicity in the country.&lt;ref name=chamCen&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census Shows More than Half of Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders Report Multiple Races|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/news/releases/operations/cb12-83.html|website=United States Census 2010|publisher=United States government|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshallese Americans]] or Marshallese come from the [[Marshall Islands]]. In the 2010 census 22,434 Americans identified as being of Marshallese descent.

Because of the Marshall Islands entering the [[Compact of Free Association]] in 1986, Marshallese have been allowed to migrate and work in the United States. There are many reasons why Marshallese came to the United States. Some Marshallese came for educational opportunities, particularly for their children. Others sought work or better health care than what’s available in the islands. Massive layoffs by the Marshallese government in 2000 led to a second big wave of immigration.

Arkansas has the largest Marshallese population with over 6,000 residents. Many live in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]], and the Marshallese comprise over 5% of the city's population. Other significant Marshallese populations include [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] and [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]].

==Polynesian Americans==
'''Polynesian Americans''' are [[Americans]] of [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] descent.

Large subcategories of Polynesian Americans include Native Hawaiians and Samoan Americans. In addition there are smaller communities of [[Tongan American]]s (see [[Tonga#Culture and diaspora|Culture and diaspora of Tonga]]), [[French Polynesian American]]s, and [[Māori American]]s.

A [[Samoan American]] is an American who is of ethnic Samoan descent either from the independent nation [[Samoa]] or the [[Insular area|American territory]] of [[American Samoa]]. Samoan American is a subcategory of Polynesian American. About 55,000 people live on American Samoa, while the US census in 2000 and 2008 has found 4 times the number of Samoan Americans live in the mainland USA.

California has the most Samoans; concentrations live in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Los Angeles County]], and [[San Diego County]]. [[San Francisco]] has approximately 2,000 people of Samoan ancestry, and other Bay Area cities such as [[East Palo Alto]] and [[Daly City]] have Samoan communities. In Los Angeles County, [[Long Beach, CA|Long Beach]] and [[Carson, CA|Carson]] have abundant Samoan communities, as well as in [[Oceanside, CA|Oceanside]] in San Diego County.&lt;ref name='malcolmx'&gt;{{cite news | first = Heather | last = Knight | title = A YEAR AT MALCOLM X: Second Chance at Success Samoan families learn American culture | date = March 1, 2006 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/01/BAGSCHGDDO1.DTL&amp;ao=all | work = San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='latimes09'&gt;{{cite news | first = Louis | last = Sahagun | title = Samoans in Carson hold church services for tsunami, earthquake victims | date = October 1, 2009 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/01/local/me-samoa-carson1 | work = Los Angeles Times | accessdate = 2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, Jessica.

Retrieved 2010-10-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Other West Coast metropolitan areas such as [[Seattle]] have strong Samoan communities, mainly in [[King County, WA|King County]] and in [[Tacoma, WA|Tacoma]]. [[Anchorage]], [[Alaska]] and [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] both have thousands of Samoan Americans residing in each city.

Persons born in American Samoa are United States [[nationality|national]]s, but not United States [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://harvardlawreview.org/2017/04/american-samoa-and-the-citizenship-clause/ American Samoa and the Citizenship Clause: A Study in Insular Cases Revisionism. Chapter 3. Harvard Law Review. Retrieved October 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is the only circumstance under which an individual would be one and not the other.)  For this reason, Samoans can move to Hawaii or the mainland United States and obtain citizenship comparatively easily. Like Hawaiian Americans, the Samoans arrived in the mainland in the 20th century as agricultural laborers and factory workers.

Elsewhere in the United States, Samoan Americans are plentiful throughout the state of [[Utah]], as well as in [[Killeen, Texas]], [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and [[Independence, Missouri]].

A [[Tongan American]] is an American who is of ethnic Tongan descent. [[Utah]] has the largest Tongan American population and Hawaii has the second largest. Many of the first Tongan Americans came to the United States in connection to the [[LDS Church]].

==Military==
Based on 2003 recruiting data, Pacific Islander Americans were 249% over-represented in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Bears the Burden?|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2005/11/who-bears-the-burden-demographic-characteristics-of-us-military-recruits-before-and-after-9-11|publisher=Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Samoans are distinguished among the wider Pacific Islander group for enthusiasm for enlistment.  In 2007, a Chicago Tribune reporter covering the island's military service noted, "American Samoa is one of the few places in the nation where military recruiters not only meet their enlistment quotas but soundly exceed them."&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|last=Scharnberg|first=Kirsten|title=Young Samoans have little choice but to enlist|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Mar/21/ln/FP703210396.html|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=March 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2009|3|23}} there have been 10 American Samoans who have died in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraq]], and 2 who have died in [[OEF-A|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Congressman Faleomavaega |authorlink=Eni Faleomavaega |title=WASHINGTON, D.C.—AMERICAN SAMOA DEATH RATE IN THE IRAQ WAR IS HIGHEST AMONG ALL STATES AND U.S. TERRITORIES |url=http://www.house.gov/list/press/as00_faleomavaega/asdeathratehighestamongstates.html |work=Press Release |publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]] |date=23 March 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009100120/http://www.house.gov/list/press/as00_faleomavaega/asdeathratehighestamongstates.html |archivedate=9 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacific Islander Americans are also represented in the [[Navy SEALS]], making up .6% of the enlisted and .1% of the officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Navy SEALS to Diversify|newspaper=Time|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2014}}
'''Pleonasm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|iː|ə|n|æ|z|ə|m}}; {{ety|grc|''{{linktext|πλεονασμός}}'', {{lang|grc-Latn|pleonasmós}}}}, {{ety||''{{linktext|πλέον}}'', {{lang|grc-Latn|pleon}}|more; too much}}) is the use of more [[word]]s or [[morpheme|parts of words]] than are necessary or sufficient for clear expression: for example ''black darkness'' or ''burning fire''. Such [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] is, by traditional [[rhetoric]]al criteria, a manifestation of [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. However, pleonasm may also be used for emphasis, or because the phrase has already become established in a certain form.

==Usage==
Most often, ''pleonasm'' is understood to mean a word or phrase which is useless, [[cliché]]d, or repetitive, but a pleonasm can also be simply an unremarkable use of [[idiom]]. It can aid in achieving a specific linguistic effect, be it social, poetic, or literary. In particular, pleonasm sometimes serves the same function as rhetorical repetition—it can be used to reinforce an idea, contention, or question, rendering writing clearer and easier to understand. Further, pleonasm can serve as a [[redundancy check]]: If a word is unknown, misunderstood, or misheard, or the medium of communication is poor—a wireless telephone connection or sloppy handwriting—pleonastic phrases can help ensure that the entire meaning gets across even if some of the words get lost.

===Idiomatic expressions===
Some pleonastic phrases are part of a language's idiom, like "tuna fish" and "safe haven" in American [[English language|English]]. They are so common that their use is unremarkable and often even unnoticeable for native speakers, although in many cases the redundancy can be dropped with no loss of meaning.

When expressing possibility, English speakers often use potentially pleonastic expressions such as ''It may be possible'' or ''maybe it's possible'', where both terms (verb ''may''&amp;nbsp;/ adverb ''maybe'' and adjective ''possible'') have the same meaning under certain constructions. Many speakers of English use such expressions for possibility in general, such that most instances of such expressions by those speakers are in fact pleonastic. Others, however, use this expression only to indicate a distinction between ontological possibility and epistemic possibility, as in "Both the ontological possibility of X under current conditions and the ontological impossibility of X under current conditions are epistemically possible" (in [[Propositional logic|logical]] terms, "I am not aware of any facts inconsistent with the truth of proposition X, but I am likewise not aware of any facts inconsistent with the truth of the negation of X"). The habitual use of the double construction to indicate possibility ''per se'' is far less widespread among speakers of most other languages (except in Spanish; see examples); rather, almost all speakers of those languages use one term in a single expression:
* French: ''Il est possible'' or ''il peut arriver''.
* Romanian: ''Este posibil'' or ''se poate întâmpla''.
* Typical Spanish pleonasms
** ''Voy a subir arriba'' - I am going to go up upstairs, "''arriba''" not being necessary.
** ''Entra para adentro'' - Go in inside, "''para adentro''" not being necessary.

* Turkish has many pleonastic constructs because certain verbs necessitate objects:
** ''yemek yemek'' - to eat food.
** ''yazı yazmak'' - to write writing.
** ''dışarı çıkmak'' - to go out outside.
** ''içeri girmek'' - to go in inside.
** ''oyun oynamak'' - to play game.

In a [[verb framing|satellite-framed]] language like English, [[verb phrase]]s containing [[grammatical particle|particle]]s that denote direction of motion are so frequent that even when such a particle is pleonastic, it seems natural to include it (e.g. "enter into").

===Professional and scholarly use===
Some pleonastic phrases, when used in professional or scholarly writing, may reflect a standardized usage that has evolved or a meaning familiar to specialists but not necessarily to those outside that discipline. Such examples as "null and void", "terms and conditions", "each and every" are [[legal doublet]]s that are part of [[Legal English|legally operative language]] that is often drafted into legal documents. A classic example of such usage was that by the [[Lord Chancellor]] at the time (1864), [[Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury|Lord Westbury]], in the English case of ''{{lang|la|ex parte}} Gorely'',&lt;ref&gt;''Ex p Gorely'', (1864) 4 De G L &amp; S 477.&lt;/ref&gt; when he described a phrase in an Act as "redundant and pleonastic". Although this type of usage may be favored in certain contexts, it may also be disfavored when used gratuitously to portray false erudition, obfuscate, or otherwise introduce verbiage. This is especially so in disciplines where imprecision may introduce ambiguities (such as the natural sciences).&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stylistic preference===
In addition, pleonasms can serve purposes external to meaning. For example, a speaker who is too terse is often interpreted as lacking ease or grace, because, in oral and sign language, sentences are spontaneously created without the benefit of editing. The restriction on the ability to plan often creates much redundancy. In written language, removing words not strictly necessary sometimes makes writing seem stilted or awkward, especially if the words are cut from an idiomatic expression.

On the other hand, as is the case with any literary or rhetorical effect, excessive use of pleonasm weakens writing and speech; words distract from the content. Writers wanting to conceal a thought or a purpose obscure their meaning with verbiage. [[William Strunk Jr]]. advocated concision in ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (1918):

{{quote|Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.}}

Yet, one has only to look at [[Baroque]], [[Mannerist]], and [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] sources for different opinions.

===Literary uses===
* "This was the '''most''' unkind'''est''' cut of all." &amp;mdash;[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (Act 3, Scene 2,183).
* "I will be brief: your noble son is mad:/Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,/What is't but to be nothing else but mad?" &amp;mdash; ''[[Hamlet]]'' (Act 2, Scene 2)
* "Beyond the garage were some decorative trees trimmed as carefully as '''poodle dogs'''." &amp;mdash;[[Raymond Chandler]], ''[[The Big Sleep]]''.
* "Let me tell you this, when social workers offer you, '''free, gratis and for nothing''', something to hinder you from swooning, which with them is an obsession, it is useless to recoil ..." &amp;mdash;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]''.

==Types==
{{Original research section|date=September 2010}}
There are two kinds of pleonasm: '''syntactic pleonasm''' and '''semantic pleonasm'''.

===Syntactic pleonasm===
[[Syntax|Syntactic]] pleonasm occurs when the [[grammar]] of a language makes certain [[function word]]s optional. For example, consider the following [[English language|English]] sentences:

* "I know you're coming."
* "I know that you're coming."

In this construction, the [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''that'' is optional when joining a sentence to a [[verb]] phrase with ''know''. Both sentences are grammatically correct, but the word ''that'' is pleonastic in this case. By contrast, when a sentence is in spoken form and the verb involved is one of assertion, the use of ''that'' makes clear that the present speaker is making an indirect rather than a direct quotation, such that he is not imputing particular words to the person he describes as having made an assertion; the demonstrative adjective ''that'' also does not fit such an example. Also, some writers may use "that" for technical clarity reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Possible Worlds: an introduction to Logic and its Philosophy|year=1979|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/pw/index.htm|author=Norman Swartz &amp; Raymond Bradley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages, such as French, the word is not optional and should therefore not be considered pleonastic.

The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] with subject pronouns. Since Spanish is a [[null-subject language]], which allows subject pronouns to be deleted when understood, the following sentences mean the same:

* "{{lang|es|Yo te amo.}}"
* "{{lang|es|Te amo.}}"

In this case, the pronoun {{lang|es|yo}} ('I') is grammatically optional; both sentences mean "I love you" (however, they may not have the same tone or ''intention''—this depends on [[pragmatics]] rather than grammar). Such differing but [[syntax|syntactically]] equivalent constructions, in many languages, may also indicate a difference in [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]].

The process of deleting pronouns is called ''[[pro-drop language|pro-dropping]]'', and it also happens in many other languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Latin]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Scandinavian languages]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], some&lt;!-- if not all --&gt; [[Slavic languages]], and the [[Lao language]].

In contrast, formal English requires an overt subject in each clause. A sentence may not need a subject to have valid meaning, but to satisfy the syntactic requirement for an explicit subject a pleonastic (or [[dummy pronoun]]) is used; only the first sentence in the following pair is acceptable English:

* "It's raining."
* "Is raining."

In this example the pleonastic "it" fills the subject function, however, it does not contribute any meaning to the sentence. The second sentence, which omits the pleonastic '''it''' is marked as ungrammatical although no meaning is lost by the omission.&lt;ref&gt;Haegeman, L. (1991). ''Introduction to Government and Binding Theory''. Blackwell Publishing. pp 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements such as "it", or "there" serving as empty subject markers are also called (syntactic) [[Syntactic expletive|expletive]]s, and also dummy pronouns. Compare:

* "There is rain."
* "Today is rain."

The pleonastic {{lang|fr|ne}} ({{lang|fr|ne pléonastique}}), expressing uncertainty in formal [[French language|French]], works as follows:
*"{{lang|fr|Je crains qu'il ne pleuve.}}"&lt;br /&gt;('I fear it may rain.')
*"{{lang|fr|Ces idées sont plus difficiles à comprendre que je ne pensais.}}"&lt;br /&gt;('These ideas are harder to understand than I thought.')

Two more striking examples of French pleonastic construction are the word {{lang|fr|aujourd'hui}} translated as 'today', but originally meaning "on the day of today", and the phrase {{lang|fr|Qu'est-ce que c'est?}} meaning 'What's that?' or 'What is it?', while literally it means "What is it that it is?".

There are examples of the pleonastic, or dummy, negative in English, such as the construction, heard in the New England region of the United States, in which the phrase "So don't I" is intended to have the same positive meaning as "So do I."&lt;ref&gt;Horn, Laurence R. ''Universals of Human Language'', Volume I, edited by Joseph H. Greenberg, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Jim P. (2008), "''So''-inversion as Polarity Focus"; in Michael Grosvald and Dianne Soares (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 38th Western Conference on Linguistics''; Fresno, California: University of California Press; pp. 304-317&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Robert South]] said, "It is a pleonasm, a figure usual in [[Bible|Scripture]], by a multiplicity of expressions to signify one notable thing",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ukIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA368|chapter=Sermon XIII Preached at St. Mary's, Oxford, on Sept. 12, 1658 |title=Five additional volumes of sermons preached upon several occasions,|volume=8|first=Robert |last=South|date=1744|page=368|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was observing the [[Biblical Hebrew]] poetic propensity to repeat thoughts in different words, since written Biblical Hebrew was a comparatively early form of written language and was written using oral patterning, which has many pleonasms. In particular, very many verses of the [[Psalms]] are split into two halves, each of which says much the same thing in different words. The complex rules and forms of written language as distinct from spoken language were not as well-developed as they are today when the books making up the [[Old Testament]] were written.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Walter J., ''Orality and Literacy (New Accents)'', p. 38, {{ISBN|0-415-28129-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter, John C. ''Doing Our Own Thing'', p. 19. {{ISBN|1-59240-084-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[parallelism (rhetoric)]].

This same pleonastic style remains very common in modern poetry and songwriting (e.g., "Anne, with her father&amp;nbsp;/ is out in the boat&amp;nbsp;/ riding the water&amp;nbsp;/ riding the waves&amp;nbsp;/ on the sea", from [[Peter Gabriel]]'s "Mercy Street").

====Types of syntactic pleonasm====
* ''Overinflection'': Many languages with [[inflection]], as a result of convention, tend to inflect more words in a given phrase than actually needed in order to express a single grammatical property. Take for example the German, ''Die alten Frauen sprechen''. Even though the plural form of the noun tells us the grammatical number of the noun phrase, the German language still dictates that the definite article, attributive adjective, and the verb must all also express the plural. Not all languages are quite as redundant however, and will permit inflection for number when there is an obvious numerical marker, as is the case with Hungarian, which does have a plural proper, but would express ''two flowers'' as ''two flower''. (The same is the case in [[Celtic languages]], where numerical markers precede singular nouns.) The main contrast between Hungarian and other tongues such as German or even English (to a lesser extent) is that in either of the latter, expressing plurality when already evident is not optional, but mandatory; making the neglect of these rules result in an ungrammatical sentence. As well as for number, our aforementioned German phrase also overinflects for grammatical case.
* ''[[Double negative|Multiple negation]]'': In some languages, repeated [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] may be used for emphasis, as in the English sentence, "There ai'''n't nothing''' wrong with that". While a literal interpretation of this sentence would be "There is not nothing wrong with that," i.e. "There is something wrong with that," the intended meaning is, in fact, the opposite: "There is nothing wrong with that" or "There isn't anything wrong with that." The repeated negation is used pleonastically for emphasis. However, this is not always the case. In the sentence "I do'''n't not''' like it," the repeated negative may be used to convey ambivalence ("I neither like nor dislike it") or even affirmation ("I ''do'' like it"). (Rhetorically, this becomes the device of [[litotes]]; it can be difficult to distinguish litotes from pleonastic double negation, a feature which may be used for [[irony|ironic]] effect.) Although the use of "double negatives" for emphatic purposes is sometimes discouraged in standard English, it is mandatory in other languages like Spanish or French. For example, the Spanish phrase {{lang|es|No es nada}} ('It is nothing') contains both a negated verb ("no es") and another negative, the word for nothing ("nada").
* ''Multiple affirmations'': In English, repeated affirmation can be used to add emphasis to an affirmative statement, just as repeated negation can add emphasis to a negative one. A sentence like ''I '''do''' love you'', with a stronger intonation on the ''do'', uses double affirmation. This is because all languages, by default, automatically express their sentences in the affirmative{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and must then alter the sentence in one way or another to express the opposite. Therefore, the sentence ''I love you'' is ''already'' affirmative, and adding the extra ''do'' only adds emphasis and does not change the meaning of the statement.
* ''Double possession'': The [[English possessive#Double genitive|double genitive]] of English, as with ''a friend of mine'', although seemingly pleonastic, and therefore has been stigmatized, has a long history of use by careful writers and has been analyzed as either a [[partitive]] genitive or an [[appositive]] genitive.
* ''Multiple quality gradation'': In English, different [[degrees of comparison]] ([[comparative]]s and [[superlative]]s) are created through a morphological change to an adjective (e.g. "prettier", "fastest") or a syntactic construction (e.g. "more complex", "most impressive"). It is thus possible to combine both forms for additional emphasis: "more bigger" or "bestest". This may be considered ungrammatical, but is common in informal speech for some English speakers. "The most unkindest cut of all" is from Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar''. Musical notation has a repeated Italian superlative in ''[[wikt:fortississimo|fortississimo]]'' and ''[[wikt:pianississimo|pianississimo]]''.

:Not all uses of constructions such as "more bigger" are pleonastic, however. Some speakers who use such utterances do so in an attempt, albeit a grammatically unconventional one, to create a non-pleonastic construction: A person who says "X is more bigger than Y" may, in the context of a conversation featuring a previous comparison of some object Z with Y, mean "The degree by which X exceeds Y in size is greater than the degree by which Z exceeds Y in size". This usage amounts to the treatment of "bigger than Y" as a single grammatical unit, namely an adjective itself admitting of degrees, such that "X is more bigger than Y" is equivalent to "X is more bigger-than-Y than Z is." Another common way to express this is: "X is even bigger than Z."

===Semantic pleonasm===
Semantic pleonasm is a question more of style and usage than of grammar&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Bergen, Evans, Cor Nelia, and others, (1957), ''A dictionary of contemporary American usage'', Random House&lt;/ref&gt;. Linguists usually call this ''redundancy'' to avoid confusion with syntactic pleonasm, a more important phenomenon for theoretical [[linguistics]]. It usually takes one of two forms: Overlap or prolixity.

'''Overlap''': One word's semantic component is subsumed by the other:
* "Receive a '''free gift''' with every purchase."
* "I ate a '''tuna fish''' sandwich."
* "The plumber fixed our '''hot''' water '''heater'''." (This pleonasm was famously attacked by American comedian [[George Carlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |at="'‘George Carlin at USC'’ (1978)" section |title=Divine Comedy: 25 Best Stand-Up Specials and Movies |first1=Steve |last1=Ciabattoni |first2=David |last2=Fear |first3=Tim |last3=Grierson |first4=Matthew |last4=Love |first5=Noel |last5=Murray |first6=Scott |last6=Tobias |work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Penske Business Media |date=29 July 2015 |access-date=27 July 2018|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/divine-comedy-25-best-stand-up-specials-and-movies-70696/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not truly redundant; a device that increases the temperature of cold water to room temperature would also be a water heater, although it did not heat hot water.)
* ''The '''Big''' Friendly '''Giant'''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'' (title of a children's book by [[Roald Dahl]]), a giant is inherently big

'''Prolixity''': A phrase may have words which add nothing, or nothing logical or relevant, to the meaning.
* "I'm going '''down''' south."&lt;br /&gt;(South is not really "down", it is just drawn that way on maps by convention.)
* "You can't seem to face '''up to''' the facts."
* "He '''entered into''' the room."
* "Every '''mother's''' child" (as in 'The Christmas Song' by Nat King Cole', also known as 'Chestnuts roasting...')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Christmas Song by Nat King Cole|url=https://genius.com/Nat-king-cole-the-christmas-song-lyrics|website=Lyrics|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. (Being a child, or a human at all, generally implies being the child of/to a mother. So the redundancy here is used to broaden the context of the child's curiosity regarding the sleigh of Santa Claus, including the concept of maternity. The full line goes: "And every mother's child is gonna spy, to see if reindeer really know how to fly". One can furthermore argue that the word "mother" is included for the purpose of lyrical flow, adding two syllables, which make the line sound complete, as "every child" would be to short to fit the lyrical/rhyme scheme. )
* "What therefore God hath joined '''together''', let no man put asunder."
* "He raised '''up''' his hands in a gesture of surrender."
* "Where are you '''at'''?"
* "located" or similar before a [[preposition]]: the preposition contains the idea of locatedness and does not need a servant.
* "the actual house itself" for "the house", and similar: unnecessary re-specifiers.
* "Actual fact": fact.
* "On a daily basis": daily.
* "On a --ly basis" or "on a -- basis": --ly.
* "This particular item": this item.
* "Different" or "separate" after numbers: for example:
** "4 different [[species]]" are merely "4 species", as two non-different species are together one same species.
** "9 separate cars": cars are always separate. (However, in "a discount if you buy ten different items", "different" has meaning, because if the ten items include two packets of frozen peas of the same weight and brand, those ten items are not all different.)
*"Despite the fact that": although

An expression like "tuna fish", however, might elicit one of many possible responses, such as:
# It will simply be accepted as '''synonymous''' with "tuna".
# It will be perceived as '''redundant''' (and thus perhaps silly, illogical, ignorant, inefficient, dialectal, odd, and/or intentionally humorous).
# It will imply a '''distinction'''. A reader of "tuna fish" could properly wonder: "Is there a kind of tuna which is not a fish? There is, after all, a dolphin mammal and a [[mahi-mahi|dolphin fish]]." This assumption turns out to be correct, as a "tuna" can also mean a [[opuntia|prickly pear]].&lt;ref name="MW Tuna"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tuna |title=tuna |work=Merriam-Webster.com |date=12 June 2018 |access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, "tuna fish" is sometimes used to refer to the flesh of the animal as opposed to the animal itself (similar to the distinction between ''beef'' and ''cattle'').&lt;ref name="MW Tuna" /&gt;
# It will be perceived as a verbal clarification, since the word "tuna" is quite short, and may, for example, be misheard as "tune" followed by an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], or (in dialects that [[arhotic|drop the final ''-r'' sound]]) as "tuner".

Careful speakers and writers to are aware of pleonasms, especially with cases such as "tuna fish", which is normally used only in some dialects of [[American English]], and would sound strange in other variants of the language, and even odder in translation into other languages.

Similar situations are:
*"Ink pen" instead of merely "pen" in the southern United States, where "pen" and "pin" are pronounced similarly.
*"Extra accessories" which must be ordered separately for a new camera, as distinct from the accessories provided with the camera as sold.

Not all constructions that are typically pleonasms are so in all cases, nor are all constructions derived from pleonasms themselves pleonastic:
* "Put that glass '''over there''' on the table."&lt;br /&gt; This could, depending on room layout, mean "Put that glass on the table across the room, not the table right in front of you"; if the room were laid out like that, most English speakers would intuitively understand that the distant, not immediate table was the one being referred to; however, if there were only one table in the room, the phrase would indeed be pleonastic. Also, it could mean, "Put that glass on that certain spot on the table"; thus, in this case, it is ''not'' pleonastic.
* "I'm going '''way down''' South."&lt;br /&gt; This may imply "I'm going much farther south than you might think if I didn't stress the southerliness of my destination"; but such phrasing is also sometimes—and sometimes jokingly—used pleonastically when simply "south" would do; it depends upon the context, the intent of the speaker/writer, and ultimately even on the expectations of the listener/reader.

===Morphemic pleonasm===
{{original research|section|date=January 2016}}
[[Morpheme]]s, not just words, can enter the realm of pleonasm: Some word-parts are simply optional in various languages and dialects. A familiar example to American English speakers would be the allegedly optional "-al-", probably most commonly seen in "publically" vs. "publicly"—both spellings are considered correct/acceptable in American English, and both pronounced the same, in this dialect, rendering the "publically" spelling pleonastic in US English; in other dialects it is "required", while it is quite conceivable that in another generation or so of American English it will be "forbidden". This treatment of words ending in "-ic", "-ac", etc., is quite inconsistent in US English—compare "maniacally" or "forensically" with "stoicly" or "heroicly"; "forensicly" doesn't look "right" in any dialect, but "heroically" looks internally redundant to many Americans. (Likewise, there are thousands of mostly American Google search results for "eroticly", some in reputable publications, but it does not even appear in the 23-volume, 23,000-page, 500,000-definition ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), the largest in the world; and even American dictionaries give the correct spelling as "erotically".) In a more modern pair of words, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] dictionaries say that "electric" and "electrical" mean exactly the same thing. However, the usual adverb form is "electrically". (For example, "The glass rod is electrically charged by rubbing it with silk".)

Some{{who|date=January 2016}} (mostly US-based) [[prescriptive grammar]] pundits would say that the "-ly" not "-ally" form is "correct" in any case in which there is no "-ical" variant of the basic word, and vice versa; i.e. "maniacally", not "maniacly", is correct because "maniacal" is a word, while "publicly", not "publically", must be correct because "publical" is (arguably) not a real word (it does not appear in the ''OED''). This logic is in doubt, since most if not all "-ical" constructions arguably are "real" words and most have certainly occurred more than once in "reputable" publications, and are also immediately understood by any educated reader of English even if they "look funny" to some, or do not appear in popular dictionaries. Additionally, there are numerous examples of words that have very widely accepted extended forms that have skipped one or more intermediary forms, e.g. "disestablishmentarian" in the absence of "disestablishmentary" (which does not appear in the ''OED''). At any rate, while some US editors might consider "-ally" vs. "-ly" to be pleonastic in some cases, the majority of other English speakers would not, and many "-ally" words are not pleonastic to anyone, even in American English.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
&lt;!-- This paragraph is pretty speculative, full of "some"s and "many"s and "in doubt"s --&gt;

The most common definitely pleonastic morphological usage in English is "[[irregardless]]", which is very widely criticized as being a non-word. The standard usage is "regardless", which is already negative; adding the additional negative ''ir-'' is interpreted by some as logically reversing the meaning to "with regard to/for", which is certainly not what the speaker intended to convey. (According to most dictionaries that include it, "irregardless" appears to derive from confusion between "regardless" and "irrespective", which have overlapping meanings.)

===Morphemic pleonasm in Mandarin Chinese===
There are several instances in Chinese vocabulary where pleonasms and [[cognate object]]s are present. Their presence usually indicate the plural form of the noun or the noun in formal context.
*{{lang|zh|书 – 书籍}} ('book(s)' – in general)
*{{lang|zh|纸 – 纸张}} ('paper, tissue, pieces of paper' – formal)

In some instances, the pleonasmic form of the verb is used with the intention as an emphasis to one meaning of the verb, isolating them from their idiomatic and figurative uses. But over time, the pseudo-object, which sometimes repeats the verb, is almost inherently coupled with the it.

For example, the word {{lang|zh|睡}} ('to sleep') is an intransitive verb, but may express different meaning when coupled with objects of prepositions as in "to sleep with". However, in Mandarin, {{lang|zh|睡}} is usually coupled with a pseudo-character {{lang|zh|觉}}, yet it is not entirely a cognate object, to express the act of resting.

*{{lang|zh|我要睡}} ('I want sleep'). Although such usage of {{lang|zh|睡}} is not found among native speakers of Mandarin and may sound awkward, this expression is grammatically correct and it is clear that {{lang|zh|睡}} means 'to sleep/to rest' in this context.
*{{lang|zh|我要睡觉}} ('I want to sleep') and {{lang|zh|我要睡了}} ('I'm going to sleep'). In this context, {{lang|zh|睡觉}} ('to sleep') is a complete verb and native speakers often express themselves this way. Adding this particle clears any suspicion from using it with any direct object shown in the next example:
*{{lang|zh|我要睡她}} ('I want to have sex with her') and {{lang|zh|我要和她睡}} ('I want to sleep with her'). When the verb follows an animate direct object {{lang|zh|她}} the meaning changes dramatically. The first instance is mainly seen in colloquial speech. Note that the object of preposition of "to have sex with" is the equivalent of the direct object of {{lang|zh|睡}} in Mandarin.

One can also find a way around this verb, using another one which does not is used to express idiomatic expressions nor necessitate a pleonasm, because it only has one meaning:
*{{lang|zh|我要就寝}} ('I want "to dorm{{"'}})
Nevertheless, {{lang|zh|就寝}} is a verb used in high-[[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] diction, just like English verbs with Latin roots.

There is no relationship found between Chinese and English regarding verbs that can take pleonasms and cognate objects. Although the verb ''to sleep'' may take a cognate object as in "sleep a restful sleep", it is a pure coincidence, since verbs of this form are more common in Chinese than in English; and when the English verb is used without the cognate objects, its diction is natural and its meaning is clear in every level of diction, as in "I want to sleep" and "I want to have a rest".

===Subtler redundancies===
In some cases, the redundancy in meaning occurs at a syntactic level above the word, such as at the phrase level:

: "It's [[déjà vu]] all over again."
: "I never make predictions, especially about the future."

The redundancy of these two well-known statements is deliberate, for [[humor]]ous effect. (See [[Yogi_Berra#Yogi-isms]].) But one does hear educated people say "my predictions about the future of politics" for "my predictions about politics", which are equivalent in meaning. While predictions are necessarily about the future (at least in relation to the time the prediction was made), the nature of this future can be subtle (e.g., "I predict that he died a week ago"—the prediction is about future discovery or proof of the date of death, not about the death itself). Generally "the future" is assumed, making most constructions of this sort pleonastic. The latter humorous quote above about not making predictions – by [[Yogi Berra]] – is not really a pleonasm, but rather an [[irony|ironic]] [[play on words]].

But "It's ''déjà vu'' all over again." could mean that there was earlier another ''déjà vu'' of the same event or idea, which has now arisen for a third time.

Redundancy, and "useless" or "nonsensical" words (or phrases, or morphemes) can also be inherited by one language from the influence of another, and are not pleonasms in the more critical sense, but actual changes in grammatical construction considered to be required for "proper" usage in the language or dialect in question. [[Irish English]], for example, is prone to a number of constructions that non-Irish speakers find strange and sometimes directly confusing or silly:

* "I'&lt;b&gt;m after&lt;/b&gt; put'''ting''' it on the table."&lt;br /&gt;('I [have] put it on the table.') This example further shows that the effect, whether pleonastic or only pseudo-pleonastic, can apply to words and word-parts, and multi-word phrases, given that the fullest rendition would be "I '''am after''' put'''ting''' it on the table".
* "Have a look at '''your''' man there."&lt;br /&gt;('Have a look at that man there.') An example of word substitution, rather than addition, that seems illogical outside the dialect. This common possessive-seeming construction often confuses the non-Irish enough that they do not at first understand what is meant. Even "'''Have a '''look at that man''' there'''" is arguably further doubly redundant, in that a shorter "Look at that man" version would convey essentially the same meaning.)
* "She's my wife''' so she is'''."&lt;br /&gt;('She's my wife.') Duplicate subject and verb, post-complement, used to emphasize a simple factual statement or assertion.

All of these constructions originate from the application of [[Irish Gaelic]] grammatical rules to the English dialect spoken, in varying particular forms, throughout the island.

Seemingly "useless" additions and substitutions must be contrasted with similar constructions that are used for stress, humor, or other intentional purposes, such as:

*"I abso'''-fuckin'-'''lutely agree!"&lt;br /&gt;([[tmesis]], for stress)
*"Topless'''-shmopless'''—nudity doesn't distract me."&lt;br /&gt;([[shm-reduplication]], for humor)

The latter of these is a result of Yiddish influences on modern English, especially [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] US English.

Sometimes editors and grammatical stylists will use "pleonasm" to describe simple wordiness. This phenomenon is also called [[prolixity]] or [[logorrhea (rhetoric)|logorrhea]]. Compare:

*"The sound of the [[loud music]] drowned out the sound of the burglary."
*"The loud music drowned out the sound of the burglary."
or even:
*"The music drowned out the burglary."

The reader or hearer does not have to be told that loud music has a sound, and in a newspaper headline or other abbreviated prose can even be counted upon to infer that "burglary" is a proxy for "sound of the burglary" and that the music necessarily must have been loud to drown it out, unless the burglary was relatively quiet (this is not a trivial issue, as it may affect the legal culpability of the person who played the music); the word "loud" may imply that the music should have been played quietly if at all. Many are critical of the excessively abbreviated constructions of "[[headline]]-itis" or "[[News style|newsspeak]]", so "loud [music]" and "sound of the [burglary]" in the above example should probably not be properly regarded as pleonastic or otherwise genuinely redundant, but simply as informative and clarifying.

Prolixity is also used simply to obfuscate, confuse, or euphemize and is not necessarily redundant or pleonastic in such constructions, though it often is. "Post-traumatic stress disorder" ([[shell shock]]) and "pre-owned vehicle" ([[used car]]) are both tumid euphemisms but are not redundant. Redundant forms, however, are especially common in business, political, and even academic language that is intended to sound impressive (or to be vague so as to make it hard to determine what is actually being promised, or otherwise misleading). For example: "This quarter, we are presently focusing with determination on an all-new, innovative integrated methodology and framework for rapid expansion of customer-oriented external programs designed and developed to bring the company's consumer-first paradigm into the marketplace as quickly as possible."

In contrast to redundancy, an [[oxymoron]] results when two seemingly contradictory words are adjoined.

===Other forms===
Redundancies sometimes take the form of foreign words whose meaning is repeated in the context:
*"We went to '''the El Restaurante restaurant'''."
*"'''The'' La Brea ''tar''' pits are fascinating."
*"Roast beef served '''with ''au'' ''jus'' sauce'''."
*"'''Please''' R.'''S.V.P.'''"
*"The Schwarz'''wald''' '''Forest''' is deep and dark."
*"The Drakens'''berg''' '''Mountains''' are in South Africa."
*Libre'''Office''' '''office''' suite.
*'''The ''hoi polloi.''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'''
*I'd like to hav'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''e a '''''chai'' tea'''.

These sentences use phrases which mean, respectively, "the {{Not a typo|the}} restaurant restaurant", "the {{Not a typo|the}} tar tar", "with {{Not a typo|in}} juice sauce" and so on. However, many times these redundancies are necessary—especially when the foreign words make up a proper noun as opposed to a common one. For example, "We went to Il Ristorante" is acceptable provided the audience can infer that it is a restaurant (if they understand Italian and English it might likely, if spoken rather than written, be misinterpreted as a generic reference and not a proper noun, leading the hearer to ask "Which ristorante do you mean?" Such confusions are common in richly bilingual areas like [[Montreal]] or the [[American Southwest]] when people mix phrases from two languages at once). But avoiding the redundancy of the Spanish phrase in the second example would only leave an awkward alternative: "La Brea pits are fascinating".

Most find it best to not even drop articles when using proper nouns made from foreign languages:

*"The movie is playing at '''the El''' Capitan theater."

This is also similar to the treatment of definite and indefinite articles in titles of books, films, etc. where the article can—some would say ''must''—be present where it would otherwise be "forbidden":

* "Stephen King'''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s''' ''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'''The''' Shining'' is scary."&lt;br /&gt;(Normally, the article would be left off following a possessive.)
* "I'm having '''an ''An''&lt;nowiki /&gt;''' ''American Werewolf in London'' movie night at my place."&lt;br /&gt;(Seemingly doubled article, which would be taken for a [[stuttering|stutter]] or typographical error in other contexts.)

Some cross-linguistic redundancies, especially in placenames, occur because a word in one language became the title of a place in another (e.g., the [[Sahara Desert]]—"Sahara" is an English approximation of the word for "deserts" in Arabic). A supposed extreme example is [[Torpenhow Hill]] in [[Cumbria]], if etymologized as meaning "hill" in the language of each of the cultures that have lived in the area during recorded history, could be translated as "Hillhillhill Hill". See the [[List of tautological place names]] for many more examples.

Acronyms can also form the basis for redundancies; this is known humorously as [[RAS syndrome]] (for Redundant Acronym Syndrome Syndrome):

*"I forgot my '''PIN number''' for the '''ATM machine'''." So actually it says: "I forgot my Personal Identification Number number for the Automated Teller Machine machine."
*"I upgraded the '''RAM memory''' of my computer."
*"She is infected with the '''HIV virus'''."
*"I have installed a '''CMS system''' on my server."
*"Next year, I will hike the '''PCT Trail'''."

In all the examples listed above, the word after the acronym repeats a word represented in the acronym—respectively, "Personal Identification Number number", "Automated Teller Machine machine", "Random Access Memory memory", "Human Immunodeficiency Virus virus", "Content Management System system". (See [[RAS syndrome]] for many more examples.) The expansion of an acronym like PIN or HIV may be well known to English speakers, but the acronyms themselves have come to be treated as words, so little thought is given to what their expansion is (and "PIN" is also pronounced the same as the word "pin"; disambiguation is probably the source of "PIN number"; "SIN number" for "Social Insurance Number number" {{sic}} is a similar common phrase in Canada.) But redundant acronyms are more common with technical (e.g. computer) terms where well-informed speakers recognize the redundancy and consider it silly or ignorant, but mainstream users might not, since they may not be aware or certain of the full expansion of an acronym like "RAM".

Some redundancies are simply typographical. For instance, when a short inflexional word like "the" occurs at the end of a line, it is very common to accidentally repeat it at the beginning of the line, and a large number of readers would not even notice it.

Carefully constructed expressions, especially in poetry and political language, but also some general usages in everyday speech, may appear to be redundant but are not. This is most common with cognate objects (a verb's object that is cognate with the verb):
*"She '''slept''' a deep '''sleep'''."

Or, a classic example from Latin:
*''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' = "with change made to what needs to be changed" (an [[ablative absolute]] construction)

The words need not be etymologically related, but simply conceptually, to be considered an example of cognate object:
*"We '''wept''' '''tears''' of joy."

Such constructions are not actually redundant (unlike "She slept a sleep" or "We wept tears") because the object's modifiers provide additional information. A rarer, more constructed form is [[polyptoton]], the stylistic repetition of the same word or words derived from the same root:

* "...[T]he only thing we have to '''fear''' is '''fear''' itself."—[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], "[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres49.html First Inaugural Address]", March 1933.
* "With eager '''feeding'''[,] '''food''' doth choke the '''feeder'''."—[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', II, i, 37.

As with cognate objects, these constructions are not redundant because the repeated words or derivatives cannot be removed without removing meaning or even destroying the sentence, though in most cases they could be replaced with non-related synonyms at the cost of style (e.g., compare "The only thing we have to fear is terror".)

==Semantic pleonasm and context==
In many cases of semantic pleonasm, the status of a word as pleonastic depends on context. The relevant context can be as local as a neighboring word, or as global as the extent of a speaker's knowledge. In fact, many examples of redundant expressions are not inherently redundant, but can be redundant if used one way, and are not redundant if used another way. The "up" in "climb up" is not always redundant, as in the example "He climbed up and then fell down the mountain." Many other examples of pleonasm are redundant only if the speaker's knowledge is taken into account. For example, most English speakers would agree that "tuna fish" is redundant because tuna is a kind of fish. However, given the knowledge that "tuna" can also refer a kind of edible prickly pear,&lt;ref name="MW Tuna" /&gt; the "fish" in "tuna fish" can be seen as non-pleonastic, but rather a disambiguator between the fish and the prickly pear.

Conversely, to English speakers who do not know Spanish, there is nothing redundant about "the La Brea tar pits" because the name "La Brea" is opaque: the speaker does not know that it is Spanish for "the tar". Similarly, even though [[Scuba diving|scuba]] stands for "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus", a phrase like "the scuba gear" would probably not be considered pleonastic because "scuba" has been reanalyzed into English as a simple word, and not an acronym suggesting the pleonastic word sequence "apparatus gear". (Most do not even know that it is an acronym and do not spell it SCUBA or S.C.U.B.A. Similar examples are [[radar]] and [[laser]].)

'''''Pocho''''' (feminine: '''pocha''') is a term used by [[Mexico|Mexican]]s (frequently pejoratively) to describe [[Chicano]]s and those who have [[Emigration from Mexico|left Mexico]]. Stereotypically, pochos speak [[English language|English]] and lack fluency in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Among some [[Mexican Americans]], the term has been embraced to express pride in having both a Mexican and an American heritage&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7hMsnIMQxN8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=pocha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nf47azqZKb&amp;sig=em5nfcUtnkQRDFK4_HAYgKKSjq0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ufWFSqqVKIGulAeu4YGDBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=snippet&amp;q=pocha%20&amp;f=false]''Handbook of Hispanic Cultures in the United States: Anthropology, Volume 4''  By Nicolás Kanellos, Thomas Weaver, Claudio Esteva Fábregat (1994) pg.182&lt;/ref&gt; asserting their place in the diverse American culture. The word derives from the Spanish word, ''pocho'', used to describe fruit that has become rotten or discolored.

==Usage==
Pochos are usually identified by their use of poorly-spoken Spanish. [[Code switching]] and the use of [[loanword]]s is common as is the use of phrases popular in American culture translated to Spanish, sometimes literally.  Code switching often involves inserting English preposition or objective nouns, such as, "''Voy a ir'' shopping ''ahora en el'' supermarket" (I am going shopping now at the supermarket). Modified loanwords are referred to as "pochismos". Examples include ''mopear'' for ''trapear'' (to mop), ''parquear'' for ''estacionar'' (to park), or ''chequear'' for ''mirar'' or ''verificar'' (to check, to inspect or to verify). A clear example of a popular American phrase that has been adopted by people familiar with both cultures would be [[Clint Eastwood]]'s famous quote "Make my day", which has been increasingly used in Spanish as "Hacer mi día."


In general, the word "pocho" can sometimes have these different meanings:
* A Mexican-American who can speak little or no Spanish.
* An American who speaks Spanish and acts "Mexican".
* The Anglicized Spanish spoken by a "Pocho" (known in English as "Spanglish") &lt;ref name="D'Amore2009"&gt;{{cite book|last= D'Amore|first=Anna Maria|title=Translating Contemporary Mexican Texts: Fidelity to Alterity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hLCm7MH7u8C&amp;pg=PA79|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0499-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A person who frequently crosses the US-Mexican border and feels at home on both sides of the border.
* A nickname in Argentina (Pocho or Pocha). For example, the popular president [[Juan Domingo Perón]] was called "El Pocho" as well as the Argentinian football players [[Ezequiel Iván Lavezzi]] and [[Federico Insua]]. 
* A 1959 [[Chicano]] [[novel]] by [[José Antonio Villarreal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1648">A [[book]] '''prospectus''' is a printed description of or [[advertisement]] for that book, usually issued before publication in an attempt to generate interest and advance orders. The word derives from Latin, meaning literally something which gives a view or prospect (in this case of a book). Some prospectuses are lavishly produced, especially for [[private press]] books.

Printed advertisements for and catalogues of books were produced in Europe as early as the 1470s, although very few survive and what we recognize today as prospectuses (containing information on the text, physical nature, price and availability of a forthcoming book) did not develop until the seventeenth century, when they were generally issued for books published by [[subscription]]. Prospectuses are of great interest to the historian and bibliographer because they often give information about a book, its author, publisher, printer or illustrator which is not available elsewhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4042">The  '''Roman Baths''' ({{lang-de|die Römischen Bäder}}), situated northeast of the [[Charlottenhof Palace]] in the [[Sanssouci Park]] in [[Potsdam]], reflect the ''Italiensehnsucht'' ("[[Sehnsucht]]/longing for [[Italy]]") of its creator [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] of [[Prussia]]. Various classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] and antique [[Italian architecture|Italian]] [[design|style]]s were melded into an [[architecture|architectural]] ensemble, created between 1829 and 1840.

[[Image:PotsdamRoemBad.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Gardener's house (center) and the entry to the Roman Baths (far right)]]

While still [[crown prince]], Frederick William commissioned both Charlottenhof (1826-1829) and the Roman Baths (1834-1840). Coming up with numerous ideas and drawing many actual drafts, the artistically inclined [[heir to the throne]] had considerable influence on the plans of the architect, [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].  Charged with managing the actual construction was one of Schinkel's students, [[Ludwig Persius]].

The gardener's house (''Gärtnerhaus'') (1829–30) and the adjacent house for the gardener's helpers (''Gärtnergehilfenhaus'') (1832) were both built in Italian country villa style (''Landhausstil''). The Roman Bath, which gave its name to the ensemble in its entirety, was styled after ancient [[villa]]s.  Together with a small tea [[pavilion]] (''Teepavillon'') (1830), modelled on temples of [[classical antiquity]], they form a complex of buildings tied together by [[pergola]]s, [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s and garden spaces.  The individual buildings were largely inspired by Schinkel's second trip to Italy in 1828.
Thus the Roman Bath, which has never actually been used as a bathing facility, came into being thanks purely to the romantic fantasy of the royal [[Italophilia|Italophile]].
[[Image:Potsdam Roemische.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Atrium of the Roman Baths with a decorative tub of green [[jasper]] (a gift of [[Czar Nicholas I]])]]

The names of the rooms connote a mixture of antique villas and Roman [[thermal bath|baths]]. The [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], the courtyard of a Roman house, is the reception area.  The [[Impluvium]], actually only a glorified rainwater-collection device, gives its name to the whole room in which it is located. The [[Viridarium]] ([[greenhouse]]) is actually a small garden.
Additional names associated with Roman thermal baths are [[Apodyterium]] for the changing room and [[Caldarium]].

The whole nostalgic creation is on the bank of an artificial lake created during [[Peter Joseph Lenné]]'s landscaping of the Charlottenhof grounds. The so-called machine pond (''Maschinenteich'') gets its name from a steam engine building and an adjacent pumping station torn down in 1923.  The large hull of a well marks the location of the former building.  The steam engine was not just responsible for keeping the artificial waters of Charlottenhof moving – its smokestacks were also a symbol of progress and what was at its time advanced technology.

'''''Sensibility Objectified: The Sculptures of Sarbari Roy Choudhury''''' is a book by [[R. Siva Kumar]] that discusses the life and sculptures of [[Sarbari Roy Choudhury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sensibility-Objectified-Scluptures-Sarbari-Choudhury/dp/1890206032|title=Sensibility Objectified: The Scupltures of Sarbari Roy Choudhury|first=Siva R.|last=Kumar|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Mapin Publishing Gp Pty Ltd|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[R. Siva kumar]] the 'sculptural sensibility' of [[Sarbari Roy Choudhury]], represented in his figurative and animated works, reveals the artist’s connection with the Indian traditions of sculpture, despite being strongly influenced by the West.

Some of Roy's best works are of classical musicians—[[Bade Ghulam Ali Khan]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Siddheshwari Devi]] and [[Kesarbai Kerkar]]. Starting from the 1950s, the monograph traces his work of each decade, revealing the artistic journey of one of India’s leading sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinpub.in/bookinfo.php?id=189#visit|title=Sensibility Objectified|website=mapinpub.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shadow Star''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Narutaru'''''|なるたる|lead=yes}}, is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series created by [[Mohiro Kitoh]], originally serialized in [[Kodansha]]'s [[seinen]] magazine ''[[Afternoon (magazine)|Afternoon]]''.  The Japanese name is an abbreviation of {{Nihongo|''Mukuro Naru Hoshi, Tama Taru Ko''|骸なる星 珠たる子}}, which roughly translates to ''Corpse of a Star; A Precious Child''. In the [[United States]], it was licensed by [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] and serialized in ''[[Super Manga Blast!]]''.

The 13-episode anime adaptation by Planet was broadcast in 2003 on the Japanese television station [[Kids Station]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The anime was licensed by [[Central Park Media]] and released as ''Shadow Star Narutaru'', and has played on Comcast's Anime Selects multiple times.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 2007 it ran on the Illusion on Demand television network.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Central Park Media released the title under their "U.S. Manga Corps" line, on 4 DVDs, and later re-released the DVDs in a box set.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Central Park Media filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and the DVDs have since been out of print.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Plot==
The protagonist of the series is a twelve-year-old girl named Shiina Tamai. She bonds with a starfish-shaped "dragonchild" (baby "shadow dragon") whom she calls Hoshimaru. The series is mainly about the interaction between Shiina and other young people who have also bonded with dragons.

The manga, especially the original Japanese version, is known for the gruesome material that appears as the plot progresses. Despite the young main characters, cute monster designs, and the initial appearance of a ''[[Pokémon]]''-esque series, the story quickly takes on a much darker and more disturbing tone, with later volumes involving some graphic depictions of gore and sexual violence. The English- and German-language versions of the manga have some edited scenes; entire pages of content were removed from the seventh volume of the English-language release.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Volumes===
{{main|List of Shadow Star chapters}}
There are twelve volumes total in the Japanese release, and seven in the English-language one. As a result of Dark Horse's rearrangement of the series' chapters, those seven volumes actually cover volumes 1 to 6 of the original Japanese release. Further chapters were serialized in ''[[Super Manga Blast!]]'', and starting with the magazine's 54th issue, the series was translated in its original right-to-left reading format; this lasted until ''Super Manga Blast!'' was cancelled five issues later. These chapters have not been collected into volumes yet, nor has Dark Horse announced any plans to further translate ''Shadow Star''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Anime==

The anime adaptation consisted of 13 episodes, each running for 24 minutes, and adapted the storyline of the first 6 volumes (7 volumes of the American release) of the manga.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Reception===
Tasha Robinson of the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] described the anime series as "transformed" from "fascinatingly quirky" to "slow but expressive."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Tasha.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2109">The '''Stollhof Hoard'''  was found in 1864 in the municipality of [[Hohe Wand]] in [[Lower Austria]] by a shepherd at the height 700–800 m above the village of Stollhof. The  [[hoard]] dates from the 4th Millennium BC in the [[Copper Age]].  The discs are the earliest gold objects to be found in Austria. 
The hoard consists of:

* 9 spiral rolls with lengths between about 5.6 and 24 cmx [[File:Stollhof Hoard 01.JPG|thumb|Chalcolithic hoard of copper and gold objects, c4000Bc from Stollhof in Lower Austria in the Naturhistorische Museum, Vienna]]
* 6 double spiral pendants made of round wire . Two of them wrapped tightly with a small element loop and four loosely wound with large centre loop. The outer diameters of the coils are from 10.1 to 12.3&amp;nbsp;cm.
* 2 flat axes length of about 14&amp;nbsp;cm and 16.5&amp;nbsp;cm
* 2 spiral bracelets (9.5&amp;nbsp;cm and 10&amp;nbsp;cm whorls ) section 5.0 and 5.5&amp;nbsp;cm, length 7.0 and 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm
* 2 gold discs diameter 10.6 and 13.8&amp;nbsp;cm, weight 71 and 121 gr
* 1 eberzahnförmiges Zierblech length 15.2&amp;nbsp;cm. [[File:Stollhof Hoard 02.JPG|thumb|Gold discs, c4000Bc from Stollhof in Lower Austria in the Naturhistorische Museum, Vienna]]

The gold discs are decorated with [[repousse]] ornament and were attached to clothing by a thread through the small holes.. To the discs have parallels from  [[Brześć Kujawski]] and [[Jordansmühl]] in Poland (where they occur with other finds) and at [[Zalaszentgrót]] ( Csáford, Hungary)

One of the axes belongs to P. Patay’s Szakálhát type, which is typical of the [[Bodrogkeresztur]] culture.

Some of the finds from the hoard never reached Naturhistorische Museum in Vienna, where the hoard is on display.

{{nihongo|'''Syaoran'''|小狼|Shaoran}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and [[protagonist]] in ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]. Syaoran is introduced as a young archaeologist who is in love with [[Sakura (Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle)|Sakura]], his childhood friend and the princess from the Kingdom of Clow. When Sakura's memories are scattered throughout [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel dimensions]], Syaoran goes on a quest to recover them, at the cost of Sakura never remembering him. Later in the series, Syaoran is revealed to be a clone created by [[List of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle characters#Fei-Wang Reed|Fei-Wang Reed]]{{mdash}}the sorcerer who caused Sakura to lose her memories. As a seal from [[List of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle characters#Tsubasa (Syaoran)|his original self]] placed on the clone's body breaks, Syaoran becomes one of the series' [[antagonist]]s, moving according to Fei-Wang's will. Syaoran has featured in other works by Clamp, including the manga ''[[xxxHolic]]'' and the [[drama CD]] series ''Holistuba''.

Syaoran's character is based on [[Syaoran Li]], a character from Clamp's ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura]]'' manga and had several changes to appeal to the series' demographic. The character has been well received by readers of the series, placing high in popularity polls from ''Tsubasa'' and manga and anime series in general. He also received positive comments by manga and anime publications. Syaoran's role as an antagonist has also received positive comments; some writers use nicknames to differentiate his antagonistic self from his original self, often calling him evil.

Syaoran is a clone of [[List of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle characters#Tsubasa (Syaoran)|another teenager]]; the sorcerer Fei-Wang Reed created the clone to find Sakura's feathers.

==Creation and conception==
Clamp designed Syaoran using the ideas of manga author [[Osamu Tezuka]] and his [[Osamu Tezuka's Star System|Star System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fujie |first=Kazuhisa |authorlink=Kazuhisa Fujie |author2=[[LABAAMEN]]  |title=Tsubasa Chronicle Factbook: Mystery, Magic &amp; Mischief |publisher=[[DH Publishing]] |year=2008 |page=10 |isbn=978-1-932897-26-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syaoran was based on [[Syaoran Li]], a character from ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura]]''{{mdash}}another series written by Clamp. Syaoran and Sakura were chosen to be the series' protagonist because their ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' counterparts had a happy ending, but Clamp said that the characters would have to go throughout the series to get their own happy ending.&lt;ref name="animexpointer"/&gt; At the start of the manga, Syaoran's character was already planned to go through development. The characters [[Fai D.

In the original design, Syaoran wore a cap, a different outfit and an enormous [[adjustable spanner]].&lt;ref name="Character guide"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clamp |authorlink=Clamp (manga artists) |others=translated and adapted by William Flanagan |title=Tsubasa CHARACTer GuiDE |publisher=[[Del Rey Manga]] |year=2005 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |page=205|isbn=978-4-06-372001-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clamp said Syaoran became popular with male readers as a hero.&lt;ref name="kiseki12"/&gt; After events of the Oto country where Syaoran participated in several battles fighting for the king Ashura and was at disadvantage, Clamp's editor for ''Tsubasa'', Kiichiro Sugawara, wrote that he wondered whether "anything good ever happen[s] to Syaoran"; Clamp said that their publishing company, [[Kodansha]] had received demands from readers for Syaoran to become stronger, and advised Clamp to let him have occasional good experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clamp |authorlink=Clamp (manga artists) |others=Translated and adapted by [[Tokyopop]] |title=CLAMP no Kiseki Vol. 11 |publisher=Tokyopop |year=2005 |location=[[Los Angeles]] |page=5 |isbn=978-1-59532-615-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make his fight scenes more entertaining, Clamp thought about giving Syaoran named sword techniques like those of Kurogane but in the end this was not added to the series.&lt;ref name="kiseki12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clamp |authorlink=Clamp (manga artists) |others=Translated and adapted by [[Tokyopop]] |title=CLAMP no Kiseki Vol. 12 |publisher=Tokyopop |year=2005 |location=[[Los Angeles]] |pages=5–7 |isbn=978-1-59532-616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clamp originally planned Subaru to be Syaoran's teacher. However, the group later decided to replace Subaru with Seishiro. During the second half of the manga when it was revealed Syaoran was a clone from another character who became the protagonist. Clamp aimed to make both of them equally different based on their actions despite being virtually identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clamp |authorlink=Clamp (manga artists) |title=公式ガイドブック ツバサ CARACTere CHRoNiCLE |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |year=2016|isbn=978-4063931280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the animated adaptations of ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle'', Syaoran is voiced by [[Miyu Irino]] in Japanese, and by [[Jason Liebrecht]] in English.&lt;ref name="staff"&gt;{{cite web|title=STAFF &amp; CAST |url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/21_/s03_/index.html |publisher=Production I.G |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uQvUaJHL?url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/21_/s03_/index.html |archivedate=November 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mainengcast"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tsubasa English Cast Announced|publisher=Anime News Network|date=February 25, 2007 |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-25/tsubasa-english-cast-announced|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irino said that ever since the introduction of the original Syaoran{{mdash}}who he also voiced{{mdash}}he sometimes had problems voicing both characters. Fellow voice actress [[Yui Makino]] also discussed Irino's role, saying that he was the most difficult character to cast because of the requirement to portray the two Syaorans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=舞台は日本国！ 「ツバサ」アニメ企画に向け監督＆キャスト陣にインタビュー|trans-title=The stage is Japan!

==Reception==
Syaoran was well received by Japanese readers of ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle''. In two popularity polls held by ''[[Weekly Shōnen Magazine]]'', Syaoran was the most-liked character. He was also highly rated in other polls, which included best groups and best scenes from the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clamp |authorlink=Clamp (manga artists) |others=translated and adapted by William Flanagan|title=Tsubasa CHARACTer GuiDE |publisher=[[Del Rey Manga]] |year=2005 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |pages=148–152 |isbn=978-4-06-372001-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clamp |authorlink=Clamp (manga artists) |others=translated and adapted by William Flanagan|title=Tsubasa CHARACTer GuiDE 2|publisher=[[Del Rey Manga]] |year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |pages=144–148 |isbn=978-4-06-372216-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, Syaoran was ranked twenty-third best male anime character of the 2000s by the Japanese magazine ''[[Newtype]]''.&lt;ref name="newtype"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Newtype]] | publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]] | title=Newtype's Top 30 Male and Female Characters of Each Decade | date=March 2010 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Animage]]''{{'}}s [[Anime Grand Prix]] poll from 2006, he was voted as the twelfth most popular male anime character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:第28回アニメグランプリ　［2006年6月号］（現在位置） |trans-title=28th Anime Grand Prix June 2006 issue (current position) |url=http://animage.jp/gp_new/gpx_2006.html |publisher=Animage |language=Japanese |accessdate=January 26, 2011 |date=June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RYonFvqr?url=http://animage.jp/gp_new/gpx_2006.html |archivedate=August  3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he remained the fourteenth most popular male character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Animage]] | publisher=[[Gakken]] | title=Anime Grand Prix 2006–2007| date=May 2007 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Animedia'' "2006 Animedia Character Awards", Syaoran was nominated in categories including "Strongest Character Award", "Best Newcomer Award", "Most Heroic Character Award" and "MVP (Most Valuable Player) Award"; his highest rating was in the "Best Newcomer Award", where he was ranked third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Animedia | publisher=[[Gakken]] | title=2006 Animedia Character Awards| date=February 2010 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of merchandising have been made based on Syaoran's appearance including plush, keychains and patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsubasa: Syaoran Plush|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]  |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TVUFXM/|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsubasa Syaoran PVC Key Chain|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]  |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P8J8NW/|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Animation Tsubasa Syaoran GE|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]  |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZT3L72/|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 [[Seiyu Awards]], [[Miyu Irino]] was a nominee in the category "Best New Actor" for his portrayal as Syaoran, but lost to [[Tetsuya Kakihara]] and [[Masakazu Morita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:アキバ総研（秋葉原総合研究所）担当者コラム番外編　声優版アカデミー賞「第1回声優アワード」|url=http://akiba.kakaku.com/hobby/0703/04/044038.php|publisher=Akiba Kakabu |accessdate=April 4, 2011|language=Japanese |date=March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Results of Japan's First Ever Seiyuu Awards Announced|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-03-05/results-of-japan's-first-ever-seiyuu-awards-announced|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |date=March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on Syaoran's character and role in the series. He received mainly positive responses. Ed Sizemore from Comics Worth Reading called him as "the perfect young hero" because of his seriousness, with points given for his care for Sakura.&lt;ref name="CWR Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sizemore |first=Ed |authorlink=Ed Sizemore |title=Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles Books 1-20 and Character Guide |publisher=Comics Worth Reading |date=March 17, 2009 |url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2009/03/17/tsubasa-reservoir-chronicles-books-1-20-and-character-guide/ |accessdate=April 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328064438/http://comicsworthreading.com/2009/03/17/tsubasa-reservoir-chronicles-books-1-20-and-character-guide/ |archivedate=March 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Carl Kimlinger found differences between Syaoran and his ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' counterpart, he found the traits of the former appealing.&lt;ref name="dvdfour"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kimlinger |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Kimlinger |title=Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE DVD 4+5 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=January 18, 2008 |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/tsubasa-reservoir-chronicle/dvd-4 |accessdate=April 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Aronson from Manga Life found that while the characters behaves differently from Syaoran Li and act considerably older, it helps readers who have not read previous Clamp series understand the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Aronson |first=Michael |title=Tsubasa v1 |publisher=Manga Life |url=http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/Tsubasav1.htm |accessdate=January 27, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140624/http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/Tsubasav1.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese singer [[Maaya Sakamoto]] said that in the animated adaptation of ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle'', Syaoran's straightforward feelings and strength to protect Sakura were very touching. Therefore, in the song "Kazemachi Jet"{{mdash}}the closing theme of the second season of the anime{{mdash}}she tried to capture the image of Syaoran growing from his naïve self into a young man through the meetings and partings over his journey and Syaoran's continuing protection of his loved one in spite of adversity.&lt;ref name="Kazemachi Jet Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Sakamoto Maaya outlook on Tsubasa Chronicle's world in "Kazemachi Jet / Spica" |publisher=[[Oricon]] |language=Japanese |url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/anime/topics/060607/060607_02.html |accessdate=May 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031062719/http://www.oricon.co.jp/anime/topics/060607/060607_02.html |archivedate=October 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
When writing "Saigo no Kajitsu", Sakamoto described Syaoran's fate as sad because he becomes the antagonist of his friends and is a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=bear |title=Maaya Sakamoto Saigo no Kajitsu long interview in PALIKA |publisher=YKFan |date=2007-11-26 |url=http://bbs.ykfan.cn/viewthread.php?action=printable&amp;tid=3861 |language=Japanese |accessdate=2009-05-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w2NvKgmy?url=http://bbs.ykfan.cn/viewthread.php?action=printable&amp;tid=3861 |archivedate=January 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Kinya Kotani]] also described sadness in Syaoran's strength, and said he had both forwarding-facing and backward-facing characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Periodical: Artist Interview "Anime Song Correspondence Vol.9" Kinya |publisher=[[Frontier Works]] |language=Japanese |url=http://www.animate.tv/column/singer/060601.php |accessdate=2009-05-15 |archivedate=April  1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401030928/http://www.animate.tv/column/singer/060601.php |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot twist in which Syaoran is revealed to be a clone and his fight against his original self has been regarded as "a titanic clash" by Chris Zimmerman from Comic Book Bin.&lt;ref name="comicbookbin"/&gt; Following this, Syaoran was called "evil Syaoran" and "Syaoran's evil clone".&lt;ref name="comicbookbin"&gt;{{cite web |last=Zimmerman |first=Chris |title=Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE OVA Collection Blu-ray |publisher=Comic Book Bin |date=January 16, 2011|url=http://www.comicbookbin.com/Tsubasa_Reservoir_Chronicle462.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Douglass Jr. |first=Todd |title=Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE - OVA Collection|publisher=DVDTalk |date=January 4, 2011|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/46754/tsubasa-reservoir-chronicle-ova-collection/|accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twist has been a "potential real upset" because Syaoran is revealed to have been created by the series' main antagonist, Fei-Wang Reed.&lt;ref name="maniaova"&gt;{{cite web|last=Beveridge|first=Chris|title=Tsubasa, RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE OVA Collection|publisher=Mania Entertainment|date=January 3, 2011|url=http://www.mania.com/tsubasa-reservoir-chronicle-ova-collection_article_125817.html|accessdate=January 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69z8DKGAd?url=http://www.mania.com/tsubasa-reservoir-chronicle-ova-collection_article_125817.html|archivedate=August 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between both Syaorans has also been found confusing for some readers to understand;&lt;ref name="ANN Manga Vol.16 Review"&gt;{{cite web |last=Santos |first=Carlo |authorlink=Carlo Santos |title=Tsubasa, RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE GN 16 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=March 8, 2008 |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/tsubasa-reservoir-chronicle/gn-16 |accessdate=April 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; others said that while there was confusion in this scene, the events led to a well-executed ending. They also highlighted the bond both have through their eyes.&lt;ref name="maniaova"/&gt; Sakura Eries from Mania Entertainment said Syaoran's actions after the twist were disturbing because of his violent acts.

'''Thomas Taylor''' (26 February 1858 – 5 July 1938) was an English priest, historian and scholar of [[Celt]]ic culture.

==Life and career==
Taylor was born in [[Thurvaston]], [[Derbyshire]], [[England]]. He attended [[King's School, Macclesfield|King Edward VI School]], [[Macclesfield]] becoming [[head boy]] in 1874. He matriculated at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]] in 1877, and graduated in the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematics Tripos]] in 1881, receiving his [[Masters degree|MA]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=TLR877T|name=Taylor, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor took Holy Orders on going down from Cambridge, being ordained [[Deacon]] at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in 1881 and was made Priest there in 1883.

After a few years (1883 – c. 1896) in Queensland, [[Australia]], he settled with his wife and family in [[Cornwall]]. He served as Vicar first at [[All Saints' Church, Falmouth]], from 1890 and then at [[Redruth]] from 1892. In 1897 he accepted the rural living of [[St Breward]].

Taylor was an honorary [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of [[Truro Cathedral]] from 1917 to 1938. In 1919 he went to serve at [[Gunwalloe]]. He was elected Proctor and held this office from 1919 to 1935. He also served as Rural Dean of Penwith from 1924 to 1927.  He became known as "the poor man’s lawyer" as a result of his freely given assistance in matters of compensation for injuries sustained in tin mining.

Canon Taylor was made a [[bard]] at the inaugural [[Gorseth Kernow]] held at [[Boscawen-Un]], [[St Buryan]] on 21 September 1928. He took the [[bardic name]] ‘'Gwas Ust'’ (‘Servant of St. Just’).

When he died in 1938, he was Vicar of St. Just. He listed his recreations as pedigree making and fly fishing.

==Scholarly work==
During his time at St Breward he found the parish registers to be complete from 1599 to 1812: his work editing the registers brought him into contact with [[W. P. Phillimore]], a publisher of books relating to [[Ecclesiastical]] Law, who in 1905 appointed him editor of the [[Parish]] Marriage Registers throughout the diocese: by 1916 he had published twenty-five volumes. It is for this work, much used by genealogists and family historians, that he is probably most widely known.

He contributed to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] and the [[Victoria County History]] of Cornwall, of which he was local editor. His standard works ''Celtic Christianity'' and ''Life of [[St Samson of Dol]]'' are still sources of reference.

{{Rights}}

'''Women's rights''' are the [[rights]] and [[entitlement]]s claimed for [[women]] and [[girl]]s worldwide, and formed the basis for the women's rights movement in the nineteenth century and [[feminist movement]] during the 20th century. In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others they are ignored and suppressed. They differ from broader notions of [[human rights]] through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor of men and boys.&lt;ref name="Hosken"&gt;Hosken, Fran P., 'Towards a Definition of Women's Rights' in ''Human Rights Quarterly'', Vol. 3, No. 2. (May 1981), pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include the right: to bodily integrity and [[autonomy]]; to be free from [[sexual violence]]; to [[women's suffrage|vote]]; to hold public office; to enter into legal contracts; to have equal rights in [[family law]]; [[right to work|to work]]; to fair wages or [[equal pay for equal work|equal pay]]; to have [[reproductive rights]]; to [[right to property|own property]]; [[Right to education|to education]].&lt;ref name=quarterly&gt;Lockwood, Bert B.

In ancient Egypt women enjoyed the same rights under the law as a men, however rightful entitlements depended upon [[social class]]. Landed property descended in the female line from mother to daughter, and women were entitled to administer their own property. Women in ancient Egypt could buy, sell, be a partner in [[legal contract]]s, be executor in wills and witness to legal documents, bring court action, and adopt children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joshua J.

Although most women lacked political and equal rights in the [[city states]] of ancient Greece, they enjoyed a certain freedom of movement until the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic age]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women of Ancient Greece|last = Nardo|first = Don|publisher = Lucent Books|year = 2000|location = San Diego|page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records also exist of women in ancient [[Delphi]], [[Gortyn]], [[Thessaly]], [[Megara]] and [[Sparta]] owning land, the most prestigious form of [[private property]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women's equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| page = 33| url = https://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&amp;dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the Archaic age, legislators began to enact laws enforcing gender segregation, resulting in decreased rights for women.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

[[Women in Classical Athens]] had no legal personhood and were assumed to be part of the ''[[oikos]]'' headed by the male ''[[Kurios|kyrios]]''. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative. Once married, the husband became a woman's ''kyrios''. As women were barred from conducting legal proceedings, the ''kyrios'' would do so on their behalf.&lt;ref name="google114"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 114| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20athens&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athenian women could only acquire rights over [[property]] through gifts, dowry and inheritance, though her ''kyrios'' had the right to dispose of a woman's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 115| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20athens&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athenian women could only enter into a contract worth less than the value of a "''[[medimno]]s'' of barley" (a measure of grain), allowing women to engage in petty trading.&lt;ref name="google114"/&gt; Women were excluded from ancient [[Athenian democracy]], both in principle and in practice.

This separation would entail living in a room called a ''[[gynaeceum|gynaikeion]]'', while looking after the duties in the home and having very little exposure with the male world. This was also to ensure that wives only had legitimate children from their husbands. Athenian women received little education, except home tutorship for basic skills such as spin, weave, cook and some knowledge of money.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although [[Spartan]] women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. Following protracted warfare in the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC Spartan women owned approximately between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property.&lt;ref name="Pomeroy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tierney| first = Helen| title = Women's studies encyclopaedia, Volume 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 1999| pages = 609–10| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&amp;dq=spartan+women| isbn = 978-0-313-31072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Sarah B.

[[Plato]] acknowledged that extending [[civil and political rights]] to women would substantively alter the nature of the household and the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Robinson| first = Eric W.| title = Ancient Greek democracy: readings and sources| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| year = 2004| page = 300| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Jug6crxEImIC&amp;dq=Aristophanes+ecclesiazusae+women%27s+rights| isbn = 978-0-631-23394-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], who had been taught by Plato, denied that women were slaves or subject to property, arguing that "nature has distinguished between the female and the slave", but he considered wives to be "bought". He argued that women's main economic activity is that of safeguarding the household property created by men. According to Aristotle the labour of women added no value because "the art of household management is not identical with the art of getting wealth, for the one uses the material which the other provides".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women's equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| pages = 32–35| url = https://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&amp;dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to these views, the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophers]] argued for equality of the sexes, sexual inequality being in their view contrary to the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="Colish"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages: Stoicism in classical Latin literature |last=Colish |first=Marcia L. |year=1990 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-09327-0 |pages=37–38  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WY-2MeZqoK0C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=stoics%2Bslavery#v=onepage&amp;q=stoics%2Bslavery&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, they followed the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and receive the same kind of education. They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity, and practiced these views in their lives as well as their teachings. The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature, thus putting their sexual egalitarianism on a strong philosophical basis.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt;

McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Freeborn women of [[ancient Rome]] were [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] who enjoyed legal privileges and protections that did not extend to [[peregrinus (Roman)|non-citizens]] or [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]]. [[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman society]], however, was [[patriarchal]], and women could not vote, hold [[Roman magistrate|public office]], or serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.N. Sherwin-White]], ''Roman Citizenship'' (Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 211 and 268; Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the upper classes exercised political influence through marriage and motherhood. During the [[Roman Republic]], the [[Cornelia Africana|mother of the Gracchus brothers]] and [[Aurelia Cotta|of Julius Caesar]] were noted as exemplary women who advanced the career of their sons. During the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], women of the emperor's family could acquire considerable political power, and were regularly depicted in official art and on coinage.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Eck, "The Emperor and His Advisors", ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (Cambridge University History, 2000), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central core of the Roman society was the ''[[pater familias]]'' or the male head of the household who exercised his authority over all his children, servants, and wife.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.&lt;ref name="David Johnston 1999 p. 134"&gt;David Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), chapter 3.3; Frier and McGinn, '' A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', Chapter IV; Yan Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law", in ''A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'' (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Athenian women, Roman women had a guardian or as it was called "tutor" who managed and oversaw all her activity.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; This tutelage had limited female activity but by first century to sixth century BCE, tutelage became very relaxed and women were accepted to participate in more public roles such as owning or managing property and or acting as municipal patrons for gladiator games and other entertainment activities&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Childbearing was encouraged by the state. By 27–14 BCE the ''[[ius trium liberorum]]'' ("legal right of three children") granted symbolic honors and legal privileges to a woman who had given birth to three children, and freed her from any male guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;Yan Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law", in ''A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'' (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest period of the [[Roman Republic]], a bride passed from her father's control into the "hand" ''(manus)'' of her husband. She then became subject to her husband's ''potestas'', though to a lesser degree than their children.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This archaic form of ''manus'' marriage was largely abandoned by the time of [[Julius Caesar]], when a woman remained under her father's authority by law even when she moved into her husband's home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Pandora's Daughters: The Role and Status of Women in Greek and Roman Antiquity'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), pp. 140–41; J.P. Sullivan, "Martial's Sexual Attitudes", ''Philologus'' 123 (1979), p. 296, specifically on sexual freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; Although women had to answer to their father in legal matters, they were free of his direct scrutiny in her daily life,&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family", in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and her husband had no legal power over her.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19–20, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; When her father died, she became legally emancipated ''([[sui iuris]])''. A married woman retained ownership of any [[property]] she brought into the marriage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.&lt;ref name="David Johnston 1999 p. 134"/&gt; Under classical [[Roman law]], a husband had no right to abuse his wife physically or compel her to have sex.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Wife beating was sufficient grounds for divorce or other legal action against the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, "Violence in Roman Social Relations", in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their legal status as citizens and the degree to which they could become emancipated, women in ancient Rome could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law,'' p. 461; W.V. Harris, "Trade", in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 733.&lt;/ref&gt; Some acquired and disposed of sizable fortunes, and are recorded in inscriptions as benefactors in funding major public works.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret L. Woodhull, "Matronly Patrons in the Early Roman Empire: The Case of Salvia Postuma", in ''Women's Influence on Classical Civilization'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman women could appear in court and argue cases, though it was customary for them to be represented by a man.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; They were simultaneously disparaged as too ignorant and weak-minded to practice law, and as too active and influential in legal matters—resulting in an edict that limited women to conducting cases on their own behalf instead of others'.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', pp. 50–51; Juvenal, ''Satire'' 6, on women busy in the courts.&lt;/ref&gt; But even after this restriction was put in place, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters, including dictating legal strategy to their male advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman law recognized [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rape|rape]] as a crime in which the victim bore no guilt&lt;ref&gt;Ariadne Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998), pp. 81–82; Jane F. Gardner, ''Women in Roman Law and Society'' (Indiana University Press, 1991), pp. 118ff.

The rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to her owner's property.&lt;ref&gt;Under the ''[[Lex Aquilia]];'' Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 314; Gardner, ''Women in Roman Law and Society'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze young girl reading CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Bronze statuette of a young woman reading (latter 1st century)]]
The first [[Roman emperor]], [[Augustus]], framed his ascent to sole power as a return to [[mos maiorum|traditional morality]], and attempted to regulate the conduct of women through [[Leges Iuliae|moral legislation]]. [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery|Adultery]], which had been a private family matter under the Republic, was criminalized,&lt;ref&gt;Beth Severy, ''Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Empire'' (Routledge, 2002; Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and defined broadly as an illicit sex act ''([[stuprum]])'' that occurred between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband.

[[Stoicism|Stoic philosophies]] influenced the development of Roman law. Stoics of the Imperial era such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Musonius Rufus]] developed theories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Stoic sexual morality|just relationships]]. While not advocating equality in society or under the law, they held that nature gives men and women equal capacity for virtue and equal obligations to act virtuously, and that therefore men and women had an equal need for philosophical education.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; These philosophical trends among the ruling elite are thought to have helped improve the status of women under the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ratnapala| first = Suri| title = Jurisprudence| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2009| pages =134–35 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=tNwdWlXxZt8C&amp;dq=Stoic+law+women| isbn = 978-0-521-61483-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome had no system of state-supported schooling, and education was available only to those who could pay for it.

====Byzantine Empire====
Since Byzantine law was essentially based on Roman law, the legal status of women did not change significantly from the practices of the 6th century. But the traditional restriction of women in the public life as well as the hostility against independent women still continued.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = 440–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater influence of Greek culture contributed to strict attitudes about women'roles being domestic instead of being public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There was also a growing trend of women who were not prostitutes, slaves or entertainers to be entirely veiled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like previous Roman law, women could not be legal witnesses, hold administrations or run banking but they could still inherit properties and own land.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As a rule the influence of the church was exercised in favor of the abolition of the disabilities imposed by the older law upon celibacy and childlessness, of increased facilities for entering a professed religious life, and of due provision for the wife. The church also supported the political power of those who were friendly toward the clergy. The appointment of mothers and grandmothers as tutors was sanctioned by Justinian.

The restrictions on the marriage of senators and other men of high rank with women of low rank were extended by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], but it was almost entirely removed by [[Justinian I|Justinian]]. Second marriages were discouraged, especially by making it legal to impose a condition that a widow's right to property should cease on remarriage, and the [[Leonine Constitutions]] at the end of the 9th century made third marriages punishable. The same constitutions made the benediction of a priest a necessary part of the ceremony of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica Volume 28|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=1911|isbn=|editor-last=Chisholm|editor-first=Hugh|location=|pages=783|chapter=Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
[[File:Bound_feet_(X-ray).jpg|thumb|right|[[Foot binding]], a practice commonly inflicted on [[Women in China|Chinese women]] between the 10th century and the early 20th century. The image shows an X-ray of two bound feet.]]
{{Main|Women in ancient and imperial China|Women in China}}
Women throughout historical and ancient China were considered inferior and had subordinate legal status based on the [[Confucianism|Confucian law]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = 426–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Imperial China, the "[[Three Obediences and Four Virtues|Three Obediences]]" promoted daughters to obey their fathers, wives to obey their husbands, and widows to obey their sons. Women could not inherit businesses or wealth&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and men had to adopt a son for such financial purposes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Late imperial law also featured seven different types of divorces. A wife could be ousted if she failed to birth a son, committed adultery, disobeyed her parents-in-law, spoke excessively, stole, was given to bouts of jealousy, or suffered from an incurable or loathsome disease or disorder.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; But there were also limits for the husband – for example, he could not divorce if she observed her parent's in-law's mourning sites, if she had no family to return to, or if the husband's family used to be poor and since then had become richer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The status of women in China was also low largely due to the custom of [[foot binding]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} About 45% of Chinese women had bound feet in the 19th century. For the upper classes, it was almost 100%. In 1912, the Chinese government ordered the cessation of foot-binding. Foot-binding involved alteration of the bone structure so that the feet were only about 4 inches long. The bound feet caused difficulty of movement, thus greatly limiting the activities of women.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near each other, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors of Western Medicine. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors of Western Medicine in China. Thus, female medical missionary Dr. Mary H. Fulton (1854–1927)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Inasmuch.html?id=04TOSAAACAAJ |title=Inasmuch |author=Mary H.

Hackett (1851–1916) of Indiana, USA. The College was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status.&lt;ref name="RebeccaChan"&gt;Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, "Piloted to Serve", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web|author=Piloted to Serve97 personen vinden dit leuk |url=https://www.facebook.com/PilotedToServe |title=Piloted to Serve |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Republic of China (1912–49)]] and earlier Chinese governments, women were legally bought and sold into slavery under the guise of domestic servants. These women were known as [[Mui Tsai]]. The lives of Mui Tsai were recorded by American feminist [[Agnes Smedley]] in her book Portraits of Chinese Women in Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Parts of this book are available online here [https://books.google.com/books?id=zKReN05ujW4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Portraits+of+Chinese+Women+in+Revolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI-Led7NLlxgIVjSmICh3LRwWC#v=onepage&amp;q=Portraits%20of%20Chinese%20Women%20in%20Revolution&amp;f=false], at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1949 the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] had been overthrown by communist guerillas led by [[Mao Zedong]], and the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded in the same year. In May 1950 the [[People's Republic of China]] enacted the [[New Marriage Law]] to tackle the sale of women into slavery. This outlawed marriage by proxy and made marriage legal so long as both partners consent. The New Marriage Law raised the legal age of marriage to 20 for men and 18 for women. This was an essential part of countryside land reform as women could no longer legally be sold to landlords. The official slogan was "Men and women are equal; everyone is worth his (or her) salt".

The [[Qur'an]], revealed to [[Muhammad]] over the course of 23 years, provided guidance to the [[Islamic community]] and modified existing customs in Arab society.&lt;ref&gt;[[John L.

Syracuse University Press. {{ISBN|0-8156-2908-7}} (pbk); p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; From 610 and 661, known as the [[early reforms under Islam]], the Qur'an introduced fundamental reforms to customary law and introduced rights for women in marriage, divorce, and [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|inheritance]]. By providing that the wife, not her family, would receive a dowry from the husband, which she could administer as her personal property, the Qur'an made women a legal party to the [[Islamic marriage contract|marriage contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (with DeLong-Bas) 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in customary law, inheritance was limited to male descendants, the Qur'an introduced rules on inheritance with certain fixed shares being distributed to designated heirs, first to the nearest female relatives and then the nearest male relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (with DeLong-Bas) 2001, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Annemarie Schimmel]] "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, [[Fiqh|Islamic legislation]] meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]], to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schimmel| first = Annemarie| title = Islam | publisher = SUNY Press| year = 1992| page = 65| url = https://books.google.com/?id=m7oKd-H1BzYC&amp;dq=compared+to+the+pre-Islamic+position+of+women,+Islamic+legislation+meant+an+enormous+progress%3B+the+woman+has+the+right,+at+least+according+to+the+letter+of+the+law,+to+administer+the+wealth+she+has+brought+into+the+family+or+has+earned+by+her+own+work| isbn = 978-0-7914-1327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Europe====
[[File:Medieval women hunting.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Women performing tasks during the Middle Ages]]
Women's rights were protected already by early Medieval Christian Church: one of the first formal legal provision for the right of wives was promulgated by [[Council of Agde|council of Adge]] in 506, which in Canon XVI stipulated that if a young married man wished to be ordained, he required the consent of his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIjEVrB3b4kC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, AD 511-768|last=Halfond|first=Gregory I.|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004179763|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Church and culture in the Middle Ages regarded women as weak, irrational and vulnerable to temptation who was constantly needed to be kept in check.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in England in the middle ages|last = Ward|first = Jennifer|publisher = A &amp; C Black|year = 2006|isbn = 1852853468|location = New York|pages = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2017}} This was reflected on the Christian culture in England through the story of [[Adam and Eve]] where Eve fell to Satan's temptations and led Adam to eat the apple. It was belief based on St.Paul, that the pain of childbirth was a punishment for this deed that led mankind to be banished from the Garden of Eden.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women's inferiority also appears in many medieval writing for example the 1200 AD theologian [[Jacques de Vitry]] (who was rather sympathetic to women over others) emphasized for female obedience towards their men and expressed women as being slippery, weak, untrustworthy, devious, deceitful and stubborn.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The church also promoted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] as a role model for women to emulate by being innocent in her sexuality, being married to a husband and eventually becoming a mother. That was the core purpose set out both culturally and religiously across Medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Rape was also seen in medieval England as a crime against the father or husband and violation of their protection and guardianship of the women whom they look after in the household.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women's identity in the Middle Ages was also referred through her relations with men she was associated with for example "His daughter" or "So and so's wife".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Despite all this, the Church still emphasized on the importance of love and mutual counselling within a marriage and prohibited any form of divorce so the wife would have someone to look after her.
[[File:Women activities in middle ages.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Royal women's activities in the Middle Ages]]
In overall Europe during the Middle Ages, women were inferior to that of a man in legal status.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women's Roles in the Middle Ages|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4SL2X3uHEAC|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|date = 1 January 2007|isbn = 9780313336355|first = Sandy|last = Bardsley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout medieval Europe, women were pressured to not attend courts and leave all legal business affairs to their husbands. In the legal system, women were regarded as the properties of men so any threat or injury to them was in the duty of their male guardians.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In Irish law, women were forbidden to act as witnesses in courts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In Welsh law, women's testimony can be accepted towards other women but not against another man.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In France, women's testimony must corroborate with other accounts or would not be accepted.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although women were expected to not attend courts, this however was not always true. Sometimes regardless of expectation, women did participate and attend court cases and court meetings. But women could not act as justices in courts, be attorneys, they could not be members of a jury and they could not accuse another person of a felony unless it's the murder of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in Medieval Western European Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k09yF2Ub-pYC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=women+in+middle+ages+law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY4_jzj9PJAhWMaxQKHUFmA6AQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=women%2520in%2520middle%2520ages%2520law&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 12 November 2012|isbn = 9781136522031|first = Linda E.|last = Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most part, the best thing a woman could do in medieval courts is observe the legal proceedings taking place.

The Swedish law protected women from the authority of their husbands by transferring the authority to their male relatives.&lt;ref name="Beattie"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Married Women and the Law in Premodern Northwest Europe|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=36uGH4HNUWoC|publisher = Boydell Press|date = 1 January 2013|isbn = 9781843838333|first = Cordelia|last = Beattie|first2 = Matthew Frank|last2 = Stevens}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wife's property and land also could not be taken by the husband without her family's consent but neither could the wife.&lt;ref name="Beattie"/&gt; This mean a woman could not transfer her property to her husband without her family or kinsman's consent either. In Swedish law, women would also only get half that of her brother in inheritance.&lt;ref name="Beattie"/&gt; Despite these legal issues, Sweden was largely ahead and much superior in their treatment towards women than most European countries.

Medieval marriages among the elites were arranged in a way that would meet the interests of the family as a whole.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Theoretically a woman needed to consent before a marriage took place and the Church encouraged this consent to be expressed in present tense and not future.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Marriage could also take place anywhere and minimum age for girls would have to be 12 while 14 for boys.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Northern Europe====
The rate of [[Weregild|Wergild]]  suggested that women in these societies were valued mostly for their breeding purposes. The [[Weregild|Wergild]] of woman was double that of a man with same status in the [[Alemannic German|Aleman]] and [[Bavaria]]n legal codes.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women In Dark Age and Early Medieval Europe|last = Jewell|first = Helen M|publisher = Palgrave Mcmillan|year = 2007|isbn = 0333912594|location = New York|pages = 37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Weregild|Wergild]] of a woman meanwhile was triple that of a man with same status in [[Salian Franks|Salic]] and Repuarian legal codes for women of child bearing age, which constituted from 12–40 years old.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; One of the most Germanic codes from the [[Lombards|Lombard]] tradition, legislated that women be under the control of a male ''mundoald'' which constituted her father, husband, older son or eventually the king as a last resort if she had no male relatives.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; A woman needed her mundold's permission to manage property but still could own her own lands and goods. Certain areas with [[Visigoths|Visgothic]] inheritance laws until the 7th century were favorable to women while all the other laws were not.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Before Christianization of Europe, there was little space for women's consent for marriage and marriage through purchase  (or ''Kaufehe'') was actually the civil norm as opposed to the alternative marriage through capture (or ''Raubehe'').&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However Christianity was slow to reach other Baltic and Scandinavian areas with it only reaching King [[Harald Bluetooth]] of Denmark in the year 950 AD.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Those living under [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and [[Iceland]]ic laws used  marriages to forge alliances or create peace usually without the women's say or consent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However divorce rights were permitted to women who suffered physical abuse but protections from harm were not given to those termed "wretched" women such as beggars, servants and slave women. Having sex with them through force or without consent usually had zero legal consequence or punishment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

During the [[Viking Age]], women had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Grágás]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Borgström Eva {{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could, further more, inherit not only property, but also the position as head of the family from a deceased father or brother: a woman with such status was referred to as ''[[ringkvinna]]'', and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, such as for example the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member, unless she married, by which her rights were transferred to her husband.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  
After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as ''maer'' and ''mey'', reached legal majority and had the right to decide of her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
An exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, as marriages was normally arranged by the clan.&lt;ref&gt;Borgström Eva{{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

[[File:Witches Being Hanged.jpg|thumb|An image of suspected witches being hanged in England, published in 1655]]
The 16th and 17th century saw numerous [[witch trial]]s, which resulted in thousands of people across Europe being executed, of whom 75-95% were women (depending on time and place).&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Killing Women – Gender, Sorcery, and Violence in Late Medieval Germany|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oUfhZceOsrgC|publisher = GRIN Verlag|date = 1 November 2010|isbn = 9783640741830|first = James|last = Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executions mostly took place in German-speaking lands, and during the 15th century the terminology "witchcraft" was definitely viewed as something feminine as opposed to prior years.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; Famous witchcraft manuals such as the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' and ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus|Summis Desiderantes]]''  depicted witches as diabolical conspirators who worshipped Satan and were primarily women. Culture and art at the time depicted these witches as seductive and evil, further fuelling moral panic in fusion with rhetoric from the Church.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

The origin of the female "witch" myth traces back to Roman mythical night creatures known as Strix, who were thought to appear and disappear mysteriously in the night.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; They were also believed by many to be of transformed women by their own supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; This Roman myth itself is believed to  originate from the Jewish Sabbath which described non-supernatural women who would suspiciously leave and return home swiftly during the night.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; Authors of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' strongly established the link between witchcraft and women by proclaiming greater likelihood for women to be addicted to "evil".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in Late Medieval and Reformation Europe|last = Jewell|first = Helen M.|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = 0333912578|location = New York|pages = 123–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors and inquisitors [[Heinrich Kramer]] and Jacob Sprengerh justified these beliefs by claiming women had greater credulity, impressionability, feeble minds, feeble bodies, impulsivity and carnal natures which were flaws susceptible to "evil" behavior and witchcraft.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These sort of beliefs at the time could send female hermits or beggars to trials just for offering remedies or herbal medicine.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These set of developed myths eventually lead to the 16-17th century witch trials which found thousands of women burned at stake.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

By 1500, Europe was divided into two types of secular law.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = 428–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One was customary law which was predominant in northern France, England and Scandinavia, and the other was Roman based written laws which was predominant in southern France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Customary laws favoured men more than women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, inheritance among the elites in Italy, England, Scandinavia and France was passed on to the eldest male heir. In all of the regions, the laws also gave men substantial powers over lives, property and bodies of their wives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, there were some improvements for women as opposed to ancient custom for example they could inherit in the absence of their brothers, do certain trades without their husbands and widows to receive dower.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In areas governed by Roman-based written laws women were under male guardianship in matters involving property and law, fathers overseeing daughters, husbands overseeing wives and uncles or male relatives overseeing widows.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Throughout Europe, women's legal status centered around her marital status while marriage itself was the biggest factor in restricting women's autonomy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Custom, statue and practice not only reduced women's rights and freedoms but prevented single or widowed women from holding public office on the justification that they might one day marry.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to [[English Common Law]], which developed from the 12th century onward, all property which a wife held at the time of marriage became a possession of her husband. Eventually English courts forbade a husband's transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced. French married women suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965.&lt;ref name="Badr-1984"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Criminal Justice|first=Gamal M.|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=32|issue=1|date=Winter 1984|pages=167–69 |doi=10.2307/840274|ref=harv|author2=Mayer, Ann Elizabeth|publisher=American Society of Comparative Law|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=840274}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Europe allowed more women to add their voices, including the English writers [[Jane Anger]], [[Emilia Lanier|Aemilia Lanyer]], and the prophetess [[Anna Trapnell]].

The philosopher [[John Locke]] opposed marital inequality and the mistreatment of women during this time.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender and Good Governance in John Locke|url = http://www.ajsih.org/index.php/ajsih/article/view/56|journal = American Journal of Social Issues and Humanities|date = 19 July 2012|issn = 2276-6928|volume = 2|issue = 4|first = Ikechukwu|last = Anthony|first2 = O. S. A.|last2 = Kanu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well known for advocating for marital equality among the sexes in his work during the 17th century. According to a study published in the ''American Journal of Social Issues &amp; Humanities,'' the condition for women during Locke's time were as quote:&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  English women had fewer grounds for divorce than men until 1923 &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  Husbands controlled most of their wives' personal property until the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870]] and [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  Children were the husband's property&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  Rape was legally impossible within a marriage&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  Wives lacked crucial features of legal personhood, since the husband was taken as the representative of the family (thereby eliminating the need for women's suffrage). These legal features of marriage suggest that the idea of a marriage between equals appeared unlikely to most Victorians.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; (Quoted from ''Gender and Good Governance in John Locke, American Journal of Social Issues &amp; Humanities Vol 2''&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;)

Other philosophers have also made the statements regarding women's rights during this time. For example, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote in ''An Occasional Letter on the Female Sex 1775'' where he states (as quote) :&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The English Literatures of America: 1500-1800|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OsRmAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 19 December 2013|isbn = 9781317795407|language = en|first = Myra|last = Jehlen|first2 = Michael|last2 = Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"If we take a survey of ages and of countries, we shall find the women, almost without exception... adored and oppressed... they are ... robbed of freedom of will by the laws...Yet such, I am sorry to say, is the lot of women over the whole earth. Man with regard to them, has been either an insensible husband or an oppressor."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A paternal society can find prefer to make women's rights a man's duty, for instance under English common law husbands had to maintain their wives. This duty was abolished in 2010.&lt;ref name="UKEqualityAct"&gt;{{cite web |title=Equality Act 2010 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15 |publisher=UK Government Legislation |accessdate=22 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OldLawsOfEngland"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sir William Blackstone |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765-1769) |url=https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-115 |website=Lonang Institute |accessdate=22 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, rights, as a concept and claim, gained increasing political, social, and philosophical importance in Europe. Movements emerged which demanded [[freedom of religion]], the abolition of [[slavery]], rights for women, rights for those who did not own property, and [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sweet| first = William| title = Philosophical theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights| publisher = University of Ottawa Press| year = 2003| page = 4| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_V_KuJGcJSAC&amp;dq=%22natural+law%22+women+%22human+nature%22| isbn =978-0-7766-0558-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain. At the time some of the greatest thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], who defended democratic principles of [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and challenged notions that a privileged few should rule over the vast majority of the population, believed that these principles should be applied only to their own gender and their own race. The philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], for example, thought that it was the order of nature for woman to obey men. He wrote "Women do wrong to complain of the inequality of man-made laws" and claimed that "when she tries to usurp our rights, she is our inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2003| pages = 29–30| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen| id = | isbn =978-0-8122-1854-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 the French playwright and political [[Activism|activist]] [[Olympe de Gouges]] published the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'',&lt;ref name=MS1112&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction", pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; modelled on the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789. The Declaration is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[Egalitarianism|equality]]. It states that: "This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights they have lost in society". The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as "almost a parody...of the original document". The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility." The first article of Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replied: "Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility". De Gouges expands the sixth article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which declared the rights of citizens to take part in the formation of law, to:

"All citizens including women are equally admissible to all public dignities, offices and employments, according to their capacity, and with no other distinction than that of their virtues and talents".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=137 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1869 essay "[[The Subjection of Women]]" the English philosopher and political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]] described the situation for women in Britain as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We are continually told that civilization and Christianity have restored to the woman her just rights. Meanwhile the wife is the actual bondservant of her husband; no less so, as far as the legal obligation goes, than slaves commonly so called."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then a member of parliament, Mill argued that women deserve the [[right to vote]], though his proposal to replace the term "man" with "person" in the second [[Reform Bill of&amp;nbsp;1867]] was greeted with laughter in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and defeated by 76&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;196 votes. His arguments won little support amongst contemporaries&lt;ref name="Brave new world – Women's rights"/&gt; but his attempt to amend the reform bill generated greater attention for the issue of women's suffrage in Britain.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt; Initially only one of several women's rights campaigns, suffrage became the primary cause of the British women's movement at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The women’s suffrage movement in Britain, 1866–1928 |last=Van Wingerden |first=Sophia A. |year=1999 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 978-0-312-21853-9 |pages=1–2 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=0oLxK_NHI6kC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the ability to vote was restricted to wealthy [[Property law|property owners]] within British jurisdictions. This arrangement implicitly excluded women as [[property law]] and [[marriage law]] gave men ownership rights at marriage or inheritance until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Although male suffrage broadened during the century, women were explicitly prohibited from voting nationally and locally in the 1830s by the [[Reform Act 1832]] and the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;Phillips, Melanie, ''The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement'' (Abacus, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millicent Fawcett]] and [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] led the public campaign on women's suffrage and in 1918 a bill was passed allowing women over the age of 30 to vote.&lt;ref name="X" /&gt;

By the 1860s, the economic sexual politics of middle class women in Britain and its neighboring Western European countries was guided by factors such as the evolution of 19th century [[Consumerism|consumer]] culture, including the emergence of the [[department store]], and [[Separate spheres]].
In ''Come Buy, Come Buy: Shopping and the Culture of Consumption in Victorian Women's Writing'', Krista Lysack's literary analysis of 19th century contemporary literature claims through her resources' reflection of common contemporary norms, "Victorian femininity as characterized by self-renunciation and the regulation of appetite."&lt;ref name="Lysack, Krista 2008"&gt;Lysack, Krista. Come buy, come buy : shopping and the culture of consumption in Victorian women's writing. n.p.: Athens : Ohio University Press, c2008., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; And while women, particularly those in the middle class, obtained modest control of daily household expenses and had the ability to leave the house, attend social events, and shop for personal and household items in the various department stores developing in late 19th century Europe, Europe's socioeconomic climate pervaded the ideology that women were not in complete control over their urges to spend (assuming) their husband or father's wages. As a result, many advertisements for socially 'feminine' goods revolved around upward social progression, [[exoticism]]s from the [[Orient]], and added efficiency for household roles women were deemed responsible for, such as cleaning, childcare, and cooking.&lt;ref name="Lysack, Krista 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Erika Diane.

By law and custom, Muscovite Russia was a patriarchal society that subordinated women to men, and the young to their elders. [[Peter the Great|Peter the great]] relaxed the second custom, but not the subordination of women.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = 443–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decree of 1722 explicitly forbade any forced marriages by requiring both bride and groom to consent, while parental permission still remained a requirement. But during Peter's reign, only the man could get rid of his wife by putting her in a nunnery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In terms of laws, there were double standards to women. Adulterous wives were sentenced to forced labor, while men who murdered their wives were merely flogged.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the death Peter the Great, laws and customs pertaining to men's marital authority over their wives increased.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1782, civil law reinforced women's responsibility to obey her husband.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By 1832, the Digest of laws changed this  obligation into "unlimited obedience".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the 18th century, Russian orthodox church further got its authority over marriage and banned priests from granting divorce, even for severely abused wives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By 1818, Russian senate had also forbade separation of married couples.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During [[World War I]], caring for children was increasingly difficult for women, many of whom could not support themselves, and whose husbands had died or were fighting in the war. Many women had to give up their children to children's homes infamous for abuse and neglect. These children's homes were unofficially dubbed as "angel factories". After the [[October Revolution]], the Bolsheviks shut down an infamous angel factory known as the 'Nikolaev Institute' situated near the Moika Canal. The Bolsheviks then replaced the Nikolaev Institute with a modern maternity home called the 'Palace for Mothers and Babies'. This maternity home was used by the [[Bolsheviks]] as a model for future maternity hospitals. The countess who ran the old Institute was moved to a side wing, however she spread rumours that the Bolsheviks had removed sacred pictures, and that the nurses were promiscuous with sailors. The maternity hospital was burnt down hours before it was scheduled to open, and the countess was suspected of being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Cathy |date=1987 |title=Women in Revolutionary Russia |location=Great Britain|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=39 |isbn=0 521 31969 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's rights activism in [[Canada]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on increasing women's role in public life, with goals including women's suffrage, increased property rights, increased access to education, and recognition of women as "persons" under the law.&lt;ref name="Prentice1988"&gt;{{cite book | title=Canadian Women: A History | publisher=Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich | author=Prentice, Alison | year=1988|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Famous Five (Canada)|The Famous Five]] were five Canadian women – [[Emily Murphy]], [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]], [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]], [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] – who, in 1927, asked the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to answer the question, "Does the word 'Persons' in Section 24 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]], include female persons?" in the case ''[[Edwards v.

The extent to which women could participate in [[Japanese society]] has varied over time and social classes. In the 8th century, Japan had women emperors, and in the 12th century ([[Heian period]]) women in Japan occupied a relatively high status, although still subordinated to men. 
From the late [[Edo period]], the status of women declined. In the 17th century, the "[[Onna Daigaku]]", or "Learning for Women", by [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] author [[Kaibara Ekken]], spelled out expectations for Japanese women, lowering significantly their status.&lt;ref name=Ekken&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekken|first1=Kaibara|title=Onna Daigaku A Treasure Box of Women's Learning.|date=2010|publisher=Gardners Books|isbn=0955979676|url=https://archive.org/stream/womenwisdomofjap00kaib/womenwisdomofjap00kaib_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Meiji period]], industrialization and urbanization reduced the authority of fathers and husbands, but at the same time the Meiji Civil Code of 1898 denied women legal rights and subjugated them to the will of household heads.&lt;ref name="Womeninworldhistory"&gt;[http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/WR-04.html The Meiji Reforms and Obstacles for Women Japan, 1878–1927]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid 20th century the status of women improved greatly. Although Japan is often considered a very conservative country, it was in fact earlier than many European countries on giving women legal rights in the 20th century, as the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]]  provided a legal framework favorable to the advancement of women’s equality in Japan. Japan for instance enacted women's suffrage in 1946, earlier than several European countries such as [[Switzerland]] (1971 at federal level; 1990 on local issues in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]]), [[Portugal]] (1976 on equal terms with men, with restrictions since 1931), [[San Marino]] in 1959, [[Monaco]] in 1962, [[Andorra]] in 1970, and [[Liechtenstein]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/timeline/votes_to_women.shtml|title=Radio 4 Woman's Hour – Timeline:When women got the vote|author=BBC|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Voter Turnout in Western Europe Since 1945: A Regional Report |author1=Rafael López Pintor |author2=Maria Gratschew |author3=Tim Bittiger |publisher=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance |year=2004 |isbn=978-9185391004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Australia=====
[[File:Catherine Helen Spence.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|Australia's first female political candidate, [[South Australia]]n suffragette [[Catherine Helen Spence]] (1825-1910)]]
The history of women's rights in [[Australia]] is a contradictory one: while Australia led the world in women's suffrage rights in the 19th century, it has been very slow in recognizing women's professional rights - it was not until 1966 that its [[marriage bar]] was removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://lrrpublic.cli.det.nsw.edu.au/lrrSecure/Sites/Web/pre_liberation/other/restrictions_pop.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, reforms which allowed women both to vote and stand for office  in [[South Australia]] in the late 19th century  were a cornerstone for women's political rights in other parts of the world. In this regard, Australia differs from other cultures, in that women's suffrage in Australia was one of the earliest objectives of the feminist movement there (beginning with South Australia and Western Australia) unlike other cultures, such as Eastern European cultures, where at the turn of the 20th century the feminist movement  focused on [[labour rights]], access to professions and education, rather than political rights. To this day, Australia has a quite low percentage of women in business executive roles compared to other countries with equivalent corporate structures.&lt;ref&gt;http://theconversation.com/australian-firms-trail-world-for-women-in-top-roles-11008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core concepts==
=== Natural rights ===
17th century [[natural law]] philosophers in Britain and America, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[John Locke]], developed the theory of [[natural rights]] in reference to ancient philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and the Christian theologist [[Aquinas]]. Like the ancient philosophers, 17th century natural law philosophers defended [[slavery]] and an inferior status of women in law.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 282 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on ancient Greek philosophers, natural law philosophers argued that [[natural rights]] were not derived from god, but were "universal, self-evident, and intuitive", a law that could be found in nature. They believed that natural rights were self-evident to "civilised man" who lives "in the highest form of society".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 297"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 297 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural rights derived from [[human nature]], a concept first established by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Citium]] in ''Concerning Human Nature''. Zenon argued that each rational and civilized male Greek citizen had a "divine spark" or "soul" within him that existed independent of the body. Zeno founded the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] and the idea of a human nature was adopted by other Greek philosophers, and later [[natural law]] philosophers and western [[humanists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 214 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle developed the widely adopted idea of [[rationality]], arguing that man was a "rational animal" and as such a natural power of reason. Concepts of human nature in ancient Greece depended on gender, ethnic, and other qualifications&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 212"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 212 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17th century natural law philosophers came to regard women along with children, slaves and non-whites, as neither "rational" nor "civilised".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 297"/&gt; Natural law philosophers claimed the inferior status of women was "common sense" and a matter of "nature". They believed that women could not be treated as equal due to their "inner nature".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"/&gt; The views of 17th century natural law philosophers were opposed in the 18th and 19th century by [[evangelical]] [[natural theology]] philosophers such as [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Charles Spurgeon]], who argued for the abolition of slavery and advocated for women to have rights equal to that of men.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"/&gt; Modern natural law theorists, and advocates of natural rights, claim that all people have a human nature, regardless of gender, ethnicity or other qualifications, therefore all people have natural rights.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 212"/&gt;

=== Equal employment ===

{{Further|Employment discrimination law in the European Union}}
[[Labour law|Employment rights]] for women include non-discriminatory access of women to jobs and [[equal pay]]. The rights of women and men to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the [[British Hong Kong]] Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkccsa.org/ |title=香港政府華員會 |publisher=Hkccsa.org |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the nursing profession.&lt;ref name="RebeccaChan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="torontosun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived|title=Celebrating two lives well lived &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Toronto Sun|publisher=m.torontosun.com|accessdate=24 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716175556/http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ottawasun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001|title=Celebrating two lives well lived : Featured OTT : Videos|publisher=ottawasun.com|accessdate=24 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704133812/http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Connor |first=Kevin |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/07/life-love-and-service-recalled |title=Life, love and service &amp;#124; Toronto &amp; GTA &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=7 April 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2012-04-08/city1333873203d3799095.html |title=曾參與二戰及香港保衛戰華裔夫婦.加美軍方墓前致最高敬意_星島日報_加拿大多倫多中文新聞網。 Canada Toronto Chinese newspaper |publisher=News.singtao.ca |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epapertor.worldjournal.com/showtor.html?apJi+mgEEOB3Bg1Fmi3TsQ==,MMV3f+xDb0CKYCyOu+WesQ== |title=世界日報電子報 – World Journal ePaper |publisher=Epapertor.worldjournal.com |accessdate=9 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812123852/http://epapertor.worldjournal.com/showtor.html?apJi+mgEEOB3Bg1Fmi3TsQ==,MMV3f+xDb0CKYCyOu+WesQ== |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mingpaotor.com/htm/News/20120408/tfc1.htm |title=明報新聞網海外版 – 加東版(多倫多) – Canada Toronto Chinese Newspaper – 社區新聞 |publisher=Mingpaotor.com |accessdate=9 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812061427/http://www.mingpaotor.com/htm/News/20120408/tfc1.htm |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some European countries, married women could not work without the consent of their husbands until a few decades ago, for example in [[France]] until 1965&lt;ref name=Guillaumin&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meltzer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Spain]] until 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/spain/43.htm|title=Spain – SOCIAL VALUES AND ATTITUDES|work=countrystudies.us|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[marriage bar]]s, a practice adopted from the late 19th century to the 1970s across many countries, including Austria, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and Switzerland, restricted married women from employment in many professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=23196053|title=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/standard/history/scotland_britain_1880_now/employment_women/revision/3/|title=Standard Grade Bitesize History – Women and work : Revision, p. 3|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century some women began to ask for, demand, and then agitate and demonstrate for the [[right to vote]] – the right to participate in their government and its law making.&lt;ref name=Krolokke&gt;Krolokke, Charlotte and Anne Scott Sorensen, 'From Suffragettes to Grrls' in Gender Communication Theories and Analyses:From Silence to Performance (Sage, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Other women opposed suffrage, like [[Helen Kendrick Johnson]], who argued in the 1897 pamphlet ''Woman and the Republic'' that women could achieve legal and economic equality without having the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Feminism's Founding Fathers: The Men Who Fought for Women's Rights|author=Kaevan Gazdar|publisher= John Hunt Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xznaDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66&amp;dq=Helen+Kendrick+Johnson+women%27s+rights&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih0Lja_ZrVAhUFnRQKHQdIA20Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Helen%20Kendrick%20Johnson%20women%27s%20rights&amp;f=false|year=2016 |isbn=978-1-78099-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideals of [[women's suffrage]] developed alongside that of [[universal suffrage]] and today women's suffrage is considered a right (under the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]). During the 19th century the right to vote was gradually extended in many countries, and women started to campaign for their right to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. Australia gave women the right to vote in 1902.&lt;ref name=suffrage&gt;{{cite web |title=Women's Suffrage |url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/womenx2019s-suffrage |publisher=Scholastic |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Nordic countries]] gave women the right to vote in the early 20th century – Finland (1906), Norway (1913), Denmark and Iceland (1915). With the end of the First World War many other countries followed – the [[Netherlands]] (1917), [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]].

In Canada, most provinces enacted women's suffrage between 1917–1919, late adopters being [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1922, [[Newfoundland]] in 1925 and [[Quebec]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/ProvinceTerritory/ProvincialWomenRightToVote.aspx|title=Women's Right to Vote in Canada|work=parl.gc.ca|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America some countries gave women the right to vote in the first half of the 20th century – [[Ecuador]] (1929), [[Brazil]] (1932), [[El Salvador]] (1939), [[Dominican Republic]] (1942), [[Guatemala]] (1956) and [[Argentina]] (1946). In [[India]], under colonial rule, universal suffrage was granted in 1935. Other Asian countries gave women the right to vote in the mid 20th century – [[Japan]] (1945), [[China]] (1947) and [[Indonesia]] (1955). In Africa, women generally got the right to vote along with men through universal suffrage – [[Liberia]] (1947), [[Uganda]] (1958) and [[Nigeria]] (1960). In many countries in the Middle East universal suffrage was acquired after World War II, although in others, such as [[Kuwait]], suffrage is very limited.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt; On 16 May 2005, the Parliament of Kuwait extended suffrage to women by a 35–23 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/05/16/kuwait.women/index.html |title="Kuwait grants women right to vote" CNN.com (May 16, 2005) |publisher=CNN |date=16 May 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property rights===
During the 19th century some women, such as [[Ernestine Rose]], [[Paulina Wright Davis]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], in the United States and Britain began to challenge laws that denied them the [[Women's Property Rights|right to their property]] once they married. Under the common law doctrine of ''[[coverture]]'' husbands gained control of their wives' real estate and wages. Beginning in the 1840s, state legislatures in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriedwomensproperty/a/property_1848ny.htm |title=Married Women's Property Act &amp;#124; 1848 &amp;#124; New York State |publisher=Womenshistory.about.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umd.umich.edu/casl/hum/eng/classes/434/geweb/PROPERTY.htm |title=Property Rights Of Women |publisher=Umd.umich.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805171942/http://www.umd.umich.edu/casl/hum/eng/classes/434/geweb/PROPERTY.htm |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; began passing statutes that protected women's property from their husbands and their husbands' creditors. These laws were known as the [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States|Married Women's Property Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366305/Married-Womens-Property-Acts |title=Married Women's Property Acts (United States [1839&amp;#93;)&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts in the 19th-century United States also continued to require privy examinations of married women who sold their property. A [[privy examination]] was a practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v012/12.2braukman.html |title=Project MUSE&amp;nbsp;– Journal of Women's History&amp;nbsp;– Married Women's Property and Male Coercion: United States Courts and the Privy Examination, 1864–1887 |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights for women continued to be restricted in many European countries until legal reforms of the 1960-70s. For example, in [[West Germany]], the law pertaining to rural farm succession favored male heirs until 1963.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/law/help/inheritance-laws/germany.php&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[Head and master]] laws, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, were common until a few decades ago. The Supreme Court, in ''[[Kirchberg v. Feenstra]]'' (1981), declared such laws unconstitutional.

=== Freedom of movement ===
[[File:A_Chinese_Golden_Lily_Foot,_Lai_Afong,_c1870s.jpg|thumb|left|Woman with [[Foot binding|bound feet]], 1870s]]
[[File:Ladies cabul1848b.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|''Ladies of [[Kabul|Caubul]]'' (1848 lithograph, by James Rattray) showing the lifting of [[purdah]] in [[zenana]] areas –  Oriental and India Office Collection, British Library]]
[[Freedom of movement]] is an essential right, recognized by international instruments, including   Article 15 (4) of [[CEDAW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 September 2017 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archive-date=1 April 2011 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in many regions of the world, women have this right severely restricted, in law or in practice. For instance, in some countries women may not leave the home without a male guardian,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24691034&lt;/ref&gt; or without the consent of the husband – for example the personal law of [[Yemen]] states that a wife must obey her husband and must not get out of the home without his consent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Even in countries which do not have legal restrictions, women's movement  may be prevented in practice by social and religious norms such as [[purdah]]. Laws restricting women from travelling existed until relatively recently in some Western countries: until 1983, in [[Australia]] the passport application of a married woman had to be authorized by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060614171552/http://www.passports.gov.au/Web/passport_history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Various practices have been used historically to restrict women's freedom of movement, such as [[foot binding]], the custom of applying painfully tight binding to the feet of young Chinese girls, which was common between the 10th and 20th century.

Women's freedom of movement may be restricted by laws, but it may also be restricted by attitudes towards women in public spaces. In areas where it is not socially accepted for women to leave the home, women who are outside may face abuse such as insults, sexual harassment and violence.
Many of the restrictions on women's freedom of movement are framed as measures to "protect" women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.empowerwomen.org/en/who-we-are/news/2016/2/freedom-of-movement-and-womens-economic-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the summer of 2017, an India women named Varnika Kundu shared a story on Facebook about being stalked by two men late at night.  Kundu was coming home after a night out with friends when two men began following her.  Kundu made it home unharmed, but was understandably shaken after the incident.  She posted her story on Facebook, hoping to bring awareness and warn other women, but was instead met with a backlash of trolls telling her she shouldn't have been out that late and that it was her fault for being in that situation.  This incident spawned the #AintNoCinderella movement, where women all over the world shared pictures of them being out past midnight with the hashtag in order to combat gender stereotypes and bias.&lt;ref&gt;https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-in-india/aint-no-cinderella-women-fight-for-safety-by-sharing-late-night-photos-on-twitter-4787653/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informing women about their legal rights===
The lack of legal knowledge among many women, especially in developing countries, is a major obstacle in the improvement of women's situation. International bodies, such as the United Nations, have stated that the obligation of states does not only consist in passing relevant laws, but also in informing women about the existence of such laws, in order to enable them to seek justice and realize in practice their rights. Therefore, states must popularize the laws, and explain them clearly to the public, in order to prevent ignorance, or misconceptions originating in [[myth|popular myth]]s, about the laws. The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/undp-cpr-8-point-agenda-practical-positive-outcomes-girls-women-crisis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref name="un-documents.net"&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrimination===
Women's rights movements focus on ending [[discrimination]] of women. In this regard, the definition of discrimination itself is important. According to the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]], the right to freedom from discrimination includes not only the obligation of states to treat in the same way persons who are in  analogous  situations, but  also the obligation to treat in a different way  persons  who are in different situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Case%20of%20Thlimmenos%20v%20Greece%20_2_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard equity, not just "equality" is important. Therefore, states must sometimes differentiate between women and men – through for example offering [[maternity leave]] or other legal protections surrounding pregnancy and childbirth (to take into account the biological realities of [[reproduction]]), or through acknowledging a specific historical context. For example, acts of violence committed by men against women do not happen in a vacuum, but are part of a social context: in ''Opuz v Turkey'', the ECHR defined [[violence against women]] as a form of discrimination against women;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interights.org/opuz/index.htm{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;para 200: "[T]he Court considers that the violence suffered by the applicant and her mother may be regarded as ''gender-based violence which is a form of discrimination against women''&lt;/ref&gt; this is also the position of the Istanbul Convention which at Article 3 states that "violence against women" is understood as a violation of human rights and ''a form of discrimination against women'' [...]".&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168046031c&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different views on where it is appropriate to differentiate between women and men, and one view is that the act of [[sexual intercourse]] is an act where this difference must be acknowledged, both due to the increased physical risks for the woman,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents&lt;/ref&gt; and due to the historical context of women being systematically subjected to forced sexual intercourse while in a socially subordinated position (particularly [[marital rape|within marriage]] and [[Wartime sexual violence|during war]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31473687_Why_Sexual_Penetration_Requires_Justification&lt;/ref&gt; States must also differentiate with regard to healthcare by ensuring that [[women's health]] - particularly with regard to [[reproductive health]] such as [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] - is not neglected. According to the World Health Organization "Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women."&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The refusal of states to acknowledge the specific needs of women, such as the necessity  of specific policies like the strong investment of states in reducing [[maternal mortality]] can be a form of discrimination. In this regard treating women and men similarly does not work because certain biological aspects such as menstruation, pregnancy, labor, childbirth, breastfeeding, as well as certain medical conditions, only affect women. The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] stipulates in its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' that states should "Examine  gender neutral  laws  and  policies  to  ensure  that  they  do  not  create  or 
perpetuate existing inequalities and repeal or modify them if they do so".  (paragraph 32).&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of gender neutral policy which harms women is that where medication tested in [[medical trial]]s only on men is also used on women assuming that there are no biological differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4800017 | pmid=27011778 | doi=10.18549/PharmPract.2016.01.708 | volume=14 | title=Women's involvement in clinical trials: historical perspective and future implications | year=2016 | journal=Pharm Pract (Granada) | page=708 | last1 = Liu | first1 = KA | last2 = Mager | first2 = NA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to health===
[[File:Maternal mortality rate worldwide.jpg|thumb|Global maternal mortality rate per 100 000 live births, (2010)&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html Country Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate] in [[:en:The World Factbook|The CIA World Factbook]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Health]] is defined by the World Health Organization as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/about/mission/en/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's health]] refers to the health of women, which differs from that of men in many unique ways. Women's health is severely impaired in some parts of the world, due to factors such as inequality, confinement of women to the home, indifference of medical workers, lack of autonomy of women, lack of financial resources of women.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/topics/womens_health/en/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Discrimination against women occurs also through denial of medical services that are only needed by women.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Violations of women's right to health may result in [[maternal death]], accounting for more than 300.000 deaths per year, most of them in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Certain traditional practices, such as [[female genital mutilation]], also affect women's health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, young women and adolescent girls are the population most affected by [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/hiv-and-aids/facts-and-figures&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to education===
{{Further|Right to education|Female education|Gender and education}}
[[File:First Iranian women university.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|First group of women who entered university in Iran]]
The right to [[education]] is a universal entitlement to education.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/2011/pdfs/Infonote_Women_and_the_right_to_education.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] prohibits discrimination in education, with discrimination being defined as "any distinction, exclusion, limitation or preference which, being based on race, colour, ''sex'', language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic condition or birth, has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing equality of treatment in education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=12949&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention against Discrimination in Education|work=unesco.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] states at Article 3 that "The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the present Covenant", with Article 13 recognizing "the right of everyone to education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx|title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|work=ohchr.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While women's right to access to academic education is recognized as very important, it is increasingly recognized that academic education must be supplemented with education on [[human rights]], [[non-discrimination]], [[ethics]] and [[gender equality]], in order for social advancement to be possible. This was pointed out by [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]], the current [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], who stressed the importance of human rights education for all children: "What good was it to humanity that [[Josef Mengele]] had advanced degrees in medicine and anthropology, given that he was capable of committing the most inhuman crimes? Eight of the 15 people who planned the [[Holocaust]] at Wannsee in 1942 held PhDs. They shone academically, and yet they were profoundly toxic to the world. [[Radovan Karadžić]] was a trained psychiatrist. [[Pol Pot]] studied radio electronics in Paris. Does this matter, when neither of them showed the smallest shred of ethics and understanding?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15482&amp;LangID=E|title=Keynote speech by Mr. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at the Conference on "Education for Peace" Palais des Nations, Geneva, 14 January 2015|work=ohchr.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been increased attention given in recent decades to the raising of student awareness to the importance of gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachunicef.org/explore/topic/gender-equality |title=Gender Equality |publisher=TeachUNICEF |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal rights====
Reproductive rights are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]]. Reproductive rights were endorsed by the twenty-year Cairo Programme of Action which was adopted in 1994 at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]], and by the [[Beijing Declaration]] and [[Beijing Platform for Action]] in 1995.

In the 1870s feminists advanced the concept of ''voluntary motherhood'' as a political critique of ''involuntary motherhood''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 55 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing a desire for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 56 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates for voluntary motherhood disapproved of [[contraception]], arguing that women should only engage in sex for the purpose of [[procreation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 57 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated for periodic or permanent [[abstinence]].&lt;ref name="Gordon 2002 59"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 59 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights represents a broad concept, that may include some or all of the following rights: the right to legal or safe abortion, the right to [[birth control|control one's reproductive functions]], the right to access quality [[reproductive health]]care, and the right to [[family planning|education and access]] in order to make reproductive choices free from [[coercion]], discrimination, and violence.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |title=Stop Violence Against Women: Reproductive rights |accessdate=8 December 2007 |author=Amnesty International USA |year=2007 |work=SVAW |publisher=Amnesty International USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120140923/http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |archivedate=20 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive rights may also be understood to include [[sex education|education]] about [[contraception]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]].&lt;ref name="COOK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Template"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zavales4.html |title=Template |publisher=Nocirc.org |date=10 December 1993 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive rights are often defined to include freedom from [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), and [[forced abortion]] and [[forced sterilization]].&lt;ref name="COOK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Template"/&gt; The Istanbul Convention recognizes these two rights at Article 38 – Female genital mutilation and Article 39 – Forced abortion and forced sterilisation.&lt;ref name="Istanbul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe – Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights are understood as rights of both men and women, but are most frequently advanced as women's rights.&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;

In the 1960s, reproductive rights activists promoted women's right to bodily autonomy, with these social movements leading to the gain of legal access to contraception and abortion  during the next decades in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/photos/MFWL.html|title=The March for Women's Lives, April 2004|website=www.jofreeman.com|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abortion====
[[File:Black March in support of abortion rights, Łódź October 2nd 2016 33.jpg|thumb|right|Access to abortion services varies considerably throughout the world, with the status of related rights being an active and major political topic in many nations.]]

Women's reproductive rights may be understood as including the right to easy access to a safe and legal abortion. [[Abortion law]]s vary from a full prohibition (the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Malta, Nicaragua, the Vatican)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/22/chile-abortion-bill-michelle-bachelet-a-triumph-of-reason-ease-abortion-ban&lt;/ref&gt; to countries [[Abortion in Canada|such as Canada]], where there are no legal restrictions. In many countries where abortion is permitted by law, women may only have limited access to safe abortion services. In some countries abortion is permitted only to save the pregnant woman's life, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or [[incest]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160415084202/http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/WorldAbortionPolicies2013/WorldAbortionPolicies2013_WallChart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also countries where the law  is liberal, but in practice it is very difficult to have an abortion, due to most doctors being  [[conscientious objectors]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that is some countries where abortion is legal it is ''[[de facto]]'' very difficult to have access to one is controversial; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt; The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:
a) Provisions  that  allow,  tolerate  or  condone  forms  of  gender based  violence against women, including [...] legislation  that  criminalises  abortion".&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], "Abortion is a highly emotional subject and one that excites deeply held opinions. However, equitable access to safe abortion services is first and foremost a human right. Where abortion is safe and legal, no one is forced to have one. Where abortion is illegal and unsafe, women are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or suffer serious health consequences and even death. Approximately 13% of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually."&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/women/abortion.html |title=Human Rights Watch: Women's Human Rights: Abortion |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=9 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112153841/http://www.hrw.org/women/abortion.html |archivedate=12 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, "the denial of a pregnant woman's right to make an independent decision regarding abortion violates or poses a threat to a wide range of human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/ |title=Q&amp;A: Human Rights Law and Access to Abortion |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114110907/http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/ |archivedate=14 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/#issue |title=Q&amp;A: Human Rights Law and Access to Abortion |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114110907/http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/#issue |archivedate=14 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can argue that even though women die from unsafe abortion, the legalization of abortion is considered a human right violation since it supports a cause that deprives the unborn of their humanity, which must be respected, and therefore another solution is needed in order to avoid maternal deaths (e.g., psychological and physiological support during and after pregnancy) whilst also avoiding abortion. According to World Health Organization, 56 million abortions on average occurred worldwide each year in 2010-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/news/440KeyAbortionFactsFinal.pdf?ua=1 |title=Induced Abortion Worldwide |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; African American women are 5 times likely to have an abortion rather than a white woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2008/08/abortion-and-women-color-bigger-picture|title=Abortion and Women of Color: The Bigger Picture|date=2008-08-13|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] and many other [[Christianity|Christian faiths]], particularly those considered the [[Christian right]], and most [[Judaism and abortion|Orthodox Jews]] regard abortion not as a right, but as a [[moral evil]] and a [[Mortal sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia was the first country to legalise abortions and offer free medical care in state hospitals to do so. After the [[October Revolution]], the Women's wing of the [[Bolshevik]] Party (the Zhenotdel) persuaded the Bolsheviks to legalise abortion (as a 'temporary measure'). The Bolsheviks legalised abortion in November 1920. This was the first time in world history that women had won the right to free abortions in state hospitals.&lt;ref name="Porter 1987 43"/&gt;

====Abuse during childbirth====
{{Main|Abuse during childbirth}}
[[Abuse during childbirth|The abuse of women during childbirth]] is a recently identified global problem and a basic violation of a woman's rights.&lt;ref name = who1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/maternal_perinatal/statement-childbirth/en/|title=Prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during childbirth|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = who2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134588/1/WHO_RHR_14.23_eng.pdf?ua=1&amp;ua=1 | title = The prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during facility-based childbirth | accessdate = 3 August 2017 | publisher = World Health organization }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse during childbirth is the [[neglect]], [[physical abuse]] and lack of respect during [[childbirth]]. This treatment is regarded as a violation of the woman's rights. It also has the effect of preventing women from seeking [[pre-natal care]] and using other health care services.

====Child marriage====
{{Main|Child marriage}}
Child marriage is a practice which is widespread across the world, and is often connected to poverty and gender inequality. Child marriage endangers the [[reproductive health]] of young girls, leading to an increased risk of  complications in pregnancy or childbirth. Such complications are a leading cause of death among girls in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/child-marriage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-marriage/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forced pregnancy====
{{Main|Forced pregnancy}}
Forced pregnancy is the practice of forcing a woman or girl to become [[pregnant]], often as part of a [[forced marriage]], including by means of [[bride kidnapping]], through rape (including [[marital rape]], [[war rape]] and [[genocidal rape]]) or as part of a program of breeding [[slave]]s (see [[Slave breeding in the United States]]). It is a form of [[reproductive coercion]], was common historically, and still occurs in parts of the world. In the 20th century, state mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]], which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Natalae | title = Memorandum: Charging forced marriage as a crime against humanity | url =http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Documentation Center of Cambodia | date = 22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced pregnancy is strongly connected to the custom of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom from violence===
[[Violence against women]] is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women.  The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref name="un-documents.net"/&gt; The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, provides the following definition of violence against women: "violence against women" is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e&lt;/ref&gt; Violence against women may be perpetrated by individuals, by groups, or by the State. It may occur in private or in public. Violence against women may be sexual violence, physical violence, psychological violence, socioeconomic violence. Some forms of violence against women have long cultural traditions: [[honor killing]]s, [[Dowry death|dowry violence]], [[female genital mutilation]]. Violence against women is considered by the World Health Organization "a major public health problem and a violation of women's human rights."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family law===
Under male dominated [[family law]], women had few, if any, rights, being under the control of the husband or male relatives. Legal concepts that existed throughout the centuries, such as [[coverture]], [[marital power]], [[Head and Master law]]s, kept women under the strict control of their husbands. Restrictions from marriage laws also extended to public life, such as [[marriage bar]]s. Practices such as [[dowry]] or [[bride price]] were, and still are to this day in some parts of the world, very common. Some countries continue to require to this day a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|male guardian]] for women, without whom women cannot exercise civil rights. Other harmful practices include marriage of young girls, often to much older men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

In the subsequent decades women's rights again became an important issue in the English speaking world. By the 1960s the movement was called "feminism" or "women's liberation." Reformers wanted the same pay as men, equal rights in law, and the freedom to plan their families or not have children at all. Their efforts were met with mixed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=Waves of Feminism |publisher=Jofreeman.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Council of Women]] (ICW) was the first women's organization to work across national boundaries for the common cause of advocating human rights for women. In March and April 1888, women leaders came together in Washington D.C. with 80 speakers and 49 delegates representing 53 women's organizations from 9 countries: Canada, the United States, Ireland, India, England, Finland, Denmark, France and Norway. Women from professional organizations, trade unions, arts groups and benevolent societies participate. National Councils are affiliated to the ICW and thus make themselves heard at international level. In 1904, the ICW met in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Helene Stöcker (2015): Lebenserinnerungen, hg. von Reinhold Lütgeeier-Davin u. Kerstin Wolff. Köln: Böhlau, 93, pp. 100–01.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICW worked with the [[League of Nations]] during the 1920s and the [[United Nations]] post-World War II. Today the ICW holds Consultative Status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the highest accreditation an NGO can achieve at the United Nations. Currently, it is composed of 70 countries and has a headquarters in Lasaunne, Switzerland. International meetings are held every three years.

In the UK, a public groundswell of opinion in favour of legal equality had gained pace, partly through the extensive employment of women in what were traditional male roles during both world wars. By the 1960s the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP [[Willie Hamilton]]'s [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] report, his equal pay for equal work bill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/620037.stm |work=BBC News | title=Tributes paid to veteran anti-royalist | date=27 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of a Sex Discrimination Board, [[Lady Sear]]'s draft sex anti-discrimination bill, a government [[Green Paper]] of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an Equal Pay Act, and an [[Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)|Equal Opportunities Commission]] came into force.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 29 December 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 29 December 1975 "Sex discrimination in advertising banned".&lt;/ref&gt; With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discrimination laws would be phased out across the European Community.

In the USA, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) was created in 1966 with the purpose of bringing about equality for all women. NOW was one important group that fought for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). This amendment stated that "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of [[gender|sex]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html |title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose |publisher=Now.org |date=29 October 1966 |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902232426/http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But there was disagreement on how the proposed amendment would be understood. Supporters believed it would guarantee women equal treatment. But critics feared it might deny women the right be financially supported by their husbands. The amendment died in 1982 because not enough states had ratified it. ERAs have been included in subsequent Congresses, but have still failed to be ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/national-organization-for-women?cat=biz-fin&amp;nr=1 |title=National Organization for Women: Definition and Much More from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women for Women International]] (WfWI) is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides practical and moral support to women survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war's devastation through a year-long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy) training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development. The organization was co-founded in 1993 by [[Zainab Salbi]], an [[Iraqi American]] who is herself a survivor of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] and Salbi's then-husband Amjad Atallah. Since June 2012, WfWI has been led by Afshan Khan, a long-time former executive with UNICEF who became WfWI's first new CEO since founder Zainab Salbi stepped down to devote more time to her writing and lecturing.&lt;ref&gt;"Women for Women International Names Afshan Khan New CEO."

The [[National Council of Women of Canada]] (Conseil national des femmes du Canada), is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] advocacy organization based in [[Ottawa]] aimed at improving conditions for women, families, and communities. A federation of nationally organized societies of men and women and local and provincial councils of women, it is the Canadian member of the [[International Council of Women]] (ICW). The Council has concerned itself in areas including [[women's suffrage]], immigration, [[health care in Canada|health care]], [[education in Canada|education]], mass media, [[environmentalism|the environment]], and many others.&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2010-05-22T15%3A32%3A48Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;rft_dat=97640&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fcollectionscanada.gc.ca%3Apam | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130115100209/http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2010-05-22T15:32:48Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=97640&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/collectionscanada.gc.ca:pam | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 15 January 2013 | title = National Council of Women of Canada fonds | publisher = [[Library and Archives Canada]] | accessdate = 2 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed on 27 October 1857 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], it is one of the oldest advocacy organizations in the country.&lt;ref name = "encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0005614 | title = National Council of Women of Canada | publisher = ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' | accessdate = 2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations and World Conferences ===
In 1946 the United Nations established a [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/Review/|title=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

Since 1975 the UN has held a series of world conferences on women's issues, starting with the World Conference of the International Women's Year in Mexico City. These conferences created an international forum for women's rights, but also illustrated divisions between women of different cultures and the difficulties of attempting to apply principles universally.&lt;ref name=Catagay&gt;Catagay, N., Grown, C. and Santiago, A. 1986.

===Field organisations===
Regions where women's rights are less developed have produced interesting local organisations, such as:
* [[IIDA Women's Development Organisation]], a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[non-governmental organisation]], created by women in order to work for [[peacebuilding]] and women's rights defence in [[Somalia]], a country deprived of state structures and security since 1991,
* the [[All Pakistan Women's Association]], a [[civil society]] organisation founded in 1949, which develops a range of programmes in the field of health, nutrition, education, [[birth control]] and legal aid.

=== United Nations convention ===
{{main|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}
[[File:CEDAW Participation.svg|right|upright=1.8|thumb| Participation in the CEDAW {{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}{{legend|#00aa00|Signed and ratified}}{{legend|#008000|Acceded or succeeded}}{{legend|#008080|Unrecognized state, abiding by treaty}}{{Col-2}}{{legend|#eeee00|Only signed}}{{legend|#ff1111|Non-signatory}}{{Col-end}}]]

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, enshrines "the equal rights of men and women", and addressed both the equality and equity issues.&lt;ref name=Human&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1979, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for legal implementation of the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]]. Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for [[woman|women]], it came into force on 3 September 1981. The UN member states that have not ratified the convention are Iran, Palau, Somalia, Sudan, Tonga, and the United States. [[Niue]] and the Vatican City, which are non-member states, have also not ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=UNTC|work=un.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest state to become a party to the convention is South Sudan, on 30 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=UNTC |publisher=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention defines discrimination against women in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also establishes an agenda of action for putting an end to sex-based discrimination for which states ratifying the Convention are required to enshrine [[gender equality]] into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. They must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], Article 2 (e).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage, divorce, and family law===
Article 16 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] enshrines the right of consenting men and women to marry and found a family.&lt;ref name=Human /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 16 of CEDAW stipulates that, "1. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations [...]".&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article16|title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003|work=un.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the rights included are a woman's right to freely and consensually choose her spouse; to have parental rights to her children irrespective of her marital status; the right of a married woman to choose a profession or an occupation, and to have property rights within marriage. In addition to these, "The betrothal and the marriage of a child shall have no legal effect".&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

[[Polygamous marriage]] is a controversial practice, prevalent in some parts of the world. The General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, state at ''General Recommendation No. 21, Equality in marriage and family relations''
"14.[...] Polygamous marriage contravenes a woman's right to equality with men, and can have such serious emotional and financial consequences for her and her dependents that such marriages ought to be discouraged and prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm|title=General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women|work=un.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cohabitation]] of unmarried couples as well as [[single mother]]s are common in some parts the world. The [[Human Rights Committee]] has stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/gencomm/hrcom28.htm|title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|work=umn.edu|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"27. In giving effect to recognition of the family in the context of article 23, it is important to accept the concept of the various forms of family, including unmarried couples and their children and single parents and their children and to ensure the equal treatment of women in these contexts (General Comment 19 paragraph 2 last sentence). Single parent families frequently consist of a single woman caring for one or more children, and States parties should describe what measures of support are in place to enable her to discharge her parental functions on the basis of equality with a man in a similar position."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action===
{{main|Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action}}
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, also known as VDPA, is a human rights declaration adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] on 25 June 1993 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. This declaration recognizes women's rights as being protected human rights. Paragraph 18 reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/Vienna.aspx |title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The human rights of women and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. The full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life, at the national, regional and international levels, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 ===
{{main|United Nations Security Council Resolution}}
On 31 October 2000, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]], the first formal and legal document from the United Nations Security Council that requires all states to respect fully [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]] applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls during and after the [[armed conflicts]].

=== Maputo Protocol ===
{{main|Maputo Protocol}}
The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, better known as the [[Maputo Protocol]], was adopted by the [[African Union]] on 11 July 2003 at its second summit in [[Maputo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0307/S00279.htm African Union: Rights of Women Protocol Adopted], press release, [[Amnesty International]], 22 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Mozambique. On 25 November 2005, having been ratified by the required 15 member nations of the African Union, the protocol entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0602/S00099.htm UNICEF: toward ending female genital mutilation], press release, [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]], 7 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol guarantees comprehensive rights to women including the right to take part in the political process, to social and political [[sexual equality|equality]] with men, and to control of their [[reproductive health]], and an end to [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-fgm-maputoprotocol.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Maputo Protocol of the African Union |author=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) |date=6 March 2015 |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against women==

===United Nations Declaration===
The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was adopted by the United Nations in 1993. It defines [[violence against women]] as "''any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 – Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women – UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|author=United Nations General Assembly|work=un-documents.net|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution established that women have a right to be free from violence. As a consequence of the resolution, in 1999, the General Assembly declared the day of 25 November to be the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].

Article 2 of The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women outlines several forms of violence against women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article Two:
Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following:

:(a)   Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [[Battery (crime)|battering]], sexual abuse of female children in the household, [[dowry]]-related violence, [[marital rape]], [[female genital mutilation]] and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]];
:(b)   Physical, sexual and [[psychological abuse|psychological violence]] occurring within the general community, including [[rape]], [[sexual abuse]], [[sexual harassment]] and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] in women and [[forced prostitution]];
:(c)   Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Istanbul Convention===
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, is the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of domestic violence and violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau des Traités |url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG |title=Liste complète |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries which ratify it must ensure that the forms of violence defined in its text are outlawed. In its Preamble, the Convention states that "the realisation of ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women". The Convention also provides a definition of [[domestic violence]] as "all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim".&lt;ref name="Istanbul"/&gt; Although it is a Convention of the [[Council of Europe]], it is open to accession by any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221131635/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rape and sexual violence ===

{{main|Rape|War rape|Violence against women}}
Rape, sometimes called [[sexual assault]], is an assault by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with or [[sexual penetration]] of another person without that person's [[consent]]. Rape is generally considered a serious [[sex crime]] as well as a civil assault. When part of a widespread and systematic practice, rape and [[sexual slavery]] are now recognised as a [[crime against humanity]] as well as a [[war crime]]. Rape is also now recognised as a form of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group.

==== As genocide ====
{{main|Rwandan genocide}}
In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] established by the United Nations made landmark decisions that rape is a crime of [[genocide]] under [[international law]]. The trial of [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]], the mayor of Taba Commune in Rwanda, established precedents that rape is an element of the crime of genocide. The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. The Trial Chamber held that rape, which it defined as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive", and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide.&lt;ref&gt;''The Prosecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu (Trial Judgement)'', ICTR-96-4-T, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), 2 September 1998, [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,ICTR,,,40278fbb4,0.html p. 166] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012031344/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CICTR%2C%2C%2C40278fbb4%2C0.html |date=12 October 2012 }} ¶.733. Available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/40278fbb4.html [accessed 13 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Navanethem Pillay]] said in a statement after the verdict: "From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as one of the [[Wartime sexual violence|spoils of war]]. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war."&lt;ref name=paulwalters&gt;[[Navanethem Pillay]] is quoted by Professor Paul Walters in his presentation of her honorary [[doctorate of law]], [[Rhodes University]], April 2005 {{cite web |url=http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001193848/http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc |archivedate=1 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 500,000 women were raped during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.nz/web/pages/home.nsf/0/e57ea3f05f6aa848cc256e460012f365?OpenDocument Violence Against Women: Worldwide Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212040642/http://www.amnesty.org.nz/web/pages/home.nsf/0/e57ea3f05f6aa848cc256e460012f365?OpenDocument |date=12 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== As a crime against humanity ====
{{main|Crimes against humanity}}
The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognises rape, [[sexual slavery]], [[enforced prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" as a [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive&amp;nbsp;– A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", p. 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] also condemn systematic rape as well as murder, [[sexual slavery]], and forced pregnancy, as the "violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law." and require a particularly effective response.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Section II, paragraph 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape was first recognised as a [[crime against humanity]] when the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] issued arrest warrants based on the [[Geneva Conventions]] and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in [[Foča|Foca]] (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread [[gang rape]], torture, and [[sexual enslavement]] by [[Bosnian Serb]] soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992.&lt;ref name="haverford"&gt;[http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html Rape as a Crime Against Humanity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212122926/http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of [[torture]] and [[enslavement]] as a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name="haverford"/&gt; The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] that rape and [[sexual enslavement]] are [[crimes against humanity]]. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH Bosnia and Herzegovina : Foca verdict&amp;nbsp;– rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907091105/http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH |date=7 September 2009 }}. 22 February 2001. [[Amnesty International]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of [[Bosniac]] (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in [[Foča|Foca]], eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of [[sexual enslavement]] for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently disappeared.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22/&gt;

===Forced marriage and slavery===
The 1956 [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery]] defines "institutions and practices similar to slavery" to include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/SupplementaryConventionAbolitionOfSlavery.aspx |title=Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

c) Any institution or practice whereby:
* (i) A woman, without the right to refuse, is promised or given in marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in kind to her parents, guardian, family or any other person or group; or
* (ii) The husband of a woman, his family, or his clan, has the right to transfer her to another person for value received or otherwise; or
* (iii) A woman on the death of her husband is liable to be inherited by another person;

The Istanbul Convention requires countries which ratify it to prohibit forced marriage (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32).&lt;ref name="Istanbul"/&gt;

===Trafficking Protocol===
The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] (also referred to as the ''Trafficking Protocol'' or ''UN TIP Protocol'') is a [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to the [[Convention against Transnational Organised Crime]]. It is one of the three [[Palermo protocols]]. Its purpose is defined at ''Article 2. Statement of purpose'' as: "(a) To prevent and combat trafficking in persons, paying particular attention to women and children; (b) To protect and assist the victims of such trafficking, with full respect for their human rights; and (c) To promote cooperation among States Parties in order to meet those objectives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf |title=United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime And The Protocols Thereto |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
