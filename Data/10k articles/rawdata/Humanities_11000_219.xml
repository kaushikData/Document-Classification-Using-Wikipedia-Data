'''Abū Manṣūr Muḥammad b. Muḥammad b. Maḥmūd al-Samarḳandī''' (853-944 CE; {{lang-fa|محمد بن محمد بن محمود أبو منصور ماتریدی سمرقندی حنفی}}), often referred to as '''Abū Manṣūr al-Māturīdī''' for short, or reverently as '''Imam Māturīdī''' by [[Sunni Muslims]], was a [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] [[fiqh|jurist]], [[aqidah|theologian]], and [[tafsir|scriptural exegete]] from ninth-century [[Samarkand]] who became the eponymous codifier of one of the principal [[Orthodox Islam|orthodox]] schools of [[kalam|Sunni theology]], the [[Maturidi]] school,&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; which became the dominant theological school for Sunni Muslims in [[Central Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; and later enjoyed a preeminent status as the school of choice for both the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to [[Ashari|Ashʿarī]] (d. 936), the founder of one of the other major orthodox Sunni theological schools, Maturidi adhered to the doctrine of [[Abu Hanifa|Abū Ḥanīfa]] (d. 772) as transmitted and elaborated by the Hanafi theologians of [[Balkh]] and [[Transoxania]].&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this theology which Maturidi systematized and used to refute not only the opinions of the [[Mutazilites]], the Karrāmites, and other heterodox groups, but also non-Muslim theologies such as those of [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], [[Miaphysitism]], [[Manichaeanism]], [[Marcionism]], and [[Bardaisan|Bardaisanism]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Vajda, ''Le témoignage d’al-Māturīdī sur la doctrine des Manichéens, des Daysanites et des Marcionites'', in ''Arabica'', xii [1966], 1-38, 113-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Maturidi's epithet or ''nisba'' refers to Māturīd (or Māturīt), a locality in Samarkand.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Al‑Maturidi was born at Maturid, a village or quarter in the neighbourhood of [[Samarkand]]. He came from the renowned family of abu Ayyub al‑Ansari of Madinah. This statement is also corroborated by the fact that some other [[Arab]] families of Madinah also settled in [[Samarkand]].&lt;ref&gt;Al Maturidi, Kitab al Tauhid, MS. Cambridge, fol. 1, footnote al Sayyid Murtada, Sharh Ihya' of al Ghazali, Cairo, 1893, Vol.II, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Relatively little is known about the life of Maturidi, as the sources available "do not read as biographies, but rather as lists of works that have been enlarged upon by brief statements on his personage and a few words of praise."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; What is evident, however, is that the theologian lived the life of a pure scholar, as "nothing indicates that he held any public office, nor that he possessed more disciples, popularity, or association with the Sāmānid court of Bukhārā than anyone else."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; It is accepted, moreover, that Maturidi had two principal teachers, namely Abū Bakr al-Jūzjānī and Abū Naṣr Aḥmad b. al-ʿAbbās al-ʿIyāḍī (d. ca. 874-892), both of whom played significant roles in the shaping of Maturidi's theological views.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Maturidi is said to have lived the life of an ascetic (''zāhid''),&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and various sources attribute numerous [[miracles]] (''karāmāt'') to him.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Although he is not usually considered a [[Sufism|mystic]], it is nevertheless very possible that Maturidi had some interaction with the Sufis of his area, as "Hanafite theology in the region could not always be sharply separated from mystical tendencies,"&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the most important Hanafi jurists of the area were also Sufi mystics.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
Maturidi defined [[faith]] (''īmān'') as ''taṣdīḳ bi ’l-ḳalb'' or "inner assent, expressed by verbal confession (''ịḳrār bi ’l-lisān'')."&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; For Maturidi, moreover, [[Works (Islam)|works]] (''aʿmāl'') are not a part of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Maturidi held that "faith cannot decrease nor increase in substance, though it may be said to increase through renewal and repetition."&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maturidi supported using allegorical interpretation with respect to the anthropomorphic expressions in the [[Quran]], though he rejected many of the interpretations the Mutazilites would reach using this method.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, Maturidi espoused using the traditionalist ''bilā kayf'' method of reading scripture, which insisted on "unquestioning acceptance of the revealed text."&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; Maturidi further refuted the Mutazilites in his defense of the [[Attributes of God]] "as real and eternally subsisting" in the Essence of God (''ḳāʾima bi ’l-d̲h̲āt'').&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; His chief theological divergence from Ashʿarī was that he held the attributes of essence and action to be "equally eternal and subsistent in the Divine Essence."&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "he insisted that the expressions 'God is eternally the Creator' and 'God has been creating from eternity (''lam yazal k̲h̲āliḳan'')' are equally valid, even though the created world is temporal."&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Maturidi staunchly defended the [[Beatific Vision]] (''ruʾya'', literally "vision [of God]") against the Mutazilites, but "consistently rejected the possibility of ''idrāk'', which he understood as grasping, of God by the eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
When Maturidi was growing up there was an emerging reaction&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. A. (1994). ''The word of Islam''. London: Thames and Hudson. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; against some schools within Islam, notably [[Mu'tazili]]s, [[Qarmati]], and [[Shi'a]]. The [[Sunni]] scholars were following [[Abu Hanifa]]. Maturidi, with other two preeminent scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Ali, A. (1963). Maturidism. In Sharif, p. 260. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote especially on the creed of Islam and elaborated [[Abu Hanifa]]'s doctrine, the other two being [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] in Iraq, and [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi]] in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, A. (1963). Maturidism. In Sharif, p. 259. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Al-Ash'ari]] and [[Al-Tahawi]] were Sunni together with Maturidi, they constructed their own theologies diverging slightly from [[Abu Hanifa]]'s school. [[Al-Ash'ari]], enunciated that God creates the individual's power (qudra), will, and the actual act&lt;ref&gt;Gimaret, D. (1980). ''The´ories de L’Acte Humain en The´ologie Musulmane''. Paris: J. Vrin.&lt;/ref&gt; giving way to a [[fatalist]] school of theology, which was later put in a consolidated form by [[Al Ghazali]].&lt;ref&gt;Hye, M. A. (1963). Ash'arism. In Sharif, p. 226. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz.&lt;/ref&gt; Maturidi, followed in [[Abu Hanifa]]'s footsteps, and presented the "notion that God was the creator of man’s acts, although man possessed his own capacity and will to act".&lt;ref&gt;Shah, M. (2006). Later Developments. In Meri, J. W. (Ed.),''Medieval Islamic civilization: an encyclopedia'', (Vol. 1), (p. 640). New York:Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Maturidi and [[Al-Ash'ari]] also separated from each other in the issue of the attributes of God,&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, S. C.(2006). Sunni Theological Schools. In Meri, J. W. (Ed.),''Medieval Islamic civilization: an encyclopedia'', (Vol. 1), (p. 809). New York:Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some other minor issues.

Later, with the impact of [[Persianate society|Persianate]] states such as [[Great Seljuq Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, A. (2004). Ash'arites, Ash'aria. In Martin, R. C. et al. (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'', (Vol. 1), (pp. 83-84). New York: Macmillan Reference USA&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ottoman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;DeWeese, D. (2004). Central Asian Culture and Islam. In Martin, R. C. et al. (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'', (Vol. 1), (p. 139). New York: Macmillan Reference USA&lt;/ref&gt; Hanafi-Maturidi school spread to greater areas where the [[Hanafi]] school of law is prevalent, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Balkan]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Caucasus]] and [[Turkey]].

Maturidi had immense knowledge of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] beliefs (Sanawiyya) and of other [[Iranian religions|old Persian religions]]. His ''Kitāb al-Tawḥīd'' in this way has become a primary source for modern researchers with its rich materials about Iranian [[Manicheanism]] (Mâniyya), a group of [[Brahmans]] (Barähima), and some controversial personalities such as [[Ibn al-Rawandi]], [[Abu Isa al-Warraq]], and [[Muhammad b. Shabib]].&lt;ref&gt;See G. Vajda, "Le Témoignage d'al-Maturidi sur la doctrine des manichéens, des daysanites et des rnarcionites", Arabica, 13 (1966), pp. 1-38; Guy Mannot, "Matoridi et le manichéisme", Melanges de l'Institut Dominicain d'Etudes Orientales de Caire, 13 (1977), pp. 39-66; Sarah Stroumsa, "The Barahima in Early Kalam", Jarusalem Studies In Arable and Islam, 6 (1985), pp. 229-241; [[Josef van Ess]], "al-Farabi and Ibn al-Rewandi", Hamdard Islamicus, 3/4 (Winter 1980), pp. 3-15; J. Meric Pessagno, "The Reconstruction of the Thought of Muhammad Ibn Shabib", Journal of American Oriental Society, 104/3 (1984), pp. 445-453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isam.org.tr/documents%5C_dosyalar%5C_pdfler%5Cislam_arastirmalari_dergisi%5Csayi01%5C019_029.pdf The Authenticity of the Manuscript of Maturidi's Kitäb al-Tawhid]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by M. Sait Özervarli, 1997. (Retrieved on: 23 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and veneration==
Although there was in the medieval period "a tendency to suppress Maturidi's name and to put Ashʿarī forward as the champion of Islam against all heretics,"&lt;ref&gt;''Macdonald, D. B., “Māturīdī”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936)'', Edited by M. Th. Houtsma, T.W. Arnold, R. Basset, R. Hartmann.&lt;/ref&gt; except in [[Transoxiana]], Maturidism gradually "came to be widely recognised as the second orthodox Sunni theological school besides" Ashʿarīsm.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “Māturīdiyya”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; It is evident from the surviving fifteenth-century accounts of Maturidi's tomb in the cemetery of Jākardīza in Samarkand that the theologian's tomb was  "visited ... and held in honor for a long time" throughout the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; This veneration of the theologian seems to have arisen out of traditions preserved by several later scholars which detailed Maturidi's wisdom and spiritual abilities. For example, Abul Muīn al-Nasafī (d. 1114) stated that Maturidi's spiritual gifts were "immeasurably plentiful"&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and that "God singled him out with miracles (''kāramāt''), gifts of grace (''mawāhib''), divine assistance (''tawfiq''), and guidance (''irshād'', ''tashdīd'')."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rudolph, ''Al-Māturīdī and the Development of Sunnī Theology in Samarqand'', trans. Rodrigo Adem (Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2015), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]], however, tends to be very critical of Maturidi's legacy in Sunni Islam due to their aversion towards using any rational thought in matters of [[aqidah|theology]], which they deem to be heretical,&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; despite this antagonism being a position that conflicts with the consensus of Sunnism throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David, “Al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Christian-Muslim Relations 600 - 1500'', General Editor David Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is often said that mainstream "orthodox Sunnism" constitutes the followers of the theological traditions of Maturidi and Ashʿarī,&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, D. B., “Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936)'', Edited by M. Th. Houtsma, T.W. Arnold, R. Basset, R. Hartmann.&lt;/ref&gt;  while Salafism and Wahhabism have often been interpreted by the proponents of the two major schools to be minority splinter theological traditions opposed to the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., “al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David, “Al-Māturīdī”, in: ''Christian-Muslim Relations 600 - 1500'', General Editor David Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the minor theoretical differences between the theological formulations of Maturidi and Ashʿarī are often deemed by their respective followers to be superficial rather than real,&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, D. B., “Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936)'', Edited by M. Th. Houtsma, T.W. Arnold, R. Basset, R. Hartmann.&lt;/ref&gt;  whence "the two schools are equally orthodox" in traditional Sunnism.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, D. B., “Māturīdī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936)'', Edited by M. Th. Houtsma, T.W. Arnold, R. Basset, R. Hartmann.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional Sunni point of view is summarized in the words of the twentieth-century Islamic publisher Munīr ʿAbduh Agha, who stated: "There is not much [doctrinal] difference between the Ashʿarīs and Māturīdīs, hence both groups are now called People of the Sunna and the Community."&lt;ref&gt;Munīr ʿAbduh Agha, ''Namudhaj min al-A`mal al-Khayriyya'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5623">'''Alison Frantz''' (27 September 1903&amp;nbsp;– 1 February 1995) was an archaeological photographer and a [[Byzantine]] scholar. With degrees in Classical and Byzantine Studies, she traveled to Greece where she joined the Athenian Agora Excavations. She was the Agora's official photographer and is especially renowned for her photographs of Greek sculpture. As an archaeologist, she contributed to a better understanding and appreciation of the post-classical layers of the Agora excavations with publications on the Byzantine and Ottoman material.

== Education ==
Alison Frantz completed her undergraduate degree in Classics at [[Smith College]] in 1924 and continued her graduate studies at the [[Columbia University]] where she focused on the study of the Byzantine period.&lt;ref name=McCredie&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCredie|first=James R.|title=Biographical Memoirs: Alison Frantz|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|date=June 2000|volume=144|issue=2|pages=213–217|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/Frantz.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102094950/http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/Frantz.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Frantz started her career in the Athenian Agora Excavations in 1934, as an assistant of [[Lucy Talcott]] in the Record Department. Frantz had been fascinated by photography from a young age, seeing her brother developing photographs in his dark room, and soon she turned to archaeological photography.&lt;ref name=Rotroff&gt;{{cite book|last=Rotroff|first=Susan|title=Women in the Athenian Agora|year=2006|publisher=The American School of Classical Studies at Athens|location=Athens|isbn=978-0-87661-644-4|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started helping Herman Wagner, the official photographer of the Agora and by 1939 she became the official photographer. Just before the Second World War, Frantz was charged with the task to photograph in two days more than six hundred tablets of [[Linear B]], discovered by the famous American archaeologists [[Carl Blegen]] in the Mycenaean palace of [[Pylos]]. It was largely these photographs that facilitated the decipherment of the Linear B script by [[Michael Ventris]].&lt;ref name="McCredie"/&gt;

== The war years (1940–45) ==
During the Second World War, Frantz worked closely with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and kept Washington informed about the political and military situation in Greece. After the war, she became a cultural attaché of the United States Embassy in Athens and worked to establish the Fulbright program in Greece.&lt;ref name=McCredie2&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCredie|first=James R.|title=Biographical Memoirs: Alison Frantz|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|date=June 2000|volume=144|issue=2|pages=215–216|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/Frantz.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102094950/http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/Frantz.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main contribution ==
Her main contribution in the field of archaeology and history of the Athenian Agora was that she insisted on a diachronic exploration of archaeological sites. In the case of the Athenian Agora excavations, she focused her interest in recording and studying the post-classical periods, especially Late Antiquity and Byzantium.&lt;ref name=McCredie2/&gt; She was one of the first scholars to publish on the Byzantine and Ottoman collection of finds from the Agora. She also worked closely with [[John Travlos]] to restore the Church of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles, Athens|Holy Apostles]], the only Byzantine monument still standing today in the Athenian Agora.

As a photographer, Frantz captured with her camera 25 years (1939–64) of discoveries, people and archaeological life in the Athenian Agora. Her talent for archaeological photography was widely recognized and she traveled all around the Mediterranean, photographing archaeological sites and especially Greek sculpture. She is most famous for her photographs of the [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze]] and of the sculptures of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.&lt;ref name=Rotroff2&gt;{{cite book|last=Rotroff|first=Susan|title=Women in the Athenian Agora|year=2006|publisher=The American School of Classical Studies at Athens|location=Athens|isbn=978-0-87661-644-4|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[phonetics]], '''aspiration''' is the strong burst of [[breathing|breath]] that accompanies either the release or, in the case of [[preaspiration]], the closure of some [[obstruent]]s. In English, aspirated consonants are [[allophone]]s in [[complementary distribution#In phonology|complementary distribution]] with their unaspirated counterparts, but in some other languages, notably most [[Languages of India|Indian]] and [[East Asian languages]], the difference is [[Contrastive distribution#Phonology|contrastive]], while in [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], all stops are aspirated.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

To feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of one's mouth, and say ''spin'' {{IPA|[spɪn]}} and then ''pin'' {{IPA|[pʰɪn]}}. One should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with ''pin'' that one does not get with ''spin''.

==Transcription==
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for [[voicelessness|voiceless consonants]] followed by the [[Phonetic symbols in Unicode#Spacing Modifier Letters (U+02B0–02FF)|aspiration modifier letter]] {{angbr|{{IPA|◌ʰ}}}}, a [[subscript and superscript|superscript form]] of the symbol for the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{angbr|{{IPA|h}}}}. For instance, {{angbr|{{IPA|p}}}} represents the voiceless [[bilabial stop]], and {{angbr|{{IPA|pʰ}}}} represents the aspirated bilabial stop.

[[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced consonants]] are seldom actually aspirated. Symbols for [[voice (phonetics)|voiced consonants]] followed by {{angbr|{{IPA|◌ʰ}}}}, such as {{angbr|{{IPA|bʰ}}}}, typically represent consonants with [[murmured voice]]d release (see [[#Breathy-voiced release|below]]). In the [[shiksha|grammatical tradition]] of [[Sanskrit]], aspirated consonants are called '''voiceless aspirated''', and breathy-voiced consonants are called '''voiced aspirated'''.

There are no dedicated IPA symbols for degrees of aspiration and typically only two degrees are marked: unaspirated {{angbr|{{IPA|k}}}} and aspirated {{angbr|{{IPA|kʰ}}}}. [[Obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet|An old symbol]] for light aspiration was {{angbr|{{IPA|ʻ}}}}, but this is now obsolete. The aspiration modifier letter may be doubled to indicate especially strong or long aspiration. Hence, the two degrees of aspiration in Korean stops are sometimes transcribed {{angbr|{{IPA|kʰ kʰʰ}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|kʻ}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|kʰ}}}}, but they are usually transcribed {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[kʰ]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor1-last=Ladefoged |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-link=Peter Ladefoged |editor2=Barbara Blankenship
|editor3=Russell G. Schuh |title=Korean |url=http://archive.phonetics.ucla.edu/Language/KOR/kor.html |website= UCLA Phonetics Archive |date=21 April 2009 |accessdate=20 February 2015 }} word lists from [http://archive.phonetics.ucla.edu/Language/KOR/kor_word-list_1977_01.html 1977], [http://archive.phonetics.ucla.edu/Language/KOR/kor_word-list_1966_01.html 1966], [http://archive.phonetics.ucla.edu/Language/KOR/kor_word-list_1975_01.html 1975].&lt;/ref&gt; with the details of voice onset time given numerically.

Preaspirated consonants are marked by placing the aspiration modifier letter before the consonant symbol: {{angbr|{{IPA|ʰp}}}} represents the preaspirated bilabial stop.

'''Unaspirated''' or [[tenuis consonant]]s are occasionally marked with the modifier letter for unaspiration {{angbr|{{IPA|◌˭}}}}, a [[Unicode subscripts and superscripts|superscript]] [[equals sign]]: {{angbr|{{IPA|t˭}}}}. Usually, however, unaspirated consonants are left unmarked: {{angbr|{{IPA|t}}}}.

[[Voicelessness|Voiceless consonants]] are produced with the [[vocal folds]] open (spread) and not vibrating, and voiced consonants are produced when the vocal folds are fractionally closed and vibrating ([[modal voice]]). Voiceless aspiration occurs when the vocal folds remain open after a consonant is released. An easy way to measure this is by noting the consonant's [[voice onset time]], as the voicing of a following vowel cannot begin until the vocal folds close.

Phonetically in some languages, such as [[Navajo phonology|Navajo]], aspiration of stops tends to be realised as voiceless velar airflow; aspiration of affricates is realised as an extended length of the frication.

Aspirated consonants are not always followed by vowels or other voiced sounds. For example, in [[Eastern Armenian]], aspiration is contrastive even word-finally, and aspirated consonants occur in [[consonant cluster]]s. In [[Wahgi language|Wahgi]], consonants are aspirated only in final position.

===Degree===
The degree of aspiration varies: the voice onset time of aspirated stops is longer or shorter depending on the language or the place of articulation.

Armenian and [[Cantonese]] have aspiration that lasts about as long as English aspirated stops, in addition to unaspirated stops. Korean has lightly aspirated stops that fall between the Armenian and Cantonese unaspirated and aspirated stops as well as strongly aspirated stops whose aspiration lasts longer than that of Armenian or Cantonese. (See [[voice onset time]].)

Aspiration varies with [[place of articulation]]. The Spanish voiceless stops {{IPA|/p t k/}} have voice onset times (VOTs) of about 5, 10, and 30 milliseconds, whereas English aspirated {{IPA|/p t k/}} have VOTs of about 60, 70, and 80 ms. Voice onset time in Korean has been measured at 20, 25, and 50 ms for {{IPA|/p t k/}} and 90, 95, and 125 for {{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lisker and Abramson|title=A cross-language Study of Voicing in Initial Stops|journal=Word|date=1964|volume=20|pages=384–422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doubling===

When aspirated consonants are doubled or [[gemination|geminated]], the stop is held longer and then has an aspirated release. An aspirated affricate consists of a stop, fricative, and aspirated release. A doubled aspirated affricate has a longer hold in the stop portion and then has a release consisting of the fricative and aspiration.

===Preaspiration===
[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] have consonants with [[preaspiration]] {{IPA|[ʰp ʰt ʰk]}}, and some scholars{{who|date=April 2017}} interpret them as consonant clusters as well. In Icelandic, preaspirated stops [[Icelandic phonology#Aspiration and length contrasts (medial and final)|contrast with double stops and single stops]]:
* ''{{lang|is|kapp}}'' {{IPA|[kʰɑʰp]}} or {{IPA|[kʰɑhp]}} "zeal"

Preaspirated stops also occur in most [[Sami languages]]. For example, in [[Northern Sami]], the unvoiced stop and affricate phonemes {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} are pronounced preaspirated ({{IPA|[ʰp]}}, {{IPA|[ʰt]}} {{IPA|[ʰts]}}, {{IPA|[ʰtʃ]}}, {{IPA|[ʰk]}}) in medial or final position.

===Fricatives and sonorants===
Although most aspirated obstruents in the world's languages are stops and affricates, [[aspirated fricative]]s such as {{IPA|[sʰ]}}, {{IPA|[ɸʷʰ]}} or {{IPA|[ɕʰ]}} have been documented in [[Korean language|Korean]], though these are allophones of other phonemes. Similarly, aspirated fricatives and even aspirated nasals, approximants, and trills occur in a few [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], in some [[Oto-Manguean languages]], in the Hmongic language [[Hmu language|Hmu]], and in the Siouan language [[Ofo language|Ofo]]. Some languages, such as [[Choni language|Choni Tibetan]], have as many as four contrastive aspirated fricatives {{IPA|[sʰ]}} {{IPA|[ɕʰ]}}, {{IPA|[ʂʰ]}} and {{IPA|[xʰ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guillaume Jacques]] 2011. A panchronic study of aspirated fricatives, with new evidence from Pumi, ''Lingua'' 121.9:1518–1538 [https://www.academia.edu/968778/A_panchronic_study_of_aspirated_fricatives_with_new_evidence_from_Pumi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Voiced stop}}Voiced consonants with voiceless aspiration===
True aspirated voiced consonants, as opposed to [[murmured]] (breathy-voice) consonants such as the {{IPA|[bʱ], [dʱ], [ɡʱ]}} that are common in the languages of India, are extremely rare. They have been documented in [[Kelabit language|Kelabit]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Blust]], 2006, "The Origin of the Kelabit Voiced Aspirates: A Historical Hypothesis Revisited", ''Oceanic Linguistics'' 45:311&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taa language|Taa]], and the [[Kx'a languages]]. Reported aspirated voiced stops, affricates and clicks are {{IPA|[b͡pʰ, d͡tʰ, d͡tsʰ, d͡tʃʰ, ɡ͡kʰ, ɢ͡qʰ, ᶢʘʰ, ᶢǀʰ, ᶢǁʰ, ᶢǃʰ, ᶢǂʰ]}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Phonology==
Aspiration has varying significance in different languages. It is either allophonic or phonemic, and may be analyzed as an [[underlying representation|underlying]] consonant cluster.

===Allophonic===
{{listen

| filename     = En-us-pin spin bin nip nib.ogg
| title        = Labial stops

In some languages, such as English, aspiration is [[allophone|allophonic]]. Stops are distinguished primarily by [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]], and voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated, while voiced stops are usually unaspirated.

[[English language|English]] [[voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stops]] are aspirated for most native speakers when they are word-initial or begin a [[stressed syllable]], as in ''pill'', ''till'', ''kill''.

They are unaspirated for almost all speakers when immediately following word-initial s, as in ''spill'', ''still'', ''skill''. After an ''s'' elsewhere in a word they are normally unaspirated as well, except sometimes in compound words. When the consonants in a cluster like ''st'' are analyzed as belonging to different morphemes ([[wikt:heteromorphemic|heteromorphemic]]) the stop is aspirated, but when they are analyzed as belonging to one morpheme the stop is unaspirated.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} For instance, ''distend'' has unaspirated {{IPA|[t]}} since it is not analyzed as two morphemes, but ''distaste'' has an aspirated middle {{IPA|[tʰ]}} because it is analyzed as ''dis-'' + ''taste'' and the word ''taste'' has an aspirated initial ''t''.

Word-final voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated.

Voiceless stops in [[Pashto]] are slightly aspirated prevocalically in a stressed syllable.

===Phonemic===
In many languages, such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Lakota language|Lakota]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Indo-Aryan languages]], [[Dravidian languages]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Ancient Greek]], and the [[varieties of Chinese]], tenuis and aspirated consonants are [[phoneme|phonemic]]. Unaspirated consonants like {{IPA|[p˭ s˭]}} and aspirated consonants like {{IPA|[pʰ ʰp sʰ]}} are separate phonemes, and words [[distinctive feature|are distinguished]] by whether they have one or the other.

====Consonant cluster====
[[Alemannic German|Alemannic German dialects]] have unaspirated {{IPA|[p˭ t˭ k˭]}} as well as aspirated {{IPA|[pʰ tʰ kʰ]}}; the latter series are usually viewed as [[consonant cluster]]s.

====Tenseness====
In [[Danish language|Danish]] and most southern varieties of [[German language|German]], the [[Fortis and lenis|lenis]] consonants transcribed for historical reasons as {{angbr|{{IPA|b d ɡ}}}} are distinguished from their [[Fortis and lenis|fortis]] counterparts {{angbr|{{IPA|p t k}}}}, mainly in their lack of aspiration.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Standard Chinese]] (Mandarin) has stops and affricates distinguished by aspiration: for instance, {{IPA|/t tʰ/}}, {{IPA|/t͡s t͡sʰ/}}. In [[pinyin]], tenuis stops are written with letters that represent voiced consonants in English, and aspirated stops with letters that represent voiceless consonants. Thus ''d'' represents {{IPA|/t/}}, and ''t'' represents {{IPA|/tʰ/}}.

[[Wu Chinese]] and [[Southern Min]] has a three-way distinction in stops and affricates: {{IPA|/p pʰ b/}}. In addition to aspirated and unaspirated consonants, there is a series of ''muddy consonants'', like {{IPA|/b/}}. These are pronounced with [[slack voice|slack]] or [[breathy voice]]: that is, they are weakly voiced. Muddy consonants as [[Syllable#Chinese|initial]] cause a syllable to be pronounced with low pitch or [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|''light'' (陽 ''yáng'') tone]].

}}
{{main|Indo-Aryan languages#Charts|Dravidian languages#Phonology}}
Many [[Indo-Aryan languages]] have aspirated stops. [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindustani language|Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] have a four-way distinction in stops: voiceless, aspirated, voiced, and breathy-voiced or voiced aspirated, such as {{IPA|/p pʰ b bʱ/}}. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] has lost breathy-voiced consonants, which resulted in a [[tone (linguistics)|tone system]], and therefore has a distinction between voiceless, aspirated, and voiced: {{IPA|/p pʰ b/}}.

Some of the [[Dravidian languages]], such as [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]], and [[Kannada language|Kannada]], have a distinction between voiced and voiceless, aspirated and unaspirated only in [[Indo-Aryan loanwords in Tamil|loanwords from Indo-Aryan languages]]. In native Dravidian words, there is no distinction between these categories and stops are [[underspecification|underspecified]] for voicing&lt;!-- Not true for Kannada and Telugu. --&gt; and aspiration.

}}
Most dialects of [[Armenian language|Armenian]] have aspirated stops, and some have breathy-voiced stops.

[[Classical Armenian|Classical]] and [[Eastern Armenian]] have a three-way distinction between voiceless, aspirated, and voiced, such as {{IPA|/t tʰ d/}}.

[[Western Armenian]] has a two-way distinction between aspirated and voiced: {{IPA|/tʰ d/}}. Western Armenian aspirated {{IPA|/tʰ/}} corresponds to Eastern Armenian aspirated {{IPA|/tʰ/}} and voiced {{IPA|/d/}}, and Western voiced {{IPA|/d/}} corresponds to Eastern voiceless {{IPA|/t/}}.

===Greek===
{{main|Ancient Greek phonology}}
Some forms of [[Greek language|Greek]] before the [[Koine Greek]] period are [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as having aspirated stops. The [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic dialect]] of [[Ancient Greek]] had a three-way distinction in stops like Eastern Armenian: {{IPA|/t tʰ d/}}. These series were called {{wikt-lang|grc|ψιλός|ψιλά}}, {{wikt-lang|grc|δασύς|δασέα}}, {{wikt-lang|grc|μέσος|μέσα}} (''psilá, daséa, mésa'') "smooth, rough, intermediate", respectively, by Koine Greek grammarians.

There were aspirated stops at three places of articulation: labial, coronal, and velar {{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ/}}. Earlier Greek, represented by [[Mycenaean Greek]], likely had a labialized velar aspirated stop {{IPA|/kʷʰ/}}, which later became labial, coronal, or velar depending on dialect and phonetic environment.

The other Ancient Greek dialects, [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], [[Doric Greek|Doric]], [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], and [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]], likely had the same three-way distinction at one point, but Doric seems to have had a fricative in place of {{IPA|/tʰ/}} in the Classical period, and the Ionic and Aeolic dialects sometimes lost aspiration ([[psilosis]]).

Later, during the Koine Greek period, the aspirated and voiced stops {{IPA|/tʰ d/}} of Attic Greek [[Lenition#Opening|lenited]] to voiceless and voiced fricatives, yielding {{IPA|/θ ð/}} in [[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] and [[Modern Greek]].

==Other uses==

===Debuccalization===
The term ''aspiration'' sometimes refers to the sound change of [[debuccalization]], in which a consonant is [[lenition|lenited]] (weakened) to become a [[glottal stop]] or [[voiceless glottal fricative|fricative]] {{IPA|[ʔ h ɦ]}}.

===Breathy-voiced release===
{{main|Murmured voice}}
So-called voiced aspirated consonants are nearly always pronounced instead with [[breathy voice]], a type of [[phonation]] or vibration of the [[vocal folds]]. The modifier letter {{angbr|{{IPA|◌ʰ}}}} after a voiced consonant actually represents a breathy-voiced or murmured dental stop, as with the "voiced aspirated" bilabial stop {{angbr|{{IPA|bʰ}}}} in the [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. This consonant is therefore more accurately transcribed as {{angbr|{{IPA|b̤}}}}, with the diacritic for breathy voice, or with the modifier letter {{angbr|{{IPA|bʱ}}}}, a superscript form of the symbol for the [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{angbr|{{IPA|ɦ}}}}.

Some linguists restrict the double-dot subscript {{angbr|{{IPA|◌̤}}}} to murmured [[sonorant]]s, such as [[vowel]]s and [[nasal consonant|nasals]], which are murmured throughout their duration, and use the superscript hook-aitch {{angbr|{{IPA|◌ʱ}}}} for the breathy-voiced release of obstruents.

The '''''Cena''''' or '''''Coena Cypriani''''' (i.e. "Feast of Cyprian") is an anonymous prose work written in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Abrantes 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition ascribes original authorship to the 3rd-century saint [[Cyprian]], bishop of [[Carthage]], but the text was probably written around 400.&lt;ref name="JQ"&gt;Johannes Quastern (ed.), ''Patrology: Volume II'', RCL, pp. 371-372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MVA1578"&gt;[[Michael von Albrecht]], ''A History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius'', Leiden: Brill, 1997, p. 1578&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a full consensus on this date: according to Arthur Lapôtre, it was written under the rule of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] (361-363).&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;Angelo Di Berardino (ed.), ''Patrology: Volume IV - The Golden Age of Latin Patristic Literature'', RCL, pp. 315-316&lt;/ref&gt; A wider range is advanced by Martha Bayless, who dates the work as possibly as late as the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Bayless, ''Parody in the Middle Ages: the Latin tradition'', University of Michigan Press, 1997, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text tells the story of a banquet held at [[Cana]], where a great king (i.e. God) invites many biblical figures to attend a wedding.&lt;ref name="JQ"/&gt; Interpretations of the intent of the work have often radically diverged: it has been viewed both as a didactic work, albeit an unusual one, and as an example of biblical parody.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bayless 1997, pp. 22-24&lt;/ref&gt; In Bayless' words, it should be read as an "allegory parodying allegoresis and biblical exegesis".&lt;ref name="MB10"&gt;M. Bayless 1997, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;       

While on linguistic grounds nobody argues anymore that Saint Cyprian is the author, attempts have been made to attribute the work to other authors. One of the first to study the piece carefully was [[Adolf von Harnack]], who argued for it having been written by the poet [[Cyprianus Gallus]] on the grounds of its using the ''[[Acta Pauli]]''. This view is endorsed by H. Brewer, but opposed by Willy Hass, who argues that Cyprianus and the ''Cena'' author made use of different versions of the Bible. Despite this, Hass agrees that on textual evidence the ''Cena'' it came from northern [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; A different attribution has been made by Lapôtre, who claimed the work to be a satire directed toward Julian the Apostate by the poet [[Bachiarius]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Bayless 1997, pp. 21-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was very popular in the Middle Ages to the point that it was read during the coronation of the [[carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] Emperor [[Charles the Bald]] in 875.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; Many retellings of the story were written in the Middle Ages, the earliest and best-known of which are in the 9th century by [[Johannes Hymonides]] and [[Rabanus Maurus]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Bayless 1997, pp. 215-216&lt;/ref&gt; 

54 manuscripts of the work survive, the oldest from the 9th century.&lt;ref name="MB10"/&gt; The work was [[Editio princeps|first printed]] in 1564 in a collection of the works of Cyprian of Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Christine Modesto, Studien zur Cena Cypriani und zu deren Rezeption, Gunter Narr Verlag, 1992, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cena'' has had a recent return to fame due to its role in the novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]].&lt;ref name="MVA1578"/&gt;

'''''Chitrochor''''' (English title : Picture Imperfect) is a 1951 [[Bengali language|Bengali]] detective novella, written by [[Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay]]. This story features the famous fictional Bengali [[private investigator]] [[Byomkesh Bakshi]], his assistant-cum-friend Ajit Bandyopadhyay and his wife Satyabati. This place takes place in a picturesque town in the border of north Bengal. This story has been adapted as a film, known as [[Abar Byomkesh]] in 2012, featuring [[Abir Chatterjee]] as Byomkesh Bakshi, and [[Saswata Chatterjee]] as Ajit Bandopadhay.

==Plot==
Byomkesh had fallen critically ill and is being nursed back to health by his wife, Satyabati, and dear friend, Ajit . On medical advice, Byomkesh goes to Dooars to recuperate with his two caring companions. He takes a decided turn for the better with the change in climate, much to the relief of Satyabati and Ajit.

But, as fate would have it, mystery arrives. At Dooars, Byomkesh meets Bengali inhabitants from the local community, including Dr. Ashwini Ghatak, Prof. Adinath Shome, Mahidhar Chaudhury, photographer Nakuleshwar, police officer Purander Pandey, deputy magistrate Umanath Ghosh  and banker Amaresh Raha. They have a get-together at the residence of Mahidhar Chaudhary, where everybody is regaled by the singing of Mahidhar's young daughter Rajani .

The flow of the party is somewhat interrupted by the sudden arrival of Falguni Pal, a poor artist, who has the rare talent of painting anyone's portrait after seeing his subject for only a few minutes. In passing, Mahidhar reports that a robbery had taken place at his house a couple of days back. The thief, however, had ignored all of Mahidhar's riches and stolen only a group photograph of Mahidhar with the other Bengali neighbours. Adding to the odd nature of the situation is that all the others who had a copy of that photograph seem to have misplaced or lost the same. The issue is apparently trivial, but, nonetheless, intrigues the ever-alert Byomkesh.

Matters take a more serious turn when there is yet another attempted robbery, this time, at the house of the deputy magistrate, Umanath Ghosh. Falguni Pal, the artist, is murdered in cold blood.

In yet another twist, Byomkesh finds out that both Adinath Shome and Ashwini Ghatak are romantically inclined towards the beautiful Rajani.

The strange disappearance of that one photograph leads Byomkesh to believe that someone is trying to remove all evidence of his presence in the locality. And after a series of hits and misses, Byomkesh finds out the killer to be the banker, Amaresh Jha. He was trying to flee with the bank's money and used a fake beard, while in the group photograph he was not wearing it. He stole those photographs and killed Falguni as he drew Amaresh's sketch when he was not in his beard. But, to escape jail, he commits suicide in the local station in the presence of Byomkesh and some others. This was most disgusting to Byomkesh as he wanted to catch hold of him alive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4142">'''Cognitive [[philology]]''' is the [[science]] that studies written and oral texts as the product of human mental processes. Studies in cognitive philology compare documentary evidence emerging from textual investigations with results of experimental research, especially in the fields of cognitive and ecological psychology, neurosciences and artificial intelligence. "The point is not the text, but the mind that made it". Cognitive Philology aims to foster communication between literary, textual, philological disciplines on the one hand and researches across the whole range of the cognitive, evolutionary, ecological and human sciences on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cognitive Philology|url=http://ojs.uniroma1.it/index.php/cogphil|website=DigiLab, Servizi di publishing digitale|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive philology: 

* investigates transmission of oral and written text, and categorization processes which lead to classification of knowledge, mostly relying on the [[information theory]];
* studies how [[narrative]]s emerge in so called natural conversation and selective process which lead to the rise of literary standards for storytelling, mostly relying on embodied [[semantic]]s;
* explores the evolutive and evolutionary role played by [[rhythm]] and [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] in human ontogenetic and phylogenetic development and the pertinence of the semantic association during processing of cognitive maps;
* Provides the scientific ground for multimedia [[Textual criticism | critical editions]] of literary texts.

 
Among the founding thinkers and noteworthy scholars devoted to such investigations are:

'''Corpus Coranicum''' is a research project of the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] towards a [[critical edition]] of the [[Quran]].

Begun in 2007, the initial three-year [[database]] project is led by [[Middle Eastern studies|Semitic and Arabic studies]] Prof. [[Angelika Neuwirth]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. The project is currently funded till 2025, but could well take longer to complete.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;Andrew Higgins and Almut Schoenfeld, "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120008793352784631 The Lost Archive: Missing for a half century, a cache of photos spurs sensitive research on Islam's holy text]", ''Wall Street Journal'', 12 January 2008. Retrieved 2010-02-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and methodology==
The project will document the [[Quran]] in its handwritten form and oral tradition, and include an extensive commentary interpreting the text in the context of its [[History of the Quran|historical development]].&lt;ref name="bbawcc"&gt;[http://www.bbaw.de/bbaw/Forschung/Forschungsprojekte/Coran/de/Startseite Corpus Coranicum], retrieved 2010-02-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the Corpus Coranicum source material consists of photographs of ancient Quran manuscripts collected before [[World War II]] by [[Gotthelf Bergsträsser]] and [[Otto Pretzl]]. After the [[Royal Air Force|British RAF]] on 24 April 1944 bombarded the building where they were housed, [[Islamic studies|Arabic studies]] scholar [[Anton Spitaler]] claimed the photograph collection had been destroyed. Towards the end of his life, however, he confessed to Neuwirth that he had hidden the photos for almost half a century, and Neuwirth assumed responsibility for the archive.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

The project's research director, [[Michael Marx (Arabist)|Michael Marx]], told ''Der Spiegel'' that the Quran did not arise in a vacuum, as for the sake of simplicity some western researchers had supposed. The Arabian peninsula in the 7th century was exposed to the great [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Persian Empire]]s as well as the ideas of [[Gnosticism]], [[early Christianity]], the ideals of ancient [[Arabic poetry]] and the ideas of [[Talmud|rabbinic Judaism]]. Only in light of this world of ideas, Marx added, "can the innovations of the Quran be clearly seen,"&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;Yassin Musharbash, "[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,514628,00.html Die Klimaforscher des Korans]" ("Climate researchers of the Quran") in ''Der Spiegel'', 1 November 2007. Retrieved 2010-002-07.&lt;/ref&gt; and while parallels exist with non-Quranic texts, "it is not a copy-and-paste job."&lt;ref name="muss"&gt;[http://www.muslimische-stimmen.de/uploads/media/Interview_Michael_Marx_Vollversion.pdf Interview with Michael Marx], ''Muslimische Stimmen'' (German, 440 kB) 14 May 2008. Retrieved 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

One goal is to distinguish between the manuscript and orally transmitted readings of the Quran, and to document both traditions online. Secondly, a database of international texts (including pre-Quranic and Judeo-Christian texts)&lt;ref name="ccwel"&gt;"[http://pomdev.bbaw.de:10080/Koranplone/welcome-to-the-corpus-coranicum/ Corpus Coranicum prospectus]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". Retrieved 2010-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt; will place the development of the Quran in the context of its spatial and temporal environment and foster better understanding among Westerners. The third part of the project is to create a commentary focusing not only on individual problems but also including [[Form criticism|form-critical analyses]]. The commentary is constructed discursively, taking note of earlier opinions and research on the Quran.

==Student Humanities Laboratory==
In April 2008, [[Yvonne Pauly]] wrote that the academy's Student Humanities Laboratory had created a teaching unit on Quranic research, declaring: "While the Quran is religiously, culturally and politically influential, it is also controversial, though the heated debate surrounding the text often stands in contrast to an actual knowledge of its contents."&lt;ref name="bbawpr"&gt;"[http://www.bbaw.de/bbaw/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Artikel.html?id=101 Den Koran verstehen lernen]", press release, 2 April 2008. Retrieved 2010-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the example of one of the shorter ''[[sura]]s'', teenagers would explore the text through the tools of modern [[philology]] while experiencing it aurally and through [[Arabic calligraphy|calligraphy]] as well, with the aim of increasing the students' curiosity and scientific interest in the humanities during their transition to university.&lt;ref name="bbawpr" /&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2007 journalist-publisher [[Frank Schirrmacher]] wrote an article for the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] suggesting that the Academy's preparation of a historically critical Quran edition had been motivated by Pope [[Benedict XVI]]'s ill-received [[Regensburg lecture]] of 2006 and predicting that the Corpus Coranicum would spark similar outrage among Muslims, comparing it to the punishment of [[Prometheus]] for bringing fire to mankind. He was enthusiastic that the fruits of their research might even "overthrow rulers and topple kingdoms".&lt;ref name="schirr"&gt;Frank Schirrmacher, [http://www.faz.net/s/Rub1DA1FB848C1E44858CB87A0FE6AD1B68/Doc~EF45C091EE4FB4301A324E84D222613AF~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html "Bücher können Berge versetzen"] ("Books can move mountains"), ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' Bücher, 10 October 2007. Retrieved 2010-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx promptly called the [[Al-Jazeera]] television network to deny any attempt to attack Islamic tenets.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

Angelika Neuwirth demurred: "It would be quite wrong to claim triumphantly that we had found the key to the Quran and that Muslims for 14 long centuries had not." Instead, she and her colleagues have chosen a nonconfrontational approach that includes regular dialogue with the Islamic world&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt; and aims "to give the Quran the same attention as the [[Bible]]."&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

Michael Marx, Neuwirth and [[Nicolai Sinai]] spiritedly defended the project, writing that negative reaction to the papal speech should not be equated with [[Islam]]ic hostility towards a [[textual criticism|historical-textual]] or [[philology|philological]] approach to the Quran.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;Michael Marx, Angelika Neuwirth and Nicolai Sinai, [http://www.faz.net/s/RubCF3AEB154CE64960822FA5429A182360/Doc~E35504EE5AAC94B2C8E28D9EE7E7F925B~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html "Koran, aber in Kontext &amp;mdash; Eine Replik"] ("The Quran, but in context &amp;mdash; a reply"), ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'',  6 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, they asserted, classical commentaries within the Islamic tradition are concerned with the "occasions of revelation" (''asbâb an-nuzûl'') of particular ''[[sura]]s'', while Islamic literature discussing alternative interpretations of the Qur'an &amp;mdash; "a sort of textual criticism ''avant la lettre''" &amp;mdash; can fill library shelves.

In discussions with Iranian, Arab and Turkish scholars in [[Tehran]], [[Qom]], [[Damascus]], [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], [[Rabat]], [[Cairo]] and [[Istanbul]] Marx, Neuwirth and Sinai had contended that even if one considered the Quran as the literal words of God, a contextual reading as a legitimate subject of historical inquiry could create a climate of healthy inquiry and debate among Islamic and non-Islamic researchers alike. The trio's letter also pointed out that the Corpus Coranicum project was in any case not directed to [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]]s, but to Germans and other Europeans.&lt;ref name="context" /&gt;

Sites of the ancient [[Maya civilization]] deteriorate as a result of both environmental and human factors.  [[archeologist|Archaeologists]] consider a number of different factors in evaluation site formation processes, site preservation, and site destruction. Deterioration from looting and defacement can destroy vital information. The natural forces of [[reforestation]] and [[erosion]] can also degrade archeological sites.

== Causes ==

===Biodegradation===
[[Limestone]] is the dominant material used in Maya architecture, in large part due to its abundance in the region. However, it is a relatively soft stone that can deteriorate easily.  [[Microorganism]]s on the surface of the limestone create acids that slowly eat away at the stone, creating cracks, fissures and weak points.  Over time, [[biofilm]]s can completely erode the stone.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez-Pompa 2003: 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sites are especially prone to the effects of [[Yucatan Peninsula|Yucatan’s]] climate, lending to [[biodegradation]]&lt;ref&gt;Gómez-Pompa 2003: 179&lt;/ref&gt; due to a warm, humid and generally [[equatorial climate]].  Sites in the [[Guatemalan highlands]] and in [[Chiapas]] enjoy more alpine and subalpine habitats, with elevations 2600–2800 meters above sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;Duellman 1966: 708&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these sites are less likely to experience biodegradation to the degree that hotter, wetter subtropical climates of the lowland sites do.

=== Rising sea levels ===
[[Rising sea levels]] have submerged a number of different sites, such as Stingray Lagoon and Wild Cane Cay, in [[Belize]].&lt;ref&gt;Mckillop 1995: 214&lt;/ref&gt; At Stingray Lagoon, artifacts related to the production of salt, including pottery used to boil down brine, a process known as ''sal cocida'', were found underwater .&lt;ref&gt;Mckillop 1995: 221&lt;/ref&gt;   Evidence suggests Wild Cane Cay,  was used as a trading post with deposits submerged about a meter underwater dating from both the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic]] and [[Mesoamerican chronology|Post Classic]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Mckillop 1995: 216&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly submerged remains extend about a meter to a meter and a half in depth at other sites in the [[Port Honduras Marine Reserve|Port Honduras]], suggesting a dramatically different environment at the time of occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Mckillop 1995: 219&lt;/ref&gt;  The speed at which a site becomes inundated can have major effects on the condition of the remains.  A gradual rise in water levels partially exposes the remains to erosion through the [[Coastal erosion|wave force]], and a fast rise in water levels could leave a completely submerged site relatively undamaged.&lt;ref&gt;Goggin 1960: 352&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result the condition of underwater remains and the amount of decay can infer insights into the location and the cause of its abandonment, however every site is different what can be true of one archeological site may not be true for another.

==== Intentional Human Destruction ====
There has been significant intentional destruction of sites through [[looting]]. Building materials used for the construction of [[New Spain|Colonial]]-era churches and other buildings were taken from Maya sites.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1993: 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Degradation of Maya sites due to human effects has increased due to [[tourism]].  In some cases, outright [[vandalism]], including [[graffiti]], has permanently altered remains.  In other cases, erosion due to overuse as thousands of tourists damages sites.

'''''Der Kontrabaß''''' ('''''The Double Bass''''') is a play by [[Patrick Süskind]]. The monologue in one act premiered in 1981.

== History ==
The manuscript of the play by [[Patrick Süskind]] dates back to 1980. The monologue in one act, the author's first work for the stage, premiered at the [[Cuvilliés Theatre]] in Munich on 22 September 1981 and was performed by [[Nikolaus Paryla]], who also directed. Thanks to its minimal staging requirements, the play was successfully reproduced at most German-language theatres. In the 1984–85 season, it was the play with the most performances on German language stages, playing more than 500 times.&lt;ref name="Wunderlich" /&gt;

Printed in 1984 by the [[Diogenes Verlag]],&lt;ref name="Diogenes en" /&gt; the play was translated into English by [[Michael Hofmann]] and published in 1987 by [[Hamish Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="Shelf" /&gt; This translation was awarded the [[Schlegel-Tieck Prize]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="Society" /&gt; The play also appeared in the [[Bloomsbury Classics]]&lt;ref name="Books" /&gt; series. It has been translated into 28 languages,&lt;ref name="Diogenes" /&gt; including Arabic, French, Russian, Serbian, Spanish and Turkish.&lt;ref name="Diogenes en" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shelf" /&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The play consists of an extended monologue delivered by a [[double bass]] player, who speaks to the audience in his small sound-proofed apartment while drinking beer. He is in his mid-thirties and is employed at a State Orchestra. At first he praises his instrument and its importance in the orchestra by telling anecdotes about its history and by actually playing it. With a considerable humour, he reveals more and more of his past and present rather than his current misery. He did not pick his instrument out of love and he never has company. He reveals too that once when his car broke down and stranded him and his instrument in the cold, he gave his coat to the bass, thereby adding to the image of a lonely man who realises that his performance is mediocre: {{Quote|Können Sie mir sagen, wieso ein Mann Mitte Dreißig, nämlich ich, mit einem Instrument zusammenlebt, das ihn permanent behindert?! Menschlich, gesellschaftlich, verkehrstechnisch, sexuell und musikalisch nur behindert?!&lt;ref name="Wunderlich" /&gt;}} {{quote|Tell me if you can why a grown man in his mid-thirties, namely me, should have to live with an instrument that's a constant handicap to him?! Humanly, socially, sexually, musically, in traffic – nothing but a handicap!&lt;ref name="Books" /&gt;}} The player dreams of chamber music, especially Schubert's [[Trout Quintet]]. He also dreams of approaching a young mezzo-soprano, Sarah, but fails to impress her by playing "eklatant schön" (strikingly beautifully). He imagines to win her attention by yelling her name at the festival premiere of [[Das Rheingold]] in the silence full of expectation before the soft beginning. When he leaves for the performance in concert dress, the end is open.&lt;ref name="Wunderlich" /&gt;

== Music examples ==
The narration is accompanied by extracts from the following pieces:
* Johannes Brahms: [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 2]]
* Richard Wagner: prelude to ''[[Die Walküre]]''
* [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf]]: Double bass concerto No. 2 in E major
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Overture of ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]''
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: ''È amore un ladroncello'', Aria of Dorabella from ''[[Così fan tutte]]''
* Franz Schubert: [[Trout Quintet]]

== Performance ==
Many actors have performed the one-man show successfully. [[Walter Renneisen]] has played the piece for more than 30 years, admitting that he is too old for the character, but still works on new nuances.&lt;ref name="Benz" /&gt;

==Theory==
Difference theory has roots in the studies of [[John Gumperz]], who examined differences in cross-cultural communication. While difference theory deals with cross-gender communication, the male and female genders are often presented as being two separate cultures, hence the relevance of Gumperz's studies. In her development of the difference theory, Deborah Tannen drew on the work of Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker, in particular their 1982 paper, ''A Cultural Approach to Male-Female Miscommunication'', which itself drew on the work of Gumperz.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland, ''Language and Gender: An advanced resource book'', pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Talbot makes reference to the term "gender-specific culture" in her critique of the difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and this idea of genders being culturally separated is embodied by the 1992 publication ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, ''Communication between Men and Women in the Context of the Christian Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Difference theory is often compared with dominance theory and deficit theory, and together with the more contemporary dynamic theory they make up four of the theories most widely referred to and compared in the study of [[language and gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', pp. 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, ''Women, Men and Language'', pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the popularity of Tannen's book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', and the resultant popularisation of difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Talbot98"&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; is generally attributed to the style of Tannen's work, in which she adopts a neutral position on differences in [[genderlect]] by making no value-judgements about use of language by either gender. Talbot comments that this means the book provides explanations for domestic disputes without "pointing the finger" at anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference theory as postulated by Tannen is generally summarised into six categories, each of which pairs contrasting uses of language by males and females.&lt;ref name="Talbot98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Deborah Tannen and difference''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status v. support===
Tannen states that, for men, the world is a competitive place in which conversation and speech are used to build status, whereas for women the world is a network of connections, and that they use language to seek and offer support. In demonstrating this, Tannen uses the example of her husband and herself, who at one point had jobs in different cities. She remarks that whenever someone commented on this, she interpreted it as being an offer of sympathy or support. Her husband, on the other hand, took such comments as being criticisms and attempts to put him down. Tannen remarks that this displays the different approaches that women and men take in terms of status and support. Furthermore, men are also more likely to interrupt to get their point across and hence gain status.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding v. advice===
Women seek comfort and sympathy for their problems, whilst men will seek a solution to the problem.

===Information v. feelings===
Tannen states that men's conversation is message-oriented, i.e. based upon communicating information. For women, conversation is much more important for building relationships and strengthening social links.

===Orders v. proposals===
Men will use direct imperatives ("close the door", "switch on the light") when speaking to others. Women encourage the use of superpolite forms, however ("let's", "would you mind if ...?").

===Conflict v. compromise===
Tannen asserts that most women avoid conflict in language at all costs, and instead attempt to resolve disagreements without any direct confrontation, to maintain positive connection and rapport. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use confrontation as a way of resolving differences and thereby negotiating status. Tannen supports this view by making reference to the work of [[Walter J. Ong]], whose 1981 publication, ''Fighting for Life'', asserts that "expressed adversativeness" is more an element of male culture than female culture. Tannen stresses that both forms of communication are valid ways of creating involvement and forming bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence v. intimacy===
Difference theory asserts that in general men favour independence, while women are more likely to seek intimacy. Tannen demonstrates this with the example of a husband making a decision without consulting his wife. She theorises that he does so because he doesn't want to feel a loss of independence that would come from saying, "Let me consult this with my wife first." Women, by contrast, like to demonstrate that they have to consult with their partner, as this is seen to be proof of the intimacy of the relationship. Tannen asserts that women, seeing the world as a network of connections and relationships, view intimacy as key to achieving consensus and avoiding the appearance of superiority, whereas men, who are more likely to view the world in terms of status, see independence as being key to establishing their status. Tannen also clarifies that while both men and women seek independence and intimacy, men tend to be focused on the former, while women tend to focus on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

General criticisms are that Tannen's observations are largely anecdotal and cannot be said for all conjugal conversations, let alone mixed-gender interactions as a whole.

In [[linguistics]], a '''distinctive feature''' is the most basic unit of [[phonology|phonological]] structure that may be analyzed in phonological theory.

Distinctive features are grouped into categories according to the [[natural classes]] of [[segment (linguistics)|segments]] they describe: major class features, laryngeal features, manner features, and place features. These feature categories in turn are further specified on the basis of the [[phonetics|phonetic]] properties of the segments in question.

Since the inception of the phonological analysis of distinctive features in the 1950s, features traditionally have been specified by binary values to signify whether a segment is described by the feature; a positive value, [+], denotes the presence of a feature, while a negative value, [−], indicates its absence. In addition, a phoneme may be [[unmarked]] with respect to a feature. However, in recent developments to the theory of distinctive features, phonologists have proposed the existence of single-valued features. These features, called univalent or privative features, can only describe the classes of segments that are said to possess those features, and not the classes that are without them.

==List==
[[File:IPA-euler-manners-features.svg|thumb|[[Euler diagram]] showing a typical classification of sounds (in IPA) and their [[Manner of articulation|manners of articulation]] and distinctive features]]

===Major class===
'''Major class features:''' The features that represent the major classes of sounds.
#[+/− syllabic] Syllabic segments may function as the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] of a [[syllable]], while their counterparts, the [−syll] segments, may not. Except in the case of [[syllabic consonant]]s, [+syllabic] designates all [[vowels]], while [-syllabic] designates all [[consonant]]s (including [[Semivowel|glides]]).
#[+/− consonantal] Consonantal segments are produced with an audible constriction in the [[vocal tract]], such as [[obstruent]]s, [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s, [[Liquid consonant|liquids]], and [[Trill consonant|trills]]. Vowels, [[Semivowel|glides]] and laryngeal segments are not consonantal.
#[+/− approximant] Approximant segments include vowels, [[Semivowel|glides]], and [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] while excluding [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s and [[obstruent]]s.
#[+/− sonorant] This feature describes the type of oral constriction that can occur in the vocal tract. [+son] designates the [[vowels]] and [[sonorant]] [[consonants]] (namely [[Semivowel|glides]], [[Liquid consonant|liquids]], and [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s), that are produced without an imbalance of air pressure in the vocal tract that might cause turbulence. [−son] describes the [[obstruent]]s, articulated with a noticeable turbulence caused by an imbalance of air pressure in the vocal tract.

===Laryngeal===
'''Laryngeal features:''' The features that specify the glottal states of sounds.
#[+/− voice] This feature indicates whether vibration of the [[vocal folds]] occurs with the articulation of the segment.
#[+/− spread glottis] Used to indicate the [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] of a segment, this feature denotes the openness of the glottis. For [+sg], the vocal folds are spread apart widely enough for frication to occur; for [−sg], there is not the same friction-inducing spreading.
#[+/− constricted glottis] The constricted glottis features denotes the degree of closure of the glottis. [+cg] implies that the vocal folds are held closely together, enough so that air cannot pass through momentarily, while [−cg] implies the opposite.

===Manner===
'''Manner features:''' The features that specify the [[manner of articulation]].
#[+/− [[continuant]]] This feature describes the passage of air through the vocal tract. [+cont] segments are produced without any significant obstruction in the tract, allowing air to pass through in a continuous stream. [−cont] segments, on the other hand, have such an obstruction, and so occlude the air flow at some point of articulation.
#[+/−  [[Nasalization|nasal]]] This feature describes the position of the [[Soft palate|velum]]. [+nas] segments are produced by lowering the velum so that air can pass through the [[nasal cavity|nasal tract]]. [−nas] segments conversely are produced with a raised velum, blocking the passage of air to the nasal tract and shunting it to the oral tract.
#[+/− strident] The strident feature applies to obstruents only and refers to a type of friction that is noisier than usual. This is caused by high energy [[white noise]].
#[+/− [[lateral consonant|lateral]]] This feature designates the shape and positioning of the [[tongue]] with respect to the oral tract. [+lat] segments are produced as the center of the tongue rises to contact the roof of the mouth, thereby blocking air from flowing centrally through the oral tract and instead forcing more lateral flow along the lowered side(s) of the tongue.
#[+/− [[delayed release (feature)|delayed release]]] This feature distinguishes [[stop consonant|stops]] from [[affricate consonant|affricates]]. Affricates are designated [+del rel]

===Place===
'''Place features:''' The features that specify the [[place of articulation]].
*[ [[Labial consonant|LABIAL]] ] Labial segments are articulated with the lips.  As consonants, these include [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] and [[labiodental consonant]]s.
#[+/− round]: [+round] are produced with lip rounding, while [−round] are not.
*[ [[Coronal consonant|CORONAL]] ] Coronal sounds are articulated with the [[apical consonant|tip]] and/or [[laminal consonant|blade]] of the tongue. These include a large number of consonants, which can be made with the tip, blade or underside of the tongue ([[apical consonant|apical]], [[laminal consonant|laminal]], or [[subapical consonant]], respectively), making contact with the upper lip ([[linguolabial consonant|linguolabial]]), between the teeth ([[interdental consonant|interdental]]), with the back of the teeth ([[dental consonant|dental]]), with the [[alveolar ridge]] ([[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]), behind the alveolar ridge ([[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]]), or on or in front of the [[hard palate]] ([[palatal consonant|(pre)palatal]]).  With [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] [[sibilant]]s, additional tongue shapes need to be distinguished, i.e. "domed" or slightly palatalized ("hushing" or "palato-alveolar"), [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] ([[alveolopalatal consonant|alveolopalatal]]), and "closed" ("hissing-hushing").
#[+/− anterior]: Anterior segments are articulated with the tip or blade of the tongue at or in front of the alveolar ridge.
#[+/− distributed]: For [+dist] segments the tongue is extended for some distance in the mouth.
*[ [[Dorsal consonant|DORSAL]] ] Dorsal sounds are articulated by raising the dorsum of the tongue. All vowels are dorsal sounds. Dorsal consonants include [[palatal consonant|palatal]], [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant]]s.
#[+/− high]: [+high] segments raise the dorsum close to the [[palate]]. [−high] segments do not.
#[+/− low]: [+low] segments bunch the dorsum to a position low in the mouth.
#[+/− back]: [+back] segments are produced with the tongue dorsum bunched and retracted slightly to the back of the mouth. [−back] segments are bunched and extended slightly forward.
#[+/− tense]: This feature (mainly) applies to the position of the root of the tongue when articulating vowels. [+tense] vowels have an advanced tongue root. In fact, this feature is often referred to as [[advanced tongue root]] (ATR), although there is a debate on whether tense and ATR are the same or different features.
*[ [[Pharyngeal consonant|PHARYNGEAL]] ] Pharyngeal sounds are articulated with the root of the tongue. These include [[epiglottal consonant]]s.
#[+/- advanced tongue root]: [+ATR] segments advance the root of the tongue.
#[+/- retracted tongue root]: [+RTR] segments bunch the root of the tongue towards the pharyngeal wall and activate the [[pharyngeal constrictor]] muscles
*[ [[Glottal consonant|GLOTTAL]] ] Purely glottal sounds do not involve the tongue at all. These are the [[glottal consonant]]s.

===Vowel space===
Vowels are traditionally distinguished by 
#[+/− back] ([[back vowel]]s)
#[+/− close] (or +/- high) ([[close vowel]]s)
#[+/− round] ([[rounded vowel]]s)

However, laryngoscopic studies suggest the features are
#[+/− front] ([[front vowel]]s)
#[+/− raised] ([[raised vowel]]s)
#[+/− retracted] ([[retracted vowel]]s)
#[+/− round]

==Other uses==
The concept of a distinctive feature matrix to distinguish similar elements is identified with phonology, but there have been at least two efforts to use a distinctive feature matrix in related fields. Close to phonology, and clearly acknowledging its debt to phonology, distinctive features have been used to describe and differentiate handshapes in [[fingerspelling]] in [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;Godsave, Bruce. 1974. An investigation of the feasibility of using a particular distinctive feature matrix for recording and categorizing fingerspelling errors. University of Cincinnati, doctoral dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive features have also been used to distinguish [[proverb]]s from other types of language such as slogans, clichés, and aphorisms.&lt;ref&gt;p. 73. Norrick, Neal. 1985. ''How Proverbs Mean: Semantic Studies in English Proverbs''. de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogous feature systems are also used throughout [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP). For example, [[part-of-speech tagging]] divides words into categories. These include "major" categories such as Noun vs. Verb, but also other dimensions such as person and number, plurality, tense, and others. Some mnemonics for part-of-speech tags conjoin multiple features, such as "NN" for singular noun, vs. "NNS" for plural noun, vs. "NNS$" for plural possessive noun (see [[Brown Corpus]]). Others provide more explicit separation of features, even formalizing them via [[markup language|markup]] such as the [[Text Encoding Initiative]]'s feature structures. Modern statistical NLP uses vectors of very many features, although many of those features are not formally "distinctive" in the sense described here.

The '''Energizer Bunny''' is the [[marketing]] icon and [[mascot]] of [[Energizer]] batteries in North America. It is a pink toy [[rabbit]] wearing sunglasses and blue and black striped sandals that beats a [[Marching Percussion|bass drum]] bearing the Energizer logo.

==History==
Originally a parody of the preexisting [[Duracell Bunny]], still seen in the UK, [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], the Bunny has appeared in [[television commercial]]s in North America since 1988. The Energizer Bunny is promoted as being able to continue operating indefinitely, or at least much longer than similar toys (or other products) using rival brands' batteries, with the marketing tagline "It just keeps going and going...". The American Energizer commercials, produced by [[D.D.B. Chicago Advertising]], originally began as a parody of TV advertisements for rival [[Duracell]]. In the original Duracell ads, a set of battery-powered drum-playing toy rabbits gradually slow to a halt until only the toy powered by a copper-top battery remains active. In Energizer's parody, the Energizer Bunny then enters the screen beating a huge [[bass drum]] and swinging a [[mallet]] over his head. The criticism was that Duracell compared their batteries with [[zinc-carbon batteries|carbon-zinc batteries]], and not similar [[alkaline batteries]] like Energizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fILdYrxnrf8 |title=Energizer Bunny - Introduction - 1989 |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The creative team at D.D.B. Chicago who conceived and designed the bunny chose All Effects [[special effects]] company to build the original Energizer Bunny, a remote-controlled prop. All Effects operated the Energizer Bunny in most of its first commercials.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Later commercials were made by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], [[Cafe FX]] and Method Studios.

The commercials started out with the Bunny leaving the studio it was in, then wandering into the sets of a couple of realistic-looking commercials for fictional products, interrupting them. As the campaign progressed, many of these ads were standalone (for fake products such as "Sitagin [[Hemorrhoid]] Remedy", "Nasotine Sinus Relief", "TresCafe Coffee", "Alarm" deodorant soap, etc.) and even a few featured celebrities (such as [[Lyle Alzado]] promoting a snack called "Pigskins", and [[Ted Nugent]] doing an ad for a Mexican food chain called "Cucaracha") only to have the Bunny march through, beating his drum, because he was "still going" (one infamous commercial was for a fake long-distance telephone company with a couple in the United Kingdom talking to their son, who was supposedly in New York and exclaimed that he "sounded like he's right next door", and when the Bunny came in, he knocked down the divider to show they really were next to each other). Eventually real-life products and icons would do a crossover with the Energizer Bunny ([[Michael J. Fox]] doing a [[Pepsi]] ad, and the opening of TV shows such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and ''[[ABC's Wide World of Sports]]'').  The Energizer Bunny has appeared in more than 115 television commercials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energizer.com/bunny/historyofbunny.asp History of the Energizer Bunny] Energizer.com - Retrieved: July 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In these commercials, a voice-over would announce one of various slogans used throughout the years; all of them would relate the stalwartness of the Energizer Bunny to the long-lasting power of their batteries. The original slogan boasted that "...[n]othing outlasts the Energizer...", but it was eventually changed after a lawsuit filed by Duracell disputing Energizer's claim.&lt;ref&gt;Pott, Carol (Ed.), (2005). ''The Blue Pages: A Directory of Companies Rated by Their Politics and Practices.'' Polipoint Press, (heading under ''Energizer Holdings, Inc.'')&lt;/ref&gt; Those commercials with the bunny interrupting all the action in a commercial were eventually spoofed in the 1993 film ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]'', featuring a blue animal drumming through instead of the pink bunny. The two people fighting then used their guns to shoot the blue animal, causing the blue animal to explode.

===1990s===
In 1993 through 1995, Energizer ran a series of commercials featuring a fake rival battery called "Supervolt" including a Supervolt weasel mascot, which was an obvious lookalike of Duracell. As Supervolt's battery sales have gone low, the company's CEO (portrayed by [[Rip Torn]]) seeks to neutralize the Energizer Bunny by targeting its battery. In order to do this. Supervolt's CEO goes in the process of finding individuals who can assist them.

* The first one is an [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]-like evil genius who planned to use the Matter Disintegrator to destroy the battery. It shuts down due to the Supervolt batteries in it running out of power.
* The second one is [[King Kong]] where Supervolt's CEO gives him a card that has him getting a banana for a reward upon Supervolt's CEO describing him as somebody big. When cornering the Energizer Bunny on the Empire State Building, a woman that King Kong angered closed the door on King Kong's foot, causing King Kong to fall off the Empire State Building.

In many of the associated commercials that followed, villains such as [[Darth Vader]], the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]], and [[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show#Characters|Boris and Natasha]], as well as a robotic flea, would try to destroy or capture the Bunny only to see complications arise when their devices using Supervolt batteries ran out or other circumstances allowed for the mascot's escape. In addition, a flock of vultures and a foxhunt would get exhausted trying to catch the Energizer Bunny and the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] gave up waiting for the Energizer Bunny to come with him.

The second one showed the quality of the product being advertised when it created complications for the villain-so as not to boast that Energizer was better than any other brand, as well as to encourage people to buy Energizer batteries for their smoke detectors.

===2016===
In September 2016, Energizer switched their advertising agency to [[Camp+King]] and introduced a new more expressive bunny who is slimmer and has more facial expression. The bunny will keep the signature drum, flip flops, and dark sunglasses, but the pink fur will be more realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Neff |first=Jack |url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/energizer-bunny-makeover-takes-fashion-week-runway/305835/ |title=In the Pink: Sightings of Slimmer Energizer Bunny Will Multiply |work=[[Advertising Age]] |date=2016-09-14 |accessdate=2016-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal challenges==
{{expand section|date=April 2016}}
In 1991, [[Energizer Holdings]] unsuccessfully sued the [[Adolph Coors Company]] for [[copyright infringement]] for [[parody advertisement#Eveready v. Coors|creating a parody of its Energizer bunny ads]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10034638817045797163&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''Eveready Battery Co., Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co.'', 765 F. Supp. 440 (N.D. Ill. 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertisement had comedian [[Leslie Nielsen]] banging a bass drum while wearing rabbit ears while the announcer said "It keeps growing and growing!" The court eventually sided with Coors noting the obvious facts that the content of the ad is substantially different considering Nielsen was not a toy and he did not run on batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Reilly |first1=Terry |title=Commercial Parodies! |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/commercial-parodies-an-encore-presentation-1.3637767 |accessdate=25 March 2017 |agency=Pirate Radio|publisher=[[CBC Radio One]]|date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign success==
Despite the immense popularity of the campaign, sales of Energizer batteries actually went down during the years that the ads ran. Duracell claimed that 40 percent of its customers thought the campaign was promoting Duracell, not Energizer, but provided no evidence. Speculation has it that TV watchers still associated pink bunnies with Duracell, so the Energizer ads were actually helping their competitor's sales rather than their own.&lt;ref&gt;Those Creative Tv Ads Can Be A Commercial Failure http://articles.philly.com/1997-11-25/news/25542942_1_tv-ads-new-ad-agency-duracell&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In North America the term "Energizer Bunny" has entered the [[vernacular]] as a term for anything that continues endlessly, or someone that has immense stamina. In Europe and Australia the term "Duracell Bunny" has a similar connotation. Several U.S. presidential candidates have compared themselves to the bunny, including President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1992 and [[Howard Dean]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2008-11-29-energizer-bunny_N.htm?csp=34|title=Still going and going: Energizer Bunny enters his 20th year |agency=Associated Press |date=2008-11-29|accessdate=2008-11-29 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the company [[PC Dynamics]] created a Screen Saver for [[Windows 3.x]] featuring Energizer Bunny with audio clips from the commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows® 1.x, 2.x, 3.x - Energizer Bunny Screen Saver |url=http://www.danielsays.com/ss-gallery-win1x2x3x-energizer-bunny-ss.html |work= |publisher= |author=Daniel Rose |date= |accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ninth season of ''[[Roseanne]]'' (1996–97), the lyrics sung by [[Blues Traveler]] lead singer [[John Popper]] begin with: "If what doesn't kill us is making us stronger, we're gonna last longer/Than that greatest wall in China, or that rabbit with the drum."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lyricsondemand.com/tvthemes/roseannelyrics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Energizer was the corporate sponsor of [[Star Tours]] at [[Disneyland|Disneyland Park]] and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] for several years; the bunny appeared in several ride-themed advertisements around the show's exit.

In 2006, an Energizer Bunny balloonicle debuted in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] and appeared until 2011.

For several years, comedian and [[ventriloquist]] [[Jeff Dunham]] had a recurring joke about the Energizer Bunny. His "grumpy old man" puppet Walter would ask about commercials interrupting their broadcast, citing the Bunny as a particularly annoying example. The joke would often end with Walter saying, "I'd like to trap his furry little ass...hook him up to a [[Sears]] [[DieHard (brand) | DieHard]]."
In the MAD sketch HOPS, E.B fooled the cop into catching the Energizer Bunny.

Count '''Eustachy Tyszkiewicz''' of [[Leliwa coat of arms]] (18 April 1814 in [[Lahoysk]] – 25 August 1874 in [[Vilnius]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[szlachta|noble]] from the [[Tyszkiewicz family]]. He was an archaeologist and historian of the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and [[White Ruthenia]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was noted as the first archaeologist with academic and systematical approach to studies of in the [[Belarus]]ian and [[Lithuania]]n lands, and had a great influence on the upcoming generations of archaeologists.&lt;ref name=vencl/&gt; In 1855, on the basis of his personal collection of archaeological and historical artifacts, he founded the [[Museum of Antiquities in Vilnius|Museum of Antiquities]] in [[Vilnius]] (Vilna, Wilno), which is considered to be the predecessor of the [[National Museum of Lithuania]]. Eustachy was a brother of historian [[Konstanty Tyszkiewicz]].

==Biography==
[[File:Rossa-Eustachy Tyszkiewicz.JPG|upright|thumb|left||Tyszkiewicz's tomb in the [[Rasos cemetery]]]]
In his memoirs, Tyszkiewicz indicated that he was born in [[Minsk]] not in [[Lahoysk]] as researchers believe.&lt;ref name=mab03/&gt; Tyszkiewicz spent his childhood at the family estate in Lahoysk.&lt;ref name=klimka/&gt; He started his studies at the {{ill|Vilnius Gymnasium|lt|Vilniaus gimnazijos|ru|Виленские мужские гимназии}}, but due to poor health he transferred to Minsk.&lt;ref name=griska/&gt; After the graduation in 1831,&lt;ref name=vle2/&gt; he began his career with the government in 1833 at the Chapter of the Orders of Russian Tsars.&lt;ref name=ruzas/&gt; At the same time, he collected archival information on the history of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name=vle2/&gt; He then held various government jobs at various locations: at the office of the {{ill|Vilna Governorate-General|ru|Литовское генерал-губернаторство}} (1835–1838), the [[Kraków Governorate]] (1838–1840), and {{ill|Little-Russian Governorate-General|ru|Малороссийское генерал-губернаторство}} (1840), school inspector of the [[Barysaw District]] and [[Marshal of Nobility (Poland)|marshal of nobility]] (1842–1848), curator of the {{ill|Minsk Men's Gymnasium|ru|Минская мужская гимназия}} (1848–1854).&lt;ref name=vle2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruzas/&gt; In 1853, he was appointed as supervisor of Vilnius psychiatric hospital. He held the titles of [[Table of Ranks|collegiate assessor]] and [[kammerjunker]]. For his service the state he received several awards, including the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]] (2nd class) in 1856 and [[Order of Saint Anna]] (2nd class) in 1860.&lt;ref name=ruzas/&gt; 

In May 1855, Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] approved the [[Vilnius Archaeological Commission]] and the [[Museum of Antiquities in Vilnius|Museum of Antiquities]]. The basis of the initial museum collection was about 6,000 items gifted by Tyszkiewicz – more than half of the items were books, while other items were coins, medals, portraits, engravings, historical artifacts.&lt;ref name=vle1/&gt; Tyszkiewicz chaired the commission and curated the museum until it was nationalized and reorganized after the failed [[Uprising of 1863]]. After losing his life's work, he retired to the [[Astravas Manor]] near [[Biržai]] which belonged to his relative [[Michał Tyszkiewicz (Egyptologist)|Michał Tyszkiewicz]].&lt;ref name=griska/&gt; There he studied local history, organized manor's library and archives of the [[Radziwiłł family]], wrote historical studies and compiled primary sources for publication.&lt;ref name=klimka/&gt; He returned to Vilnius in 1871, where he died in 1874 and was buried in the [[Rasos cemetery]].&lt;ref name=mab01/&gt;

Tyszkiewicz is best remembered as the "father of archaeology" in the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania.&lt;ref name=kunce/&gt; Starting in 1837, he carried our archaeological excavations [[Trakai Peninsula Castle]] but focused on [[tumuli]]. He excavated about half a hundred&lt;ref name=kersy2007/&gt; tumuli near [[Kernavė]], [[Halshany]], [[Barysaw]], [[Kreva]], [[Lida]], [[Lahoysk]]. He took a systematic approach to discovered artifacts and categorized them according to the [[three-age system]] into the [[Stone Age|Stone]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron Age]]s.&lt;ref name=vle2/&gt; He published his first studies in various journals 1837–1841 and a separate monograph, the first book devoted to archaeology in Lithuania, in 1842.&lt;ref name=griska/&gt; It described remains of medieval castles, [[hill forts]], tumuli, bronze and iron artifacts, etc.&lt;ref name=taras/&gt; The publication was well received and acted as a textbook of archaeology for others. It was translated to Russian in 1843 and German 1846.&lt;ref name=kunce/&gt; Based on the archaeological findings, he studied the [[Krivichs]], a Slavic tribe, their territory and trade.&lt;ref name=logoysk/&gt; He systematically analyzed similarities and differences of the tumuli of different regions and tribes.&lt;ref name=kunce/&gt; In 1872, he published his third significant work on archaeology in which he outlined the developments over the last few decades.&lt;ref name=taras/&gt;

Tyszkiewicz started making plans for a [[learned society]] (in the vacuum created by the closure of [[Vilnius University]] in 1832) after moving to Vilnius in 1835. At the suggestion of [[Theodor Narbut]], he also started thinking about a history museum.&lt;ref name=griska/&gt; In 1843, he toured Scandinavian countries, establishing contacts with various historical societies and gathering ideas for the future museum. He purchased a house in [[Antakalnis]] and opened a [[Cabinet (room)|cabinet]] of antiquities to the public in 1847.&lt;ref name=griska/&gt; He petitioned the Tsarist administration for a permission to open a public museum twice, in 1848 and 1851, but the [[Museum of Antiquities in Vilnius|Museum of Antiquities]] was approved only in 1855.&lt;ref name=aleks/&gt; The [[Vilnius Archaeological Commission]], which Tyszkiewicz chaired, acted as a ''de facto'' learned society.&lt;ref name=aleks/&gt; The museum was popular and its collections grew tenfold from 6,000 items donated by Tyszkiewicz to more than 67,000 items in 1865.&lt;ref name=kersy/&gt; After the failed [[Uprising of 1863]], Tsarist authorities instituted a number of strict [[Russification]] policies and nationalized the museum. Many valuable items, particularly those related to the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], were removed to the [[Rumyantsev Museum]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name=mulev/&gt; Tyszkiewicz formally oversaw the transformation of the museum into a department of the Vilnius Public Library and officially resigned from the museum in September 1867.&lt;ref name=aleks/&gt;

He was a member of the [[St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences]], [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]], Royal Society of Northern Antiquities in [[Kopenhagen]], [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]] in Stockholm, and [[Royal Archaeological Institute]] in London.&lt;ref name=logoysk/&gt;&lt;ref name=mab11/&gt;

A '''fair trade law''' was a [[statute]] in any of various states of the United States that permitted manufacturers the right to specify the minimum retail price of a commodity, a practice known as "[[Resale price maintenance|price maintenance]]".  Such laws first appeared in 1931 during the [[Great Depression]] in the state of [[California]].  They were ostensibly intended to protect small businesses to some degree from competition from very large chain stores during a time when small businesses were suffering.  Many people objected to this on the grounds that if the manufacturers could set the price, consumers would have to pay more even at large discount stores.  The complexity of the market also made the enforcement of these laws almost impractical.  As the chain stores became more popular, and bargain prices more common, there was a widespread repeal of the laws in many jurisdictions.  By 1975, the laws had been repealed completely&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/fair-trade-law&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/bus/A0818158.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7355">A '''finding aid''', in the context of [[archival science]], is a document containing detailed information about a specific collection of records within an [[archive]]. They often consist of an inventory and description of the materials, their source, and their structure. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rare.library.cornell.edu/collections/guides|title=Finding Aids for Archival and Manuscript Collections {{!}} Rare and Manuscript Collections|website=rare.library.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The finding aid for a collection is usually compiled by the collection's entity of origin, or by an [[archivist]] or [[librarian]] during [[archival processing]], and serves the purpose of locating specific information within the collection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As long as humans have stored documents, they have created tools to navigate their storage systems; ancient Sumerians created them to locate bureaucratic records. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thediscoverblog.com/2012/02/28/discover-finding-aids/|title=Discover Finding Aids!|date=2012-02-28|work=Library and Archives Canada Blog|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, finding aids were paper documents such as lists or index cards; now they can be created in electronic formats like spreadsheets or databases. The standard machine-readable format for manuscript collection finding aids, widely used in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Australia]] and elsewhere, is [[Encoded Archival Description]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/ead/eaddev.html|title=Development of the Encoded Archival Description DTD (EAD Official Site, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Overview==
The content of a finding aid may differ depending on the type of material it is describing. Usually, a finding aid includes a description of the scope of the collection, biographical and historical information related to the collection, and restrictions on use of or access to the materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/f/finding-aid|title=finding aid {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding aids may be detailed inventories that list contents. They may also include subject headings drawn from [[LCSH]], [[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus|AAT]], or other [[controlled vocabulary]], and may cross-refer to related collections in other repositories. The data elements essential to finding aids are defined by the [[International Council on Archives]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.org/en|title=International Council on Archives {{!}}|website=www.ica.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the General International Standard Archival Description ([[ISAD(G)]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818015843/http://www.ica.org/en/node/30000|title=ISAD(G): General International Standard Archival Description, Second edition {{!}} International Council on Archives|date=2010-08-18|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various national implementations of ISAD(G) exist, such as ''[[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]]'', used in the USA.

=== Creation ===

The process of creating a finding aid often begins with archival description. For example, [[Encoded Archival Description]] calls for a basic description of the collection, a list of controlled vocabulary terms, administrative information, biographical information, scope and content, arrangement, description of components, and other descriptive data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/ead/lcp/|title=LC EAD Best Practices at the Library of Congress (Finding Aids)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a universal standard for finding aids,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/catalog/stds99/chapter5.html|title=Standards for Archival Description: Chapter 5|website=www.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; these elements are often used as a basis.

=== Components ===

The '''Basic Description, Collection Overview,''' or '''Summary Information''' is usually the first section of a finding aid, containing information about the collection's creator, the physical space the collection occupies in the archive, and the date range and an abstract of its documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guides.lib.purdue.edu/c.php?g=352889&amp;p=2378063|title=Library Guides: Primary Sources in Archives &amp; Special Collections: How to Read a Finding Aid|last=Harmeyer|first=Neal|website=guides.lib.purdue.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''Biographical/Historical Note''' describes a collection from the perspective of the time period it was created, providing background information on a person or organization. It can also describe the history of the collection. The '''Scope and Content''' note briefly explains the collection's [[provenance]], its arrangement and date range, and in general what kind of materials it contains—letters, reports, photographs, audio/video, etc.

The '''Access and Use''' section that contains information about using the collection, such as terms of access and restrictions. Usage issues that may affect researchers could include donor agreements restricting access, copyright information, the collection's history of ownership, any additional formats the collection may have, and if the collection is accepting additions. '''Additional Information''' contains details of related materials, language, citation instructions, any sponsors, and the date of processing. '''Search Terms''' are generally a list of subject headings, any personal, corporate, or family names, geographical headings, and genre terms that relate to the contents of the collection.

'''Arrangement''' is the manner in which the collection has been ordered (generally in accordance, as far as practicable, with its [[original order]]). Hierarchical levels of arrangement are typically composed of '''record groups''' containing '''series''', which in turn contain boxes, folders, and items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/l/levels-of-arrangement|title=levels of arrangement {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''Content List''' is a list of the collection's materials down to the box and folder level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guides.lib.purdue.edu/c.php?g=352889&amp;p=2378063|title=Library Guides: Primary Sources in Archives &amp; Special Collections: How to Read a Finding Aid|last=Harmeyer|first=Neal|website=guides.lib.purdue.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series descriptions containing the title, dates of coverage, and a brief description of the contents of each series. Series descriptions may also include the range of containers, a statement of the type of arrangement, and a note on any restrictions for each series.

A '''government district''' or '''government area''' is any part of a city or town in which the primary land use by state institutions ([[national legislature]], [[official residences]]s, [[foreign ministry headquarters]], and so on), as opposed to a [[residential neighbourhood]], [[commercial district]] and [[industrial park|industrial zone]], or other types of [[neighborhood]]s. In some cities, authorities use planning or [[zoning]] laws to define the boundaries of government districts.

In most national and many sub-national (state, provincial, etc.) [[capital cities]] there are distinct government districts centred on the [[national legislature]].  However, non-capitals may also have an administrative district centered on city hall or a government office building.

== Examples ==

=== Canada ===
In the national capital, [[Ottawa]], the main government district, centered on [[Parliament Hill]] is within [[Downtown Ottawa]] (part of [[Centretown]]), but could be extended to include small parts of [[Lower Town]] and [[Sandy Hill, Ottawa|Sandy Hill]] if the prime minister's and government general's residences are included, as well as the district of [[Hull, Quebec]] in the neighboring city of [[Gatineau]] where several ministries are headquartered.  These areas are all linked by the ceremonial route known as "[[Confederation Boulevard]]".

In Quebec City, the provincial capital of Quebec, the ''[[Complexe du Parlement]]'' (including the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]]) and several other government buildings, are located within the neighborhood of [[Parliament Hill (Quebec City)|Parliament Hill]].  This is within the districts of [[Vieux-Québec—Cap-Blanc—colline Parlementaire]] and [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Quebec City|Saint-Jean-Baptiste]], which are themselves in the borough of [[La Cité-Limoilou]].

Toronto, Ontario's government district is centered on [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] home of the provincial parliament.

Edmonton Alberta's main government district, is centered on Capital Boulevard ([[107 Street, Edmonton|107 Street]] south of [[Jasper Avenue]]) which is home to the [[Alberta Legislature Building]] and the [[Federal Public Building]].  However [[Edmonton City Hall]] and [[Canada Place (Edmonton)|Canada Place]] anchor another government cluster to the east.

In [[linguistics]], '''grammatical mood''' (also '''mode''') is a [[Grammar|grammatical]] feature of [[verb]]s, used for signaling [[Linguistic modality|modality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank R. Palmer|Palmer, F. R.]], ''Mood and Modality'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986 (second edition 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, Joan; Perkins, Revere; and Pagliuca, William.

That is, it is the use of verbal [[inflection]]s that allow speakers to express their attitude toward what they are saying (e.g. a statement of fact, of desire, of command, etc.). The term is also used more broadly to describe the [[Syntax|syntactic]] expression of modality; that is, the use of verb phrases that do not involve inflexion of the verb itself.

Mood is distinct from [[grammatical tense]] or [[grammatical aspect]], although the same word patterns are used for expressing more than one of these meanings at the same time in many languages, including English and most other modern [[Indo-European language]]s. (See [[tense–aspect–mood]] for a discussion of this.)

Some examples of moods are [[Indicative mood|indicative]], [[Interrogative mood|interrogative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[Injunctive mood|injunctive]], [[Optative mood|optative]], and [[Potential mood|potential]]. These are all [[Finite verb|finite]] forms of the verb. [[Infinitive]]s, [[gerund]]s, and [[participle]]s, which are non-finite forms of the verb, are not considered to be examples of moods.

Some [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]] languages have more than ten moods; [[Nenets languages|Nenets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/sketch.html|title=Tundra Nenets grammatical sketch|author=|date=|website=www.helsinki.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; has as many as sixteen. The original [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] inventory of moods consisted of indicative, subjunctive, optative, and imperative. Not every Indo-European language has all of these moods, but the most conservative ones such as [[Avestan]], [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]], and [[Sanskrit]] have them all. English has indicative, imperative, and subjunctive moods; other moods, such as the conditional, do not appear as morphologically distinct forms.

Not all of the moods listed below are clearly conceptually distinct.  Individual terminology varies from language to language, and the coverage of (e.g.) the "conditional" mood in one language may largely overlap with that of the "hypothetical" or "potential" mood in another. Even when two different moods exist in the same language, their respective usages may blur, or may be defined by syntactic rather than semantic criteria. For example, the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[optative mood|optative]] moods in [[Ancient Greek]] alternate syntactically in many subordinate clauses, depending on the tense of the main verb. The usage of the [[indicative]], subjunctive, and [[jussive mood]]s in [[Classical Arabic]] is almost completely controlled by syntactic context. The only possible alternation in the same context is between indicative and jussive following the negative particle ''lā''.

==Realis moods==
{{main article|Realis mood}}
Realis moods are a category of grammatical moods that indicate that something is actually the case or actually not the case. The most common realis mood is the indicative mood. Some languages have a distinct generic mood for expressing general truths. For other realis moods, see the main [[Realis mood]] article.

=== Indicative ===
The indicative mood, or evidential mood, is used for factual statements and positive beliefs. It is the mood of reality. The indicative mood is the most commonly used mood and is found in all languages. Example: "Paul is eating an apple" or "John eats apples". All intentions that a particular language does not categorize as another mood are classified as indicative.

==Irrealis moods==
{{main article|Irrealis mood}}

Irrealis moods are the set of grammatical moods that indicate that something is not actually the case or a certain situation or action is not known to have happened. They are any verb or sentence mood that are not ''realis'' moods. They may be part of expressions of necessity, possibility, requirement, wish or desire, fear, or as part of counterfactual reasonings, etc.

''Irrealis'' [[verb]] forms are used when speaking of an event which has not happened, is not likely to happen, or is otherwise far removed from the real course of events. For example, in the sentence "If you had done your homework, you wouldn't have failed the class", ''had done'' is an ''irrealis'' verb form. &lt;!--What if the speaker is not sure whether the statement is fact? I.e. "If he did his part, we should be seeing the results by now."--&gt;

Some languages have distinct grammatical forms that indicate that the event described by a specific verb is an ''irrealis verb''. Many of the [[Indo-European languages]] preserve a [[subjunctive mood]] that functions as an ''irrealis''. Some also preserve an [[optative mood]] that describes events that are wished for or hoped for but not factual.

Common ''irrealis'' moods are the imperative, the conditional, the subjunctive, the optative, the jussive, and the potential. For other examples, see the main article for each respective mood.

=== Subjunctive ===
{{main article|Subjunctive mood}}

The subjunctive mood, sometimes called conjunctive mood, has several uses in [[dependent clause]]s. Examples include discussing imaginary or hypothetical events and situations, expressing opinions or emotions, or making polite requests (the exact scope is language-specific). A subjunctive mood exists in English, though it is used in English much less than in many other Indo-European languages. In English, this mood has, for some uses, become something of a [[Fossilization (linguistics)|linguistic fossil]]. An example of the subjunctive mood is "I suggest that Paul ''eat'' an apple". The sentence refers to an event which may or may not take place. Contrast this with the indicative verb of the sentence "Paul will eat an apple", in which the verb "will eat" states an unambiguous fact. Another way of expressing the suggestion is "I suggest that Paul should eat an apple".

Other uses of the subjunctive in English are [[archaism]]s, as in "And '''if he be''' not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass..." ([[King James Version|KJV]] [[Leviticus]] 5:7). Statements such as "I will ensure that he leave immediately" often sound archaic or overly formal, and have been almost completely supplanted by constructions with the indicative, like "I will ensure that he leave'''s''' immediately".

Some Germanic languages distinguish between two types of subjunctive moods, for example, the ''Konjunktiv I'' and ''II'' in German or the ''present'' and ''past subjunctive'' in English. Note that the latter distinction is not about the actual time at which something happens (or does not happen).

The conditional version of “John eats if he is hungry” is (subjunctive part boldfaced):

: English: ''John would eat if he '''were''' hungry.'' 
: French:  ''Jean mangerait s’il '''eût''' faim.'' (note: in modern usage, the imperfect indicative usually replaces the imperfect subjunctive in this type of sentence.)
: German:  ''Johannes äße, wenn er hungrig '''wäre'''.''
: Italian: ''Giovanni mangerebbe se '''avesse''' fame.''
: Polish:  ''Jan jadłby, gdyby '''zgłodniał'''.''
: Portuguese: ''João comeria se '''tivesse''' fome.''
: Russian:    ''Иван поел бы, если бы '''был''' голоден.''
: Spanish: ''Juan comería si '''tuviera''' hambre.''
: Swedish: ''Johan skulle äta, om han '''vore''' hungrig''.

The subjunctive mood figures prominently in the [[grammar]] of the [[Romance languages]], which require this mood for certain types of dependent clauses. This point commonly causes difficulty for English speakers learning these languages.

In certain other languages, the dubitative or the conditional moods may be employed instead of the subjunctive in referring to doubtful or unlikely events (see the main article).

=== Conditional ===
{{main article|Conditional mood}}

The conditional mood is used for speaking of an event whose realization is dependent upon another condition, particularly, but not exclusively, in [[conditional sentence]]s. In Modern English, this type of modality is expressed via a [[compound verb|periphrastic construction]], with the form ''would'' + infinitive, (e.g. ''I would buy''), and thus is a mood only in the broad sense and not in the more common narrow sense of the term "mood".{{clarify|date=November 2015}} In other languages, verbs have a specific conditional [[inflection]]. In German, the conditional mood is identical to one of the two subjunctive moods ''(Konjunktiv II,'' see above).

The conditional version of "John eats if he is hungry" is (conditional part boldfaced):

: English:    ''John '''would eat''' if he were hungry.''
: Finnish:    ''Juha '''söisi''', jos hänellä olisi nälkä.''
: Estonian:  ''Juhan '''sööks''', kui tal oleks nälg.''
: Basque:  ''Jonek '''jango luke''', goserik balu.''
: French:     ''Jean '''mangerait''' s'il avait faim.''
: German:     ''Johannes '''äße''', wenn er hungrig wäre.'' (Also: ''Johannes '''würde essen''', wenn er hungrig wäre.'')
: Italian:    ''Giovanni '''mangerebbe''' se avesse fame.''
: Polish:     ''Jan '''jadłby''', gdyby zgłodniał.''
: Portuguese: '' João '''comeria''' se estivesse com fome.''
: Russian:    ''Иван '''поел бы''', если бы был голоден.''
: Spanish:    ''Juan '''comería''' si tuviera hambre.''
: Swedish:   ''Johan '''skulle äta''', om han vore hungrig.''

In the [[Romance languages]], the conditional form is used primarily in the [[Conditional sentence|apodosis]] (main clause) of conditional clauses, and in a few [[set phrase]]s where it expresses courtesy or doubt. The main verb in the [[protasis]] (dependent clause) is usually in the subjunctive or in the indicative mood. However, this is not a universal trait: among others in German (as above), [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (even though the last is a Romance language), the conditional mood is used in both the apodosis and the protasis. A further example is the sentence "I would buy a house if I earned a lot of money", where in Finnish both clauses have the conditional marker ''-isi-'': ''Osta'''isi'''n talon, jos ansaits'''isi'''n paljon rahaa''. In Polish (as well as in eastern Slavic languages) the conditional marker ''-by'' also appears twice: ''Kupił'''by'''m dom, gdy'''by'''m zarabiał dużo pieniędzy''.

Because English is used as a lingua franca, a common error among second-language speakers is to use "would" in both clauses, e.g. *"I would buy if I would earn...". "Would" can, however, correctly be used after "if" in sentences such as "If you '''would''' only '''tell me''' what is troubling you, I might be able to help" (i.e. "if you were willing to tell me...").

=== Optative ===
{{main article|Optative mood}}
The optative mood expresses hopes, wishes or commands and has other uses that may overlap with the subjunctive mood. Few languages have an optative as a distinct mood; some that do are [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], and [[Sanskrit]].

=== Imperative===
{{main article|Imperative mood}}
The imperative mood expresses direct commands, prohibitions, and requests. In many circumstances, using the imperative mood may sound blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care. Example: "Paul, do your homework now".  An imperative is used for telling someone to do something without argument.  Many languages, including English, use the bare verb stem to form the imperative (such as "go", "run", "do"). Other languages, such as [[Seri language|Seri]] and [[Latin]], however, use special imperative forms.  In English, the second person is implied by the imperative except when first-person plural is specified, as in "Let's go" ("Let us go").  In Romance languages a first person plural exists in the imperative mood: Spanish: ''Vayamos a la playa''; French: ''Allons à la plage'' (both meaning: Let us go to the beach).  The prohibitive mood, the negative imperative may be grammatically or morphologically different from the imperative mood in some languages. It indicates that the action of the verb is not permitted, e.g. "Don't you go!"  In English, the imperative is sometimes used for forming a [[conditional sentence]]: e.g. "go eastwards a mile, and you'll see it" means "if you go eastwards a mile, you will see it".

===Jussive===
{{main article|Jussive mood}}
The jussive, similarly to the imperative, expresses orders, commands, exhortations, but particularly to a third person not present. An imperative, in contrast, generally applies to the listener. When a language is said to have a jussive, the jussive forms are different from the imperative ones, but may be the same as the forms called "subjunctive" in that language. Latin is an example where the jussive is simply about certain specific uses of the subjunctive. Arabic, however, is an example of a language with distinct subjunctive, imperative and jussive conjugations.

===Potential===

The potential mood is a mood of probability indicating that, in the opinion of the speaker, the action or occurrence is considered likely. It is used in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], in [[Sanskrit]], and in the [[Sami languages]]. (In Japanese it is often called something like '''tentative,''' since '''potential''' is used for referring to a [[grammatical voice|voice]] indicating capability to perform the action.)

In Finnish, it is mostly a literary device, as it has virtually disappeared from daily spoken language in most dialects. Its affix is ''-ne-'', as in *''men'' + ''ne'' + ''e'' → ''mennee''  "(she/he/it) will probably go". 
In English, it is formed by means of the auxiliaries ''may'', ''can'', ''ought'', and ''must'': ''"She may go.''".

===Hypothetical===
A few languages use a [[hypothetical mood]], which is used in sentences such as "you could have cut yourself", representing something that might have happened but did not.

=== Inferential ===
{{main article|Inferential mood}}The inferential mood is used to report unwitnessed events without confirming them. Often, there is no doubt as to the veracity of the statement (for example, if it were on the news), but simply the fact that the speaker was not personally present at the event forces them to use this mood.

In the [[Balkan languages]], the same forms used for the inferential mood also function as [[admirative]]s. When referring to Balkan languages, it is of&lt;dfn&gt;ten called&lt;/dfn&gt; '''renarrative mood'''; when referring to [[Estonian language|Estonian]], it is called '''oblique mood'''.

The inferential is usually impossible to be distinguishably translated into English. For instance, indicative Bulgarian ''той отиде (toy otide)'' and Turkish ''o gitti'' will be translated the same as inferential ''той отишъл (toy otishal)'' and ''o gitmiş'' — with the English indicative ''he went''.'''&lt;sup&gt;[[Inferential mood#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;''' Using the first pair, however, implies very strongly that the speaker either witnessed the event or is very sure that it took place. The second pair implies either that the speaker did not in fact witness it take place, that it occurred in the remote past or that there is considerable doubt as to whether it actually happened. If it were necessary to make the distinction, then the English constructions "he must have gone" or "he is said to have gone" would partly translate the inferential.

==Other moods==

=== Interrogative ===
{{main article|Interrogative mood}}
The interrogative (or interrogatory) mood is used for asking questions. In English, questions are considered interrogative. Most other languages do not have a special mood for asking questions, but exceptions include [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Nenets languages|Nenets]] and [[Eskimo languages]] such as [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]].

=== Deontic Mood vs. Epistemic Mood ===
Linguistics also differentiate moods into two parental categories that include deontic mood and epistemic mood. Deontic mood describes whether one could or should be able to do something. An example of deontic mood is: She should/may start. On the other hand, epistemic mood describes the chance or possibility of something happening. This would then change our example to: She may have started. To further explain modality, linguists introduce weak mood. A weak deontic mood describes how a course of action is not recommended or is frowned upon. A weak epistemic mood includes the terms perhaps and possibly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Tokelauan syntax|last=Hooper|first=Robin|publisher=University Microfilms International|year=1994|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=283–284|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other languages==
=== Pingelapese ===
Pingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. ''e'' and ''ae'' are auxiliary verbs found in Pingelapese. Though seemingly interchangeable, e and ''ae'' are separate phonemes and have different uses. A Pingelapese speaker would choose to use ''e'' when they have a high degree of certainty in what they are saying and ''ae'' when they are less certain. This therefore illustrates that ''e'' and ''ae'' are mood indicators. They have no effect on the direct translation of a sentence, but they are used to alter the mood of the sentence spoken. The following example shows the difference between ''e'' and ''ae'' when applied in the same sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Preverbal Particles in Pingelapese|last=Hattori|first=Ryoko|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ngaei rong pwa Soahn e laid.''

‘I heard that John was fishing (I am certain about it).’

'' Ngaei rong pwa Soahn ae laid.''

‘I heard that John was fishing (but I am not certain about it).’

The use of ''ae'' instead of ''e'' can also indicate an interrogative sentence. This is a form of non-declarative speech that demonstrates the speaker has no commitment to the statement they are saying. The following sentence is an example.

Soahn ae laid?

‘Does John fish?’

=== Reo Rapa ===
The language we know as [[Rapa language|Reo Rapa]] was not created by the combination of 2 languages, but through the introduction of [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] to the Rapa monolingual community. Old Rapa words are still used for the grammar and structure of the sentence of phrase but most common context words were replaced with [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reo Rapa: A Polynesian Contact Language — Journal of Language Contact|last=Walworth|first=Landon|publisher=Brill|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reo Rapa language uses TAM (Tense - Aspect - Mood) in their sentence structure such as the Impertective TAM marker ''/e/'' and the Imperative TAM marker ''/a/''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reo Rapa: A Polynesian Contact Language — Journal of Language Contact|last=Walworth|first=Mary|publisher=Brill|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* ''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt; hina’aro &lt;u&gt;na&lt;/u&gt; vau tō mei’a &lt;u&gt;ra&lt;/u&gt;''
** ''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'' (Imperfective TAM marker) + ''hina’aro'' (Like) + ''&lt;u&gt;na&lt;/u&gt;'' ([[Deixis]]) + ''vau'' (Singular) + ''tō'' ([[Definiteness|Definite]]) + ''mei’a'' (Banana) ''&lt;u&gt;ra&lt;/u&gt;'' (Deixis)
*** 'I would like those bananas (you mentioned).'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reo Rapa: A Polynesian Contact Language — Journal of Language Contact|last=Walworth|first=Mary|publisher=Brill|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mortlockese ===
[[Mortlockese]] is an Austronesian language made up of eleven dialects over the eleven atolls that make up the [[Mortlock Islands (disambiguation)|Mortlock Islands]] in Micronesia. Various TAM markers are used in the language. Mood markers include the past tense [[hortative]] (marking encouragement or to urge) ''aa'', the hortative ''kɞ'' which denotes a polite tone, ''min'' or ''tin'' to stress the importance of something, and the word ''tɞ'' to denote warning or caution. Each of these markers is used in conjunction with the subject proclitics except for the ''aa'' marker. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odango|first1=Emerson Lopez|title=Afféú Fangani ‘Join Together’: A Morphophonemic Analysis of Possessive Suffix Paradigms and A Discourse-Based Ethnography of the Elicitation Session in Pakin Lukunosh Mortlockese|date=May 2015|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa Dissertation|url=http://ling.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/Dissertation_ODANGO-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
DePaul grew up in Maryland and graduated from NYU. After college, he worked as a private investigator and wrote for ''[[The Washington Post]]''. In 1998, DePaul moved to Los Angeles, where he directed his own play, ''Motherlove''. DePaul teamed with writer Hank Nelken to create a comic short film, ''Jerry Mashugana'', a parody of the hit comedy ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', which starred [[Matt Damon]], [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Demi Moore]].

==Career==
''[[Saving Silverman]]'', starring [[Jack Black]] and [[Jason Biggs]], which was released by Sony Pictures in 2001. The film falls within a cross-genre film type from the late 1990s and early 2000s in which grooms are saved, or nearly saved, from distasteful marriage.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;Adam Sternbergh (January 28, 2004). [http://www.slate.com/id/2094507/ "The Devil Wears Pearls: In recent movies, grooms across America flee their frigid fiancees"].

The film grossed a domestic total of $19,402,030 and $26,086,706 worldwide from a $22&amp;nbsp;million budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{mojo title|savingsilverman|Saving Silverman}}&lt;!--whole para so far--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Killer Bud'', was produced independently. It was [[Robert Stack]]'s final film prior to his death in 2003.

He then wrote ''Bride Wars'', starring Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway and Candace Bergen. DePaul got the idea when he and his wife were planning a double wedding with her sister.&lt;ref name="scriptmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scriptmag.com/features/career-features/selling-screenplay-screenwriter-greg-depaul-career-writing-comedy|title=Selling Your Screenplay: Screenwriter Greg DePaul on His Career Writing Comedy - Script Magazine|website=scriptmag.com|accessdate=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la-screenwriter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-screenwriter.com/2016/11/28/screenwriter-greg-depaul-on-his-career-as-a-comedy-screenwriter/|title=Screenwriter Greg DePaul On His Career as a Comedy Screenwriter|website=LA Screenwriter|accessdate=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its opening weekend, the film grossed $21,058,173 ranking #2 at the box office.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bridewars.htm |title=Bride Wars (2009) |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese [[remake]] [[Bride Wars (2015 film)|of the same name]] was released in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/bride-wars-review-1201576787/|title= Film Review: ‘Bride Wars’|author= Maggie Lee|date= August 24, 2015|accessdate= 2015-10-10|work= [[variety.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Muiredach s Cross.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Muiredach's High Cross]], [[Monasterboice]], 9th or 10th century]]
[[File:Cloncha cross church.jpg|thumb|A simpler example, [[Culdaff]], [[County Donegal]], Ireland]]
A '''high cross''' or '''standing cross''' ({{lang-ga|cros ard / ardchros}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focal.ie/Search.aspx?term=cros ard&amp;lang=2 Focal]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-gd|crois àrd / àrd-chrois}}, {{lang-cy|croes uchel / croes eglwysig}}) is a free-standing Christian [[cross]] made of stone and often richly decorated. There was a unique [[Early Medieval]] tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses, usually outdoors. These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood, perhaps with metalwork attachments, and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones; the [[Pictish stones]] of Scotland may also have influenced the form. The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]], which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain. 

Their [[relief]] decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as [[knotwork]], [[interlace (art)|interlace]] and in Britain [[vine-scrolls]], all in the styles also found in [[insular art]] in other media such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and metalwork. They were probably normally painted, perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs, in particular scenes crowded with small figures, are often now rather indistinct and hard to read.

The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high, but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later, retaining thick massive proportions, giving large surface areas for carving. [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] examples mostly remained slender in comparison, but could be large; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures.  The crosses often, though not always, feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a [[Celtic cross]]; this seems clearly an innovation of [[Celtic Christianity]], perhaps at [[Iona]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 118&lt;/ref&gt; The term "high cross" is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland, but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon, though there are certainly strong regional variations.

Some crosses were erected just outside churches and monasteries; others at sites that may have marked boundaries or crossroads, or preceded churches. Whether they were used as "[[preaching cross]]es" at early dates is unclear, and many crosses have been moved to their present locations.  They do not seem to have been used as grave-markers in the early medieval period.  In the 19th century [[Celtic Revival]] Celtic crosses, with decoration in a form of insular style, became very popular as gravestones and memorials, and are now found in many parts of the world.  Unlike the Irish originals, the decoration usually does not include figures.

==Ireland and Britain==

High crosses are the primary surviving monumental works of [[Insular art]], and the largest number in Britain survive from areas that remained under [[Celtic Christianity]] until relatively late.  No examples, or traces, of the putative earlier forms in wood or with metal attachments have survived; the decorative repertoire of early crosses certainly borrows from that of metalwork, but the same is true of Insular illuminated manuscripts.  Saint [[Adomnán]], [[Abbot of Iona]] who died in 704, mentions similar free standing ringed wooden crosses, later replaced by stone versions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Archaeology of late Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. 400–1200 AD, Lloyd Robert Laing, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the earliest surviving free-standing stone crosses are at [[Carndonagh]], [[Donegal]], which appear to be erected by missionaries from [[Iona]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Françoise. ''Irish art in the early Christian period'', 1940&lt;/ref&gt; fleeing the Viking raiders, "giving Iona a critical role in the formation of ringed crosses".&lt;ref&gt;Catherine E. Karkov, Michael Ryan, Robert T. Farrell, ''The insular tradition'', p.138, SUNY Press, 1997, also citing ''The Chronology and Relationship of some Irish and Scottish Crosses'', J.R.S.A.I 86 [1956], pp. 85–89 by R.B.K Stevenson&lt;/ref&gt; The round bosses seen on early crosses probably derive from Pictish stones. High crosses may exist from the 7th century in [[Northumbria]], which then included much of south-east Scotland, and Ireland, though Irish dates are being moved later. However the dates assigned to most of the early crosses surviving in good condition, whether at Ruthwell and Bewcastle, the Western [[Kingdom of Ossory|Ossory]] group&lt;ref&gt;(Nancy Edwards, 1982.) ''A reassessment of the early medieval stone crosses and related stone sculpture of Offaly, Kilkenyn and Tipperary.''   http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7418/1/7418_4483-vol1.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; in Ireland, [[Iona]] or the [[Kildalton Cross]] on [[Islay]], have all shown a tendency to converge on the period around or slightly before 800, despite the differences between the Northumbrian and Celtic types. The high cross later spread to the rest of the British Isles, including the Celtic areas of [[Wales]], Devon, Brittany and [[Cornwall]], where [[ogham]] inscriptions also indicate an Irish presence, and some examples can be found on Continental Europe, particularly where the style was taken by Insular missionaries. 

Most Irish High crosses have the distinctive shape of the ringed [[Celtic cross]], and they are generally larger and more massive, and feature more figural decoration than those elsewhere. They have probably more often survived as well; most recorded crosses in Britain were destroyed or damaged by [[iconoclasm]] after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and typically only sections of the shaft remain. The ring initially served to strengthen the head and the arms of the high cross, but it soon became a decorative feature as well.

The high crosses were status symbols, either for a [[monastery]] or for a sponsor or patron, and possibly [[preaching cross]]es, and may have had other functions. Some have inscriptions recording the donor who commissioned them, like [[Muiredach's High Cross]] and the [[Bewcastle Cross]].  The earliest 8th- or 9th-century Irish crosses had only ornament, including interlace and round bosses, but from the 9th and 10th century, figurative images appear, sometimes just a figure of Christ crucified in the centre, but in the largest 10th century examples large numbers of figures over much of the surface.  Some late Irish examples have fewer figures, approaching life-size, and carved in very high relief.  The Irish tradition largely died out after the 12th century, until the 19th-century [[Celtic Revival]], when the Celtic cross form saw a lasting revival for gravestones and memorials, usually just using ornamental decoration and inscriptions.  These are now found across the world, often in contexts without any specific link to the Insular Celts or Britain.

[[Anglo-Saxon cross]]es were typically more slender, and often nearly square in section, though when, as with the [[Ruthwell Cross]] and [[Bewcastle Cross]], they were geographically close to areas of the Celtic Church, they seem to have been larger, perhaps to meet local expectations, and the two 9th century [[Mercia]]n [[Sandbach Crosses]] are the largest up to that period from anywhere.  The heads tend to be smaller and usually not Celtic crosses, although the majority of cross-heads have not survived at all.  Carved figures in these large examples are much larger and carved in deeper relief than the Irish equivalents with similar dates – only some very late Irish crosses show equally large figures.  Anglo-Saxon decoration often combines panels of vine-leaf scrolls with others of interlace, although the placement and effect from a distance is similar to Celtic examples.  Smaller examples may have only had such decoration, and inscriptions, which are much more common on Anglo-Saxon than Irish crosses.

After the [[Viking]] invasions, the settled [[Norse language|Norse]] population of the [[Danelaw]] adopted the form, and a number of crosses combine Christian imagery with pagan [[Sagas|Norse myths]], which the Church seems to have tolerated, and adopted at least as metaphors for the period when conversion was bedding down.  The [[Gosforth Cross]], a very rare almost-complete cross in England, is an example.  By the 10th century such Anglo-Norse crosses were the bulk of the production in England, as the high cross seems to have been abandoned further south, although the simple and practical [[Dartmoor crosses]], no doubt an essential aid to navigating [[Dartmoor]], appear to have continued to be made for centuries after.  Given the tough [[granite]] used, decoration is mostly slight and they are hard to date confidently. [[Market cross]]es, many once dating to the Early Medieval period, have continued to be erected and replaced until modern times.

In [[Pict]]ish Scotland the cross-slab, a flat stone with a cross in relief or incised on an essentially rectangular stone, developed as a hybrid form of the [[Pictish stone]] and the high cross.  The cross is normally only on one side of the stone and the remaining areas of the stone may be covered with interlace or other decoration.  These are usually distinguished from true high crosses.

==Scandinavia==
The tradition of raising high crosses appeared at a time when Norse settlers appeared in the British Isles and met a Christian culture. A fragmentary cross has been discovered in Granhammar in Vintrosa parish in [[Närke]], [[Sweden]] and testify to the English mission in the central Swedish provinces. In Norway the British tradition was more widely accepted and some 60 stone crosses are known from the country, but only four of them can be safely dated to the Viking Age thanks to runic inscriptions on the crosses. Many of the crosses have probably been raised on pagan grave fields when the family was baptised. Later, they were moved to cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histvarld.historiska.se/histvarld/sok/artikel.asp?id=11102 The entry ''Stenkors'' in ''Vikingatidens ABC'' by Göran Tegnér.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819054426/http://histvarld.historiska.se/histvarld/sok/artikel.asp?id=11102 |date=19 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high cross tradition also probably helped increase the popularity of raising [[runestone]]s (often with engraved crosses) in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K.

==Notable crosses==
[[File:High Crosses of Ireland (map).png|thumb|Location of high crosses in Ireland.]]
Amongst the most famous are:&lt;!-- Those with articles about, or with GOOD information on, the actual cross at the top --&gt;
*[[Muiredach's High Cross|Muiredach's Cross]] and West Cross at [[Monasterboice]], [[County Louth]]
* The [[Clonmacnoise]] crosses: Cross of the Scriptures (the original 9th century cross is housed in a museum, but a copy stands on the original site), and the North and South Crosses.
* The Nether (or Lower) Cross, a 9th-century granite cross with ornate carving, in the graveyard of St. Canice's Church, established by St. Canice, Finglas village, Dublin.  The Cross was taken from its original location in the grounds of St. Canice's Abbey and buried to prevent damage by Cromwellian forces in 1649. It was found 160 years later intact and moved to its present location.
* The Anglo-Saxon [[Ruthwell Cross]] from Scotland, 8th century, with relatively large figures.
* The Anglo-Saxon [[Bewcastle Cross]] Northumbrian
* The Anglo-Saxon [[Irton Cross]], Cumbria showing affinity to the style of Bewcastle
* The [[Pictish]]/[[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Medieval]] [[Dupplin Cross]] in [[Perth and Kinross|Strathearn]], Scotland
* The Pictish/Early Medieval [[Camus Cross]] in Angus, Scotland
[[File:Graiguenamanach High Crosses East Side 1997 08 27.jpg|thumb|Graiguenamanach crosses, [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]], east side]]
* Classic examples of 9th-century [[Pictish]] cross-slabs: [[Aberlemno Sculptured Stones|Aberlemno 2 and 3]] at [[Aberlemno]], Angus

A 12th-century cross at [[Dysert O Dea monastery|Dysert O'Dea]] near [[O'Dea Castle]] showing Christ and a bishop carved in high relief on the east side, with geometric motifs and animal ornament on the other sides. On the west side of the base are shown the Temptation, with Adam and Eve beneath the tree of knowledge, while on the north side is some ceremony with several figures holding croziers. This is a particularly finely preserved twelfth-century example, that does not use the circle of the Celtic cross.
* The [[Ahenny]] High Crosses. The two sandstone Ahenny crosses date from the 8th to 9th centuries and are among the earliest of the ringed high crosses. Ahenny, County Tipperary, near the Kilkenny border, and the Monastic site of Kilclispeen, or the church of [[St. Crispen]]
*[[Ardboe High Cross]], a 10th-century cross near [[Cookstown, County Tyrone|Cookstown]], eroded, showing 22 panels with scenes from the Old and New Testaments.

* South Cross, [[Kells, County Meath]], the best preserved of several 10th century crosses in the town.
*Doorty Cross, [[Kilfenora]], [[County Clare]]; 12th century, has a bishop and two other clerics carved on it.
* [[Kilree]] High Cross, 9th century high cross said to be the burial place of [[Niall Caille]], located 4&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Kells Priory]], [[Co. Kilkenny]].

==Modern period==
From the 19th century, many large modern versions have been erected for various functions, and smaller Celtic crosses have become popular for individual grave monuments, usually featuring only abstract ornament, usually [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]].

In 1887, the Rev. William Slater Calverley commissioned a replica life-sized copy of Gosforth cross and had it erected in the churchyard at Aspatria, Cumbria.[3]

In the early 21st century, Irish sculptor Brendan McGloin was commissioned by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Portland to handcraft a full size replica of the Clonmacnoise Cross of the Scriptures. The 13-foot, 5 tonne sandstone cross was completed in 2007 and shipped from [[Donegal]] to [[Portland, Oregon]], where it will stand as a Famine memorial. In 2016, a high cross was erected outside [[Wakefield Cathedral]], West Yorkshire, England, carved from stone quarried in [[Holmfirth]] and carved by Celia Kilner. This was based on the remains of a Saxon high cross, dated 930 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pontefractandcastlefordexpress.co.uk/news/local-news/saxon-cross-raised-at-wakefield-cathedral-1-7816824|title=Saxon cross raised at Wakefield Cathedral|website=www.pontefractandcastlefordexpress.co.uk|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seiyaku.com/customs/crosses/wakefield.html|title=Wakefield Cathedral Cross|website=seiyaku.com|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical negationism'''&lt;ref&gt;The term "negationism" derives from the French [[neologism]] ''négationnisme'', denoting Holocaust denial.(Kornberg, Jacques. [https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-494822161/the-future-of-a-negation-reflections-on-the-question The Future of a Negation: Reflections on the Question of Genocide.(Review) (book review)], [[Shofar]], January 2001). It is now also sometimes used for more general political historical revisionism as [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001238/123862e.pdf (PDF) UNESCO against racism world conference] 31 August – 7 September 2001 "Given the ignorance with which it is treated, the slave trade comprises one of the most radical forms of historical negationism."&lt;br /&gt;
Pascale Bloch has written in ''International law: Response to Professor Fronza's The punishment of Negationism'' (Accessed ProQuest Database, 12 October 2011) that:
{{quote| "[R]evisionists" are understood as "negationists" in order to differentiate them from "historical revisionists" since their goal is either to prove that the Holocaust did not exist or to introduce confusion regarding the victims and German executioners regardless of historical and scientific methodology and evidence. For those reasons, the term "revisionism" is often considered confusing since it conceals misleading ideologies that purport to avoid disapproval by presenting "revisions" of the past based on pseudo-scientific methods, while really they are a part of negationism.|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kriss Ravetto (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pOyPsK8yClsC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UemJokdA6a&amp;sig=hLmLmoTDNl1et_sWd8oPqHMvUXw&amp;hl=en The Unmaking of Fascist Aesthetics], University of Minnesota Press {{ISBN|0-8166-3743-1}}. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; or '''[[denialism]]''' is an illegitimate distortion of the historical record. It is often imprecisely or intentionally incorrectly referred to as ''[[historical revisionism]]'', but that term also denotes a legitimate academic pursuit of re-interpretation of the historical record and questioning the accepted views.&lt;ref name="Berger-154"&gt;"The two leading critical exposés of Holocaust denial in the United States were written by historians [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (1993) and [[Michael Shermer]] and Alex Grobman (2000). These scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial. Revisionism, in their view, entails a refinement of existing knowledge about an historical event, not a denial of the event itself, that comes through the examination of new empirical evidence or a re-examination or reinterpretation of existing evidence. Legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a 'certain body of irrefutable evidence' or a 'convergence of evidence' that suggest that an event – like the black plague, American slavery, or the Holocaust – did in fact occur (Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer &amp; Grobman 200:34). Denial, on the other hand, rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence.&amp;nbsp;... " Ronald J. Berger. ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach'', Aldine Transaction, 2002, {{ISBN|0-202-30670-4}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempting to revise the past, illegitimate historical revisionism may use techniques inadmissible in proper historical discourse, such as presenting known forged documents as genuine; inventing ingenious but implausible reasons for distrusting genuine documents; attributing conclusions to books and sources that report the opposite; manipulating statistical series to support the given point of view; and deliberately mis-translating texts (in languages other than the revisionist's).&lt;ref name="Evans-145"&gt;''Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial'', by [[Richard J. Evans]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-465-02153-0}}. p. 145. The author is a professor of Modern History, at the [[University of Cambridge]], and was a major expert-witness in the ''Irving v. Lipstadt'' trial; the book presents his perspective of the trial, and the expert-witness report, including his research about the Dresden death count.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries, such as Germany, have criminalised the negationist revision of certain historical events, while others take a more cautious position for various reasons, such as protection of [[free speech]]; still others mandate negationist views.

Notable examples of negationism include [[Holocaust denial]], [[Armenian Genocide denial]], [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese war crime denial]]&lt;ref name="Mehnert1952Marx"&gt;Klaus Mehnert, ''Stalin Versus Marx: the Stalinist historical doctrine'' (Translation of ''Weltrevolution durch Weltgeschichte'') Port Washington NY: Kennikat Press 1972 (1952), on the illegitimate use of history in the 1934–1952 period.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Markwick"&gt;Roger D. Markwick, ''Rewriting history in Soviet Russia : the politics of revisionist historiography, 1956–1974'' New York ; Basingstoke : Palgrave, 2001, on legitimate Soviet Historiography particularly in the post 1956 period.&lt;/ref&gt; and the denial of Soviet crimes such as the [[Holodomor]], [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]], the [[Katyn massacre]], and the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced deporations of Poles, Romanians/Moldovans, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Tatars etc.]] 

In literature, the consequences of historical negationism have been imaginatively depicted in some [[social science fiction|works of fiction]], such as ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', by [[George Orwell]]. In modern times, negationism may spread via new media, such as the [[Internet]].
{{TOC limit}}

==Origin of the term==
The term "negationism" (''négationnisme'') was first coined by the French historian [[Henry Rousso]] in his 1987 book ''The Vichy Syndrome'' which looked at the French popular [[memory]] of [[Vichy France]] and the [[French Resistance]]. Rousso argued that it was necessary to distinguish between legitimate [[historical revisionism]] in [[Holocaust studies]] and politically-motivated denial of the Holocaust, which he termed negationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkielkraut|first1=Alain|title=The Future of a Negation: Reflections on the Question of Genocide|date=1998|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=978-0-8032-2000-3|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Usually, the purpose of historical negation is to achieve a national, political aim, by transferring war-guilt, demonizing an enemy, providing an illusion of victory, or preserving a friendship.&lt;ref name="lass1"&gt;Harold D. Lasswell, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Propaganda_technique_in_the_world_war.html?id=e5PtAAAAMAAJ Propaganda Technique in World War I.] 1927, MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-62018-9}} pp. xxii–xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the purpose of a revised history is to sell more books or to attract attention with a newspaper headline.&lt;ref name="danc2"&gt;Matthew d'Ancona, [http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3T2M-9PN0-00H1-F2PP&amp;csi=10939&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true History men battle over Britain's future.] The Times, 9 May 1994; ProQuest Database (. Retrieved 12 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[James M. McPherson]] said that negationists would want revisionist history understood as, "a consciously-falsified or distorted interpretation of the past to serve partisan or ideological purposes in the present".&lt;ref name="mcphear1"&gt;McPherson disagrees with this as the sole definition of revisionist history – he argues rightly that revisionism (academically) is the 'lifeblood of history.' James McPherson. [http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2003/0309/0309pre1.cfm Revisionist Historians]. Perspectives, 2003. American Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideological influence===
{{See also|Social influence|War of ideas}}
The principal functions of negationist history are the abilities to control ideological influence and to control political influence.
In "History Men Battle over Britain's Future", Michael d’Ancona said that historical negationists "seem to have been given a collective task in [a] nation's cultural development, the full significance of which is emerging only now: To redefine [national] status in a changing world".&lt;ref name= "d'An"&gt;Matthew d'Ancona; [http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3T2M-9PN0-00H1-F2PP&amp;csi=10939&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true History men battle over Britain's future.] The Times, 9 May 1994; ProQuest Database (Retrieved 12 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; History is a social resource that contributes to shaping [[national identity]], culture, and the public memory. Through the study of history, people are imbued with a particular cultural identity; therefore, by negatively revising history, the negationist can craft a specific, ideological identity. Because historians are credited as people who single-mindedly pursue truth, by way of fact, negationist historians capitalize on the historian's [[Reputation|professional credibility]], and present their [[pseudohistory]] as true scholarship.&lt;ref name="Lasswell-51"&gt;{{cite book |first=Harold D. |last =Lasswell |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Propaganda_technique_in_the_world_war.html?id=e5PtAAAAMAAJ |title=Propaganda Technique in World War I.|year=1927 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-62018-9 | page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; By adding a measure of credibility to the work of revised history, the ideas of the negationist historian are more readily accepted in the public mind.&lt;ref name="Lasswell-51"/&gt; As such, professional historians recognize the revisionist practice of historical negationism as the work of "truth-seekers" finding different truths in the historical record to fit their political, social, and ideological contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lasswell|1927|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political influence===
History provides insight into past political policies and consequences, and thus assists people in extrapolating political implications for contemporary society. Historical negationism is applied to cultivate a specific [[political myth]]&amp;nbsp;– sometimes with official consent from the government&amp;nbsp;– whereby self-taught, amateur, and dissident academic [[historian]]s either manipulate or misrepresent historical accounts to achieve political ends. In the USSR (1917–91), the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and [[Historiography in the Soviet Union|Soviet historiography]] treated [[reality]] and the [[party line (politics)|party line]] as the same [[Intellectualism|intellectual entity]];&lt;ref&gt;Taisia Osipova, "Peasant rebellions: Origin, Scope, Design and Consequences", in Vladimir N. Brovkin (ed.), ''The Bolsheviks in Russian Society: The Revolution and the Civil Wars'', Yale University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-300-06706-2}}. pp. 154–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet historical negationism advanced a specific, political and ideological agenda about Russia and its place in world history.&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Markwick, Donald J. Raleigh, ''Rewriting History in Soviet Russia: The Politics of Revisionist Historiography'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2001, {{ISBN|0-333-79209-2}}, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques of negationism==
Historical negationism applies the techniques of research, quotation, and presentation for [[deception]] of the reader and [[denial]] of the historical record. In support of the "revised history" perspective, the negationist historian uses [[false documents]] as genuine sources, presents specious reasons to distrust genuine documents, exploits published opinions, by quoting out of historical context, manipulates [[statistics]], and mistranslates texts in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Tennent H. Bagley, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Spy_wars.html?id=Ng7myCguewAC Spy Wars]¸ Yale University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-300-12198-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12198-8}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The revision techniques of historical negationism operate in the [[academic research|intellectual space]] of public debate for the advancement of a given interpretation of history and the cultural-perspective of the "revised history".&lt;ref name= "Dionne1"&gt;Dionne, E.J. Jr. [http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3SJF-B8B0-002S-T1J1&amp;csi=8075&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true Cold War Scholars Fault Stalin: Soviet Historians Lean to U.S. View]. The Washington Post. 26 July 1990. LexisNexis Database (Retrieved 12 October 2011). First Section, p. A3.&lt;/ref&gt; As a document, the revised history is used to negate the validity of the factual, documentary record, and so reframe explanations and perceptions of the discussed historical event, in order to deceive the reader, the listener, and the viewer; therefore, historical negationism functions as a technique of [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Nargor1"&gt;Nagorski, Andrew.

LexisNexis Database(. Retrieved 12 October 2011)Vol. 151 No 11. {{ISSN|0163-7053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than submit their works for [[peer review]], negationist historians rewrite history and use [[fallacy|logical fallacies]] to construct arguments that will obtain the desired results, a "revised history" that supports an agenda&amp;nbsp;– political, ideological, religious, etc.&lt;ref name="Evans-145"/&gt; In the practice of [[historiography]], the British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] describes the technical differences, between [[historical revisionism|professional historians]] and negationist historians:

{{quote|Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account, and, if necessary, amend their own case, accordingly. They do not present, as genuine, documents which they know to be forged, just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious, but implausible, and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents, because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments, if this is the case, or, indeed, abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources, which, in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages in order to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not willfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events, for which there is no historical evidence, in order to make their arguments more plausible.&lt;ref name="Evans-Pgrph-6-20"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition, [http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/defense/evans/6.html 6. General Conclusion] Paragraphs 6.20,6.21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Deception===
{{See also| Disinformation}}
Deception includes falsifying information, [[Obscurantism|obscuring the truth]], and lying in order to manipulate public opinion about the historical event discussed in the revised history. The negationist historian applies the techniques of deception to achieve either a political or an [[Ideology|ideological]] goal, or both. The field of history distinguishes among history books based upon credible, verifiable sources, and were [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] before publication; and deceptive history books, based upon incredible sources, and which were not submitted for peer review.&lt;ref&gt;Falsifier:
* Jon Silverman [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4449212.stm How 'Holocaust denier' fought and lost] on the [[BBC]] web-site 18 November 2005
* [[Malte Herwig]] "[http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,395810,00.html The Swastika Wielding Provocateur]" in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 16 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction among types of history-book rests upon the research techniques used in writing a history. Verifiability, accuracy, and openness to criticism are central tenets of historical [[Scholarly method|scholarship]]. When these techniques are sidestepped, the presented historical information might be deliberately deceptive, a "revised history".

===Denial===
{{See also| Denialism| Conspiracy theory}}
Denial is defensively protecting information from being shared with other historians, and claiming that facts are untrue&amp;nbsp;– especially denial of the [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] perpetrated in the course of the [[World War II]] (1939–45) and the [[Holocaust]] (1933–45). The negationist historian protects the historical-revisionism project by [[blame shifting|shifting the blame]], censorship, distraction, and [[media manipulation]]; occasionally, denial by protection includes [[risk management]] for the physical security of revisionist sources.
{{Further information|Holocaust denial| Criticism of Holocaust denial }}

===Relativization and trivialization===
{{main article|Holocaust trivialization}}
Comparing certain historical atrocities to other crimes is the practice of relativization, interpretation by moral judgements, in order to alter public perception of the first historical atrocity. Although such comparisons can often occur in negationist history, their pronouncement is not usually part of revisionist intentions upon the historical facts, but an opinion of [[moral judgement]].
* The Holocaust and [[Nazism]]: The historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] said that the concept of "comparable Allied wrongs", such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]] from [[Lebensraum|Nazi-colonised lands]] and the formal [[Allied war crimes during World War II|Allied war crimes]], is at the center of, and is a continually repeated theme of, contemporary [[Holocaust denial]], that such relativization presents "immoral equivalencies".&lt;ref&gt;Barry Loberfeld, [http://abcdunlimited.com/ideas/denying.html "Denying the Other Holocausts"]: Professor Lipstadt's Own Assault on Truth and Memory, [[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]], May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{Denial of mass killings}}

===Book burning===

Repositories of literature have been targeted throughout history (e.g., the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|Library of Alexandria]]), burning of the liturgical and historical books of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|St. Thomas Christians]] by the [[Patriarch of the East Indies|archbishop of Goa]] [[Aleixo de Menezes]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gouvea, Jornada (Coimbra, 1606);Geddes,"History of the Malabar Church", London, 1694&lt;/ref&gt; including recently, such as the [[Burning of Jaffna library]] and the destruction of Iraqi libraries by ISIS during the [[fall of Mosul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/26/isis-destroys-thousands-books-libraries|last=Fadhil|first=Muna|title=Isis destroys thousands of books and manuscripts in Mosul libraries |date=26 February 2015|accessdate=17 July 2015|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chinese book burning====
The ''[[Burning of books and burying of scholars]]'' ({{zh|t=焚書坑儒|s=焚书坑儒|p=fénshū kēngrú|l=burning of books and burying (alive) of (Confucian) scholars|first=t}}), or "Fires of Qin", refers to the burning of writings and slaughter of scholars during the [[Qin Dynasty]] of [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], between the period of 213 and 210 BC. "Books" at this point refers to writings on [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo strips]], which were then bound together. This contributed to the loss to history of many philosophical theories of proper government (known as "the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]"). The official philosophy of government ("[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]") survived.

====Nazi book burning====
{{main article|Nazi book burnings}}
 [[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A Nazi-sponsored book burning meant to negate the value of Germany's literary history (10 May 1933, Berlin).]]
In the mid–1930s, the [[Nazi book burnings]] were part of a campaign of [[anti-intellectualism]] conducted throughout [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] by the ''[[Deutsche Studentenschaft]]'' (German Student Association) of the [[Third Reich]] (1933–45). The burning of books was a public ceremony in which the works of authors whose politics were [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]], [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Socialism|Socialist]], [[Pacifism|pacifist]], and [[Communism|Communist]] were fuel for bonfires. Given the official [[antisemitism]] of the Reich, the works of [[Jews|Jewish]] writers were specifically identified for burning; thus did Nazi Germany rid themselves of writers deemed subversive of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] ideology.

In Poland, the ''Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen'' ("[[Special Prosecution Book-Poland]]") was the book of political proscription for the killing of socially important Poles who might lead resistance against the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|Nazi Occupation of Poland]] (1939–45). Compiled before the war began in 1939, the book contained lists that identified more than 61,000 members of the Polish elites&amp;nbsp;– political and social [[activist]]s, the [[intelligentsia]], [[Academia|scholars]], actors, former [[military officer]]s&amp;nbsp;– as enemies of the state dangerous to the Third Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacwashmetrodiv.org/events/holoc04/moor-jankowski.htm|title=Poland's Holocaust|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Germany-occupied France]], anti-fascist exiles made a "Library of Burned Books" of every book that [[Adolf Hitler]] had ordered destroyed in France. It listed copies of titles that had been burned. The book burnings in France were an idea that the [[Révolution nationale|French fascists]], of the collaborating [[Vichy government]] (1940–44), borrowed from the Nazis, to cleanse French culture of Jewish intellectualism and the foreign politics of [[pacifism]], decadent literature, and [[degenerate art]], as the Nazis had cleansed German culture. In the event, after the [[Final Solution]] had concluded, for the post-war world, the Nazis had planned to establish a museum of Judaism that would have featured selected books of Jewish culture, preserved ''in memoriam'' of the extinct Jews of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books:A Living History|year=2011|publisher=J.Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|pages=200–01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States history===
====Confederate revisionism====
{{Main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Neo-Confederate}}
The historical negationism of [[American Civil War]] revisionists and [[Neo-Confederate]]s claims that the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] (1861–65) were the defenders rather than the instigators of the war, and that the Confederacy's motivation for secession from the [[United States]] was the maintenance of the southern states' rights and limited government, rather than the preservation and expansion of the [[chattel slavery]] of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Confronting Civil War Revisionism: Why the South Went to War | url=http://www.wallbuilders.com/libissuesarticles.asp?id=92 | author=David Barton |work=Wall Builders | date=December 2008 | accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Neoconfederate civil war revisionism: Those who commemorate the South's fallen heroes are entitled to do so, but not to deny that slavery was the war's prime cause| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/26/american-civil-war-usa | author=Barrett Brown |work=TheGuardian.com | date=27 December 2010 | accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Howard Swint: Confederate revisionism warps U.S. history|url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/Opinion/Commentary/201106140917 | work=Charleston Daily Mail | date=June 15, 2011 | accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Neo-Confederate revisionism of the U.S. Civil War, the historian [[Brooks D. Simpson]] said that:

{{quote|This is an active attempt to reshape historical memory, an effort by white Southerners to find historical justifications for present-day actions. The neo–Confederate movement's ideologues have grasped that if they control how people remember the past, they'll control how people approach the present and the future. Ultimately, this is a very conscious war for memory and heritage. It's a quest for [[wikt:legitimacy|legitimacy]], the eternal quest for justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2000/arizona-state-professor-brooks-d-simpson-discusses-neo-confederate-movement|author=Southern Poverty Law Center|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|work=White Lies|date=2000|title=Arizona State Professor Brooks D. Simpson Discusses Neo-Confederate Movement|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the early 20th century, [[Mildred Rutherford]], the historian general of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] (UDC), led the attack against [[American history]] textbooks that did not present the ''[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]]'' (ca. 1900) version of the history of the U.S. Civil War. To that pedagogical end, Rutherford assembled a "massive collection" of documents that included "essay contests on the glory of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and personal tributes to faithful slaves".&lt;ref&gt;Blight, David W.

The post-war minimisation of the war crimes of [[Japanese imperialism]] is an example of "illegitimate" historical revisionism;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmu.edu/academic/ijps/vol5_2/oh_grbi.htm "Forgiving the culprits: Japanese historical revisionism in a post-cold war context"] published in the ''International Journal of Peace Studies''&lt;/ref&gt; some contemporary Japanese revisionists, such as Yūko Iwanami (granddaughter of General [[Hideki Tojo]]), propose that Japan's invasion of China, and [[World War II]], itself, were justified reactions to racist Western imperialism of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=458V-5VC0-0197-80BW&amp;csi=244786&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true "Now Tojo is a Hero"] ''The Daily Telegraph''.

====Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav wars====
{{Main article|Serbia in the Yugoslav Wars}}
There have been a number of scholars and political activists who have publicly disagreed with mainstream views of [[Serbia in the Yugoslav Wars#War crimes|Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav wars]] of 1991–1999. Among the points of contention are whether the victims of massacres such as the [[Račak massacre]] and [[Srebrenica massacre]] were unarmed civilians or armed resistance fighters, whether death and rape tolls were inflated, and whether prison camps such as [[Sremska Mitrovica camp]] were sites of mass war crimes.

These scholars are labeled "revisionists" by their opponents. For example, [[Diana Johnstone]]'s controversial book, ''Fools' Crusade: Yugoslavia, Nato, and Western Delusions'', questions whether genocidal killings occurred in Srebrenica. The book was rejected by publishers in Sweden&lt;ref name="MAH"&gt;Marko Attila Hoare [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=6494 "Chomsky's Genocidal Denial"] {{Webarchive|url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171019225839/http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=6494 |date=19 October 2017 }}, FrontPage magazine, 23 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; prompting an open letter in 2003 defending Johnstone's book (and her right to publish) which was signed by, among others, [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Arundhati Roy]], [[Tariq Ali]] and [[John Pilger]]: "We regard Diana Johnstone's ''Fools' Crusade'' as an outstanding work, dissenting from the mainstream view but doing so by an appeal to fact and reason, in a great tradition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagglundsforlag.se/forfattaredok/johnstone/ChomskyDararnas.htm "To whom it may concern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208074819/http://www.hagglundsforlag.se/forfattaredok/Johnstone/ChomskyDararnas.htm |date=8 February 2012 }}, hagglundsforlag (Sweden)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnn.se/n-model/foreign/ordfront.pdf "Attack of the Zarembites",] ''Ordfront'' (Sweden), April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Richard Caplan of Reading and Oxford University reviewed the work in '' [[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'', where he described the work as "a revisionist and highly contentious account of western policy and the dissolution of Yugoslavia".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Caplan [http://www.politicalreviewnet.com/polrev/reviews/INTA/R_0020_5850_624_17222.asp "Fool's crusade: Yugoslavia, NATO and western delusions by Diana Johnstone Pluto Press, London",] ''International Affairs'', 79: 2, pp. 413–74, as reproduced on Political Reviewnet, 18 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Marko Attila Hoare]] called it "an extremely poor book, one that is little more than a polemic in defence of the Serb-nationalist record during the wars of the 1990s&amp;nbsp;– and an ill-informed one at that".&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;

Turkish laws such as [[Article 301 (Turkish Penal Code)|Article 301]], that state "a person who publicly insults Turkishness, or the Republic or [the] Turkish Grand National Assembly of Turkey, shall be punishable by imprisonment", were used to criminally charge the writer [[Orhan Pamuk]] with disrespecting Turkey, for saying that "Thirty thousand Kurds, and a million [[Armenians]], were killed in these lands, and nobody, but me, dares to talk about it".&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Rainsford ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4527318.stm Author's trial set to test Turkey]'' [[BBC]] 14 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy occurred as Turkey was first vying for membership in the [[European Union]] (EU) where the suppression of dissenters is looked down upon.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;Madeleine Brand speaks with Hugh Pope ''[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5171842 Charges Against Turkish Writer Pamuk Dropped]'' [[National Public Radio|NPR]] 25 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 301 originally was part of penal-law reforms meant to modernise Turkey to EU standards, as part of negotiating Turkey's membership to the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/Article?tcmuri=tcm:29-140266-16&amp;type=News "Turkey's new penal code touches raw nerves"] EurActiv 2 June 2005, updated 14 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the charges were dropped due to pressure from the European Union and United States on the Turkish government.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

During the existence of the [[Russian SFSR]] (1917–1991) and the [[Soviet Union]] (1922–1991), the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) attempted to ideologically and politically control the writing of both academic and popular history. These attempts were most successful in 1934–52 period. According to Mehnert, the Soviets attempt to control academic [[historiography]] (the writing of history by academic historians) to promote ideological and ethno-racial [[imperialism]] by Russians.&lt;ref name="Mehnert1952Marx"/&gt;{{better source|This is a dated source; and may be Cold war propaganda|date=April 2016}} During the 1928–56 period, modern and contemporary history was generally composed according to the wishes of the CPSU, not the requirements of accepted historiographic method.&lt;ref name="Mehnert1952Marx"/&gt;

During and after the rule of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (1956–64), Soviet historiographic practice is more complicated. Although not entirely corrupted, Soviet historiography was characterized by complex competition between Stalinist and anti-Stalinist Marxist historians.&lt;ref name="Markwick"/&gt; To avoid the professional hazard of politicized history, some historians chose pre-modern, medieval history or classical history, where ideological demands were relatively relaxed and conversation with other historians in the field could be fostered;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Historian (journal)]] ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6563.1957.tb01984.x/full Encounters with Soviet Historians]'' in [[The Historian (journal)]] November 1957. Vol 20. No 1. pp. 80–95&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, despite the potential danger of proscribed ideology corrupting historians' work, not all of Soviet historiography was corrupt.&lt;ref name="Markwick"/&gt;

Control over party history and the legal status of individual ex-party members played a large role in dictating the ideological diversity and thus the faction in power within the CPSU. The history of the Communist Party was revised to delete references to leaders purged from the party, especially during the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]] (1922–53).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An example of changing visual history is the Party motivated practice of [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|altering photographs]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Historiography of the Cold War]], a controversy over negationist historical revisionism exists, where numerous revisionist scholars in the West have been accused of [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewashing]] the crimes of [[Stalinism]], overlooking the [[Katyn massacre]] in Poland and disregarding the validity of the [[Venona project|Venona messages]] with regards to [[Soviet espionage in the US|Soviet espionage in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Earl Haynes]] and [[Harvey Klehr]].

For instance in the revised texts the word "Armenian" is either simply removed or is replaced by the word "Albanian"; there are many other examples of such falsifications, all of which have the purpose of creating an impression that historically Armenians were not present in this territory.

Willem M.

===North Korea===
;The Korean War
Since the start of the [[Korean War]] (1950–53), the government of [[North Korea]] has consistently denied that the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK) launched the attack with which began the war for the Communist unification of Korea. The historiography of the DPRK maintains that the war was provoked by [[South Korea]], at the instigation of the United States:

{{quote|On June 17, Juche 39 [1950] the then U.S. President [Harry S.] Truman sent [John Foster] Dulles as his special envoy to South Korea to examine the anti-North war scenario and give an order to start the attack. On June 18, Dulles inspected the 38th parallel and the war preparations of the ‘ROK Army’ units. That day he told [[Syngman Rhee]] to start the attack on North Korea with the counter-propaganda that North Korea first ‘invaded’ the south.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Order to Start Korean War", Korean Central News Agency, 12 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further North Korean pronouncements included the claim that the U.S. needed the peninsula of Korea as "a bridgehead, for invading the Asian continent, and as a strategic base, from which to fight against national-liberation movements and socialism, and, ultimately, to attain world supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;Ho Jong Ho, Kang Sok Hui, and Pak Thae Ho, ''US Imperialists Started the Korean War'' (Pyongyang: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1993), p. 11. Accessible at http://www.uk-songun.com/index.php?p=1_110_US-IMPERIALISTS-STARTED-THE-KOREAN-WAR .&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the DPRK denied the war crimes committed by the North Korean army in the course of the war; nonetheless, in the 1951-52 period, the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) privately admitted to the "excesses" of their earlier campaign against North Korean citizens who had collaborated with the enemy&amp;nbsp;– either actually or allegedly&amp;nbsp;– during the US–South Korean occupation of North Korea. Later, the WPK blamed every war-time atrocity upon the U.S. military, e.g. the [[Sinchon Massacre]] (17 October – 7 December 1950) occurred during the retreat of the DPRK government from Hwanghae Province, in the south-west of North Korea.

The campaign against "[[Collaborationism|collaborators]]" was attributed to political and ideological manipulations by the U.S. About which the high-rank leader [[Pak Chang-ok]] said that the American enemy had "started to use a new method, namely, it donned a [[leftist]] garb, which considerably influenced the inexperienced cadres of the Party and government organs."&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Szalontai.

* "The two leading critical exposés of Holocaust denial in the United States were written by historians [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (1993) and [[Michael Shermer]] and Alex Grobman (2000). These scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial. Revisionism, in their view, entails a refinement of existing knowledge about a historical event, not a denial of the event itself, that comes through the examination of new empirical evidence or a reexamination or reinterpretation of existing evidence. Legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a "certain body of irrefutable evidence" or a "convergence of evidence" that suggest that an event – like the black plague, American slavery, or the Holocaust – did in fact occur (Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer &amp; Grobman 200:34).

It is not intended as a polemic, nor does it attempt to ascribe motives. Rather, it seeks to explain the fundamental error in the "revisionist" approach, as well as why that approach of necessity leaves no other choice. It concludes that "revisionism" is a misnomer because the facts do not accord with the position it puts forward and, more importantly, its methodology reverses the appropriate approach to historical investigation&amp;nbsp;..."Revisionism" is obliged to deviate from the standard methodology of historical pursuit because it seeks to mold facts to fit a preconceived result, it denies events that have been objectively and empirically proved to have occurred, and because it works backward from the conclusion to the facts, thus necessitating the distortion and manipulation of those facts where they differ from the preordained conclusion (which they almost always do).

* "Crucial to understanding and combating Holocaust denial is a clear distinction between denial and revisionism. One of the more insidious and dangerous aspects of contemporary Holocaust denial, a la Arthur Butz, Bradley Smith and Greg Raven, is the fact that they attempt to present their work as reputable scholarship under the guise of 'historical revisionism.' The term 'revisionist' permeates their publications as descriptive of their motives, orientation and methodology. In fact, Holocaust denial is in no sense 'revisionism,' it is denial&amp;nbsp;... Contemporary Holocaust deniers are not revisionists – not even neo-revisionists. They are ''Deniers''. Their motivations stem from their neo-nazi political goals and their rampant antisemitism."

* "Holocaust denial can be a particularly insidious form of antisemitism precisely because it often tries to disguise itself as something quite different: as genuine scholarly debate (in the pages, for example, of the innocuous-sounding Journal for Historical Review). Holocaust deniers often refer to themselves as 'revisionists', in an attempt to claim legitimacy for their activities. There are, of course, a great many scholars engaged in historical debates about the Holocaust whose work should not be confused with the output of the Holocaust deniers. Debate continues about such subjects as, for example, the extent and nature of ordinary Germans' involvement in and knowledge of the policy of genocide, and the timing of orders given for the extermination of the Jews. However, the valid endeavour of historical revisionism, which involves the re-interpretation of historical knowledge in the light of newly emerging evidence, is a very different task from that of claiming that the essential facts of the Holocaust, and the evidence for those facts, are fabrications."

* "In 1969, after David Irving's support for Rolf Hochhuth, the German playwright who accused Winston Churchill of murdering the Polish wartime leader General Sikorski, The Daily Telegraph issued a memo to all its correspondents. 'It is incorrect,' it said, 'to describe David Irving as a historian. In future we should describe him as an author.'" Ingram, Richard.

* "It may seem an absurd semantic dispute to deny the appellation of 'historian' to someone who has written two dozen books or more about historical subjects. But if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian. Those in the know, indeed, are accustomed to avoid the term altogether when referring to him and use some circumlocution such as 'historical writer' instead. Irving is essentially an ideologue who uses history for his own political purposes; he is not primarily concerned with discovering and interpreting what happened in the past, he is concerned merely to give a selective and tendentious account of it in order to further his own ideological ends in the present. The true historian's primary concern, however, is with the past. That is why, in the end, Irving is not a historian."

The [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]] were a series of pro-democracy demonstrations that were put down violently on June 4, 1989, by the Chinese government via the [[People's Liberation Army]], resulting in estimated casualty of over 10,000 deaths and 40,000 injured, obtained via later declassified documents.&lt;ref&gt;https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/daily/article/20140605/18744916}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nextplus.nextmedia.com/news/spot/20140604/46139&lt;/ref&gt;, whereas the government claimed official estimates of 0 - 200 civilian deaths. Western media referred to this crackdown as the "[[Tiananmen Square Massacre]]", and in Chinese media it was called the "June Fourth Incident".

However, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] decided to downplay and later deny the occurrence of the protests and massacre, therefore, soon afterwards, news media and internet coverage of the events were suppressed and the search terms in Chinese for "June Fourth protests", "June Fourth incident", "Tiananmen Square protests", "Tiananmen Square Massacre", and similar terms were manipulated through [[Great Firewall of China|censorship]] such that no results come up or if any, only results that have been cleaned up and relate to Tiananmen Square or June Fourth in general would be shown.  On [[Baidu]], China's largest internet search engine for the [[Chinese language]] and on [[Baidu Baike]], Baidu's version of Wikipedia, for the entry "June 4", which lists all significant events on this date in history throughout the world, for the year 1989, there's completely no mention of this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=六月四日|url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/6%E6%9C%884%E6%97%A5/8691062?fromtitle=%E5%85%AD%E6%9C%88%E5%9B%9B%E6%97%A5&amp;fromid=11272386&amp;fr=aladdin#1|website=baidu.com|date=7 June 2018|access-date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{or|date=September 2018}}

In the 1990s following a massive western media coverage of the [[Yugoslav civil war]], there was a rise of the publications considering the matter on historical revisionism of [[former Yugoslavia]]. One of the most prominent authors on the field of historical revisionism in the 1990s considering the newly emerged republics is [[Noel Malcolm]] and his works ''Bosnia: A Short History (1994)'' and ''Kosovo: A Short History (1998)'', that have seen a robust debate among historians following their release; following the release of the latter, the merits of the book were the subject of an extended debate in ''Foreign Affairs''. Critics said that the book was "marred by his sympathies for its ethnic Albanian separatists, anti-Serbian bias, and illusions about the Balkans".{{sfn|Djilas|1998}} In late 1999, Thomas Emmert of the history faculty of [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] in [[Minnesota]] reviewed the book in ''Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans Online'' and while praising aspects of the book also asserted that it was "shaped by the author's overriding determination to challenge Serbian myths", that Malcolm was "partisan", and also complained that the book made a "transparent attempt to prove that the main Serbian myths are false".{{sfn|Emmert|1999}} In 2006, a study by Frederick Anscombe looked at issues surrounding scholarship on Kosovo such as Noel Malcolm's work ''Kosovo: A Short History''.&lt;ref name="Anscombe770"/&gt; Anscombe noted that Malcolm offered a "a detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo's history" and that his work marked a "remarkable reversal" of previous acceptance by Western historians of the "Serbian account" regarding the migration of the Serbs (1690) from Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Anscombe770"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|p=770}}. "Noel Malcolm, who offers a detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo's history... Here is a remarkable reversal, as Malcolm, like other Western historians, had previously accepted the Serbian account."&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm has been criticized for being "anti-Serbian" and selective like the Serbs with the sources, while other more restrained critics note that "his arguments are unconvincing".&lt;ref name="Anscombe770771"/&gt; Anscombe noted that Malcolm, like Serbian and Yugoslav historians who have ignored his conclusions sideline and are unwilling to consider indigenous evidence such as that from the Ottoman archive when composing national history.&lt;ref name="Anscombe770771"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|pp=770–71}}. "Malcolm is criticized for being anti-Serbian, and for using his sources as selectively as the Serbs, though the more restrained of his critics only suggest that his arguments are unconvincing. Most of the documents he relies on were written by enemies of the Ottoman Empire, or by officials with limited experience of the Ottoman Balkans... Malcolm, like the historians of Serbia and Yugoslavia who ignore his findings, overlooks the most valuable indigenous evidence. Unwillingness to consider Ottoman evidence when constructing national history is exemplified by the Serbian historians..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A member of the [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]] erects a banner reading "[Give] the Children Correct History Textbooks".]]
The [[Japanese history textbook controversies|history textbook controversy]] centers upon the secondary school history textbook ''Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho'' ("New History Textbook") said to [[whitewash (censorship)|minimise]] the nature of Japanese militarism in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–95), in annexing Korea in 1910, in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–45), and in the Pacific Theater of [[World War II]] (1941–45). The conservative [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]] commissioned the ''Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho'' textbook with the purpose of traditional national and international view of that Japanese historical period. The Ministry of Education vets all history textbooks, and those that do not mention Japanese war crimes and atrocities are not vetted;{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} however, the ''Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho'' de-emphasises aggressive Japanese Imperial wartime behaviour and the matter of Chinese and Korean [[comfort women]]. It has even been denied that the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanking massacre]] (a series of violences and rapes carried on by the Japanese army against Chinese civilians during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]) ever took place (see [[Nanking Massacre denial|Nanking massacre denial]]).&lt;ref name=Hoshiyama&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoshiyama |first=Takashi |title=The Split Personality of the Nanking Massacre |url=http://www.iips.org/bp330e.pdf |date=November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101104617/http://www.iips.org/bp330e.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Ministry of Education]] attempted to revise textbooks regarding the [[Battle of Okinawa]], lessening the involvement of the Japanese military in Okinawan civilian mass suicides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070623a1.html Okinawa slams history text rewrite], ''Japan Times'', 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Okinawa-against-Tokyo%E2%80%99s-attempts-to-rewrite-history-9666.html |title=Okinawa against Tokyo's attempts to rewrite history |publisher=Asianews.it |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
{{Further information|Pakistani textbooks controversy}}
Allegations of historical revisionism have been made regarding Pakistani textbooks in that they are laced with [[Indophobic]] and [[Islamist]] bias. Pakistan's use of officially published textbooks has been criticized for using schools to more subtly foster religious extremism, whitewashing [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]] and promoting "expansive pan-Islamic imaginings" that "detect the beginnings of Pakistan in the birth of Islam on the Arabian peninsula".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30854 Curriculum of hatred], [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]], 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, the Pakistani government has stated that curriculum reforms have been underway by the [[Ministry of Education (Pakistan)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name="Jamil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itacec.org/document/nep09/NCERT%20Pakistan%20paper%20BRJ.pdf|title=Curriculum Reforms in Pakistan – A Glass Half Full or Half Empty?|last=Jamil|first=Baela Raza|publisher=Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jalal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/~ajalal01/Articles/conjuring.pdf|title=Conjuring Pakistan: History as Official Imagining|last=Jalal|first=Ayesha|work=International Journal of Middle East Studies, 27, (1995), 73–89|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/18/pakistan-textbooks-religious-extremism The threat of Pakistan's revisionist texts], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
12 October 2015, South Korea's government has announced controversial plans to control the history textbooks used in secondary schools despite oppositional concerns of people and academics that the decision is made to glorify the history of those who served the Imperial Japanese government ([[Chinilpa]]). Section and the authoritarian dictatorships in South Korea during 1960s–1980s.The Ministry of Education announced that it would put the secondary-school history textbook under state control; "This was an inevitable choice in order to straighten out historical errors and end the social dispute caused by ideological bias in the textbooks," Hwang Woo-yea, education minister said on 12 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20151012000678|title=Ministry unveils plan for history textbook publication system|first=The Korea|last=Herald|date=12 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government's plan, the current history textbooks of South Korea will be replaced by a single textbook written by a panel of government-appointed historians and the new series of publications would be issued under the title ''The Correct Textbook of History'' and are to be issued to the public and private primary and secondary schools in 2017 onwards.

The move has sparked fierce criticism from academics who argue the system can be used to distort the history and glorify the history of those who served the Imperial Japanese government ([[Chinilpa]]) and of the authoritarian dictatorships. Moreover, 466 organisations including Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union formed History Act Network in solidarity and have staged protests: "The government's decision allows the state too much control and power and, therefore, it is against political neutrality that is certainly the fundamental principle of education." Many South Korean historians condemned [[Kyohaksa]] for their text glorifying those who served the Imperial Japanese government (Chinilpa) and the authoritarian dictatorship with a far-right political perspective. On the other hand, New Right supporters welcomed the textbook saying that ‘the new textbook finally describes historical truths contrary to the history textbooks published by left-wing publishers,’ and the textbook issue became intensified as a case of ideological conflict.

In fact, there once was a time in Korean history that the history textbook was put under state control. It was during the authoritarian regime under Park Chung-hee (1963-1979), who is a father of Park Geun-hye, former President of South Korea, and was used as a means to keep the Yushin Regime (also known as Yushin Dictatorship). However, there had been continuous criticisms about the system especially from the 1980s when Korea experienced a dramatic democratic development. In 2003, liberalisation of textbook began when the textbooks on Korean modern and contemporary history were published though the Textbook Screening System, which allows textbooks to be published not by a single government body but by many different companies, for the first time.

====Turkey====
[[Education in Turkey]] is centralised: its policy, administration and content are each determined by the Turkish government. Textbooks taught in schools are either prepared directly by the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education (MEB)]] or must be approved by its Instruction and Education Board. In practice, this means that the Turkish government is directly responsible for what textbooks are taught in schools across Turkey.&lt;ref name=armenianweekly&gt;[http://armenianweekly.com/2014/12/04/textbooks/ Akcam: Textbooks and the Armenian Genocide in Turkey: Heading Towards 2015], ''[[Armenian Weekly]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Taner Akçam]], writing for the [[Armenian Weekly]], discussed 2014-15 Turkish elementary and middle school textbooks that the MEB had made available on the internet. He found that Turkish history textbooks are filled with the message that Armenians are people "who are incited by foreigners, who aim to break apart the state and the country, and who murdered Turks and Muslims." The Armenian Genocide is referred to as the "Armenian matter", and is described as a lie perpetrated in order to further the perceived hidden agenda of Armenians. Recognition of the Armenian Genocide is defined as the "biggest threat to Turkish national security".&lt;ref name=armenianweekly/&gt;

Akçam summarized one textbook that claims the Armenians had sided with the Russians during the war. The 1909 [[Adana massacre]], in which as many as 20,000–30,000 Armenians were massacred, is identified as "The Rebellion of Armenians of Adana". According to the book, the Armenian [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|Hnchak]] and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] organizations instituted rebellions in many parts of [[Anatolia]], and "didn’t hesitate to kill Armenians who would not join them," issuing instructions that "if you want to survive you have to kill your neighbor first." Claims highlighted by Akçam:&lt;ref name=armenianweekly/&gt; &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;[The Armenians murdered] many people living in villages, even children, by attacking Turkish villages, which had become defenseless because all the Turkish men were fighting on the war fronts. ... They stabbed the Ottoman forces in the back. They created obstacles for the operations of the Ottoman units by cutting off their supply routes and destroying bridges and roads. ... They spied for Russia and by rebelling in the cities where they were located, they eased the way for the Russian invasion. ... Since the Armenians who engaged in massacres in collaboration with the Russians created a dangerous situation, this law required the migration of [Armenian people] from the towns they were living in to Syria, a safe Ottoman territory. ... Despite being in the midst of war, the Ottoman state took precautions and measures when it came to the Armenians who were migrating. Their tax payments were postponed, they were permitted to take any personal property they wished, government officials were assigned to ensure that they were protected from attacks during the journey and that their needs were met, police stations were established to ensure that their lives and properties were secure.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

Similar revisionist claims found in other textbooks by Akçam included that Armenian "back-stabbing" was the reason the Ottomans lost the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]] (similar to the post-War German [[stab-in-the-back myth]]), that the [[Hamidian massacres]] never happened, that the Armenians were armed by the Russians during late [[World War I]] to fight the Ottomans (in reality they had already been nearly annihilated from the area by this point), that Armenians killed 600,000 Turks during said war, that the deportation were to save Armenians from other violent Armenian gangs, and that Armenians who were deported were later able to return to Turkey unscathed and reclaim their properties.&lt;ref name=armenianweekly/&gt;

As of 2015, Turkish textbooks still describe the Armenians as "traitors", call the Armenian Genocide a lie and say that the Ottoman Turks "took necessary measures to counter Armenian separatism."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/europe/turkeys-century-of-denial-about-an-armenian-genocide.html A Century After Armenian Genocide, Turkey's Denial Only Deepens], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Armenians are also characterised as "dishonorable and treacherous," and students are taught that Armenians were forcibly relocated to protect Turkish citizens from attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/04/23/turkey-armenia-genocide-massacre-anniversary/26261059/ Turkey, Armenians battle over genocide 100 years later], ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===French law recognising colonialism's positive value===
{{Main article|French law on colonialism}}
On 23 February 2005, the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union for a Popular Movement (UMP)]] conservative majority at the [[French National Assembly]] voted a law compelling history textbooks and teachers to "acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000444898&amp;fastPos=2&amp;fastReqId=1461448112&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;oldAction=rechTexte]&lt;/ref&gt; Criticized by historians and teachers, among them [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], who refused to recognise the French Parliament's right to influence the way history is written (despite the French [[Holocaust denial]] laws, see ''[[Loi Gayssot]]''). That law was also challenged by left-wing parties and the former [[French colonial empires|French colonies]]; critics argued that the law was tantamount to refusing to acknowledge the racism inherent to French [[colonialism]], and that the law proper is a form of historical revisionism.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In retaliation against the law, Algerian president [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] refused to sign a prepared "friendly treaty" with France. On 26 June 2005, Bouteflika declared that the law "approached mental blindness, negationism and revisionism".

==Ramifications and judicature==
Some countries have criminalised historical revisionism of historic events such as the [[Holocaust]]. The [[Council of Europe]] defines it as the "denial, gross minimisation, approval or justification of [[genocide]] or [[crimes against humanity]]" (article 6, ''Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime'').

Some council-member states proposed an additional protocol to the [[Council of Europe]] [[Cybercrime Convention]], addressing materials and "acts of racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks"; it was negotiated from late 2001 to early 2002, and, on 7 November 2002, the [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers]] adopted the protocol's final text&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm#topicE Frequently asked questions and answers Council of Europe Convention on cybercrime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209153034/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm |date=9 February 2006 }} by the US [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cyber-crime, Concerning the Criminalisation of Acts of a Racist and Xenophobic Nature Committed through Computer Systems'', ("Protocol").&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=189&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=17/02/2006&amp;CL=ENG Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems] on the [[Council of Europe]] web site&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on 28 January 2003, and became current on 1 March 2006; as of 30 November 2011, 20 States have signed and ratified the Protocol, and 15 others have signed, but not yet ratified it (including Canada and South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=189&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=30/11/2011&amp;CL=ENG APCoc Treaty open for signature by the States that signed the Treaty ETS 185.] on the [[Council of Europe]] web site&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol requires participant States to criminalise the dissemination of racist and xenophobic material, and of racist and xenophobic threats and insults through computer networks, such as the Internet.&lt;ref name="www.usdoj.gov COEFAQs"&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm#topicE Frequently asked questions and answers Council of Europe Convention on cyber-crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209153034/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm |date=9 February 2006 }} by the United States Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; Article 6, Section 1 of the Protocol specifically covers [[Holocaust Denial]], and other genocides recognised as such by international courts, established since 1945, by relevant international legal instruments. Section 2 of Article 6 allows a Party to the Protocol, at their discretion, only to prosecute the violator if the crime is committed with the intent to incite hatred or discrimination or violence; or to use a reservation, by allowing a Party not to apply Article 6 – either partly or entirely.&lt;ref name="conventions.coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Reports/Html/189.htm|title=Liste complète|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe's ''Explanatory Report'' of the Protocol says that the "[[European Court of Human Rights]] has made it clear that the denial or revision of 'clearly established historical facts – such as the Holocaust &amp;nbsp;– &amp;nbsp;... would be removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17' of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]" (see the ''[[Lehideux and Isorni v.

==Negationism in fiction==
In the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949), by [[George Orwell]], the government of [[Oceania (fiction)|Oceania]] continually revises historical records to concord with the contemporary political explanations of The Party. When Oceania is at war with [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Eurasia]], the public records (newspapers, cinema, television) indicate that Oceania has been always at war with Eurasia; yet, when Eurasia and Oceania are no longer fighting each other, the historical records are subjected to negationism; thus, the populace are [[mind control|brainwashed]] to believe that Oceania and Eurasia always have been allies against Eastasia.

The protagonist of the story, [[Winston Smith]], is an editor in the [[Ministry of Truth]], responsible for effecting the continual historical revisionism that will negate the contradictions of the past upon the contemporary world of Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: 1984: Themes, Motifs &amp; Symbols|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George ''Nineteen Eighty-four'' New American Library 1 January 1961 {{ISBN|978-0-451-52493-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To cope with the psychological stresses of life during wartime, Smith begins a diary, in which he observes that "He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future", and so illustrates the principal, ideological purpose of historical negationism.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. [https://books.google.com/books/about/1984.html?id=yxv1LK5gyV4C ''1984''], [[New American Library]], 1961 {{ISBN|978-0-451-52493-5}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Kurowski]] was an extremely prolific right-wing German writer who dedicated his entire career to the production of Nazi military propaganda, followed by post-war military pulp fiction and revisionist histories of [[World War II]], claiming the humane behaviour and innocence of war crimes of the [[Wehrmacht]], glorifying war as a desirable state, while fabricating eye-witness reports of atrocities allegedly committed by the Allies, especially Bomber Command and the air raids on Cologne and Dresden as planned genocide of the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;*{{DNB portal|106231650|NAME=Franz Kurowski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International auxiliary language orthography''' (IAL orthography) is often simplified when compared with natural language orthography.

==Script==
Most IALs use a [[Latin-script orthography]] and [[Latin-script alphabet]] for their standard writing. [[Lingua Franca Nova]] is additionally defined in [[Cyrillic script]].

==Letter inventory==
Most IAL writing systems use only letters from the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. Some exceptions are:
* [[Volapük]]: ä, ö, ü
* [[Esperanto]]: [[C-circumflex|ĉ]], [[G-circumflex|ĝ]], [[H-circumflex|ĥ]], [[J-circumflex|ĵ]], [[S-circumflex|ŝ]], and [[U-breve|ŭ]]
* [[Uropi]]: ʒ
* [[Universalglot]]: "Œ/œ", "Σ/σ", "Ü/ü"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k131148w/f9.image|title=Essai d'une langue universelle, par MM. Pirro et L. A.|author=Pirro, Jean (1813-1886). Auteur du texte|date=4 September 1868|website=Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digraphs==
Some IALs do not use digraphs: Uropi, Esperanto (standard system), Lingua Franca Nova.

Some IALs use digraphs:
*[[Interlingua]]: qu
*[[Ido language|Ido]]: ch, qu, sh
*[[Esperanto orthography|Esperanto]] (X-system): cx, gx, hx, jx, sx, ux

==Collation==
The basic ordering of the letters is as in the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].

Esperanto sorts each letter with diacritic mark directly after the corresponding letter without such a mark. Uropi sorts the non-ASCII ʒ after all ASCII letters, i.e. after z.

'''''Jammers Minde''''' (literally A Memory of Lament), translated into English as '''''Memoirs of Leonora Christina''''', is an autobiography completed in 1674 by [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt|Leonora Christina]], daughter of [[Christian IV of Denmark]] and [[Kirsten Munk]]. The work, first published in 1869, is included in the [[Danish Culture Canon]]. It is considered to be the finest piece of prose work written in 17th-century Denmark.&lt;ref name="Monod2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monod|first=Paul Kléber|authorlink=Paul Monod |title=The Power of Kings: Monarchy and Religion in Europe, 1589-1715|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNAmbT21ctUC&amp;pg=PA209|accessdate=18 January 2013|date=11 August 2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09066-6|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stecher-Hansen2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stecher-Hansen|first=Marianne|title=Danish writers from the Reformation to decadence, 1550-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NM0UAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 January 2013|date=6 August 2004|publisher=Gale|isbn=978-0-7876-6837-2|page=460}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relates a partly fictionalized account of Christina's time during captivity, with a detailed personal account of prison life, often drawing upon biblical references and black humour, and contrasting the comical with the macabre.  Radical for its period in its personal account, it is considered an existential religious writing.

==Background==
[[File:Leonora Christina French manuscript.jpg|thumb|160px|left|First page of Leonora's autobiography in French (1673)]]
Married to [[Corfitz Ulfeldt]], [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt|Leonora Christina]] was imprisoned from 1663 to 1685 in the [[Blåtårn|Blue Tower]] of [[Christiansborg Palace|Copenhagen Castle]] for presumed knowledge of her husband's treachery. When [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] came to the throne in 1670, the conditions of her imprisonment were improved and she was given books and writing materials.&lt;ref name=dsd&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/Jammers_Minde "Jammers Minde"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 17 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After writing a short autobiography in French in 1673, she embarked on ''Jammers Minde'' which she completed after her release from prison in 1685. As the manuscript was secretly held abroad for many years, the work remained unknown until it was finally published in 1869, attracting considerable attention.&lt;ref name=dsd/&gt;

==The work==
Considered to be Denmark's most important 17th-century prose work, ''Jammers Minde'' is a defensive, intimate and dramatic account, which brings back to life the painful years of Leonora's imprisonment. It was written with a political and tactical purpose and is considered an existential religious writing, radical for its time in its reporting of personal confession and crisis.&lt;ref name="NWL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordicwomensliterature.net/article/fidelity-suffering-and-passion|title=Fidelity, suffering and passion|publisher=Nordicwomensliterature.net|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonora knew that the work would be more successful if it came across as an authentic account of her time within the prison walls so it displays many of her real experiences, but which are dramatized and fictionalized, and vividly and fully so.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt;

''Jammers Minde'' conveys the woman's conscious will to describe her experience without succumbing to her fate. It contains a host of vivid details: sights, smells and sounds, often conveyed with loathing — but also frequently juxtaposed with a grotesque twist of humour which only serves to make it all the more moving. Leonora's ability to describe the appearance and behaviour of those she was forced to come into contact with has left a picture of a series of insignificant figures, mainly women, who would otherwise have been forgotten. One of the reasons the work has become a literary masterpiece is that the author manages to couch her account in a fine, dignified style, giving elegance and shine to even the most lurid details.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kum.dk/Documents/Temaer/Kulturkanon/KUM_kulturkanonen_OK2.pdf "Jammers minde"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211223858/http://kum.dk/Documents/Temaer/Kulturkanon/KUM_kulturkanonen_OK2.pdf |date=2012-12-11 }}, ''Kulturkanonen''. Danish Ministry of Culture. {{da icon}} Retrieved 17 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her account, her female attendants appeared to suffer more than she did, suffering from anxiety, fever and alcoholism, while she remained in good health during her time in captivity, although she once suffered from [[gallstone]]s.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt;

Leonora frequently draws upon biblical stories and characters and God in her depiction of prison life, recreating the prison in part as a scene in the Bible and her jailors and enemies into characters in her Christian Passion. Sophie Amalie for instance is portrayed as [[Salome]], stepdaughter of [[Herod Antipas]], who called for [[John the Baptist]] to be beheaded.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt; Languages also play an important and complex role in ''Jammers Minde''. It is mainly written in Danish, and Leonora translates much of the Low German, High German and French dialogue into Danish, but later on in the story adds more depth to her characters by writing in the original language, and demonstrates her superior knowledge of languages by often replying in a language they cannot understand.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt; Leonora's allies are usually French-speaking, sending her letters or conversing intimately with her.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt; Anne-Marie Mai highlights the psychological meaning of the autobiography and how the  account can be viewed as a "monument for her spiritual and moral triumph over her adversaries, the evil agents of power, the flesh ungodly."&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt;

'''''Keeping Up with the Steins''''' is a 2006 comedy film directed by [[Scott Marshall (director)|Scott Marshall]], and starring [[Garry Marshall]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Jami Gertz]] and [[Daryl Hannah]].&lt;ref name="Keeping Up with the Steins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/642768/Keeping-Up-With-The-Steins/full-credits.html|accessdate=April 19, 2016|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|title=Keeping Up with the Steins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is also a commentary on how too many Jewish families see a [[bar mitzvah]] or [[bat mitzvah]] not as a coming of age for their son or daughter, but rather as an excuse to throw outrageously lavish parties which end in drama.

==Plot==
Benjamin Fiedler is the 13-year-old son of Jewish couple Adam and Joanne Fiedler. After attending the elaborate [[B'nai Mitzvah|bar mitzvah]] party for the son of Arnie Stein - which was done on a [[cruise ship]], with a ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' theme - Benjamin's parents decide to go all out for his bar mitzvah. The plan is to rent [[Dodger Stadium]] for the bar mitzvah party, complete with movie stars and everything. Adam even kombooks [[Neil Diamond]] to sing the [[National Anthem]]. However, Benjamin does not want to go through with it, as he does not even understand the words of the [[haftorah]] he has to read as part of his bar mitzvah rite. To try to stall the planning, he secretly invites his grandfather Irwin, who is now living on an [[Indian reservation]] with a [[New Age]] woman named Sacred Feather. When Benjamin's grandfather arrives, it puts a kink in the planning - as Irwin had a falling out with his son Adam, both for having left Adam when he was a teenager, and for Adam's own humiliating bar mitzvah. Irwin must then pull off somehow reconciling with his son while helping his grandson deal with the question of what it means to be a "man."

Now appreciating his bar mitzvah not as an excuse to throw a party but rather as a rite of passage in his Jewish life, Benjamin gets up the courage to tell his parents to call off the over-the-top bash they had planned. After he does very well at the service the party is just a casual backyard affair with lunch, a [[klezmer]] band (with a guest-star singer and guitarist, as Adam "couldn't cancel Neil Diamond") and lots of family and friends.

==Cast==
*[[Daryl Sabara]] as Benjamin "Ben" Fiedler
*[[Jami Gertz]] as Joanne Fiedler
*[[Jeremy Piven]] as Adam Fiedler
*[[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]] as Arnie Stein
*Sandra Taylor as Raylene Stein
*[[Carter Jenkins]] as Zachary "Zach" Stein
*[[Miranda Cosgrove]] as Karen Sussman
*[[Britt Robertson]] as Ashley Grunwald
*[[Cheryl Hines]] as Casey Nudelman
*[[Garry Marshall]] as Irwin Fiedler
*[[Daryl Hannah]] as Sandy Frost / Sacred Feather
*[[Doris Roberts]] as Rose Fiedler
*[[Marc John Jefferies]] as Tim
*[[Richard Benjamin]] as Rabbi Schulberg
*[[DJ Quik]] as Himself
*[[Neil Diamond]] as Himself

==Production notes==
* The working title for this movie was ''"Lucky 13"''.
* While shooting this movie, Daryl Sabara was also studying for his own Bar Mitzvah. The Haftorah portion that his character chants in the movie was Sabara's actual Bar Mitzvah portion.
* DJ Quik makes a cameo as himself as the rapper at the Stein's Bar Mitzvah, which is one of many things that makes Jeremy Piven's character jealous. In episode 10 in the second season of "Entourage" (titled "The Bat Mitzvah"), DJ Quik makes a cameo as himself as the deejay at Piven's daughter's Bat Mitzvah.
* Congregation Ari-El, the synagogue where Daryl Sabara's character is to have his Bar Mitzvah, which is shown on an exterior shot, is a real synagogue in Studio City and was founded by members of the movie industry. It has an Ark (where the scrolls of the Torah are kept) built by Jewish carpenters working for [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] that was originally used on a movie set, and installed in the synagogue after the movie was completed.

==Reception==
The film scored 36% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], making it "rotten." Criticism generally focused on the film's tendency towards [[melodrama]], and that the material was better suited for a [[sitcom]] on television than for a motion picture.

'''Library hand''' is a rounded style of [[hand (handwriting)|handwriting]] once taught in [[library school]]s. The intention was to ensure uniformity and legibility in the handwritten cards of [[library catalog]]s. Beginning in September 1885, [[Melvil Dewey]] and [[Thomas Edison]] developed and perfected the approved library hand to be taught in [[library school]] and used in [[libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/library-hand-penmanship-handwriting |title=Library Hand, the Fastidiously Neat Penmanship Style Made for Card Catalogs |first=Ella |last=Morton |date=16 February 2017 |journal=Atlas Obscura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1903 Handbook of the New York State Library School listed the requirements of library hand. They included legibility, speed, and uniformity. The particular type of ink, inkstands, pens, penholders, and erasers was specified. The standards for lettering were dictated in regard to size, slant, spacing, special letters and figures, and even the proper posture and position of the writer was outlined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liswiki.org/wiki/History_of_the_card_catalog History of the card catalog], Library and Information Science Wiki&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of library hand declined after the widespread introduction of the [[typewriter]] in the early 20th century.

The '''National Historical Geographic Information System''' (NHGIS) is a [[historical GIS]] project to create and freely disseminate a database incorporating all available aggregate [[United States Census|census information for the United States]] between [[United States Census, 1790|1790]] and [[United States Census, 2010|2010]]. The project has created one of the largest collections in the world of statistical census information, much of which was not previously available to the research community because of legacy data formats and differences between metadata formats.  The statistical and  geographic data are disseminated free of charge through a sophisticated online data access system.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Fitch and [[Steven Ruggles]],  “[http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/nhgis.pdf Building the National Historical Geographic Information System].” Historical Methods 46(2003): 41-51&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, NHGIS has created historical and contemporary cartographic boundary [[shapefile]]s compatible with every census, and over 50 million lines of metadata describing the collection.  Historical U.S. state and county boundaries are available 1790–present, with smaller geographies available as the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] created them.  Census Tract boundaries are available 1910–present and Block Group and Block boundaries available 1990–present.&lt;ref&gt;GIS boundary file availability https://www.nhgis.org/user-resources/data-availability#boundary-files&lt;/ref&gt;  The cartographic boundary files and the tabular data are formatted so as to be easily linked for use in [[Geographic Information System]] software.

NHGIS was launched in 2007 and is maintained by the [[Minnesota Population Center]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] and is funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]].

Much of the historical data are viewable as tables or interactive maps in Social Explorer, a small company which offers both free and professional licenses.

'''''Natura naturans''''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] tag coined during the Middle Ages, meaning "Nature naturing", or more loosely, "nature doing what nature does".  The Latin, ''naturans'', is the present active [[participle]] of ''naturo'', indicated by the suffix "''-ans''" which is akin to the English suffix "''-ing''". ''Naturata'' is the perfect passive participle.  These terms are most commonly associated with the philosophy of [[Baruch Spinoza]].  For Spinoza, ''natura naturans'' refers to the self-causing activity of nature, while ''natura naturata'', meaning "nature natured", refers to nature considered as a passive product of an infinite causal chain. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] defined it as "Nature in the active sense" as opposed to ''[[natura naturata]]''.

The distinction is expressed in Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[B]y ''Natura naturans'' we must understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, ''or'' such attributes of substance as express an eternal and infinite essence, that is … God, insofar as he is considered as a free cause. &lt;br&gt; But by ''Natura naturata'' I understand whatever follows from the necessity of God's nature, ''or'' from God's attributes, that is, all the modes of God's attributes insofar as they are considered as things which are in God, and can neither be nor be conceived without God.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part I, Prop. 29, Scholium. Trans: Edwin Curley.  London: Penguin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Spinoza, Nature and God were the same (see ''[[Deus sive Natura]]'').

'''''Picasso &amp; Lump: A Dachshund's Odyssey''''' ({{ISBN|0821258109}}) is a book by [[David Douglas Duncan]] that features professional photographs of [[Pablo Picasso]] and his [[dachshund]], [[Lump (dog)|Lump]]. The book, published in 2006 by Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, gives an insight into Picasso's later life, and Picasso - the man, not the image. The book contrasts black-and-white photos of Picasso, his wife Jacqueline and Lump with Picasso's colourful [[Las Meninas (Picasso)|interpretations]] of painting ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (that happen to feature Lump). ''Picasso &amp; Lump: A Dachshund's Odyssey'' is a [[coffee table book]] that brings to light the story of a lucky dog who became a loved pet and an icon of [[modern art]].

The book is alternatively known as, '''''Lump: The Dog Who Ate a Picasso'''''.

==History==
The Prešeren Award was for the first time bestowed in 1947, on the basis of a decree from 1946. It was originally given on 8 February, [[Prešeren Day]], the holiday commemorating the anniversary of the death of the Slovene [[national poet]] [[France Prešeren]].&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; In 1955, the first act on the Prešeren awards was passed. By it, the award gained its current name and the Prešeren Fund was established, which by the amendments of the act in 1956 became a legal personality.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since 1961, the awards were conferred also for the lifetime work. In addition, the Prešeren Fund Award was introduced.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since that year, these awards have been conferred only for exceptional achievements in the field of arts. In 1982, the Prešeren Fund came under the auspice of the [[Cultural Community of Slovenia]]. At most three Prešeren Awards and ten Prešeren Fund Awards were given.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since 1991, when the ''Prešeren Award Act'' ({{lang|sl|Zakon o Prešernovi nagradi}}) was passed,&lt;ref name="ZUODNO-G"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pisrs.si/Predpis.aspx?id=ZAKO866&amp;pogled=osnovni |title=Zakon o Prešernovi nagradi (ZPreN) Ur.l. RS, št. 29I/1991) |accessdate=19 April 2011 |work=PisRS |publisher=Office of Legislation, Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fund works under the auspice of the Slovenian administrative body in charge of culture.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; According to the act, at most two awards may be given.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Prešeren Fund==
The Prešeren Award and the Prešeren Fund Award are bestowed by the Prešeren Fund Management Board ({{lang|sl|Upravni odbor Prešernovega sklada}}). Its 15 members are artists or other cultural workers, like critics, historians, and theoreticians. They are nominated by the [[Slovenian Government]] and elected for a four-year term by the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly of Slovenia]]. The board, which was last elected in May 2008, elected [[Jaroslav Skrušny]] as its chair in July 2008.&lt;ref name="STA2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ms.sta.si/2011/09/prva-seja-upravnega-odbora-presernovega-sklada-v-kranju/ |title=Prva seja upravnega odbora Prešernovega sklada v Kranju |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The First Session of the Prešeren Fund Management Board in Kranj |date=22 September 2011 |newspaper=Misli slovensko [Think Slovene] |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418153027/http://ms.sta.si/2011/09/prva-seja-upravnega-odbora-presernovega-sklada-v-kranju/ |archivedate=18 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prešeren Fund now operates under the auspice of the [[Ministry of Culture (Slovenia)|Slovenian Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name="Fund2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mk.gov.si/en/about_the_ministry/expert_committees_counsels_and_funds/preseren_fund/ |title=Prešeren Fund |publisher=Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131925/http://www.mk.gov.si/en/about_the_ministry/expert_committees_counsels_and_funds/preseren_fund/ |archivedate=17 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in February 2012, Skrušny described the work by the Board as independent and denied any political pressure in the past few years.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Selection and proclamation of the winners==
On 10 February, the Prešeren Fund announces a public tender, which lasts until 15 September. Any physical or legal person may nominate authors for the award, but have to provide appropriate rationale and references.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt; About 100 proposals are put forward each year,&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt; the majority of proposals from the [[performing arts]].&lt;ref name="STA2011" /&gt;  The selection is based on artistic value of the works by the proposed artists as well as other criteria, such as the equal representation of gender, regions, generations, and world views, trying to achieve a balanced and plural choice. Both the established artists and debitants have won the award. The nominees are then selected by the four field committees of the Prešeren Fund, each comprising seven members named by the Prešeren Fund Management Board. Each committee proposes two names for the Prešeren Award and six names for the Prešeren Fund Award, altogether eight for the great award and 24 for the little award. The board then makes the final selection with a secret vote in November after a long discussion and proclaims the awardees after they are elected by two thirds of members. If necessary, more voting rounds may take place. Although in the past, the names of the awardees were announced already on 3 December, the date of the anniversary of Prešeren's births, in the last years they have remained secret until the award ceremony.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Review of the awardees==
Since Slovenian declaration of independence in 1991, the majority of the Prešeren Award winners have been literary artists, among them the only woman being Makarovič, who declined the award in 2000 but accepted the money.&lt;ref name="Planet2011-06"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siol.net/novice/poglobljeno/2011/06/dvajset_let_umetnosti_v_sloveniji.aspx |title=Dvajset let umetnosti v Sloveniji |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Twenty Years of Art in Slovenia |newspaper=Planet Siol.net |publisher=TSMedia d. o. o. |date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the field of performing arts, only two artists won the award. From the field of music, the awardees have been mainly composers and conductors, with the only instrumentalist being the flautist [[Irena Grafenauer]]. A general trend of older men active in [[institution]]alised arts is recognisable among the awardees. The group of the Prešeren Fund Award winners is more diverse.&lt;ref name="Planet2011-06" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6953">A '''psycholinguist''' is a social scientist who studies [[psycholinguistics]], which connects [[psychology]] and [[linguistics]]. Psycholinguistics is interdisciplinary in nature and is studied by people in a variety of fields, such as, psychology, [[cognitive science]], linguistics, [[neuroscience]] and many more. The main aim of psycholinguistics is to outline and describe the process of producing and comprehending communication.

==Education and training==
More specifically, a psycholinguist studies language, speech production, and comprehension by using behavioral and neurological methods traditionally developed in the field of psychology, but other methods such as [[corpus linguistics|corpus analysis]] are also widely used. Psycholinguists typically receive undergraduate degrees in linguistics or psychology and then seek a higher degree. Psycholinguistics is not usually a degree of its own; graduate degrees range from scientific studies to criminal justice. The majority of students who become psycholinguists receive a master's degree or a Ph.D.; however, there are also some opportunities available for those who choose not to attend graduate school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What can you do with a Linguistics degree?|url = http://www.northeastern.edu/linguistics/advising/what-can-you-do-with-a-linguistics-degree/|website = Northeastern University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers==
Psycholinguists currently represent a widely diverse field. Many psycholinguists are also considered to be [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguists]], cognitive linguists, neurocognitive linguists, or are associated with those who are. There are subtle differences between the titles, though they are all attempting to use different facets of similar issues. Psycholinguists are sometimes categorized into separate groups by the models and theories in which they believe. The two main groups, either interactive or autonomous, are based on ideas of language processing. Psycholinguists who support the interactive side, believe that our levels of processing for language work side-by-side and share information as words are received. The other argument is the autonomous side, which believes that the levels of processing for language occur independent of one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Field|first1 = John|title = Psycholinguistics: A Resource Book for Students|publisher = Psychology Press|pages = 69|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=3kQkQ-cpIMwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP18&amp;dq=famous+psycholinguists&amp;ots=mqS85iE0L6&amp;sig=vZX_FEAl4hcCFzI7kr7BV2MZ_s8#v=onepage&amp;q=psycholinguists&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When conducting research, psycholinguists use a variety of techniques that can involve qualitative and/or quantitative data. Typical methods of research include: observation (language recording), experimentation (issuing language tests), and self-reports (participants report what they are experiencing). The research tends to result in either theoretical evidence or a realistic application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Field|first1 = John|title = Psycholinguistics: A Resource Book for Students|publisher = Psychology Press|pages = 49|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=3kQkQ-cpIMwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP18&amp;dq=famous+psycholinguists&amp;ots=mqS85iE0L6&amp;sig=vZX_FEAl4hcCFzI7kr7BV2MZ_s8#v=onepage&amp;q=psycholinguists&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional associations==
There are many associations that include professionals in the psycholinguist field worldwide, such as the following:
* '''[[Linguistic Society of America]]:''' started in 1924 with the goal of furthering scientific linguistic studies, and has come to include all subsets of the linguistic field including psycholinguistics.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Society of America"&gt;{{cite web|title = Linguistic Society of America|url = http://www.linguisticsociety.org/about|website = Linguistic Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics]]:''' located in The Netherlands; it is a subset of the Max Planck Society that focuses solely on psycholinguistics, making it a one-of-a-kind institution.&lt;ref name="Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics"&gt;{{cite web|title = Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics|url = http://www.mpi.nl/institute/who-we-are|website = Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''International Society of Applied Psycholinguistics (ISAPL):''' an international organization founded in 1982 that is devoted to furthering research and teaching in the field of psycholinguistics.&lt;ref name="International Society of Applied Psycholinguistics"&gt;{{cite web|title = International Society of Applied Psycholinguistics|url = http://isapl.psycholing.org/page.php?10|website = International Society of Applied Psycholinguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rada Iveković''' (born 1945 in [[Zagreb]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) is a Croatian professor, [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Indology|Indologist]], and writer.

== Research ==
Ivekovic’s research interests include [[comparative philosophy]] ([[Asian philosophy]], particularly [[Indian philosophy|Indian]], and [[Western philosophy|Western]]), [[feminist theory]] and [[feminist philosophy]] as well as [[political philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In particular, the following aspects have been of intellectual inspiration for Ivekovic’s work:  [[contemporary European philosophy]], [[postmodern philosophy]], [[Orientalism]] in (Western) philosophy, the feminine in philosophy, issues of [[nation]], [[Sovereign state|state]] und [[citizenship]], problems of [[nationalism]], of [[violence]] and [[war]], European [[Cultural identity|identity]] issues, and [[democracy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Ivekovic’s other interests include: [[literary theory]] and [[literary criticism]], [[religion]] and [[mythology]], [[gender studies]] and [[women writers]], [[anthropology]], and  [[contemporary French philosophy]] in particular.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

== Political positioning ==
Ivekovic holds that the inequality of the sexes (Inégalité des sexes) and other [[Alterity|alterities]], [[social equality|inequalities]], [[Outcast (person)|exclusion]]s, subordinating [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]]s (e.g. through discrimination by  [[gender]], [[Nation|national citizenship]], [[ethnicity]], [[colonization]]) leads to a fatal partitioning of reason ("Le partage de la raison"). On the war events on the territory of Yugoslavia she takes an explicitly anti-patriarchal, anti-racist and non-nationalist stance.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1997 Ivekovic published a study on gender/sex in philosophy, taking issue with [[Jean-François Lyotard]].

== Career ==
Iveković grew up mostly in [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]], living in Zagreb, from 1963 until leaving Croatia for exile in 1991-1992 in a self-described "protest against nationalism."

At [[Zagreb University]], she studied Indology, Philosophy and English Studies (1969) and from 1970 to 1973, [[Buddhist philosophy]] at [[Delhi University]] where she received her PhD in 1972.

From 1975 to 1991-1992, Iveković was a Lecturer in the History of Asian Philosophy and Comparative Philosophy at Zagreb University. From 1998-2003 she was a professor at Paris VIII. Since 2003 Professor in the Department of Sociology at [[University Jean Monnet - St.Etienne]] and after 2004, the Program Director at [[Collège international de philosophie (Paris)]].

[[File:Tending the sick in a migrant camp, Stanfield, Arizona (7449941406).jpg|thumb|A nurse tends to a woman in an Arizona migrant camp, 1961.]]'''Refugee health''' or '''migrant health''' focuses on the health of individuals who have relocated from their country of origin, often because of factors such as political instability, war, or natural disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/|title=Home {{!}} Immigrant and Refugee Health {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special considerations are needed to provide appropriate medical treatment for these individuals, who often face extreme adversity, violent and/or traumatic experiences, and travel through perilous regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A|first=Bigot|last2=L|first2=Blok|last3=M|first3=Boelaert|last4=Y|first4=Chartier|last5=P|first5=Corijn|last6=A|first6=Davis|last7=M|first7=Deguerry|last8=T|first8=Dusauchoit|last9=F|first9=Fermon|title=Refugee health: an approach to emergency situations.|url=http://www.popline.org/node/272816|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such considerations include screenings for communicable diseases, vaccinations, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], and [[Depression (differential diagnoses)|depression]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Matt|last2=Haslam|first2=Nick|date=2001-10-01|title=Forced displacement in Yugoslavia: A meta-analysis of psychological consequences and their moderators|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1023/A:1013054524810/abstract|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=817–834|doi=10.1023/A:1013054524810|issn=1573-6598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] has rigorous health screening guidelines for refugees and immigrants entering the country. The 1980 Federal [[Refugee Act]] enabled the [[US Public Health Service]] to facilitate health screenings for all immigrants and refugees before they depart their country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/refugeeactof198000unit_0/refugeeactof198000unit_0_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Refugee act of 1980 : [an act to amend the Immigration and nationality act to revise the procedures for the admission of refugees, to amend the Migration and refugee assistance act of 1962 to establish a more uniform basis for the provision of assistance to refugees and for other purposes]|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screening effort is overseen by the [[Office of Refugee Resettlement]] [https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr (ORR),] housed in and funded by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] [https://www.hhs.gov/ (HHS).]

Both in their countries of origin and after arriving in the U.S., refugees often face obstacles in accessing medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/8/08-020808/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Overcoming migrants’ barriers to health|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their countries of origin, weak healthcare infrastructure and a scarcity of medical resources may prevent them from obtaining needed care prior to their departure.

== Special health considerations for refugees ==
Because of the often hasty circumstances of their departures from their origin countries, refugees usually lose access to their medical records, and continuity of care is difficult to establish upon entry to the United States.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=R.|date=September 2006|title=Primary health care for refugees and asylum seekers: A review of the literature and a framework for services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350606001387|journal=Public Health|volume=120|pages=809–816}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a significant problem, especially for refugees with chronic and mental health conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further, after arrival in the U.S., refugees may face obstacles to accessing care because of limited English proficiency and uncertainty of how to navigate the U.S. healthcare system.  Once accessing care, ensuring that the treatment refugees receive is culturally appropriate may serve as another obstacle to maintaining a healthy life after resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philbrick|first=Ann M.|last2=Wicks|first2=Cherilyn M.|last3=Harris|first3=Ila M.|last4=Shaft|first4=Grant M.|last5=Van Vooren|first5=James S.|date=May 2017|title=Make Refugee Health Care Great [Again]|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388985/|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=107|issue=5|pages=656–658|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2017.303740|issn=0090-0036|pmc=5388985|pmid=28398805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For improving refugee health, individuals who can act as "cultural brokers" could help refugees to access medical services, locate pharmacies, learn about their medications, and schedule follow-up treatment.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McNeely|first=Clea A.|last2=Morland|first2=Lyn|date=2017-04-09|title=The Health of the Newest Americans: How US Public Health Systems Can Support Syrian Refugees|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=106|issue=1|pages=13–15|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.302975|issn=0090-0036|pmc=4695930|pmid=26696285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing communication between policymakers, frontline providers of refugee medical care, and refugees can allow for improvements in refugee health policy outcomes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Also, making sure that refugees receive continuing, thorough assessments of their mental and physical health, health promotion materials in their own language, and access to specialist services (especially in cases of torture or violence) can improve the standard of health among refugee populations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2013, a study done by Tod Hamilton was looking to find if the post-migrant health of black immigrants to the United States varied across their countries with different conditions. The study found that their health was more favorable when migrating from a country with relatively higher ratio of enrollment in primary, secondary, and tertiary education, where tertiary education is any education pursued after high school. Immigrants who were migrating from countries with relatively lower levels of income inequality and higher life expectancies at birth were more likely to experience more favorable health than individuals born in the receiving country. After the researcher controlled for country conditions, African immigrants to the United States reported better health than non-African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Tod G. "Do Country‐of‐Origin Characteristics Help Explain Variation in Health among Black Immigrants in the United States?" Social Science Quarterly, vol. 95, no. 3, 2014, pp. 817-834, doi:10.1111/ssqu.12063.&lt;/ref&gt;

A longitudinal study found that late life immigrants were less likely to suffer from cancer and also had less chronic conditions that individuals born in the U.S.. Late life immigrants were defined as individuals who were 70 years or older and had only been in the immigrant-receiving country (United States) for less than 15 years. However, these late life immigrants had worse self-reported health than the native-born individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Sunha H. "Testing Healthy Immigrant Effects among Late Life Immigrants in the United States: Using Multiple Indicators." Journal of Aging and Health, vol. 24, no. 3, 2012, pp. 475-506, doi:10.1177/0898264311425596.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental health ===
As of 1997, states are required to provide a comprehensive health screening for all newly arrived refugees in the United States, which includes a mental evaluation, as well as a physical examination. This approach has resulted in a significant number of mental health referrals and treatments, indicating a need for increased psychological support for newly-arrived refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Savin, Daniel; Seymour, Deborah J.; Littleford, Linh Nguyen; Bettridge, Juli; Giese, Alexis (2005). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20056782 "Findings from Mental Health Screening of Newly Arrived Refugees in Colorado"]. ''Public Health Reports (1974-)''. '''120''' (3): 224–229.&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequently diagnosed mental condition in refugee populations is [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]], which is commonly a result of violence. Experts have found that drug therapy, through the use of [[serotonin uptake inhibitors]], as well as cognitive therapy have been effective treatments during resettlement. However, there still exists a lack of culturally appropriate psychiatric care that prevents adequate treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Kristina M; Gardiner, Lorin D; Assefi, Nassim (2004). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41708113 "Healthcare challenges from the developing world: post-immigration refugee medicine"]. ''BMJ: British Medical Journal''. '''328''' (7455): 1548–1552.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental health of refugees remains an issue long after their resettlement in the United States. Refugees often experience further mental trauma after migrating due to hostility from native citizens, or even authorities at detention centers and ports of entry, which is further exacerbated by long wait times for asylum application decisions. This process generally takes anywhere from 18 months to well over two years.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Karmi, Ghada (1992). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29716400 "Refugee Health: Requires A Comprehensive Strategy"]. ''BMJ: British Medical Journal''. '''305''' (6847): 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of [[Cambodia]]n refugees (one of the largest refugee groups in the United States), it was found that, despite the passage of more than two decades since the end of the [[Cambodian Civil War|Cambodian civil war]] and refugee resettlement in the US, members of the group continue to suffer from high rates of psychiatric disorders associated with trauma.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Grant N.|date=2005-08-03|title=Mental Health of Cambodian Refugees 2 Decades After Resettlement in the United States|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201332|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=294|issue=5|doi=10.1001/jama.294.5.571|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Cambodian refugee group, higher rates of PTSD and major depression were associated with factors such as old age, having poor English-speaking proficiency, unemployment, being retired or disabled, and living in poverty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Researchers have identified a number of factors contributing to mental illness in refugee populations, including language barriers, family separation, hostility, social isolation, and trauma prior to migration. However, few doctors in the US are equipped to address these issues, and thus, there have been calls for a refugee-specific strategy for health care that ensures equal access to services for refugees, as well as universal training for physicians to handle refugee-specific conditions and circumstances.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Several barriers prevent Western mental health protocols and categorizations from effectively evaluating and treating refugees. For example, bereavement and demoralization are often labeled as depression in Western mental health. Moreover, access to mental health resources is often time-limited for newly-arrived refugees, which poses another challenge health professionals attempting to deliver effective and culturally appropriate care, which takes into account the unique history and cultural diversity of the refugee population.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Kate E.; Davidson, Graham R.; Schweitzer, Robert D. (2010-10-01). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1939-0025.2010.01062.x "Review of refugee mental health interventions following resettlement: Best practices and recommendations"].

According to a study in 2013, Latino (Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, or Other) women were significantly affected by pre-migration measures (migration itself and unplanned migration) that resulted in higher levels of psychological distress, but not Latino men. The study also found that both men and women were more likely to report fair or poor physical health if they migrated to the United States in an unplanned manner.&lt;ref&gt;Torres, Jacqueline M., and Steven P. Wallace. "Migration Circumstances, Psychological Distress, and Self-Rated Physical Health for Latino Immigrants in the United States."''American journal of public health'', vol. 103, no. 9, 2013, pp. 1619-1627, doi:10.2105/AJPH.2012.301195.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dental health ===
Poor oral health is the most common health-related issue among refugee children and is the second most common health issue among refugee adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cote|first=S.|last2=Geltman|first2=P.|last3=Nunn|first3=M.|last4=Lituri|first4=K.|last5=Henshaw|first5=M.|last6=Garcia|first6=R.I.|date=2004|title=Dental caries of refugee children compared with US children|pmid=15574605|journal=Pediatrics|volume=114|pages=733–740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refugee children in the U.S. have been shown to have poorer oral health on average, due to lack of access to dental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reza|first=Mona|last2=Amin|first2=Maryam S.|last3=Sgro|first3=Adam|last4=Abdelaziz|first4=Angham|last5=Ito|first5=Dick|last6=Main|first6=Patricia|last7=Azarpazhooh|first7=Amir|date=2016-02-01|title=ORAL HEALTH STATUS OF IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE CHILDREN IN NORTH AMERICA: A SCOPING REVIEW|journal=Journal (Canadian Dental Association)|volume=82|pages=g3|issn=1488-2159|pmid=27548669}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with medical care, dental care is difficult to obtain by refugee families with limited English language proficiency and limited education about proper dental hygiene.

=== Lead poisoning ===
[[Lead poisoning]] is an important health issue for children all around the world. The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (i.e., BLLs ≥ 10&amp;nbsp;µg/dL) among newly resettled refugee children is substantially higher than the 2.2% prevalence for US children.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/refugee%20recommendations.pdf|title=CDC Recommendations for Lead Poisoning Prevention in Newly Arrived Refugee Children|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 Massachusetts study found as many as 27% of newly arrived refugee children with elevated BLLs, making refugees one of the highest risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;Geltman PL, Brown MJ, Cochran J. Lead poisoning among refugee children resettled in Massachusetts, 1995-1999" ''Pediatrics'' 2001; 108:158-162&lt;/ref&gt; Refugees may be exposed to lead from a number of sources which can include: [[leaded gasoline]], [[herbal remedies]], [[cosmetics]], [[spices]] that contain lead, cottage industries that use lead in an unsafe manner, and limited regulation of emissions from larger industries.&lt;ref&gt;Zabel, E., Smith, M.E., O’Fallon, A. Implementation of CDC Refugee Blood Lead Testing Guidelines in Minnesota. Public Health Rep. 2008 Mar-Apr;123(2):111-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The detrimental effects of lead on children may occur with no overt symptoms and blood lead testing is the only way to determine exposure or poisoning. Lead poisoning is typically treated by identifying the lead source, eliminating that source, and regularly receiving testing to ensure that blood lead levels are decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/publications/refugeetoolkit/refugee_tool_kit.htm|title=CDC - Lead - Lead Poisoning Prevention in Newly Arrived Refugee Children: Tool Kit|last=Health|first=National Center for Environmental|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For extremely high blood lead levels (i.e., BLLs ≥ 45&amp;nbsp;µg/dL), [[chelation therapy]] may recommended for refugee children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/18/applications/4_2_LeadOralChelators.pdf|title=Oral Chelation Therapy for Patients with Lead Poisoning|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC recommends lead testing for newly arrived refugee children younger than 16 years of age.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Guidelines for testing vary among states, ranging from testing children younger than six years of age to the CDC age limits of testing those younger than 16 years of age.

=== Infant Mortality ===
A study done in 2007 found that infants born to Mexican-immigrant women in the United States had a 10% lower mortality rate than infants born to non-Hispanic women in the United States. This research further support for the [[Hispanic paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Hummer, Robert A., et al. "Paradox found (again): Infant Mortality among the Mexican-Origin Population in the United States."'' Demography'', vol. 44, no. 3, 2007, pp. 441-457, doi:10.1353/dem.2007.0028.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet ===
A study that based its research on the New Immigrant Survey (NIS) found that Hispanic immigrants that have been in the United States the longest have experienced greater changes in their diet. Of these Hispanics with the greater change in their diet since moving to the U.S., the ones who have reported the worst health are the ones who have spent more time in the United States. Also, Hispanic immigrants who have spent the most time in the U.S. and reported worse health were also more likely to report the use of English language in their workplace. These findings demonstrate some correlation between Hispanic-immigrant health and their assimilation to American behavior in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Akresh, Ilana R. "Dietary Assimilation and Health among Hispanic Immigrants to the United States."'' Journal of Health and Social Behavior'', vol. 48, no. 4, 2007, pp. 404-417, doi:10.1177/002214650704800405.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical screening for entry to the United States ==
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] provides two major categories of refugee health guidelines:  
* The '''overseas medical screening guidelines''' provide panel physicians guidance on the overseas pre-departure presumptive treatments for malaria and intestinal parasites. These screenings are usually conducted days to weeks before the refugee departs from his or her country of asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/overseas/overseas-guidelines.html|title=Overseas Guidelines {{!}} Immigrant and Refugee Health {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''domestic medical screening guidelines''' are provided for state public health departments and medical providers in the United States who conduct the initial medical screening for refugees. These screenings are usually conducted 30–90 days post-arrival in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/domestic/domestic-guidelines.html|title=Guidelines: Domestic Medical Exam Newly Arriving Refugees {{!}} Immigrant and Refugee Health {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overseas protective actions ===
Three medical interventions are either required or recommended in order to contain infectious disease and reduce the medical burdens that may be associated with refugee resettlement. First is a mandatory overseas screening for all refugees and immigrants, then a recommended domestic screening for refugees, and finally a required medical component to the Adjustment of Status ([[Permanent residence (United States)|Green Card]]) process.

These medical exams are performed by approximately 400 physicians [called Panel Physicians] selected by the [[US Department of State]] (DOS) consular officials. The CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ) provide the technical instructions and guidance to the physicians conducting the overseas exams. The screening is primarily aimed at detecting infectious diseases of [[public health]] concern. The overseas exam includes a medical history inquiry, [[physical exam]], [[chest x-ray]] for persons older than 14 years of age ([[Southeast Asian]] refugees older than 2 years of age), and specific lab tests. Testing routinely includes screening for [[syphilis]] and [[HIV]] in people over 15 years of age.

==== Laws ====
The CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine is responsible for providing the US Department of State and the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) with medical screening guidelines. The guidelines are developed in accordance with Section 212(a)(1)(A) of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] (INA), which outlines the reasons an alien is ineligible for a visa or admission to the United States, specifically based on health grounds. "The health-related grounds include those aliens who have a communicable disease of public health significance, who fail to present documentation of having received vaccination against vaccine-preventable diseases, who have or have had a physical or mental disorder with associated harmful behavior, and who are drug abusers or addicts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/laws/immigration-and-nationality-act|title=Immigration and Nationality Act|work=USCIS|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical conditions recognized in refugees are categorized as Class A or Class B and are described below. If a refugee is found to have an inadmissible health-related condition, a waiver is required for the applicant to come to the US.

==== Class conditions ====
The health-related grounds for exclusion of refugees and immigrants set forth in the law are implemented by a regulation, "Medical Examination of Aliens" (42 CFR, Part 34). The regulation [https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/domestic-refugee-questions.html lists certain disorders] that, if identified during the overseas medical examination, are grounds for exclusion (Class A condition) or represent such significant health problems (Class B condition) that they must be brought to the attention of consular authorities.

The purpose of the medical examination is to determine whether an alien has 1) a physical or mental disorder (including a communicable disease of public health significance or drug abuse/addiction) that renders him or her ineligible for admission or adjustment of status (Class A condition); or 2) a physical or mental disorder that, although not constituting a specific excludable condition, represents a departure from normal health or well-being that is significant enough to possibly interfere with the person's ability to care for himself or herself, or to attend school or work, or that may require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization in the future (Class B condition).

=== Domestic preventative actions ===
When refugees enter the United States, they must enter through one of the authorized ports of entry that have [https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/quarantine-stations-us.html Quarantine Stations]. At these locations, [[US Public Health Service]] personnel review refugees' medical documents and perform limited inspections to look for obvious signs of illness. Through an electronic notification system maintained by the CDC, state health officials in the destination state are notified and sent copies of the overseas medical exam.

Upon arrival in the US, it is recommended that refugees complete a domestic health screening that seeks to reduce health-related barriers to successful resettlement and protect the health of the US population. Domestic health exams focus on infectious disease screening, but can also offer diagnosis and treatment for other health conditions identified. The parameters of the screening are based upon the [http://dhs.wisconsin.gov/international/refugee/PDF/ORRprotocal.pdf 1995 Office of Refugee Resettlement Medical Screening Protocol], but new guidance is forthcoming.

==== Laws ====
The Refugee Act of 1980, which amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a domestic refugee resettlement program, has outlined several public health activities with regards to refugee resettlement. First, all state or local health officials are to be notified of each refugee's arrival so that they can provide timely treatment for health conditions of public health significance identified overseas. The Director of ORR has the authority to make grants to state or local health agencies to help them meet the costs of providing medical screening and initial medical treatment to refugees. In this way, states can provide domestic health assessment services with federal refugee funding support. To qualify for this funding, the state health assessments need to be in accordance with ORR requirements and approved by the ORR director. It is recommended that a refugee receive a health screening within 90 days of entering the United States. The screening protocols are left to state health officials with the approval of ORR.

==== Domestic health assessment ====
A Medical Screening Protocol for Newly Arriving Refugees was developed by ORR in collaboration with CDC in 1995. Many states have added requirements in addition to the ORR protocol. DHHS is now drafting guidance for an expanded domestic protocol for screening refugees. The scope of the domestic health exam includes:
* Follow up (evaluation, treatment and/or referral) of Class A and B conditions identified during the overseas medical exam
* Identification of persons with communicable diseases of potential public health importance that were not identified during, or developed subsequent to the overseas exam
* Introduction of incoming refugees and eligible clients to the US health care system, and
* Identification of conditions that could present a barrier to self-sufficiency

=== Adjustment of status exam ===
Refugees are eligible to apply for [[adjustment of status]] after one year in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-through-refugee-or-asylee-status/green-card-refugee|title=Green Card for a Refugee|work=USCIS|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most immigrants are required to have a full medical exam at the time of applying for adjustment of status, refugees are an exception. Refugees who arrived without a Class A condition only require vaccinations with their adjustment of status; the full medical examination is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/adjustment-status|title=Adjustment of Status|work=USCIS|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full medical exam is only required for refugees if a Class A condition existed prior to arrival in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ), www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dq/civil.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Rondanini Pietà''''' is a [[marble sculpture]] that [[Michelangelo]] worked on from 1552 until the last days of his life, in 1564. Several sources indicate that there were actually three versions, with this one being the last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xy8qxGlF4jcC&amp;pg=PA117|author=Enrica Crispino|title=Michelangelo.

This final sculpture revisited the theme of the [[Virgin Mary]] mourning over the emaciated body of the dead [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], which he had first explored in his ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'' of 1499. Like his late series of drawings of the [[Crucifixion]] and the sculpture of the [[The Deposition (Michelangelo)|Deposition of Christ]] intended for his own tomb, it was produced at a time when Michelangelo's sense of his own mortality was growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A_1Ady0GAuUC&amp;pg=PA23|title=The Changing Status of the Artist|editor1=Emma Barker|editor2=Nick Webb|editor3=Kim Woods|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=1999|page=23|isbn=0-300-07740-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had worked on the sculpture all day, just six days before his death.&lt;ref&gt;(11 September 2010), [http://www.michelangeloexperience.com/2010/09/the-rondanini-pieta/ The Rondanini Pieta] Retrieved 4 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rondanini Pietà'' was begun before The Deposition of Christ was completed in 1555. In his dying days, Michelangelo hacked at the marble block until only the dismembered right arm of Christ survived from the sculpture as originally conceived. The elongated Virgin and Christ are a departure from the idealised figures that exemplified the sculptor's earlier style, and have been said to bear more of a resemblance to the attenuated figures of [[Gothic sculpture]] than those of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michelangelo.net/rondanini-pieta/ Rondanini Pieta] Retrieved 4 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italoamericano.org/story/2015-4-20/rondanini|title=Rondanini Pietà, last Michelangelo's masterpiece|work=The Italo-Americano|date=20 April 2015|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also suggest that the elongated figures are reminiscent of the style used in [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.con/books?id=1n_dCP6i7zoC&amp;pg=PA247|author=L.

It has also been suggested that the sculpture should not be considered unfinished, but a work in a continuous process of being made visible by the viewer as he or she moves around to see it from multiple angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Visibility of Sculpted Matter and Form : Michelangelo’s Rondanini Pietà and the Ontological Nature of Sculpture.|author=Ivana Vranic|publisher=[[University of British Columbia Press]]|year=2010|doi= 10.14288/1.0071176|url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0071176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Evstafiev-circus-russian bar.jpg|thumb|right|An act created by Russian [[artistic director]] [[Valentin Gneushev]]]]
The '''Russian bar''' (or '''Russian barre''') is a circus act which combines the [[gymnastic]] skills of the [[balance beam]], the rebound tempo skills of [[trampoline]] and the swing handstands skills of the [[uneven bars]] and the [[parallel bars]].  The bar (or ''barre'') itself is a flexible vaulting pole around 4 meters long, typically made of [[fibreglass]]. This genre was first created by the Russian artist Alexander Moiseev, who brought his act twice to the [[International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo]], winning the Gold and Silver Clown.

==Technique==
Two porters ("bottom people"), one at each end of the Russian bar, control the bar and the movements of the "flyer" ("top mounter"), guiding him or her into tempo swings and transitional aerial moves. The flyer will prepare for the bar's catapult when the porters give a "ready" signal.
 
With the advancement of highly intricate acrobatic-aerial techniques, two to three poles can be secured together, allowing for a higher lift and resulting in more airtime.  At the present heights, aerial skills such as "full-in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Bar Trio NCAA Final Four|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co2Xj2BNFcc|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;, full-out" (double twisting doubles)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Bar Trio NCAA Final Four|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co2Xj2BNFcc|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;, trifis (triple twisting somersault)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Russian bar performance at the Monte Carlo Circus Festival|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRJxJdgc4Ng}}&lt;/ref&gt;, triple sault{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and "Miller" (triple twisting double){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} somersaults are possible.

The Russian bar act requires [[acrobatics|acrobat]]s to be highly skilled in tumbling and have experience with the [[trampoline]] and/or sports acrobats. To perform, the act must collaborate on many levels.  Additionally, the act requires not only physical skill, but psychological and communicative skills as well.

As the flyer is flung high in the air, a good deal of clearance is necessary when performing this acrobatic act.

An act featuring the Russian bar appeared on [[America's Got Talent]] and was voted to return.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">[[Image:Farsoun1.jpg|thumb|right|Samih Farsoun]]'''Samih K. Farsoun''', (1937 in [[Haifa]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] – June 9, 2005) was a [[professor]] emeritus of [[sociology]] at [[American University]], where he taught for thirty years until his retirement in 2003. He graduated from [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]. He received a [[master's degree]] in 1961 and a [[PhD]] in 1971, both in sociology from the [[University of Connecticut]].  He died June 9 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while on a walk with his wife in [[New Buffalo, Michigan|New Buffalo]], [[Michigan]]. He was a resident of Florida and [[Washington, D.C.]] During his career at AU, Farsoun served as chairman of the Department of Sociology for eleven years, chairman and member of numerous university-wide committees and founder of its Arab Studies Program.

He was the founding dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the newly established [[American University of Sharjah]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] from 1997 to 1999. In 2004, Farsoun was named founding dean of Academic Affairs and the College of Arts and Sciences at the newly established [[American University of Kuwait]], where he served until February.

An activist and mentor to young [[Arab-American]]s, Farsoun was a founding member of several organizations and the author or editor of several books and numerous other writings on varied aspects of the Arab world, [[Third World]] development and the political economy of the Middle East. He lectured at numerous conferences and provided commentary on radio and television news shows on the Middle East.

*He served as a founding member and president of the [[Association of Arab American University Graduates]]; founding member of the [[Arab Sociological Association]].
*He was editor of [[Arab Studies Quarterly]];
*a member of the International Advisory Board of the [[Holy Land Studies: A Multidisciplinary Journal]];
*a founding fellow of the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]];
*board member of Partners for Peace, formerly the [[American Alliance for Palestinian Human Rights]] in Washington, D.C.;
*and board member of the [[Middle East Children's Alliance]] in [[Berkeley, California]].

Farsoun was one of the first members of the board of directors of the [[Jerusalem Fund]] for Education and Community Development and first member of the executive committee of the [[Center for Policy Analysis on Palestine]], now the [[Palestine Center]], both based in Washington. He was a founding member of the [[Trans-Arab]] Research Institute in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].

Farsoun was married to Katha Kissman and his daughter was Rouwayda Farsoun, an adoptee from the Palestinian refugee camp [[Tel Zatar]] in [[Lebanon]].

== Works ==
Farsoun wrote several books about the sociology and politics of the [[Middle East]]:
* "''[[Palestine and the Palestinians]]''" (1997), an updated Arabic edition of the book was published in [[Beirut]] in 2003.
* "''[[Culture and Customs of the Palestinians]]''" (2004). An updated second edition of "''[[Palestine and the Palestinians]]''" (2006) co-authored with [[Naseer Aruri]] is now available by Westview Press.

Additionally, he published more than 75 papers, book chapters and articles. His works have been translated into several languages, including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]]. Farsoun also published numerous columns in Arabic and English journals and newspapers.

'''SemEval''' ('''Sem'''antic '''Eval'''uation) is an ongoing series of evaluations of [[Semantic analysis (computational)|computational semantic analysis]] systems; it evolved from the '''Senseval''' [[word sense]] evaluation series. The evaluations are intended to explore the nature of [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in language. While meaning is intuitive to humans, transferring those intuitions to computational analysis has proved elusive.

This series of evaluations is providing a mechanism to characterize in more precise terms exactly what is necessary to compute in meaning. As such, the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations with meaning. These exercises have evolved to articulate more of the dimensions that are involved in our use of language. They began with apparently simple attempts to identify [[word sense]]s computationally. They have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence (e.g., [[semantic role labeling]]), relations between sentences (e.g., [[coreference]]), and the nature of what we are saying ([[semantic relations]] and [[sentiment analysis]]).

The purpose of the SemEval and Senseval exercises is to evaluate semantic analysis systems. "[[Semantic analysis (linguistics)|Semantic Analysis]]" refers to a formal analysis of meaning, and "computational" refer to approaches that in principle support effective implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, P., and Bos, J. (2005), '''Representation and Inference for Natural Language: A First Course in Computational Semantics''', CSLI Publications. {{ISBN|1-57586-496-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three evaluations, Senseval-1 through Senseval-3, were focused on [[word sense disambiguation]], each time growing in the number of languages offered in the tasks and in the number of participating teams. Beginning with the fourth workshop, SemEval-2007 (SemEval-1), the nature of the tasks evolved to include [[Semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]] tasks outside of word sense disambiguation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navigli | first1 = R | year = 2009 | title =  Word sense disambiguation| url = | journal = ACM Computing Surveys | volume = 41 | issue = 2| pages = 1–69 | doi=10.1145/1459352.1459355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Triggered by the conception of the [[*SEM conference]], the SemEval community had decided to hold the evaluation workshops yearly in association with the *SEM conference. It was also the decision that not every evaluation task will be run every year, e.g. none of the WSD tasks were included in the SemEval-2012 workshop.

==History==

===Early evaluation of algorithms for word sense disambiguation===
From the earliest days, assessing the quality of [[word sense disambiguation]] (WSD) algorithms had been primarily a matter of [[Natural language processing#Different types of evaluation|intrinsic evaluation]], and “almost no attempts had been made to evaluate embedded WSD components”.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, M., Ng, H.T., &amp; Hoa, T.D. (2006), '''Evaluation of WSD systems''', in Eneko Agirre &amp; Phil Edmonds (eds.), Word Sense Disambiguation: Algorithms and Applications, Text, Speech and Language Technology, vol. 33. Amsterdam: Springer, 75–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Only very recently &lt;sup&gt;(2006)&lt;/sup&gt; had extrinsic evaluations begun to provide some evidence for the value of WSD in end-user applications.&lt;ref&gt;Resnik, P. (2006), '''WSD in NLP applications''', in Eneko Agirre &amp; Phil Edmonds (eds.), Word Sense Disambiguation: Algorithms and Applications. Dordrecht: Springer, 299–338.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1990 or so, discussions of the sense disambiguation task focused mainly on illustrative examples rather than comprehensive evaluation. The early 1990s saw the beginnings of more systematic and rigorous intrinsic evaluations, including more formal experimentation on small sets of ambiguous words.&lt;ref&gt;Yarowsky, D. (1992), '''Word-sense disambiguation using statistical models of Roget’s categories trained on large corpora'''. Proceedings of the 14th Conference on Computational Linguistics, 454–60. {{DOI|10.3115/992133.992140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senseval to SemEval===
In April 1997, Martha Palmer and Marc Light organized a workshop entitled ''Tagging with Lexical Semantics: Why, What, and How?'' in conjunction with the Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, M., &amp; Light, M. (1999), '''[http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/~light/tueb_html/semtag_ws.html Tagging with Lexical Semantics: Why, What, and How?| ACL SIGLEX workshop on tagging text with lexical semantics: what, why, and how?]''' Natural Language Engineering 5(2): i–iv.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, there was a clear recognition that manually annotated [[Text corpus|corpora]] had revolutionized other areas of NLP, such as [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[parsing]], and that corpus-driven approaches had the potential to revolutionize automatic semantic analysis as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, H.T. (1997), '''Getting serious about word sense disambiguation'''. Proceedings of the ACL SIGLEX Workshop on Tagging Text with Lexical Semantics: Why, What, and How? 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Kilgarriff recalled that there was “a high degree of consensus that the field needed evaluation,” and several practical proposals by Resnik and Yarowsky kicked off a discussion that led to the creation of the Senseval evaluation exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Resnik and Jimmy Lin (2010). '''Evaluation of NLP Systems'''. In Alexander Clark, Chris Fox, and Shalom Lappin, editors. The Handbook of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. Wiley-Blackwellis. 11:271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Kilgarriff and Martha Palmer (ed. 2000). '''Special Issue of Computers and the Humanities, SENSEVAL98:Evaluating Word Sense Disambiguation Systems'''. Kluwer, 34: 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Cotton, Phil Edmonds, Adam Kilgarriff, and Martha Palmer (ed. 2001). '''SENSEVAL-2: Second International Workshop on Evaluating Word Sense Disambiguation Systems'''. SIGLEX Workshop, ACL03, Toulouse, France.&lt;/ref&gt;

===SemEval's 3, 2 or 1 year(s) cycle===
After SemEval-2010, many participants feel that the 3-year cycle is a long wait. Many other shared tasks such as [[Conference on Natural Language Learning]] (CoNLL) and [[Recognizing Textual Entailments]] (RTE) run annually. For this reason, the SemEval coordinators gave the opportunity for task organizers to choose between a 2-year or a 3-year cycle.&lt;ref&gt;SIGLEX: Message Board (2010) Retrieved on Aug 15, 2012, from http://www.clres.com/siglex/messdisp.php?id=111&lt;/ref&gt; The SemEval community favored the 3-year cycle. &lt;br&gt;
Although the votes within the SemEval community favored a 3-year cycle, organizers and coordinators had settled to split the SemEval task into 2 evaluation workshops. This was triggered by the introduction of the new [[*SEM conference]]. The SemEval organizers thought it would be appropriate to associate our event with the *SEM conference and collocate the SemEval workshop with the *SEM conference. The organizers got very positive responses (from the task coordinators/organizers and participants) about the association with the yearly *SEM, and 8 tasks were willing to switch to 2012.  Thus was born SemEval-2012 and SemEval-2013.  The current plan is to switch to a yearly SemEval schedule to associate it with the *SEM conference but not every task needs to run every year.&lt;ref&gt;SemEval 3 Google Group post. Retrieved on Aug 15, 2012, from https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/semeval3/8YXMvVlH-CM%5B1-25%5D&lt;/ref&gt;

====List of Senseval and SemEval Workshops====
* ''Senseval-1'' took place in the summer of 1998 for English, French, and Italian, culminating in a workshop held at Herstmonceux Castle, Sussex, England on September 2–4.
* ''Senseval-2'' took place in the summer of 2001, and was followed by a workshop held in July 2001 in Toulouse, in conjunction with ACL 2001. Senseval-2 included tasks for Basque, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish and Swedish.

==SemEval Workshop framework==
The framework of the SemEval/Senseval evaluation workshops emulates the [[Message Understanding Conference]]s (MUCs) and other evaluation workshops ran by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency, renamed the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]]). 
[[File:SemEval framework.jpg|600px|none|SemEval Framework, adapted from [http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/related_projects/muc/muc_sw/muc_sw_manual.html MUC introduction]]]
'''Stages of SemEval/Senseval evaluation workshops'''&lt;ref&gt;Kilgarriff, A. (1998). '''SENSEVAL: An Exercise in Evaluating Word Sense Disambiguation Programs'''. In Proc. LREC, Granada, May 1998. Pp 581--588&lt;/ref&gt;
# Firstly, all likely participants were invited to express their interest and participate in the exercise design.
# A timetable towards a final workshop was worked out.
# A plan for selecting evaluation materials was agreed.
# [[Natural language processing#Different types of evaluation|'Gold standards']] for the individual tasks were acquired, often human annotators were considered as a gold standard to measure precision and recall scores of computer systems. These 'gold standards' are what the computational systems strive towards. In WSD tasks, human annotators were set on the task of generating a set of correct WSD answers (i.e. the correct sense for a given word in a given context)
# The gold standard materials, without answers, were released to participants, who then had a short time to run their programs over them and return their sets of answers to the organizers.
# The organizers then scored the answers and the scores were announced and discussed at a workshop.

==Semantic evaluation tasks==
Senseval-1 &amp; Senseval-2 focused on evaluation WSD systems on major languages that were available corpus and computerized dictionary. Senseval-3 looked beyond the [[lexeme]]s and started to evaluate systems that looked into wider areas of semantics, such as Semantic Roles (technically known as [[Theta roles]] in formal semantics), [[Logic Form]] Transformation (commonly semantics of phrases, clauses or sentences were represented in [[First-order logic|first-order logic forms]]) and Senseval-3 explored performances of semantics analysis on [[Machine translation]].

As the types of different computational semantic systems grew beyond the coverage of WSD, Senseval evolved into SemEval, where more aspects of computational semantic systems were evaluated.

===Overview of Issues in Semantic Analysis===

The SemEval exercises provide a mechanism for examining issues in semantic analysis of texts. The topics of interest fall short of the logical rigor that is found in formal computational semantics, attempting to identify and characterize the kinds of issues relevant to human understanding of language. The primary goal is to replicate human processing by means of computer systems. The tasks (shown below) are developed by individuals and groups to deal with identifiable issues, as they take on some concrete form.

The first major area in semantic analysis is the identification of the intended meaning at the word level (taken to include idiomatic expressions). This is word-sense disambiguation (a concept that is evolving away from the notion that words have discrete senses, but rather are characterized by the ways in which they are used, i.e., their contexts). The tasks in this area include lexical sample and all-word disambiguation, multi- and cross-lingual disambiguation, and lexical substitution. Given the difficulties of identifying word senses, other tasks relevant to this topic include word-sense induction, subcategorization acquisition, and evaluation of lexical resources.

The second major area in semantic analysis is the understanding of how different sentence and textual elements fit together. Tasks in this area include semantic role labeling, semantic relation analysis, and coreference resolution. Other tasks in this area look at more specialized issues of semantic analysis, such as temporal information processing, metonymy resolution, and sentiment analysis. The tasks in this area have many potential applications, such as information extraction, question answering, document summarization, machine translation, construction of thesauri and semantic networks, language modeling, paraphrasing,
and recognizing textual entailment. In each of these potential applications, the contribution of the types of semantic analysis constitutes the most outstanding research issue.

For example, in the [[word sense induction]] and [[word-sense disambiguation|disambiguation]] task, there are three separate phases:
#In the '''training phase''', evaluation task participants were asked to use a training dataset to induce the sense inventories for a set of polysemous words. The training dataset consisting of a set of polysemous nouns/verbs and the sentence instances that they occurred in. No other resources were allowed other than morphological and syntactic Natural Language Processing components, such as [[Part-of-speech tagging#morphological analyzers|morpohological analyzers]], [[Part-of-speech tagging|Part-Of-Speech taggers]] and [[parsing#computational parsers|syntactic parsers]].
#In the '''testing phase''', participants were provided with a [[test set]] for the disambiguating subtask using the induced sense inventory from the training phase.
#In the '''evaluation phase''', answers of to the testing phase were evaluated in a [[Supervised learning|supervised]] an [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] framework.
The unsupervised evaluation for WSI considered two types of evaluation [[V Measure]] (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007), and [[paired F-Score]] (Artiles et al., 2009). This evaluation follows the supervised evaluation of SemEval-2007 [[Word Sense Induction|WSI]] task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007)

The Multilingual WSD task was introduced for the SemEval-2013 workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Navigli, R., Jurgens, D., &amp; Vannella, D. (2013, June). Semeval-2013 task 12: Multilingual word sense disambiguation. In Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013), in conjunction with the Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (* SEM 2013) (pp. 222-231).&lt;/ref&gt; The task is aimed at evaluating Word Sense Disambiguation systems in a multilingual scenario using BabelNet as its sense inventory. Unlike similar task like crosslingual WSD or the [[Lexical substitution|multilingual lexical substitution]] task, where no fixed sense inventory is specified, Multilingual WSD uses the [[BabelNet]] as its sense inventory. Prior to the development of BabelNet, a bilingual [[Classic monolingual WSD#Task Description|lexical sample]] WSD evaluation task was carried out in SemEval-2007 on Chinese-English bitexts.&lt;ref&gt;Peng Jin , Yunfang Wu and Shiwen Yu. [http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/S/S07/S07-1004.pdf SemEval-2007 task 05: multilingual Chinese-English lexical sample]. Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations, p.19-23, June 23–24, 2007, Prague, Czech Republic.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cross-lingual WSD task was introduced in the SemEval-2007 evaluation workshop and re-proposed in the SemEval-2013 workshop 
.&lt;ref name="CLWSD13"&gt;Lefever, E., &amp; Hoste, V. (2013, June). Semeval-2013 task 10: Cross-lingual word sense disambiguation. In Second joint conference on lexical and computational semantics (Vol. 2, pp. 158-166).&lt;/ref&gt;  To facilitate the ease of integrating WSD systems into other [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) applications, such as Machine Translation and multilingual [[Information Retrieval]], the cross-lingual WSD evaluation task was introduced a language-independent and knowledge-lean approach to WSD. The task is an unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation task for English nouns by means of parallel corpora. It follows the lexical-sample variant of the Classic WSD task, restricted to only 20 polysemous nouns.

It is worth noting that the SemEval-2014 have only two tasks that were multilingual/crosslingual, i.e. (i) the [http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task5/ L2 Writing Assistant] task, which is a crosslingual WSD task that includes English, Spanish, German, French and Dutch and (ii) the [http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task12/ Multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity] task that evaluates systems on English and Spanish texts.

===Areas of evaluation===
The major tasks in semantic evaluation include the following areas of [[natural language processing]]. This list is expected to grow as the field progresses.&lt;ref&gt;'''SemEval Portal''' (n.d.). In ACLwiki. Retrieved August 12, 2010 from http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?title=SemEval_Portal&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows the areas of studies that were involved in Senseval-1 through SemEval-2014 (S refers to Senseval and SE refers to SemEval, e.g. S1 refers to Senseval-1 and SE07 refers to SemEval2007):

===Type of Semantic Annotations===

SemEval tasks have created many types of semantic annotations, each type with various schema. In SemEval-2015, the organizers have decided to group tasks together into several tracks. These tracks are by the type of semantic annotations that the task hope to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;'''SemEval-2015 website'''. Retrieved Nov 14, 2014 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/index.php?id=tasks&lt;/ref&gt; Here lists the type of semantic annotations involved in the SemEval workshops:

#Learning Semantic Relations
#Question and Answering 
#Semantic Parsing
#Semantic Taxonomy
#Sentiment Analysis
#Text Similarity
#Time and Space
#Word Sense Disambiguation and Induction

A task and its track allocation is flexible; a task might develop into its own track, e.g. the taxonomy evaluation task in SemEval-2015 was under the ''Learning Semantic Relations'' track and in SemEval-2016, there is a dedicated track for ''Semantic Taxonomy'' with a new ''Semantic Taxonomy Enrichment'' task.&lt;ref&gt;Georgeta Bordea, Paul Buitelaar, Stefano Faralli and Roberto Navigli. 2015. ''Semeval-2015 task 17: Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation (TExEval)''. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation. Denver, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''SemEval-2016 website'''. Retrieved Jun 4 2015 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41406">[[image:LippenStudium1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Children]] copy with their own [[mouth]]s the words spoken by the mouths of those around them. This enables them to learn the [[pronunciation]] of words not already in their [[vocabulary]].]]
'''Speech repetition''' is the [[speech|saying]] by one individual of the spoken [[Speech production|vocalizations]] made by another individual. This requires the ability in the person making the copy to map the sensory input they [[Hearing (sense)|hear]] from the other person's vocal [[pronunciation]] into a similar motor output with their own [[vocal tract]].

Such speech input output imitation often occurs independently of speech comprehension such as in [[speech shadowing]] when a person automatically says words heard in [[earphone]]s, and the pathological condition of [[echolalia]] in which people [[reflex]]ively repeat overheard words. This links to speech repetition of words being separate in the [[human brain|brain]] to [[speech perception]]. Speech repetition occurs in the  dorsal speech processing stream while speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by this route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay following  storage in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]].

In humans, the ability to map heard input vocalizations into motor output is highly developed due to this copying ability playing a critical role in a child's rapid expansion of their  [[Vocabulary#Vocabulary growth|spoken vocabulary]]. In older children and adults it still remains important as it enables the continued learning of novel words and names and [[Second language acquisition|additional languages]]. Such repetition is also necessary for the propagation of language from generation to generation. It has also been suggested that the phonetic units out of which speech is made have been selected upon by the process of vocabulary expansion and vocabulary [[cultural evolution|transmission]]s  due to  children preferentially copying words in terms of more easily imitated elementary units.

The ability to repeat and imitate speech sounds occurs separately to that of normal speech.

===Effector independent===
Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations in spite of vocal tract anatomy differences in size and shape due to [[gender]], [[Human development (biology)|age]] and individual [[anatomical]] variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: [[dentist]]s recognize three basic shapes of [[palate]]: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of [[malocclusion]] between the two [[jaw]]s; nine ways teeth relate to the [[dental arch]] and a wide range of [[maxilla]]ry and [[human mandible|mandible]] deformities.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer HH. (1971). Speech defects associated with dental malocclusions and related abnormalities. In L. E. (Eds), Handbook of speech pathology and audiology (pp. 715-766), New York, Appleton Century. {{ISBN|978-0-13-381764-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and [[dental caries]]. Other factors that do not impede  the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation  are gross oral deformations such as [[hare-lip]]s, [[cleft palate]]s or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in [[ventriloquism]]). [[Paranasal sinuses]]  vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their  asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Williams RJ. (1967). You are extra-ordinary. New York, Random House.  pp. 26-27. {{OCLC|156187572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vocal traits also vary moreover when people get upper respiratory tract infections  as the shape and size of sinus cavities is further changed with the swelling of mucous membranes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse linguistic vocalizations===
Vocal imitation occurs potentially in regard to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use [[consonant|consonantal phone]]s that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract [[place of articulation]]s (from the [[lip]]s to the [[glottis]]). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable [[manner of articulation]]s ([[nasal stop]]s to [[lateral click]]s). Speech can be copied in regard to its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|social accent]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Pitch accent|pitch]] and individuality (as with entertainment [[impersonator]]s). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, [[timbre]], pitch, [[loudness]] and [[emotion]]. Speech further exists in different forms such as [[song]], [[Poetry|verse]], [[Vociferation|scream]] and [[whispering|whisper]]. Intelligible speech can be produced with pragmatic intonation and in [[regional dialect]]s and [[Accent (dialect)|foreign accents]]. These aspects are readily copied: people asked to repeat speech-like words imitate not only phones but also accurately other pronunciation aspects such as [[fundamental frequency]],&lt;ref name="Kappes"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kappes | first1 = J. | last2 = Baumgaertner | first2 = A. | last3 = Peschke | first3 = C. | last4 = Ziegler | first4 = W. | title = Unintended imitation in nonword repetition | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2009.08.008 | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 140–151 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19811813| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schwa]]-syllable expression,&lt;ref name="Kappes"/&gt; voice [[spectrum|spectra]] and lip [[kinematic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 16698051|year= 2007|author1= Gentilucci|first1= M|title= Imitation during phoneme production|journal= Neuropsychologia|volume= 45|issue= 3|pages= 608–15|last2= Bernardis|first2= P|doi= 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[voice onset time]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Mechanism==

Spoken words are sequences of motor movements organized around vocal tract gesture motor targets.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer LH. (1984). Motor programming in language production. In H. Bouma &amp; D. G. Bouwhuis, (Eds), Attention and performance, X. pp. (17-41). London, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-86377-005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalization due to this is copied in terms of the motor goals that organize it rather than the exact movements with which it is produced. These vocal motor goals are auditory. According to James Abbs&lt;ref&gt;Abbs JH. (1986). Invariance and variability in speech production, A distinction between linguistic intent and its neuromotor implementation. In J. S. Perkell, &amp; D. H. Klatt, (Eds), Invariance and variability in speech processes (pp. 202-219).

==Neurology==

===Dorsal speech processing stream function===

Two cortical processing streams exist: a ventral one which maps sound onto meaning, and a dorsal one, that maps  sound onto motor representations. The dorsal stream projects from the posterior [[Sylvian fissure]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]], onto frontal motor areas, and is not normally involved in speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Carl Wernicke]] identified a pathway between the left posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] (a cerebral cortex region sometimes called the [[Wernicke's area]]) as a centre of the sound "images" of speech and its syllables that connected through the [[arcuate fasciculus]] with part of the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (sometimes called the [[Broca's area]]) responsible for their articulation.&lt;ref name="Wernicke"/&gt;  This pathway is now broadly identified as the dorsal speech pathway, one of the two pathways (together with the ventral pathway) that process speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the motor theory of speech imitation such speech mirror neurons in infants have selected for motor goals with vocal track gestures that are easy to imitate and this has shaped the nature of the phonetic units out of which spoken words are constructed.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt; Speech is mirrored constantly into its articulations since speakers cannot know in advance that a word is unfamiliar and in need of repetition—which is only learnt after the opportunity to map it into articulations has gone. Thus, speakers if they are to incorporate unfamiliar words into their spoken vocabulary
must by default map all spoken input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Skoyles | first1 = J.

==Evolution and language==
Human language is a vocabulary-based form of communication that  unlike that of other animals employs tens of thousands of lexicals and names. This requires that young humans new to language have the ability to quickly learn both the pronunciations and use of many thousands of words. If children could not repeat speech without problems,  human language could not exist.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;  This makes the evolution of the capacity of speech repetition a critical innovation needed for the [[origin of speech]]&lt;ref name="skoyles"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor theory of speech imitation argues that this need for speech to be imitable not speech perception nor [[speech production]] moreover underlies the evolved nature of the [[vowel]] and consonant units of phonetics.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;

==Sign language==
Words in [[sign languages]], unlike those in spoken ones, are made not of sequential units but of [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] configurations of subword unit arrangements, the spatial analogue of the sonic-chronological [[morpheme]]s of spoken language.&lt;ref name="Poizner"&gt;Poizner H. Klima ES. Bellugi U. (1987). What the hands reveal about the brain. MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-66066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These words, like spoken ones, are learnt by imitation.  Indeed, rare cases of compulsive sign-language echolalia exist in otherwise language-deficient deaf autistic individuals born into signing families.&lt;ref name="Poizner"/&gt; At least some cortical areas neurobiologically active during both sign and vocal speech, such as the auditory cortex, are associated with the act of imitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

This includes Somali women in the autonomous [[Puntland]] region and [[Somaliland]], a self-declared republic that is internationally recognized as an [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous region]] (Federal Member State) of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Sqfirhbmsscf"&gt;[http://wardheernews.com/Articles_2010/June/Buh/29_Somaliland_recognition_&amp;_the_HBM-SSC_Factor.html Somaliland’s Quest for International Recognition and the HBM-SSC Factor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frspc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Republic of Somalia - Provisional Constitution|url=http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a poll cited by [[Face2Face Africa]], Somalia has the most beautiful women in [[Africa]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://face2faceafrica.com/article/most-beautiful-african-women&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
Most people in Somalia are [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="Mepc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mepc.org/workshops/popstat.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214023655/http://www.mepc.org/workshops/popstat.asp|archivedate=2006-12-14 |title=Middle East Policy Council – Muslim Populations Worldwide |publisher=Mepc.org |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia's population is expanding at a growth rate of 1.67% per annum and a birth rate of 41.45 births/1,000 people. Somalia's [[total fertility rate]] in 2013 was 6.17 children born per woman, the fourth highest in the world.&lt;ref name="factbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most local residents are young, with a median age of 17.7 years. 44.3% of the population are between the ages of 0–14 years, 53.5% are between the ages of 15–64 years, and only 2.3% are 65 years of age or older. The [[Sex ratio|gender ratio]] is roughly balanced, with proportionally about as many men as women.&lt;ref name="factbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the civil war, exact population statistics for Somalia have been difficult to determine since 1975.  According to the United Nations, roughly half the population of Somalia, as of 2014, is female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://somalia.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Population-Estimation-Survey-of-Somalia-PESS-2013-2014.pdf|title=Population Estimation Survey 2014 for the 18 Pre-War Regions of Somalia|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations Population Fund, Somalia Country Office|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=PDF file.|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Women's Rights in Somalia ==
By the late 9th century A.D., almost all people living in Somalia had converted to [[Islam]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Somalia|title=Islam in Somalia|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The rights of women under the [[Quran|Koran]] include the right to life, education, ownership and inheritance of property, as well as the right to give consent to be married and the right to a marriage contract with one's future husband &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510|title=Women and Islam|last=|first=|date=2018|website=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam: Oxford Studies Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the same time, Somali culture has traditionally operated as a [[patriarchy]], where men made the majority of financial and family decisions, and dominated the public sphere.         

After Somalia gained its independence from colonial powers in 1960, both men and women were given the right to vote. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~park22d/classweb/Women.html|title=Somali Women|last=Park|first=Daeyun|date=2009|website=Lives in Conflict: Somali Women and Children|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to increased participation of women in public life from the 1970s to the 1980s.  Female school enrollment, women in the workplace, and women's participation in politics and the military all increased during that time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unicef.org/somalia/SOM_WomenInIslam.pdf|title=Women's Rights in Islam and Somali Culture|last=|first=|publisher=UNICEF|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=6|format=PDF file}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Family Law of 1975 gave equal rights to women and men regarding marriage, divorce, and inheritance of property and restricted polygamy. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamed|first=I.A.|date=2015|title=Somali women and the socialist state.|url=http://www.qscience.com/doi/pdf/10.5339/messa.2015.4|journal=Journal of Georgetown University Qatar Middle Eastern Studies Student Association|volume=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Siad Barre]] supported the establishment of the [[Somali Women's Democratic Organization]] (SWDO) in 1977 in memory of [[Hawo Tako]], a female member of the anti-colonialist [[Somali Youth League]] who was killed by the Italian forces in 1948 &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.  The Barre regime established the SWDO and appointed its female leadership in order to maintain female compliance with the government. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the Barre regime fell in 1991, Somalia embraced [[Islamic extremism]] which effectively eliminated the legal rights of women &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6a83b8.html|title=RefWorld: Human Rights Brief: Women in Somalia|last=|first=|date=1994|website=RefWorld|publisher=Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Clan and family structure==
The [[clan]] groupings of the [[Somali people]] are important [[social unit]]s, and clan membership plays a central part in Somali [[Culture of Somalia|culture]] and [[Politics of Somalia|politics]]. Clans are [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] and are often divided into sub-clans, sometimes with many sub-divisions.  

Somali society is traditionally ethnically [[Endogamy|endogamous]]. Women who marry are expected to join their husband's family. To extend ties of alliance, marriage is often to another Somali from a different clan. For example, a 1994 study observed that in 89 marriages contracted by men of the [[Dhulbahante]] clan, 55 (62%) were with women of Dhulbahante sub-clans other than those of their husbands; 30 (33.7%) were with women of surrounding clans of other clan families ([[Isaaq]], 28; [[Hawiye]], 3); and 3 (4.3%) were with women of other clans of the [[Darod]] clan family ([[Majeerteen]] 2, [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]] 1).&lt;ref&gt;Ioan M. Lewis, ''Blood and Bone: The Call of Kinship in Somali Society'', (Red Sea Press: 1994), p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Somali clans include:

*[[Darod]]
*[[Dir (clan)|Dir]]
*[[Hawiye]]
*[[Isaaq]]
*[[Rahanweyn]] (Digil and Mirifle)

In 1975, the most prominent government reforms regarding [[family law]] in a [[Muslim World|Muslim country]] were set in motion in the [[Somali Democratic Republic]], which put women and men, including husbands and wives, on complete equal footing.&lt;ref&gt;Pg.115 - Women in Muslim family law by John L. Esposito, Natana J. DeLong-Bas&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 Somali Family Law gave men and women equal division of property between the husband and wife upon divorce and the exclusive right to control by each spouse over his or her personal property.&lt;ref&gt;Pg.75 - Generating employment and incomes in Somalia: report of an inter-disciplinary employment and project-identification mission to Somalia financed by the United Nations Development Programme and executed by ILO/JASPA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attire==

During regular, day-to-day activities, women in Somalia usually wear the ''guntiino'', a long stretch of cloth tied over the shoulder and draped around the waist. The guntiino is traditionally made out of plain white fabric sometimes featuring with decorative borders, although nowadays alindi, a textile common in the [[Horn of Africa]] region and some parts of [[North Africa]], is more frequently used. The garment can be worn in many different styles and with different fabrics. 

For more formal settings such as weddings or religious celebrations like [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]], women wear the dirac, a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of cotton, polyester or saree fabric. The ''dirac'' is related to the short-sleeved Arabian [[kaftan]] dress. It is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Known as the gorgorad, the underskirt is made out of [[silk]] and serves as a key part of the overall outfit. 

The dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful, the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads. The fabric is typically acquired from Somali clothing stores in tandem with the ''gorgorad''. In the past, dirac fabric was also frequently purchased from South Asian merchandisers.

[[File:Ucidlhd22.png|thumb|Somali women in traditional attire.]]
Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as ''shash'', and also often cover their upper body with a [[shawl]] known as ''garbasaar''. Unmarried or young women do not always cover their heads. Traditional Arabian garb such as the [[Jilbāb|jilbab]] is also commonly worn.

Additionally, Somali women have a long tradition of wearing gold and silver jewelry, particularly bangles. During weddings, the bride is frequently adorned in gold. Many Somali women by tradition also wear gold necklaces and anklets. Xirsi, a quranic necklace, also worn in countries such as Ethiopia and Yemen, is also frequently worn.

[[Henna]] is another important part of Somali culture. It is worn by Somali women on their hands, arms, feet and neck during weddings, [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]], [[Ramadan]], and other festive occasions. Somali henna designs are similar to those in the Arabian peninsula, often featuring flower motifs and triangular shapes. The palm is also frequently decorated with a dot of henna and the fingertips are dipped in the dye. Henna parties are usually held before the wedding ceremony takes place.

==Literature==
Somalia has a long tradition of poetry. Several well-developed Somali forms of verse include the female-driven ''[[buraanbur]]'', as well as ''gabay'', ''jiifto'', ''geeraar'', ''wiglo'', ''beercade'', ''afarey'' and ''guuraw''. The gabay (epic poem) is mostly composed by men has the most complex length and meter, often exceeding 100 lines. It is considered the mark of poetic attainment when a young poet is able to compose such verse, and is regarded as the height of poetry.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi75"&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.75-76&lt;/ref&gt;

''Buraanbur'', which is of a lighter measure, is primarily composed by women. Groups of memorizers and reciters (''hafidayaal'') traditionally propagated the well-developed art form. Poems revolve around several main themes, including ''baroorodiiq'' (elegy), ''amaan'' (praise), ''jacayl'' (romance), ''guhaadin'' (diatribe), ''digasho'' (gloating) and ''guubaabo'' (guidance). The baroorodiiq is composed to commemorate the death of a prominent poet or figure.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi75"&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.75-76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable women==
Notable women in the country include Chairperson of the Barnet Muslim Women's Network [[Hanan Ibrahim]], former Federal Minister of Social Development [[Maryam Qaasim]], former Federal Foreign Minister [[Fowsiyo Yussuf Haji Aadan]], former Foreign Minister of the [[Somaliland]] region [[Edna Adan Ismail]], and parliamentary consultant [[Hodan Ahmed]].

== Gender Inequality ==
Women in Somalia have lower levels of education and higher levels of infant mortality than in other countries in Africa. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/rbas/doc/Women%27s%20Empowerment/Gender_Somalia.pdf|title=Gender in Somalia Brief.|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations Development Programme Country Office for Somalia Gender Unit.|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In urban areas, Somali women are more likely to be heads of households than in rural areas, but traditionally have not been allowed to make financial decisions or own property. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Female genital mutilation ==
{{See|Prevalence of female genital mutilation by country}}

About 97.9% of Somalia's women and girls underwent [[female genital mutilation]] in a 2005 study. This was at the time the world's highest prevalence rate of the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/index.html |title=Prevalence of FGM |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UNICEF 2010 report reported that Somalia had the world's highest rate of Type III FGM, with 79% of all Somali women having undergone the procedure. Another 15% of women underwent Type II FGM.&lt;ref name="prb.org"&gt;[http://www.prb.org/pdf10/fgm-wallchart2010.pdf Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Data and Trends: UPDATE 2010] UNICEF, Page 7&lt;/ref&gt; 

The prevalence is on the decline in the northern part of Somalia. In 2013, UNICEF in conjunction with the Somali authorities reported that the FGM prevalence rate among 1- to 14-year-old girls in the autonomous northern [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]] regions had dropped to 25% following a social and religious awareness campaign.&lt;ref name="Jpsfgmd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Female genital mutilation down|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/04/16/somalia-female-genital-mutilation-down.html|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=Associated Press via The Jakarta Post|date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 15 of the [[Constitution of Somalia|Federal Constitution]] adopted in August 2012 prohibits female circumcision.&lt;ref name="Frspc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2155">'''Ștefan Niculescu''' (July 31, 1927 &amp;ndash; January 22, 2008) was a [[Romanian people|Romanian]] [[composer]].

Niculescu was born in [[Moreni]], [[Dâmbovița County|Dâmbovita]]. He was credited with introducing his own brand of heterophony, a technique based on superimposing melodic material onto variations of itself in order to create textures that are propelled by thematic energy as well as by the more common textural factors of density and levels of activity. This creative approach bears similarities with [[György Ligeti]]'s [[micropolyphony]], but important aesthetic and stylistic differences set them apart.

Niculescu's work as a teacher made him a mentor to a whole generation of younger Romanian composers, among them [[Dan Dediu]].

Niculescu's work ''Ison II'' for wind and [[percussion]] permutates simultaneous segments of a [[diatonic]] melody producing a reverberating complexity of sound which is held together by a strong sense of modal clarity. ''Opus Dacicum'' for [[orchestra]] applies similar textural explorations but with a stronger sense of harmonic movement, often with a Wagnerian lushness that lends this music a sensuous appeal a world apart from Ligeti's cluster-oriented sonorities.

Among his honors are many awards from the [[Romanian Academy]] and [[The Society of Romanian Composers]]. He also received awards from the Académie des Beaux-Arts in [[Paris]] (1972), the International Record Critics Award (1985), and the [[Herder Prize]] in [[Vienna]] (1994).

In the 1970s he contributed to the popularization of modern music by organizing public listenings in [[Bucharest]] together with Şerban Stănciulescu.
