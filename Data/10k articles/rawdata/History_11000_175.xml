      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">'''Andrew Wyntoun''', known as  '''Andrew of Wyntoun''' ({{circa|1350|1425}}), was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] poet, a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] and [[prior of Loch Leven]] on [[St Serf's Inch]] and, later, a canon of [[St. Andrews]].

Andrew Wyntoun is most famous for his completion of an eight-syllabled metre entitled, ''[[Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland]]'', which contains an early mention of ''[[Robin Hood]]''; it is also cited by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the earliest work in English to use the word "[[Catholic]]":  [spelling modernized] "He was a constant Catholic;/All [[Lollard]] he hated and heretic."  Wyntoun wrote the 'Chronicle' at the request of his patron, [[Earls of Wemyss|Sir John of Wemyss]], whose representative, Mr. Erskine Wemyss of [[Wemyss Castle]], [[Fife]], possessed the oldest extant [[manuscript]] of the work.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Wyntoun, Andrew of|volume=28|page=873}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of the 'Chronicle' is the history of Scotland from the mythical period to the death of [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]] in 1420.&lt;ref&gt;Wyntoun's Chronicle Prologue IX&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine original manuscripts of the ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' still subsist today and are preserved within various facilities throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. Three out of the eight original manuscripts are currently preserved by the [[British Library]], two are in the possession of the [[Advocates' Library]] in [[Edinburgh]]; one, within the [[University of St Andrews]] Library; another, within the confines of [[Wemyss Castle]] and the eighth,  privately owned by Mister John Ferguson of [[Duns]], [[Berwickshire]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The first edition of the 'Chronicle' (based on the Royal manuscript) was published by [[David Macpherson (historian)|David Macpherson]] in 1795; the second edition was produced by [[David Laing (antiquary)|David Laing]] and published in 1872&lt;ref&gt;''The Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland by Androw of Wyntoun'', Edited by David Laing in three volumes, Edinburgh, Scottish Text Society, 1872&lt;/ref&gt; and the current standard edition was published by [[F. J. Amours]] as ''The Original Chronicle of Andrew of Wyntoun: Printed on Parallel Pages from the Cottonian and Wemyss MSS., with the Variants of the Other Texts''.

The ''Chronicle'' is entirely composed of couplets, usually of eight syllables, although frequently there also are lines of six or 10 syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A biographical dictionary of eminent Scotsmen|year=1875|publisher=Blackie &amp; Sons|location=Glasgow|page=562|url=http://digital.nls.uk/74514690|editor=Robert Chambers|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Art for art's sake'''" is the usual [[English language|English]] rendering of a [[French language|French]] [[slogan]] from the early 19th century, "'''''l'art pour l'art'''''", and expresses a philosophy that the intrinsic value of art, and the only "true" art, is divorced from any [[didactic]], moral, or utilitarian function. Such works are sometimes described as "[[autotelic]]", from the Greek ''autoteles'', "complete in itself", a concept that has been expanded to embrace "inner-directed" or "self-motivated" human beings.

The term is sometimes used commercially. A Latin version of this phrase ("'''''ARS GRATIA ARTIS'''''") is used as a motto by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and appears in the circle around the roaring head of [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] in its [[motion picture]] logo. &lt;!--Also, Delta House from the movie National Lampoon's Animal House use it as their motto, as can be seen on their fraternity flag.--&gt;

==History==
"''L'art pour l'art''" (translated as "art for art's sake") is credited to [[Théophile Gautier]] (1811–1872), who was the first to adopt the phrase as a slogan in the preface to his 1835 book, ''Mademoiselle de Maupin''. Gautier was not, however, the first to write those words: they appear in the works of [[Victor Cousin]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125149/art-for-arts-sake retrieved 23 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Constant]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. For example, Poe argues in his essay "[[The Poetic Principle]]" (1850):

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's sake [...] and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force: – but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, '''this poem written solely for the poem's sake'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"Art for art's sake" was a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[creed]] in the nineteenth century, a slogan raised in defiance of those who – from [[John Ruskin]] to the much later [[Communism|Communist]] advocates of [[socialist realism]] – thought that the value of art was to serve some [[moral]] or [[Didacticism|didactic]] purpose. "Art for art's sake" affirmed that art was valuable ''as'' art, that artistic pursuits were their own justification and that art did not need moral justification – and indeed, was allowed to be morally neutral or subversive.

In fact, [[James McNeill Whistler]] wrote the following in which he discarded the accustomed role of art in the service of the state or official religion, which had adhered to its practice since the [[Counter-Reformation]] of the sixteenth century: "Art should be independent of all claptrap – should stand alone [...] and appeal to the artistic sense of eye or ear, without confounding this with emotions entirely foreign to it, as devotion, pity, love, patriotism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Such a brusque dismissal also expressed the artist's distancing himself from [[Sentimentality|sentimentalism]]. All that remains of [[Romanticism]] in this statement is the reliance on the artist's own eye and sensibility as the arbiter.

The explicit slogan is associated in the history of English art and letters with [[Walter Pater]] and his followers in the [[aestheticism|Aesthetic Movement]], which was self-consciously in rebellion against [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] moralism. It first appeared in English in two works published simultaneously in 1868: Pater's review of [[William Morris]]'s poetry in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' and in ''[[William Blake]]'' by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. A modified form of Pater's review appeared in his ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873), one of the most influential texts of the Aesthetic Movement.

In Germany, the poet [[Stefan George]] was one of the first artists to translate the phrase ("''Kunst für die Kunst''") and adopt it for his own literary programme which he presented in the first volume of his literary magazine ''Blätter für die Kunst'' (1892). He was inspired mainly by [[Charles Baudelaire]] and the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] whom he had met in Paris, where he was friends with Albert Saint-Paul and consorted with the circle around [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].

==Criticism==

[[George Sand]] wrote in 1872 that ''L'art pour l'art'' was an empty phrase, an idle sentence. She asserted that artists had a "duty to find an adequate expression to convey it to as many souls as possible," ensuring that their works were accessible enough to be appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Letters of George Sand, Vol 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] claimed that there is no art for art’s sake:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the purpose of moral preaching and of improving man has been excluded from art, it still does not follow by any means that art is altogether purposeless, aimless, senseless — in short, ''l'art pour l'art'', a worm chewing its own tail. "Rather no purpose at all than a moral purpose!" — that is the talk of mere passion. A psychologist, on the other hand, asks: what does all art do? does it not praise? glorify? choose? prefer? With all this it strengthens or weakens certain valuations. Is this merely a "moreover"? an accident? something in which the artist's instinct had no share? Or is it not the very presupposition of the artist's ability? Does his basic instinct aim at art, or rather at the sense of art, at life? at a desirability of life? Art is the great stimulus to life: how could one understand it as purposeless, as aimless, as ''l'art pour l'art''?&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', “Skirmishes of an Untimely Man,” §24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary [[postcolonial]] African writers such as [[Leopold Senghor]] and [[Chinua Achebe]] have criticised the slogan as being a limited and Eurocentric view on art and creation. In "Black African Aesthetics," Senghor argues that "art is functional" and that "in black Africa, 'art for art's sake' does not exist." Achebe is more scathing in his collection of essays and criticism entitled ''Morning Yet on Creation Day'', where he asserts that "art for art's sake is just another piece of deodorised dog shit" (sic).&lt;ref&gt;Achebe, Chinua. ''Morning Yet on Creation Day''. Michigan: Heinemann Educational, 1975. Page 19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Benjamin]] discusses the slogan in his seminal 1936 essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]." He first mentions it in regard to the reaction within the realm of traditional art to innovations in reproduction, in particular [[photography]]. He even terms the "L'art pour l'art" slogan as part of a "[[theology]] of art" in bracketing off social aspects. In the Epilogue to the essay Benjamin discusses the links between [[fascism]] and art. His main example is that of [[Futurism]] and the thinking of its mentor [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]. One of the slogans of the Futurists was "Fiat ars - pereat mundus" ("Let art be created, though the world perish"). Provocatively, Benjamin concludes that as long as fascism expects war "to supply the artistic gratification of a sense of perception that has been changed by technology," then this is the "consummation," the realization, of "L'art pour l'art."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Benjamin, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," in ''Illuminations'', Fontana Press, London, 1973, 23. {{ISBN|0-00-686248-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diego Rivera]] claims that the "art for art's sake" theory would further divide the rich from the poor. Rivera goes on to say that since one of the characteristics of so called "pure art" was that it could only be appreciated by a few superior people, the art movement would strip art from its value as a social tool and ultimately make art into a currency-like item that would only be available to the rich. &lt;ref&gt;http://photo-soup.org/wp2013/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Rivera-Diego-The-revolutionary-spirit-in-modern-art.pdf; pg.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] said: "There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. [[Proletarian]] literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause; they are, as [[Lenin]] said, cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine."&lt;ref&gt;"Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art" (May 1942), ''Selected Works'', Vol. III, p. 86. Via ''[[Quotations of Chairman Mao Zedong]]'', accessed via the [[Marxists Internet Archive]] [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch32.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt;

The only female warlord in [[Afghanistan]], '''Bibi Ayesha''' controls a force of 50-150 men in the [[Nahrin District|Nahrin]] district of [[Baghlan Province]].&lt;ref name="cog"/&gt;

Also known as ''Kaftar'' ("The Pigeon"), she operated for at least two decades, fighting against [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|the Soviet invasion]] and the [[Taliban]] takeover.&lt;ref name="cog"/&gt;

She dismissed notions that the roles of women in Afghanistan should exclude military roles, saying "It makes no difference if you are a man or a woman when you have the heart of a fighter." &lt;ref name="cog"/&gt;

However, she does insist that a ''[[mahram]]'' male relative, accompany her into battle.&lt;ref name="cog"&gt;Coghlan, Tom. [[BBC]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4806516.stm Afghanistan's feared woman warlord], March 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

It has about 155,000 inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DICA_POPALED&amp;Lang=it |title=Statistiche Istat |publisher=Dati.istat.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its [[Cagliari metropolitan city|metropolitan city]] (including Cagliari and 16 other nearby municipalities) has more than 431,000 inhabitants. According to [[Eurostat]], the population of the [[Larger urban zone|Functional urban area]], the commuting zone of Cagliari, rises to 476,974.&lt;ref&gt;http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_lpop1&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;
Cagliari is the 26th largest city in Italy and the largest city on the island of Sardinia.

An ancient city with a long history, Cagliari has seen the rule of several civilisations. Under the buildings of the modern city there is a continuous stratification attesting to human settlement over the course of some five thousand years, from the [[Neolithic]] to today. Historical sites include the prehistoric [[Domus de Janas]], very damaged by cave activity, a large Carthaginian era [[necropolis]], a Roman era [[amphitheatre]], a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]], three Pisan-era towers and a strong system of fortification that made the town the core of [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] imperial power in the western [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Its natural resources have always been its sheltered harbour, the often powerfully fortified hill of ''Castel di Castro'', the modern ''Casteddu'', the [[salt]] from its lagoons, and, from the [[hinterland]], wheat from the [[Campidano]] plain and silver and other ores from the [[Iglesiente]] mines.

Cagliari was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] from 1324 to 1848, when [[Turin]] became the formal capital of the kingdom (which in 1861 became the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]). Today the city is a regional cultural, educational, political and artistic centre, known for its diverse [[Art Nouveau]] architecture and several monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.it-schools.com/sections/travel-and-culture-in-italy/sardiniat/cagliari-art.shtml |title=Cagliari art (Italian Language Schools and Courses to Learn Italian in Italy.) |publisher=It-schools.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also Sardinia's economic and industrial hub, having one of the [[Port of Cagliari|biggest ports in the Mediterranean Sea]], an [[Cagliari-Elmas Airport|international airport]], and the 106th highest income level in Italy (among 8,092 [[comuni]]), comparable to that of several northern Italian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2011-03-26/milano-stacca-tutti-classifica-132221.shtml?uuid=AauRDnJD|title=Nell'Italia delle tasse Milano stacca tutti - Guarda il reddito del tuo Comune |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |date= |accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
[[File:Mosaico Karalitani Ostia.jpg|thumb|180px|Karalitan ship owners and traders, mosaic in [[Ostia Antica]]]]

The Cagliari area has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]]. It occupies a favourable position between the sea and a fertile plain and is surrounded by two [[marsh]]es (which provides defence against attacks from the inland). There are high mountains nearby, to which people could evacuate if the settlement had to be given up. Relics of prehistoric inhabitants were found in the hill of Monte Claro ([[Monte Claro culture]]) and in [[Cape Sant'Elia]] (several [[domus de janas]]).

[[File:Roman Amphitheatre of Cagliari.jpg|thumb|180px|''Is Centu Scalas'' ("a hundred steps"), the [[Roman amphitheatre of Cagliari]]]]
'''Karaly''' ({{lang-xpu|𐤊𐤓𐤋‬𐤉}}, {{sc|krly}}){{sfnp|Mastino|2006}} was established around the 8th/7th century BC as one of a string of [[Phoenicia]]n colonies in Sardinia, including [[Tharros]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudian]], De Bello Gildonico, IV A.D.: city located in front of Libya (Africa), founded by the powerful [[Tyro]], Karalis extends in length, between the waves, with a small bumpy hill, disperses headwinds. It follows a port in the mid of the sea, and all strong winds are softened in the shelter of the pond.(521.Urbs Lybiam contra Tyrio fundata potenti 521. Tenditur in longum Caralis, tenuemque per undas 
522. Obvia dimittit fracturum flamina collem. 
523. Efficitur portus medium mare: tutaque ventis 
524. Omnibus, ingenti mansuescunt stagna recessu)&lt;/ref&gt; Its founding is linked to its position along communication routes with Africa as well as to its excellent port. The Phoenician settlement was located in the [[Stagno di Cagliari|Stagno di Santa Gilla]], west of the present centre of Cagliari. This was also the site of the Roman ''Portus Scipio'', and when Arab pirates raided the area in the 8th century it became the refuge for people fleeing from the city. Other Phoenician settlements have been found at Cape Sant'Elia.

In the late 6th century BC [[Carthage]] took control of part of Sardinia, and Cagliari grew substantially under their domination, as testified by the large [[Tuvixeddu necropolis]] and other remains. Cagliari was a fortified settlement in what is now the modern Marina quarter, with an annexed holy area in the modern Stampace.

Sardinia and Cagliari came under [[Roman Republic|Roman rule]] in 238 BC, shortly after the [[First Punic War]], when the Romans defeated the Carthaginians. No mention of it is found on the occasion of the Roman conquest of the island but, during the [[Second Punic War]], '''Caralis''' was the headquarters of the praetor, [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (dictator)|Titus Manlius Torquatus]], from whence he conducted his operations against [[Hampsicora]] and the Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] xxiii. 40, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; At other times it was also the Romans' chief naval station on the island and the residence of its praetor.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xxx. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans built a new settlement east of the old Punic city, the ''vicus munitus Caralis'' (i.e. the fortified [[Vicus (Rome)|community]] of Caralis) mentioned by [[Varro Atacinus]]. The two urban agglomerations merged gradually during the second century BC; to this process is perhaps attributable the plural name '''Carales'''.&lt;ref&gt;Attilio Mastino (a cura di), Storia della Sardegna antica, Il Maestrale, Nuoro,2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Florus]] calls it the ''urbs urbinum'' or capital of Sardinia. He represents it as taken and severely punished by [[Gracchus]],&lt;ref&gt;ii. 6. § 35.&lt;/ref&gt; but this statement is wholly at variance with Livy's account of the wars of Gracchus, in Sardinia, according to which the cities were faithful to Rome, and the revolt was confined to the mountain tribes.&lt;ref&gt;xli. 6, 12, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Caesar's civil war|Civil War]] between [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and [[Pompey]], the citizens of Caralis were the first to declare in favor of the former, an example soon followed by the other cities of Sardinia;&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]] ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' i. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; and Caesar himself touched there with his fleet on his return from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Hirt. ''B. Afr.'' 98.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, when Sardinia fell into the hands of [[Menas (admiral)|Menas]], the lieutenant of [[Sextus Pompeius]], Caralis was the only city which offered any resistance, but was taken after a short siege.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] xlviii. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cagliari continued to be regarded as the capital of the island under the [[Roman Empire]], and though it did not become a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], obtained the status of [[Municipium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] iii. 7. s. 13; [[Strabo]] v. p. 224; [[Pomponius Mela]], ii. 7; ''[[Antonine Itinerary]]'' pp. 80, 81, 82, ''etc.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Remains of Roman public buildings were found to the west of Marina in Piazza del Carmine. There was an area of ordinary housing near the modern Via Roma, and richer houses on the slopes of the Marina distinct. The amphitheatre is located to the west of the Castello.

A [[Christian]] community is attested in Cagliari at least as early as the 3rd century, and by the end of that century the city had a Christian bishop. In the middle decades of the 4th century bishop [[Lucifer of Cagliari]] was exiled because of his opposition to the sentence against [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] at the [[Synod of Milan]]. He was banished to the desert of [[Thebais]] by the emperor [[Constantius II]].&lt;ref&gt;Sozomen, ''Ecclesiastical History'', 3.15 and 5.12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claudian]] describes the ancient city of Karalis as extending to a considerable length towards the promontory or headland, the projection of which sheltered its port. The port affords good anchorage for large vessels, but besides this, which is only a well-sheltered standby, there is a large salt-water lake or lagoon, called the [[Stagno di Cagliari]], adjoining the city and communicating by a narrow channel with the bay, which appears from Claudian to have been used in ancient times as an inner harbor or basin.&lt;ref&gt;Claud. ''B. Gild.'' 520-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The promontory adjoining the city is evidently that noticed by Ptolemy ({{lang|grc|Κάραλις πόλις καὶ ἄκρα}}), but the Caralitanum Promontorium of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] can be no other than the headland, now called [[Capo Carbonara]], which forms the eastern boundary of the [[Gulf of Cagliari]] and the southeast point of the whole island. Immediately off it lay the little island of Ficaria,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''l. c.''; Ptolemy iii. 3. § 8.&lt;/ref&gt; now called the ''Isola dei Cavoli'' ("Cabbage Island" in Italian, ''Isula de is Càvurus'' "Crab Island" in Sardinian).

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] Cagliari fell, together with the rest of Sardinia, into the hands of the [[Vandals]], but appears to have retained its importance throughout the Middle Ages.

===Judgedom of Cagliari===
{{Main|Giudicato of Cagliari}}
[[File:Pluteo di età mediobizantina con grifo e pegaso. Museo Archeologico nazionale di Cagliari.jpg|thumb|left|Griffin and Pegasus pluteo, Byzantine Middle Ages. National Archaeological Museum of Cagliari]]
Subsequently, ruled by the Vandals and then part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Cagliari became the capital of a gradually independent [[Giudicati|Judgedom]]. However, there is some evidence that during this period of independence from external rule, the city was deserted because it was too exposed to attacks by [[Moors|Moorish]] pirates coming from north Africa and Spain. Apparently many people left Caralis and founded a new town named ''[[Santa Igia]]'' in an area close to the Santa Gilla swamp to the west of Cagliari, but relatively distant from the sea.

The Judgedom of Cagliari comprised a large area of the Campidano plain, the [[Sulcis]]-[[Iglesiente]] and the mountain region of [[Ogliastra]].

===11th to 13th century===
[[File:TorreElefanteCagliari-pjt2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Torre dell'Elefante]] (1307)]]
During the 11th century, the [[Republic of Pisa]] began to extend its political influence over the Judgedom of Cagliari. Pisa and the maritime [[republic of Genoa]] had a keen interest in Sardinia because it was a perfect strategic base for controlling the commercial routes between Italy and North Africa.

In 1215 the Pisan [[Lamberto Visconti]], [[giudice of Gallura|judike of Gallura]], forced the judikessa [[Benedetta of Cagliari]] to give him the mount located east of [[Santa Igia]].{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=209-210}} Soon (1216–17) Pisan merchants established there a new fortified city, known as ''Castel di Castro'', which can be considered the ancestor of the modern city of Cagliari.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=209-210}}

In 1258, after the defeat of [[William III of Cagliari|William III]], the last king of Cagliari, the Pisans and their Sardinian allies ([[Giudicato of Arborea|Arborea]], [[Giudicato of Gallura|Gallura]] and [[Giudicato of Logudoro|Logudoro]]) destroyed the old capital of Santa Igia.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=209-210}} The Judgedom of Cagliari was then divided into three parts: the northwest third went to Gallura; the central portion was incorporated into Arborea; [[Sulcis]] and [[Iglesiente]], on the southwest, were given to the Pisan [[della Gherardesca]] family, while the Republic of Pisa maintained control over its colony of Castel di Castro.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=210-212}}

Some of the fortifications that still surround the current district of Castello were built by the Pisans, including the two remaining white limestone towers (early 14th century) designed by the architect [[Giovanni Capula]]. Together with the district of Castello, Castel di Castro comprised the districts of [[Marina]] (which included the port), and later {{Interlanguage link multi|Stampace|it}} and Villanova. Marina and Stampace were guarded by walls, in contrast to Villanova, which was mostly home to peasants.

===14th to 17th centuries===
{{Main|Kingdom of Sardinia}}
In the second decade of the 14th century the [[Crown of Aragon]] [[Aragonese conquest of Sardinia|conquered Sardinia]] after a series of battles against the [[Pisa]]ns. During the siege of Castel di Castro (1324-1326), the Aragonese, led by the [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|infant Alfonso]], built a stronghold on a more southern hill, that of Bonaria.
[[File:Braun_hogenberg_Cagliari_1572.jpg|thumb|View of Cagliari from ''Civitates orbis terrarium'' (1572) by [[Georg Braun]]]]
When the fortified city was finally conquered by the Catalan-Aragonese army, Castel di Castro (''Castel de Càller'' or simply Càller in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) became the administrative capital of the newborn [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], one of the many kingdoms forming the Crown of Aragon, which later came under the rule of the [[Spanish Empire]]. After the expulsion of the Tuscans,{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=304}} the Castello district was repopulated by the [[Catalans|Catalan]] settlers of Bonaria while the indigenous population was, as in the past, concentrated in Stampace and Villanova.

The [[kings of Aragon]] and later the [[kings of Spain]], were represented in Cagliari by a [[List of viceroys of Sardinia|viceroy]], who resided in the [[Palazzo Regio]].
[[File:PalazzoRegio3.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Interior view of the [[Palazzo Regio|Royal Palace of Cagliari]]]]

In the 16th century the fortifications of the city were strengthened with the construction of the [[bastion]]s and the rights and benefits of the Catalan-Aragonese were extended to all citizens. The intellectual life was relatively lively and in the early years of the 17th century the University was founded.

===18th century===
In 1718,&lt;ref name="Guide to Cagliari"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Cagliari-Villasimius-Costa%20Rei-Oristano-2009.pdf |title=Guide to Cagliari, Villasimius, Costa Rei |work=CharmingSardinia |date=February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711085802/http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Cagliari-Villasimius-Costa%20Rei-Oristano-2009.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after a brief rule by the Austrian Habsburgs, Cagliari and Sardinia came under the [[House of Savoy]]. As rulers of Sardinia, the Savoys took the title of kings of the Sardinian kingdom. During the Savoyard Era, until 1848, the institutions of the Sardinian kingdom remained unchanged, but with the "[[Perfect Fusion]]" in that year, all the possessions of the House of Savoy House, comprising [[Savoy]], [[Nice]] (now part of [[France]]), [[Piedmont]] and from 1815 [[Liguria]], were merged into a unitary state. Although Sardinian by name, the kingdom had its parliament in [[Turin]], where the Savoys resided, and its members were mainly aristocrats from [[Piedmont]] or the mainland.

In the late 18th century during the [[Napoleonic wars]] France tried to conquer Cagliari because of its strategic role in the Mediterranean sea (''[[Expédition de Sardaigne]]''). A French army landed on Poetto beach and advanced towards Cagliari, but the French were defeated by Sardinians who had decided to defend themselves against the revolutionary army. The people of Cagliari hoped to receive some concession from the Savoys in return for their defence of the town. For example, aristocrats from Cagliari asked for a Sardinian representative in the [[parliament]] of the kingdom. When the Savoyards refused any concession to the Sardinians, the inhabitants of Cagliari rose up against them and expelled all the representatives of the kingdom along with the Piedmontese rulers.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=468}} This insurgence is celebrated in Cagliari during ''[[Sa die de sa Sardigna]]'' ("The day of Sardinia") on the last weekend of April. However, the Savoys regained control of the town after a brief period of [[autonomous entity|autonomous]] rule.

===Modern age===

[[File:Cagliari porto.jpg|thumb|View of Via Roma and the port]]
Starting in the 1870s, in the wake of the [[unification of Italy]], the city experienced a century of rapid growth. Many buildings were erected by the end of the 19th century during the term of office of mayor [[Ottone Bacaredda]]. Numerous buildings combined influences from [[Art Nouveau]] together with the traditional Sardinian taste for floral decoration; an example is the [[white marble]] [[City Hall]] near the port. Bacaredda is also known for his strong repression of one of the earliest worker strikes at the beginning of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

During the [[Second World War]] Cagliari was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in February 1943. In order to escape from the danger of [[bombardment]]s and difficult living conditions, many people were evacuated from the city into the countryside. In total the victims of the bombings were more than 2000&lt;ref name=Bomb&gt;[http://www.comunecagliarinews.it/reportage.php?pagina=43 Comune Cagliari News, ''Bombe su Cagliari: cronologia di una strage'']&lt;/ref&gt; and about 80% of the buildings were damaged. The city received the [[Gold Medal of Military Valour]].&lt;ref name="Bomb"/&gt;

After the [[Armistice with Italy|Italian armistice]] with the Allies in September 1943, the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] took control of Cagliari and the island, but soon retreated peacefully in order to reinforce their positions in mainland Italy. The [[United States Army|American Army]] then took control of Cagliari. Airports near the city ([[Elmas]], [[Monserrato]], [[Decimomannu]], currently a [[NATO]] airbase) were used by Allied aircraft to fly to North Africa or mainland Italy and [[Sicily]].

After the war, the population of Cagliari grew again and many apartment blocks and recreational areas were erected in new residential districts.

==Geography==
[[File:Cagliari11.jpg|thumb|The so-called Sella del Diavolo]]
{{quote|And suddenly there is Cagliari: a naked town rising steep, steep, golden-looking, piled naked to the sky from the plain at the head of the formless hollow bay. It is strange and rather wonderful, not a bit like Italy. The city piles up lofty and almost miniature, and makes me think of Jerusalem: without trees, without cover, rising rather bare and proud, remote as if back in history, like a town in a monkish, illuminated missal. One wonders how it ever got there. And it seems like Spain—or Malta: not Italy. It is a steep and lonely city, treeless, as in some old illumination. Yet withal rather jewel-like: like a sudden rose-cut amber jewel naked at the depth of the vast indenture. The air is cold, blowing bleak and bitter, the sky is all curd. And that is Cagliari. It has that curious look, as if it could be seen, but not entered. It is like some vision, some memory, something that has passed away. Impossible that one can actually walk in that city: set foot there and eat and laugh there. Ah, no! Yet the ship drifts nearer, nearer, and we are looking for the actual harbour.|[[D. H. Lawrence]], ''[[Sea and Sardinia]]'' (1921)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.online-literature.com/dh_lawrence/sea-and-sardinia/2/ Ch. 2 and 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The city of Cagliari is situated in the south of Sardinia, overlooking the centre of the eponymous gulf, also called [[Golfo degli Angeli]] ("Bay of Angels") after an ancient legend. The city is spread over and around the hill of the historic district of Castello and nine other limestone hills of the middle-to-late Miocene, unique heights of a little more than {{convert|100|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] on the long plains of Campidano. The plain is actually a [[Graben]] formed during the [[Alpine orogeny]] of the [[Cenozoic]], which separated Sardinia from the European continent, roughly where the [[Gulf of Lion]] is now. The Graben filled in the course of [[Tectonics|tectonic]] movements associated with the breakup of the ancient island [[Paleozoic]] skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atlante della Sardegna|editor1=R.

[[File:Castello_San_Michele_(CA).jpg|thumb|left|San Michele hill with the [[Castle of San Michele|castle]] on the top]]
[[File:Cagliari panorama.jpg|thumb|View over the historical district of Villanova]]
The repeated intrusion of the sea left calcareous sediments that formed a series of hills that mark the territory of Cagliari. Castello is where the fortified town arose in the [[Middle Age]] near the harbour of the port, other hills are those of Mount Urpinu, the St. Elias hill, also known as the ''Sella del Diavolo'' ("Saddle of the Devil") for its shape, Tuvumannu and Tuvixeddu, the site of the ancient Punic and Roman necropolis, the small Bonaria hill, where the basilica stands, and the San Michele hill, with the eponymous castle on top. The modern city occupies the flat spaces between the hills and the sea to the south and southeast, along the Poetto beach, the lagoons and ponds of Santa Gilla and Molentargius, and the remains of more recent marine intrusions, in an articulate landscape with many landmarks and panoramas of the bay, the plain, and the mountains that surround it on the east (The Seven Brothers and Serpeddì) and west (the mountains of [[Capoterra]]). On the cold, clear days of winter, the snowy peaks of [[Gennargentu]] can be seen from the highest points of the city.

[[File:Cagliari.jpg|thumb|Fonsarda]]
The city has four historic neighbourhoods: Castello, Marina, Stampace and Villanova and several modern districts (such as San Benedetto, Monte Urpinu and Genneruxi at the east, Sant'Avendrace at the west, Is Mirrionis/San Michele at north and Bonaria, La Palma and Poetto at the south), grown when part of the ancient walls had been demolished in the middle of the 19th century. The comune of Cagliari has one [[circoscrizione]], the town of [[Pirri, Sardinia|Pirri]] (about 30.000 inhabitants), former village of the Campidano absorbed in the fast growth after the [[Second World War]].

===Parks and recreation===
[[File:Cagliari Giardini pubblici.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Old public gardens]]

Cagliari is one of the "greenest" Italian cities. Every inhabitant of Cagliari has access to {{convert|87.5|m2|ft2}} of public gardens and parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istat.it/it/files/2013/06/Urbes_2013.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204010425/http://www.istat.it/it/files/2013/06/Urbes_2013.pdf |date=February 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its mild climate allows the growth of numerous subtropical plants, such as ''[[Jacaranda mimosifolia]]'', ''[[Ficus macrophylla]]'', with some huge specimens in Via Roma and in the [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Cagliari|University Botanic Gardens]], ''[[Erythrina caffra]]'' with its stunning red flowers, ''[[Ficus retusa]]'', which provides shade for several of the city's streets, ''[[Araucaria heterophylla]]'', the date palm (''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]''), the Canary Islands palm (''[[Phoenix canariensis]]'') and the Mexican Fan Palm (''[[Washingtonia robusta]]'').

Major city parks include:
[[File:Monte_Urpinu_Cagliari.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cagliari, panorama from Monti Urpinu Park]]
[[File:Parco di Monte Claro (CA).jpg|thumb|Park of Monte Claro]]

* Monte Urpinu Park, the most wooded, is a low hill covered by a pine (''[[Pinus halepensis|Pinus halepensis Mill.]]'') and evergreen oak (''[[Quercus ilex|Quercus ilex L.]]'') forest with a dense Mediterranean maquis of mastic (''[[Pistacia lentiscus|Pistacia lentiscus L.]]''), juniper (''[[Juniperus phoenicea|Juniperus phoenicea L.]]''), Kermes oak (''[[Quercus coccifera|Quercus coccifera L.]]''), wild olive (''[[Olea europaea|Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea, var. sylvestris]]'') and tree spurge (''[[Euphorbia dendroides|Euphorbia dendroides L.]]''). It extends for about {{convert|25|ha|acre}}.
* Park of San Michele hill (about 25 hectares), with its medieval castle on the top;
* Terramaini Park, about {{convert|13|ha|acre}}, with a little pond which is home to flamingos and other wading birds;
* Monte Claro Provincial Park, about {{convert|22|ha|acre}}, which hosts the provincial library in an old mansion on the top of the hill;
* Ex-vetreria Pirri Park, about {{convert|2.5|ha|acre}};
* Public gardens, the oldest public esplanade of the city, planted in the 19th century, with a wonderful promenade of ''[[Jacaranda mimosifolia|Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don]]''.

The [[Molentargius - Saline Regional Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parcomolentargius.it/ |title=Parco Molentargius - Saline |publisher=Parcomolentargius.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located near the city. Some mountain parks, such as Monte Arcosu or Maidopis, with large forests and wildlife (Sardinian deer, wild boars, etc.) are also nearby.

[[File:Poetto spiaggia.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Aerial view of Poetto Beach]]

====Beaches====
{{Main|Poetto}}
The main beach of Cagliari is the Poetto. It stretches for about {{convert|8|km|mi|0}}, from Sella del Diavolo ("Devil's Saddle") up to the coastline of Quartu Sant'Elena. Poetto is also the name of the district located on the western stretch of the strip between the beach and Saline di Molentargius ("Molentargius's Salt Mine").

Another smaller beach is that of Calamosca near the Sant'Elia district. On the coast between Calamosca and Poetto beaches, among the cliffs of the Sella del Diavolo, lies Cala Fighera, a small bay.

Cagliari is close to other seaside locations such as Santa Margherita di Pula, [[Chia, Italy|Chia]], Geremeas, [[Solanas]], [[Villasimius]] and [[Costa Rei]].

===Climate===
[[File:Unusual snowy Cagliari, 1910.jpg|thumb|220px|Snow in Cagliari, 1910]]
Cagliari has a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa in the [[Köppen climate classification]]) with hot, dry summers and very mild winters. The summer extreme values can be slightly over {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}, sometimes with very high humidity, while in winter, under special and rare conditions, the temperature drops slightly below zero. Heavy snowfalls occur on average every thirty years.

The average temperature of the coldest month, January, is about {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and of the warmest month, August, about {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}}. But heat waves can occur, due to African anticyclone, starting in June. From mid-June to mid-September, rain is a rare event, limited to brief afternoon storms. The rainy season starts in September, and the first cold days come in December.

Winds are frequent, especially the [[mistral (wind)|mistral]] and [[sirocco]]; in summer a marine sirocco breeze (called ''s'imbattu'' in [[Sardinian language]]) lowers the temperature and brings some relief from the heat.

According to ISTAT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/bilmens2014gen/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 there were 154,356 people residing in Cagliari (+3.0% compared with 2011), of whom 71,522 were male and 82,834 female for a [[sex ratio]] of 0.86. Minors (children aged 18 and younger) totalled 12.92% of the population, compared to pensioners at 24.81%. The average age of Cagliari residents is 47.44. The ratio of the population over 65 years of age to that under the age of 18, is 53.39%. The elderly population, defined as being over 65 years of age, has increased by 21.95% over the last 10 years. The current birth rate in Cagliari is 6.29 births per 1,000 inhabitants. The average number of people of any age per household is 2.11 and the percentage of households composed of a single person is 42.53%. The population of Cagliari is structured like that of other first world countries, especially as to the prevalence of an elderly population. The trend of these rates in the Cagliari metropolitan area is proportionally reversed in the suburbs, where most younger families move.

{{As of|2012}}, 4.26% (6,658 people) of the population was foreign, of which the largest group were [[Filipinos]] (21.33%), followed by [[Ukrainians]] (11.93%), [[Romanians]] (10.93%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (9.49%) and [[Senegalese]] (9.49%).

In 1928, during the fascist regime, the neighbouring municipalities of Pirri, [[Monserrato]], [[Selargius]], [[Quartucciu]] and [[Elmas]], were merged with that of Cagliari. Mussolini's regime wanted to streamline the local administration by eliminating many small towns and at the same time show that Italy was a major power with many large cities. After the war these small municipalities gradually regained their autonomy, except for the former town of Pirri.

The first table shows the inhabitants of the town in its present borders, the second one the commune population including the merged municipalities.

===Metropolitan City===
{{Main|Metropolitan City of Cagliari}}
[[File:Map of comune of Cagliari (metropolitan city of Cagliari, region Sardinia, Italy) - 2016.svg|thumb|left|Map of the metropolitan city of Cagliari, the capital in red]]
The Metropolitan City of Cagliari has been established in 2016 by a Sardinia Regional Law and totals about 431,000 inhabitants according to ISTAT. It is composed of 17 municipalities along the coast of the gulf and up to {{convert|20|km|mi}} of the inner Campidano plain.

It covers an area on the plain of Campidano between large basins (Santa Gilla lagoon and salt mills of about 30 km2 (3200 acres), ponds ([[Molentargius]], 16,22 km2 (40,10 acrees) and the depopulated mountains up to {{convert|1100|m|ft}} above sea level. The mountains are largely covered by forests mostly managed by the Ente Foreste of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. To the west these amount to {{convert|256|km2|mi2}} on the Capoterra and Pula mountains. Monte Arcosu WWF Natural Reserve has another {{convert|36|km2|mi2}}, and to the east on Mount Serpeddì and Sette Fratelli there are a total of {{convert|132|km2|mi2}} of forest.

The Metropolitan City is defined by municipalities where the population increased between the last two censuses, in a region where the population is otherwise generally decreasing. These municipalities welcome immigrants to the urban area whose main nucleus, the city of Cagliari, has a high number of elderly people.

In the last century, the population of the municipalities of the metropolitan area increased by 354% and in the last 50 years by 158% (1911: 128,444; 1961: 288,683; 2011: 454,819). For the whole of Sardinia this increase was respectively 88% and 15% (1911: 868,181; 1961: 1,419,362; 2011: 1,639,362). The urbanisation towards the area of Cagliari was, in percentage terms, impressive, making the capital of the island a metropolis surrounded by rural areas increasingly depopulated. This urbanisation is also reflected in the concentration in Cagliari of most of the economic activities and wealth.

[[File:Cagliari Via Roma La Rinascente.jpg|thumb|Cagliari Via Roma ''[[La Rinascente]]'']]
According to 2014 data from the Italian Ministry of Economic Affairs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twig.pro/la-mappa-dei-redditi-dei-comuni-italiani/&lt;/ref&gt; the inhabitants of Cagliari benefited a per capita income of 23,220 euros (being the fifth Regional Capital), that is the 122% of the national average, while all of Sardinia benefited only 16,640 euros, being the 13th Region and 86% of the national average. The metropolitan area benefited an average income of 19,185 euros, 103% of the national average. With the 26% of the island population the Cagliari Metropolitan City produces the 31% of its GDP. 
As the capital city of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Cagliari is the administrative hub and headquarters of the region as well as of the provincial offices of the Italian central administration. Cagliari is also the main trade and industrial centre of the island, with numerous commercial sites and factories within its metropolitan boundaries.

The Cagliari-Sarroch port system was the third in Italy for goods movements in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assoporti.it/sites/www.assoporti.it/files/statistiche/Movimenti_portuali_2015_29lug16.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first department store, ([[La Rinascente]]) opened in 1931 in the centre of the city, and it is still open today. Nowadays there are many commercial centres in the metropolitan area (Le Vele, Santa Gilla, La Corte del Sole, Marconi) hosting many European chain stores such as [[Auchan]], [[Metro AG]], [[Lidl]], [[Media Markt|MediaWorld]], [[Euronics]], [[Jysk (store)|Jysk]], [[IKEA]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ikea.com/ms/it_IT/puop/cagliari/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carrefour]] and [[Bata Shoes]].
Cagliari is also home to an [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.jobs/location/cagliari-italy&lt;/ref&gt;

Cagliari is the main operational headquarters of the [[Banco di Sardegna]], which belongs to the BPER Group and is listed on [[Borsa Italiana]], of the [[Banca di Cagliari]]. [[Banca di Credito Sardo]] was based in Cagliari until it was absorbed by the parent company [[Intesa Sanpaolo]].

The Macchiareddu-Grogastru area between Cagliari and Capoterra is one of the most important industrial areas of Sardinia, in conjunction with a large international container terminal port at Giorgino.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cict.it]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101258/http://www.cict.it/ |date=August 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside having one of the biggest container terminals on the Mediterranean Sea, Cagliari also has one of the largest fish markets in Italy offering for sale a vast array of fish to both the public and traders. The communications provider [[Tiscali]] also has its headquarters in Cagliari.

Multinational corporations like [[Coca-Cola]], [[Heineken]], [[Unilever]], [[Bridgestone]] and [[Eni|Eni Group]] have factories in town. One of the six oil refinery supersites in Europe, [[Saras S.p.A.|Saras]], is located within the metropolitan area at [[Sarroch]].
[[File:Lungomare Poetto - Cagliari.jpg|thumb|The Poetto Beach.]]
Tourism is one of the major industries of the city, although historical venues such as its monumental [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early modern period]] defence system, its Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine ruins are less highlighted compared to the recreational beaches and coastline. Cruise ships touring the Mediterranean often stop for passengers at Cagliari, and the city is a traffic hub to the nearby beaches of [[Villasimius]], [[Chia, Italy|Chia]], [[Pula, Sardinia|Pula]] and [[Costa Rei]], as well as to the urban beach of Poettu. Pula is home to the archaeological site of the Punic and Roman city of [[Nora, Italy|Nora]]. Especially in summer many clubs and pubs are goals for young locals and tourists. Pubs and night-clubs are concentrated in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a narrow street in Stampace district, in the Marina district, near the port and in the Castello district, The clubs are mostly to be found on the Poetto Beach (in summer) or in Viale Marconi (in winter).
In Cagliari there are 180 B&amp;B and 22 hotels that totals 3,300 beds. There are many others hotels in seaside resort of his gulf.

Considerable remains of the ancient city of Karalis are still visible, including those of the [[Tuvixeddu necropolis]] (the largest Punic necropolis still in existence), the [[Roman amphitheatre (Cagliari)|Roman amphitheatre]], traditionally called ''Is centu scalas'' ("One hundred steps"), and of an [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] used to provide generally scarce water. Still visible are also some ancient cisterns of vast extent, the ruins of a small circular temple, and numerous sepulchres on a hill outside the modern town that appear to have formed the necropolis of the ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth's ''Sardinia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;206, 215Valery, ''Voyage en Sardaigne'', c. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The amphitheatre stages open-air operas and concerts during the summer.

[[File:Basilica di S.Saturnino.jpg|thumb|220px|right|San Saturnino Basilica, 5th century]]

The Palaeo-Christian [[Basilica of San Saturnino]], dedicated to a martyr killed under [[Diocletian]]'s reign, [[Saturninus of Cagliari]], patron saint of the city, was built in the 5th century. Of the original building the dome and the central part remain, to which two arms (one with a nave and two aisles) were added later. A Palaeo-Christian crypt is also under the church of ''San Lucifero'' (1660), dedicated to [[Saint Lucifer]], a bishop of the city. The church has a Baroque façade with ancient columns and sculpted parts, some of which came from the nearby [[necropolis]].

The old medieval town (called ''Castello'' in Italian, ''Casteddu de susu'' in Sardinian, "the upper castle") lies on top of a hill with a view of the Gulf of Cagliari (also known as Angels' Gulf). Most of its city walls are intact and include two early 14th-century white limestone towers, the [[Torre di San Pancrazio]] and the [[Torre dell'Elefante]], typical examples of Pisan military architecture. The local white limestone was also used to build the walls of the city and many other buildings, besides the towers. The exact period of construction of a fortress on this hill is unknown at present, due to the superposition of layers of buildings along the history. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ferrucio Barreca, La Sardegna fenicia e punica, Storia della Sardegna antica e moderna, edizioni Chiarella, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested a first urbanization of the quarter in the Punic era on the basis of similarity of the planimetry with the contemporary Carthaginian fortress of [[Monte Sirai]]. Recently, archaeological excavations have identified Punic and Roman buildings under the ramparts of the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastionline.org/docs/FOLDER-it-2012-264.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Already the Roman poet [[Varro]] called the city "Vicus munitus", a fortified city, and sixteenth-century authors describe a Roman acropolis perhaps still visible in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco Carmona, Hymno a Càller&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roderigo Hunno Baeza, Caralis panegyricus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. H. Lawrence]], in his memoir of a voyage to Sardinia, ''[[Sea and Sardinia]]'', that he undertook in January 1921, described the effect of warm Mediterranean sunlight on the white limestone city and compared Cagliari to a "white Jerusalem".
[[File:Cattedrale_Cagliari.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Cathedral (left) and the old city hall (right)]]
The [[Cagliari Cathedral|cathedral]] was restored in the 1930s, returning the former [[Baroque]] façade into a [[Medieval Pisan]]-style façade more akin to the original appearance of the church in the 13th century. The bell tower is original. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with a pulpit (1159–1162) sculpted for the [[Cathedral of Pisa]] but later donated to Cagliari. The crypt houses the remains of martyrs found in the Basilica of San Saturno (see below). Near the cathedral is the palace of the provincial government. Before 1900 it was the island's governor's palace.
[[File:Basilica di Bonaria.JPG|thumb|[[The Basilica of Our Lady of Bonaria]]]]
[[File:Sant'Anna (Cagliari).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Collegiata di Sant'Anna]]
The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Bonaria|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Bonaria]] ([[Names of Buenos Aires|from which the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, gets its name]]) was built by the Catalans in 1324–1329 when they were besieging the Pisans in Castello. It has a small [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] portal in the façade and the interior houses a wooden statue of the Madonna, which, after having been thrown off a Spanish ship, landed at the foot of Bonaria hill. Bonaria hill is also the location of the [[Monumental Cemetery of Bonaria]].

The ''Chiesa della Purissima'' is a [[Catalan Gothic]] church built in the 16th century in the Castello distinct.

The other early districts of the town (Marina, Stampace and Villanova) retain much of their original character. In Stampace the [[Torre dello Sperone]], another tower built by the Pisans in the late 13th century, is located, as well as two important monumental churches: the ''Collegiata di Sant'Anna'' and the ''Chiesa di San Michele'', both built in the 18th century in a baroque style. Many more churches, both old and modern, can be found throughout the city.

The Promenade Deck and the Terrazza Umberto I were designed in 1896 by the engineers Joseph Costa and Fulgenzio Setti. The entire building was built of white and yellow limestone in a classical style with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]]. It was opened in 1901. A staircase with two flights provides access from Constitution Square. It is interrupted by a covered walkway and ends beneath the Arc de Triomphe, in the Terrazza Umberto I. In 1943, during World War II, the staircase and the Arch of Triumph were severely damaged by aerial bombardment, but after the conflict they were faithfully reconstructed.

From the Terrazza Umberto I the Bastion of Santa Caterina can be accessed via a short flight of steps. Here there was once an old Dominican convent, destroyed by fire in 1800. According to tradition, the conspiracy to kill the Viceroy Camarassa in 1666 was set up in the surroundings of the monastery.
[[File:Liberty Cagliari.png|thumb|[[Art Nouveau]] in Cagliari]]
The Promenade Deck was inaugurated in 1902. At first it was used as a banqueting hall, then during the First World War as an infirmary. In the 1930s, during the period of sanctions, it was an exhibition of [[autarky]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. During World War II it served as a shelter for displaced people whose homes had been destroyed by bombs. In 1948 it hosted the first Trade Fair of Sardinia. After many years of decay, the Promenade was restored and re-evaluated as a cultural space reserved especially for art exhibitions.

The modern districts built in the late 19th and early 20th century contain examples of [[Art Deco]] architecture, as well as controversial examples of Fascist [[neoclassicism]] architecture, such as the Court of Justice (''Palazzo di Giustizia'') in Republic Square. The Court of Justice is near the biggest city park, Monte Urpinu, with its pine trees, artificial lakes, and a vast area with a hill. The [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Cagliari]], the city's [[botanical garden]], is also of interest.

==Culture==
[[File:OldUniversityLibraryCagliari.jpg|thumb|18th-century University Library]]

The city has numerous libraries and is also home to the State Archive, containing thousands of handwritten documents from the foundation of the Kingdom of Sardinia (1325 AD) to the present.
In addition to numerous local and university department libraries, the most important libraries are the old University Library,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegna.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/267/biblioteche/22/biblioteca-universitaria-di-cagliari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909052702/http://www.sardegna.beniculturali.it/index.php?it%2F267%2Fbiblioteche%2F22%2Fbiblioteca-universitaria-di-cagliari |date=September 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with thousands of ancient books, the Provincial Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provincia.cagliari.it/ProvinciaCa/it/bibliotecaprovincialeragazzi2.page |title=Provincia di Cagliari &amp;#124; Biblioteca Provinciale Ragazzi |publisher=Provincia.cagliari.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Regional Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sardegnabiblioteche.it/biblioteche/regionale.html |title=Sardegna Biblioteche - Attività - Biblioteca regionale |publisher=Sardegnabiblioteche.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mediateca of the Mediterranean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.cagliari.it/portale/it/scheda_sito.page;jsessionid=D5874DE00B5FEC3C5BBFC82F31F14F90?contentId=SIT662 |title=Comune di Cagliari&amp;#124; MEM - Mediateca del Mediterraneo: Biblioteca Comunale Generale e di Studi Sardi - Archivio Storico - Mediateca |publisher=Comune.cagliari.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209164310/http://www.comune.cagliari.it/portale/it/scheda_sito.page%3Bjsessionid%3DD5874DE00B5FEC3C5BBFC82F31F14F90?contentId=SIT662 |archivedate=2015-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains the municipal archive and library collection.

In the first century B.C. a famous singer and musician from Cagliari, Tigellius, lived in Rome and was satirized by [[Cicero]] and [[Horace]]. The history of Sardinian literature begins in Cagliari in the first century A.D. In the funerary monument of Atilia Pomptilla, carved into the rock of the necropolis of Tuvixeddu, poems are engraved in Greek and Latin dedicated to his dead wife. Some of them, particularly those in the Greek language, have literary merit.

The first Sardinian literary author known was Bishop [[Lucifer of Cagliari]], who wrote severe pamphlets against the [[Arian heresy]]in the fourth century A.D. Only in the eleventh century A.D. did the first texts of an administrative nature appear in the modern [[Sardinian language]], together with [[Hagiography|hagiographs]] of local martyrs written in Latin.

Life in Cagliari has been depicted by many writers, starting with the late Roman poet [[Claudian]]. In the late 16th century, the local humanist Roderigo Hunno Baeza dedicated to his town a didactic Latin poem, ''Caralis Panegyricus''.&lt;ref&gt;Miscellaneous codex preserved in the Civic Library of Cagliari, edited by Francesco Alziator, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 17th century Juan Francisco Carmona wrote a hymn to Cagliari in Spanish; Jacinto Arnal De Bolea published in 1636, in Spanish, the first novel set in Cagliari, entitled'' El Forastero''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacinto Arnal de Bolea, El Forastero, Emprenta A. Galgerin, Càller, 1636, republished by the editor Marìa Dolores, Garcìa Sànchez, CFS/CUEC, Cagliari, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.H. Lawrence|David Herbert Lawrence]] wrote about the city in his ''[[Sea and Sardinia]]''.

Modern writers connected to Cagliari include [[Giuseppe Dessì]], [[Giulio Angioni]], [[Giorgio Todde]], [[Sergio Atzeni]], (who set many of his novels and short stories, such as ''Bakunin's Son'', in ancient and modern Cagliari), [[Flavio Soriga]].
[[File:Lirico Cagliari.jpg|thumb|right|The new Teatro Lirico (opera house)]]

Cagliari was the birthplace or residence of the composer [[Ennio Porrino]], of the film, theatre and TV director [[Nanni Loy]], and of the actors [[Gianni Agus]], [[Amedeo Nazzari]] and [[Pier Angeli]] (born Anna Maria Pierangeli).

Excluding the Roman era amphitheater, the first theater was inaugurated in Cagliari in 1767: the Teatro Zapata, later becoming the Civic Theatre. Devastated by bombing in 1943, it was recently restored, but the roof was not rebuilt, and today it serves as an open-air theatre. The Politeama Regina Margherita, inaugurated in 1859, was destroyed by fire in 1942 and never rebuilt.

Although [[opera]] had, and in part still has, a solid tradition the city, it was left without a true theater until 1993 when a new opera house, the [[Teatro Lirico di Cagliari|Teatro Lirico]], was inaugurated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatroliricodicagliari.it/ |title=Teatro Lirico Web-site |publisher=Teatroliricodicagliari.it |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside there is a music compound with a music conservatory with its own auditorium, and a music park. Cagliari is and was home to opera singers such as the [[tenor]]s [[Giovanni Matteo Mario]] (Giovanni Matteo De Candia, 1810–1883) and Piero Schiavazzi (1875–1949), the [[baritone]] Angelo Romero (born 1940), the [[contralto]] [[Bernadette Manca di Nissa]], born 1954 and the [[soprano]] Giusy Devinu (1960–2007). The Italian pop singer [[Marco Carta]] was also born in Cagliari, in 1985.

The old Teatro Massimo was only recently renovated and is now the seat of the Teatro Stabile of Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrostabiledellasardegna.it/index.php/spazi/teatro-massimo.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908160900/http://www.teatrostabiledellasardegna.it/index.php/spazi/teatro-massimo.html |date=September 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Municipal Auditorium, in the former 17th-century church of Santa Teresa, is the seat of the Scuola di Arte Drammatica (School of Dramatic Art) di Cagliari,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scuoladiteatrocagliari.it/ |title=Scuola d'Arte Drammatica Cagliari - Tetatro stabile d'arte contemporanea Akròama |publisher=Scuoladiteatrocagliari.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Teatro delle Saline ("Saltworks Theatre"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatrodellesaline.it/ |title=Teatro delle Saline |publisher=Teatrodellesaline.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is home of Akroama, Teatro Stabile di Innovazione ("Permanent Theater of Innovation").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akroama.it |title=Akròama T.L.S. - Contemporary Art Theatre |publisher=Akroama.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, some comic and satirical theater companies are active in the city, the most well known being the "Compagnia Teatrale Lapola",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapola.eu/ |title=Compagnia Teatrale LAPOLA |publisher=Lapola.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers an urban version of the traditional campidanese comic theater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teatrupopulari.figlidartemedas.org/progetto ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022211823/http://teatrupopulari.figlidartemedas.org/progetto |date=October 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feast of Sant'Efis===
[[File:Mazziere del Comune di Cagliari.jpg|thumb|left|Municipal mace bearer]]
[[File:Costumi sardi.jpg|thumb|220px|Traditional folk costume of Cagliari during the Feast of St. Ephysius]]
The Feast of [[St. Ephysius]] (Sant'Efisio in Italian, Sant'Efis in Sardinian) is the most important religious event of Cagliari, taking place every year on May 1. During this festival, thousands of people from folk groups all over Sardinia wear their traditional costumes. The saint is escorted by the traditional ancient ''Milicia'', the deputy mayor (Alter Nos), numerous confraternities, and a convoy of chariots pulled by oxen in a procession to Nora (near modern Pula), {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} from Cagliari, where, according to tradition, he was beheaded. In addition to being one of the oldest, it is also the longest Italian religious procession, with about {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} of walks over four days, and the largest in the Mediterranean area.

A plague was spreading throughout Sardinia, starting in 1652, and the epidemic infected Cagliari in particular, killing some ten thousand inhabitants. According to legend, in 1656 St. Ephysius appeared to the Spanish Viceroy, [[Francisco Fernández de Castro Andrade, Count of Lemos]] to request a procession on 1 May, in order to free the city from the plague. The Municipality of Cagliari swore that, if the plague disappeared, a procession would be held every day in the saint's honor, starting from the Stampace district and ending at Nora where the saint was martyred. In September the plague ended, and the procession and festival was therefore regularly held starting the following year on May 1. The procession was held even during the last war; a statue of the saint was placed on a lorry and, through city ruins of the devastated by the bombs, arrived safely in Nora.

===Other events===
Other feasts and events in Cagliari include:
*The Carnival
*Holy Week and Easter celebrations
*Sea processions of St. Francis of Paola, held in May, and Nostra Signora di Bonaria, in July
*Cagliari Fair, in early May
*[[Audi MedCup]] regatta

===Languages===
{{main|Sardinian language|Campidanese dialect}}
The native language of Cagliari, declared official along with Italian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardiniapost.it/politica/cagliari-il-sardo-diventa-lingua-ufficiale-si-del-consiglio-al-nuovo-statuto/ Cagliari, il sardo diventa lingua ufficiale: il Consiglio dice sì al nuovo Statuto - Sardiniapost]&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (''sardu''), a [[Romance language]], specifically the [[Campidanese dialect]] (''campidanesu'') in its local variant (''casteddaju'').

The variant of Cagliari in its high register has traditionally represented the linguistic model of reference for the entire southern area of the island, and the high social variant used by the middle class in the whole Campidanese domain, as well as the literary model of reference for writers and poets.
This language is less spoken by the younger generations in the city, who use Italian instead as that language is compulsory in education and the mass media. Italian has increasingly become predominant in social relations, both formal and informal, relegating Sardinian to a mostly marginal role in everyday life. Young people often have only passive competence in the language, gathered from elderly relatives who still speak it, as their parents often speak only Italian, or they may use a juvenile slang (''italianu porceddinu'') that mixes both Sardinian and Italian.

Since Cagliari was the metropolis of the ancient Roman province, it absorbed innovations coming from Rome, Carthage, and Constantinople, and its language probably reflected late Latin urban dialects of the 5th-century core cities of the empire.

[[File:Sea food Cagliari.jpg|thumb|Seafood offered in a Cagliari restaurant]]

===Gastronomy===
Cagliari has some unique gastronomic traditions: unlike the rest of the island its cuisine is mostly based on the wide variety of locally available [[seafood]]. Although it is possible to trace influences from [[Catalan cuisine|Catalan]], [[Sicilian cuisine|Sicilian]] and Genoese cuisine, Cagliaritan food has a distinctive and unique character.

Excellent [[wine]]s are also part of Cagliaritanians' dinners, like the [[Grenache|Cannonau]], [[Nuragus di Cagliari|Nuragus]], [[Nasco di Cagliari|Nasco]], [[Monica (grape)|Monica]], Moscau, [[Girò di Cagliari|Girò]] and Malvasia, produced in the nearby vineyards of the Campidano plain.

==Media==
The main newspaper of Sardinia is ''[[L'Unione Sarda]]'', it was founded in Cagliari in 1889. It was one of the first European newspapers to have its own website in 1994. It has a circulation of about 85,000 copies.

The main regional headquarters of [[RAI]], the Italian state-owned radio and television network, is in Cagliari. There are also two regional television and radio companies as well as numerous information sites on the internet.

==Sports==
[[File:SardegnaArena.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|Internal view of the [[Sardegna Arena]], home of [[Serie A]] football club [[Cagliari Calcio]] since 2017]]
Cagliari is home to the football team [[Cagliari Calcio]], winner of the [[1969-70 Serie A|Italian league championship in 1970]], when the team was led by [[Gigi Riva]]. Founded in 1920, the club played at the [[Stadio Sant'Elia]] in the city from 1970 until it was closed in the summer of 2017, causing the club to temporarily relocate to the provisional [[Sardegna Arena]]. Sant'Elia was the venue for three [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/international/tournaments/fifa-world-cup/1990/1990-group-f.html |title=FIFA World Cup 1990 - Group F - Historical Football Kits |publisher=Historicalkits.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cagliari is an ideal location for water sports such as [[surfing]], [[kitesurfing]], [[windsurfing]] and [[sailing]] due to strong and reliable favourable winds. [[Field hockey]] is also popular, with two teams in the Italian top division, G.S. Amsicora and C.U.S. Cagliari, the first of which won the league title more often than any other Italian team in the men's championship (20) and is also the protagonist in the women's division.

It is the seat of the Superintendency of Cultural and Environmental Heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbappsaecaor.beniculturali.it/ |title=Home - Soprintendenza per i Beni Architettonici, Paesaggistici, Storici, Artistici ed Etnoantropologici per le province di Cagliari e Oristano |publisher=Sbappsaecaor.beniculturali.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421233516/http://www.sbappsaecaor.beniculturali.it/ |archive-date=2015-04-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Sardinia Archival Superintendency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sa-sardegna.beniculturali.it/ |title=La Soprintendenza archivistica - Soprintendenza Archivistica per la Sardegna |publisher=Sa-sardegna.beniculturali.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Archeological Superintendency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archeocaor.beniculturali.it/ |title=Home - Soprintendenza Archeologia della Sardegna |publisher=Archeocaor.beniculturali.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317083905/http://www.archeocaor.beniculturali.it/ |archive-date=2015-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Cultural Heritage Ministry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/index.html/ |title=Home-Page Sito web del Ministero dei beni e delle attività culturali e del turismo |publisher=Beniculturali.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Sardinia and Provincial seat of the Employment and Social Policies Ministry, of the regional offices of the Finance and Economy Ministry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgs.mef.gov.it/VERSIONE-I/La-Ragione/Organigram/Ragionerie2/Sardegna/Cagliari/ |title=Ragioneria Generale dello Stato - Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze |publisher=Rgs.mef.gov.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133152/http://www.rgs.mef.gov.it/VERSIONE-I/La-Ragione/Organigram/Ragionerie2/Sardegna/Cagliari/ |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of some branch offices of the Health Ministry.

Cagliari is home to all criminal, civil, administrative and accounting courts for Sardinia of the Ministry of Justice up to the High Court of Assizes of Appeal. It was home to a prison, Buon Cammino, built in the late 19th century, famous because no one has ever managed to escape. A new modern prison has been built in the nearby town of Uta.

Traditionally, votes in Cagliari are oriented towards the center-right wing. Since World War II, all the mayors belonged to the [[Democrazia Cristiana|Christian Democracy]] party with the exception of Salvatore Ferrara, from the Socialist Party, allied with the former. After the collapse of the traditional parties in the 1990s, the mayors belonged to the party or the coalition led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. The current economic and political crisis that affects Italy has prompted the electorate toward a large abstention and to elect a young mayor, Massimo Zedda, who belongs to a centre-left alliance. In the last municipal elections in June 2016, Massimo Zedda was confirmed in the first round with 50.86% of the votes.

[[File:Ospedale_San_Michele_-_scale_antincendio.jpg|thumb|250px|San Michele Hospital]]
Life expectancy in Cagliari is high: 79.5 years for men and 85.4 for women (provincial level).

There has been a public hospital in Cagliari since the 17th century. The first modern structure was built in the middle of the 19th century, designed by the architect [[Gaetano Cima]]. This hospital is still operating, although all its departments will eventually be transferred to the new University Hospital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoucagliari.it/index.php?xsl=21&amp;s=10&amp;v=9&amp;c=2785&amp;esn=Primo+piano&amp;na=1&amp;n=100&amp;o=1 |title=AouCagliari - Presidi sanitari - Presidio Policlinico Monserrato |publisher=Aoucagliari.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104713/http://www.aoucagliari.it/index.php?xsl=21&amp;s=10&amp;v=9&amp;c=2785&amp;esn=Primo+piano&amp;na=1&amp;n=100&amp;o=1 |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Monserrato.

Waste sorting is still at a low level: only 33.4&amp;nbsp;percent of waste is separated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6381">'''Dina Abramowicz''' (1909- April 3, 2000&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;) was a librarian at [[YIVO]] and a [[Yiddish language]] expert.

== Early life and education ==
Abramowicz was born in [[Vilnius]], then under Russian rule.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;Joseph Berger, "Dina Abramowicz, 90, Librarian and Yiddish Expert, Dies," ''New York Times'' (April 9, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were teachers. Though her first language was Russian, when the Germans occupied Vilnius during [[World War I]], they allowed Jews to establish their own schools. Abramowicz's parents sent her to a Yiddish-language elementary and high schools. During her university years she studied Polish literature. In 1936 Abramowicz graduated from [[Stefan Batory University|Stefan Bathory University]] with a degree in humanities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yleksikon.blogspot.com/2015/12/dina-abramowicz.html|title=Yiddish Leksikon: DINA ABRAMOWICZ|last=Fogel|first=Joshua|date=2015-12-04|website=Yiddish Leksikon|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first job was at a children's library in Vilnius, the Kinderbibliotek.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Soon after its founding she joined YIVO.

During [[World War II]], Vilnius's Jews were put in ghettos. A librarian, [[Herman Kruk]], organized a library and asked Abramowicz to staff it. "How can we think of a library under these conditions, and who will come to read books there?" she remembered asking a fellow librarian. "Since there was nothing one could do about this absurd situation, what was the use of talking and wondering?" was the response. During its initial year, the ghetto library lent 100,000 books, mostly of escapist fiction to relieve the suffering of the ghetto residents.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

The Vilnius ghetto was liquidated in 1943. Abramowicz's mother was sent to [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] where she was murdered. Abramowicz was to be sent to a labor camp, but when the train car door opened on the Vilnius platform, she walked out unnoticed and made her escape, eventually working in a camp devoted to processing winter coats for the German army. She escaped into the woods and joined Jewish resistance fighters as a nurse's helper.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

After the war she made her way to [[New York City]] where she reunited with her father (who had relocated there prior to the war). There she encountered [[Max Weinreich]], one of YIVO's founders, and together they worked to reconstitute YIVO. In 1947 Abramowicz was appointed assistant librarian at YIVO.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1953 Abramowicz received her Masters in Science from the School of Library Science at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She became the head librarian at YIVO in 1962, a position she held until 1987.  when she was appointed research librarian, a position she held until her death.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/abramowicz-dina Baker, Zachary. "Dina Abramowicz." Jewish Women's Archive.]&lt;/ref&gt;

People recalled Abramowicz as having a phenomenal memory and as being a knowledgeable source for information on the Yiddish culture of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

After her death, YIVO established the [https://www.petersons.com/scholarship/Dina-Abramowicz-Emerging-Scholar-Fellowship-111_153681.aspx Dina Abramowicz Emerging Scholar Fellowship] for postdoctoral research in Eastern European Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.petersons.com/scholarship/Dina-Abramowicz-Emerging-Scholar-Fellowship-111_153681.aspx|title=Dina Abramowicz Emerging Scholar Fellowship|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Peterson's|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doron Mendels''' is a [[full professor]] in the history department of the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem.

==Research==
Mendels researches primarily the [[Hellenistic]] world from various perspectives (beginning with the period of [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BCE through the period of [[Constantine the Great]] in the 4th century CE). Many of his works deal with the encounters between the Jews, [[Christianity]], and [[Paganism]], and relate to the themes of [[historiography]], ancient Jewish nationalism, the history of the Catholic Church, public memory, and communication.

===Books===

====''The Land of Israel as a Political Concept in Hasmonean Literature''====

This work was Mendels' first published book, issued in 1987 in Germany by Mohr-Siebeck, Tuebingen, Germany. The book deals with the [[pseudepigrapha]], [[apocrypha]] and Jewish Hellenistic literature of the [[Hasmonean]] era, works which have not usually been seen in their historical-political context. Mendels deals with the perception of the [[Land of Israel]] in the Hasmonean period, and reveals that the question of borders was an open question which was dealt with differently in each decade of the 2nd century BCE.

====The Rise and Fall of Jewish Nationalism: Jewish and Christian Ethnicity in the Ancient Land of Israel====

This book by Mendels, dealing with Jewish nationalism, resonated in the scholarly world beyond ancient historians. It was first published in 1992 by Doubleday in New York, and in paper back in 1997 by William B. Eerdmans in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The book shows that the Jewish approach to nationalism was already strongly implanted in the Jewish community of Palestine in the ancient period.  Mendels divides the concept of nationalism into 4 components that shaped nationalism in the ancient period, each one receiving a separate history from the period of the Maccabees until the Bar Kochba revolt.  The 4 elements are:
# Territory,
# Leadership – generally kingship,
# Army, and
# Temple – conducted by the priests.

Mendels concludes that this approach to nationalism was authentically Jewish, although elements of it can be found also in the surrounding pagan world. This book is cited inter alia by modern historians who deal with nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Such as Anthony D. Smith, Nationalism And Modernism (London and New York: Routledge,1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Jewish Identity in the Hellenistic Period''====

The book deals with the question of Jewish identity based on the literature of the period. It was published in Hebrew by the Broadcast University in 1996, based on a series of lectures on ''[[Galei Tzahal]]''.

====Identity, Religion, and Historiography: Studies in Hellenistic History====

This book is a collection of articles written by Mendels up to 1997. It was published by Sheffield Academic Press in 1998.  Some of the studies deal with the noted Hellenistic historian [[Polybius]]. A number of articles deal with the encounters between the Jews and the Hellenistic world.  Mendels dedicated a significant portion of his research to the literature of the period, from the Greek translation of the Bible through the Pseudepigraphic and apocryphal literature to the New Testament.  The literature of [[Qumran]] is also dealt with in this collection.

One article deals with the [[Essenes]], comparing the light of their lives with what we know about the Hellenistic utopia, which came into style after the conquests of Alexander the Great. 
&lt;ref&gt;"Hellenistic Utopia and the Essenes",  420&amp;ndash;439 (Chapter 25)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another article deals with the issue of reception of historians from the ancient period during the Byzantine period.  The article focuses on the Bibliotheka of the 9th-century patriarch Photius of Byzantium.&lt;ref&gt;"Greek and Roman History in the Bibliotheca of Photius,"  200&amp;ndash;210 (Chapter 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

In another article, Mendels defines the concept "creative history".  He distinguishes between the rationalist historiographic writings (historians that deal with cause and effect, writing linear narratives that describe the history of a period month by month and year by year) and historiography that make connections between political and social needs by tying them to different social strands in the population (primarily from the Hellenistic world after the conquests of Alexander the Great).  In reality, Mendels deals here with the question of how history is "fabricated" in order to create identity in a changing world.&lt;ref&gt;" ‘Creative History’ in the Hellenistic Near East in the Third and Second Centuries BCE: The Jewish Case", 357&amp;ndash;364 (Chapter 21)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his comprehensive article on [[Manetho]], the Egyptian priest, Mendels also discusses this question with a focus on Egyptian Hellenism.&lt;ref&gt;" The Polemical Character of Manetho's Aegyptiaca", 139&amp;ndash;157 (Chapter 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

In another article, Mendels examines the question of how Paul and the first Apostles accepted the idea of mission.  The concept of the mission did not exist in the Judaism that preceded them, and Mendels demonstrates that the ancient Christian mission derived from the concept of mission relating to the traveling Hellenistic gods.  This borrowing had a significant impact on the notion of conversion to the new religion.&lt;ref&gt;" Pagan or Jewish? The Presentation of Paul's Mission in the Book of Acts", 394&amp;ndash;419 (Chapter 24)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Media Revolution of Early Christianity: An Essay on Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History====

This book by Mendels was published in 1999 in Grand Rapids Michigan (William B. Eerdmans).  In it, he attempts to examine the question of how the Church, which developed as an esoteric entity in the Land of Israel, became in less than 300 years a state religion that encompassed the world.  Utilizing subsidiary research from the field of communications (social science), Mendels demonstrates that the church intensively utilized tools of communication to spread its message throughout the ancient world. As a textual basis for his research, Mendels uses Eusebius, a noted church father from the end of the 3rd century and the beginning of the 4th century CE, who was a bishop in Caesarea in the Land of Israel.  Mendels primarily utilizes Eusebius's book, the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'' (while at times relying on his other works such as The Preparation for the Gospel), to demonstrate that we are dealing with a real communication revolution. This book integrates ancient historiographic research with modern research in communication. The communication tools that helped the Church spread out and become a significant organization within the Roman Empire (and later even beyond it) are primarily the following: Christian martyrdom which took place in the public space during particular periods, became a very valuable communication asset. The confrontation between Christian Orthodoxy and the heretical movements within it (the "destructive" ones) caused a commotion that echoed in the public sphere and led to the publicizing of the Church among Pagans and Jews.  Furthermore, the creation of a significant organizational network that became an effective communication network (the periodic meetings of local bishops in synods) helped the Church in activating its "branches" throughout the world.  An additional tool that Mendels expands upon is the mission (which was lacking in Judaism of the time).  The Church made the mission into one of its foundation stones in order to extend its reach to as broad a base of communities as possible. As such, the mission was a most important marketing strategy. Similarly, Mendels draws our attention to the fact that the emperors themselves, both those who persecuted the Christians and those who nullified the decrees, would issue edicts for or against the Christians that were distributed throughout the empire.  Even those that were negative in nature added to the other attempts at communication.  It was these communication tools (alongside an attractive message), according to Mendels, that transformed the Church into a universal entity.

This book is summarized in a Hebrew article that was published in the periodical Zemanim. 
&lt;ref&gt;"The Rise of the Eastern Church: A Revolution in Communication", Zemanim 77 (Winter 2001&amp;ndash;2002), 12&amp;ndash;19 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Memory in Jewish, Pagan and Christian Societies of the Graeco-Roman World''====

This book was published in 2004 by Clark-Continuum in London. It deals with memory in ancient societies of the Greco-Roman world.

Various chapters deal with different types of historical and public memory, and its expression in literature, in historiography, and to some degree in physical monuments. For example, in a chapter on ''The Persians'' of [[Aeschylus]], Mendels examines a number of alternative narratives of remembrance that were embedded in the population of Athens after the [[Battle of Salamis]].  In another chapter, Mendels shows how the memory of [[ancient history]] was created in western society.  Historical memory was influenced already in the ancient world by the creation of a canon by historians.  Mendels demonstrates the processes by which a canon was created, a process that led to a selectivity of what would remain of the works of historians of the ancient period.  Thus, the picture of ancient history in western culture, beginning during the period of the [[Renaissance]], is very partial.  The book challenges the concept of [[collective memory]] prevailing in research from the time of [[Maurice Halbwachs]]; and Mendels claims that it is not entirely correct to talk about collective memory, but rather about partial memory (fragmentary), entrenched within different sub-groups within the collective. These group memories do not necessarily complement each other, but compete and conflict with each other. Mendels was one of the first to deal with these topics within the context of the ancient world.

====On Memory: An Interdisciplinary Approach====

This book, edited by Doron Mendels, was published in 2007 by Peter Lang in Oxford.  The idea developed for Mendels in light of his conclusions in the book surveyed above that in reality one should only talk about partial memories of sub-groups within the collective.  The idea launched a conference connected to a group that dealt with communication and the Jewish world in the context of the Institute for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University in 2005 (some of the participants in the group were Elihu Katz, Menachem Blondheim, Arye Edrei, Tamar Liebes, Shmuel Feiner, Hayim Soloveitchik, Dror Warman and others).  The book, which is a collection of the lectures delivered at the conference in the spring of 2007, includes the participation of experts from a variety of disciplines.  Among the disciplines connected to memory, articles represented the disciplines of law (Nili Cohen), the brain (from the natural sciences: Idan Segev and [[Hermona Soreq]]), anthropology (Yoram Bilu and Moshe Shoked), psychology (Amiya Leiblich and Yonatan Slavin), Hebrew literature (Dan Laor), Israeli society and the holocaust (Arye Edrei) and philosophy (Jeffrey Barash).

Mendels himself wrote the introduction in which he brings a concrete example of the nature of memory from the "public" drawing of the Renaissance period in early Italy.  In addition, he wrote an article on the novella of Gunther Grass "Crabwalk", in which he tries to give an example of the fragmentation of memory in contemporary Germany.  According to the analysis in the article, the collective memory of World War II exists in Germany as a dark background, but there are groups that have adopted for themselves fragments of memories from the past, at times very marginal, which can bring disastrous results when attempting to revive them.

====Zweierlei Diaspora. Zur Spaltung der antiken jüdischen Welt====

This book that Mendels wrote in conjunction with Arye Edrei, a professor of Jewish law at Tel Aviv University, and is published in German by Vandenhoek&amp; Ruprecht in Goettingen, Germany, argues that contrary to the accepted scholarly view, the Rabbis in the first centuries of the common era, did not have control or authority over the western Greek-speaking (and subsequently Latin speaking) Jewish diaspora.  Neither the Rabbis nor other people cared to translate the rabbinic corpus into Greek or Latin (perhaps from the simple reason that it was kept oral for centuries). Hence the Jews in Asia Minor, Greece, the Aegean Islands, Italy, France, Spain, France, and Egypt, who were Greek speaking, were almost completely cut off from rabbinic Judaism that functioned in the Land of Israel and Babylonia because they had no common language of communication.  As a result of this gap, two types of Jews were created – those who accepted rabbinic literature and all that it implies, and those in the west who remained biblical Jews without the oral law that developed in the east.  Also the eastern Jews (i.e. in the Land of Israel and eastward in the direction of Babylonia) who did not accept the Rabbis had the potential to accept them (because they knew Aramaic and Hebrew, in contrast to the western Jews who practically could not communicate because they lacked the knowledge of these languages).  Rabbinic literature, such as the Mishnah, the Talmud and the Midrashim, penetrated into Western Europe only in the 8th and 9th centuries.  At that point, the intensive familiarity of the Jews with this literature began.  By that point, many of the Jews of Europe had been wiped out, and a not insignificant portion had converted to Christianity. But the remainder of Jews accepted the corpus which was by then written down. 
&lt;ref&gt;The German book is based (with many additions and corrections) on Arye Edrei and Doron Mendels, "The Split Jewish Diaspora: It's Dramatic Consequences", ''Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha'', vol. 16.2 (2007), 91&amp;ndash;137; 17.3 (2008), 163&amp;ndash;187&lt;/ref&gt;

====Why Did Paul Go West? Jewish Historical Narrative and Thought====
The book addresses the topic of the authority of texts and their transmission, as well as different strategies of narration in ancient texts. The book also provides extensive treatment of issues such as linearity, temporality and simultaneity of historical texts, whilst working to examine four core themes. First, the narrator and his strategies in the [[historiography]] of the [[Hellenistic period]]. Secondly, Jewish historical thought as expressed in the [[1 Maccabees|1 Book of Maccabees]]. Thirdly, issues of [[Hellenization]] in Palestine – power, honor, peace, gifting, etiquette in general, sovereignty and political theology and their presentation in the main narrative of the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean period]], the 1 Book of Maccabees. Finally, the issue of public memory gets also a significant place in the discussions in the various chapters of the book.

====Current research====

Mendels has for a number of years been actively writing a comprehensive commentary on the Book of 1Maccabees for the series "Hermeneia", published by Fortress Press. 
&lt;ref&gt;His occupation with the past in the Hellenistic period has come to the fore in a recent article by him: “How was Antiquity Treated in Societies with a Hellenistic Heritage? And Why Did the Rabbis Avoid Writing History?”, in G.Gardner and K.L.Osterloh (eds.), Antiquity in Antiquity. Jewish and Christian Pasts in the Greco-Roman World (Tuebingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2008), 131&amp;ndash;151&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published recently in a volume edited by L.I.Levine and D.R.Schwartz (Jewish Identities in Antiquity, Tuebignen, 2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;41–54 Mendels argues that there exists a gap between the myth of Helleniztaion—which has become a metaphor for the struggle of Jewish continuity over the ages &amp;ndash; and the actual historic record from the period itself. The sources from the period do not indicate any real link between Hellenization and the struggle for Jewish religious autonomy in the 160s BCE. Even if representatives of the Seleucid king—probably not the king himself—ordered the Jews to abandon the Torah with all its ritual commandments, the king did not make a further step and ordered their hellenization. The Seleucid kings, in line with Hellenistic kings in general, did not launch a Hellenistic mission and did not have any other strategies of cultural imperialism. The Jews who did undergo a process of Hellenization were a minority and this "conversion" was not forced upon them by the rulers.

The article “How was Antiquity Treated in Societies with a Hellenistic  Heritage? And Why Did the Rabbis Avoid Writing History?” in G.Gardner and Kevin L.Osterloh, Antiquity in Antiquity. Jewish and Christian Pasts in the Greco-Roman World (Mohr Siebeck, Tuebingen 2008), pp.&amp;nbsp;131–151 deals with theoretical aspects of the literary strategies ancient societies used for coping with their pasts. Against this background the avoidance of writing history by the Rabbis is clarified. 
 
In 2011 the article “ Was the Rejection of Gifts One of the Reasons for the Outbreak of the Maccabean Revolt? A Preliminary Note on the Role of Gifting in the Book of 1 Maccabees,” appeared in the Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha 20.4 (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;243–256. The article deals with the role of gift-giving during the period of the first Hasmoneans. Whereas Mattathias rejected gifts and other grants offered by the Seleucids (and by doing so sharpened the rift between Jews and Seleucids), from Jonathan onwards the Hasmoneans became players within this framework of gifting on the international scene and enter into the complex network of gifting and reciprocity. A distinction between gift, grant and concession in drawn, taking into account various aspects such as valuability (value of gift), status (the social status of giver and receiver), supplementation (rhetoric that is considered to be part and parcel of gifting in Hellenistic etiquette), as well as compatibility (whether the gift is in proportion to the wealth of the giver and to the occasion it was given).

'''Florence Nightingale Graham''' (December 31, 1878&amp;nbsp;– October 18, 1966), who went by the business name '''Elizabeth Arden''', was a [[Canadian American]] businesswoman who founded what is now [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], and built a cosmetics empire in the United States.  By 1929 she owned 150 upscale salons across the United States and Europe. Her 1000 products were found in the luxury market in 22 countries. She was the sole owner, and at  the peak of her career, she was one of the wealthiest women in the world.

==Background==
Arden was born in 1878 in [[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Her parents had emigrated to Canada from [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom, in the 1870s. Her father, William Graham, was [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and her mother, Susan, was [[Cornish people|Cornish]] and had arranged for a wealthy aunt in Cornwall to pay for her children's education.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyers, June Skinner (1966). ''Famous Firsts of Scottish-Americans''. Pelican Publishing, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Arden dropped out of nursing school in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Hilary. ''Frommer's Guide to Toronto 2004''. p. 262. {{ISBN|0-7645-4060-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

She then joined her elder brother in [[Manhattan]], working briefly as a [[bookkeeper]] for the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|E. R. Squibb Pharmaceuticals Company]]. While there, Arden spent hours in their lab, learning about [[skincare]]. She then worked—again briefly—for Eleanor Adair, an early beauty culturist, as a "treatment girl".

In her salons and through her marketing campaigns, Elizabeth Arden stressed teaching women how to apply makeup, and pioneered such concepts as scientific formulation of cosmetics, beauty makeovers, and coordinating colors of eye, lip, and facial makeup.

Elizabeth Arden was largely responsible for establishing makeup as proper and appropriate—even necessary—for a ladylike image, when before makeup had often been associated with lower classes and prostitutes. She targeted middle age and plain women for whom beauty products promised a youthful, beautiful image.

In politics, Elizabeth Arden was a strong [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] who supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Lewis| first = Jone Johnson | title = Elizabeth Arden Biography| accessdate = April 7, 2015| date = 2015| url = http://womenshistory.about.com/od/fashion20th/p/elizabeth_arden.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Arden formed a partnership with Elizabeth Hubbard, another culturist. The business relationship dissolved after six months. Graham, who desired a trade name, used "Elizabeth" to save money on her salon signage. She chose the last name, "Arden", from a nearby farm. So the trade name "Elizabeth Arden" was formed. From there, Arden founded, in 1910, the ''Red Door'' salon in New York, which has remained synonymous with her name ever since (see under [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]]){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In 1912, Arden traveled to France to learn beauty and facial [[massage]] techniques used in the Paris [[beauty salon]]s.  She returned with a collection of [[Rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]]s and tinted powders she had created. She began expanding her international operations in 1915, and started opening salons across the world. In 1934, she opened the Maine Chance residential spa in [[Rome, Maine]], the first destination beauty spa in the United States. It operated until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McMillan |first=Susan |url=http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/06/12/former-elizabeth-arden-estate-on-long-pond-for-sale/|title=Former Elizabeth Arden estate on Long Pond for sale |newspaper=[[Kennebec Journal]] |location=[[Augusta, Maine]] |date=June 13, 2014 |accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the French government awarded Arden the [[Légion d'Honneur]], in recognition of her contribution to the cosmetics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/elizabeth-arden-1779864|title=Who Was Elizabeth Arden?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, 5% of the company's shares were purchased by Mark Klein Laboratories. 

In October 18, 1966, Arden died at [[Lenox Hill Hospital]] in [[Manhattan]]. She was interred in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], under the name Elizabeth N. Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hannaonline.org/2017/01/30/the-original-beauty-queen-the-story-of-elizabeth-arden/|title=The Original Beauty Queen: The Story of Elizabeth Arden|date=January 30, 2017|work=Hanna|access-date=February 27, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7110">'''Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus''' was a politician and historian of the [[Roman Republic]]. He was [[Roman consul|consul]] in 129 BC.

== Biography ==

Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus was a member of the [[plebeian]] [[Sempronia (gens)|gens Sempronia]]. His father had the same name and was [[Roman senate|senator]] and in 146 BC member of a commission of ten men who had to reorganize the political conditions in [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Base of a statue in [[Olympia, Greece]]: ''Inscriptions of Olympia'', [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=214128&amp;bookid=224&amp;region=2&amp;subregion=5 No. 323]; [[Cicero]], ''ad Atticum'' 13.4.1; 13.6.4; 13.30.2; 13.32.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman orator and politician [[Cicero]] confused several times the younger Tuditanus with his father and was informed of his mistake by his friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]] in May 45 BC.

Probably the younger Tuditanus is first attested in 146 BC as officer of [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]] in his war in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Atticum'' 13.33.3&lt;/ref&gt; In 145 BC Tuditanus was [[Quaestor]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Atticum'' 13.4.1&lt;/ref&gt; Probably because he was an adherent of the Scipiones he could pass the [[Aedile|curule]] offices within the legally allowed periods without any problems.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Atticum'' 13.32.3&lt;/ref&gt; In 132 BC he was [[Praetor]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Atticum'' 13.30.2; 13.32.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuditanus achieved the peak of his career in 129 BC when he became consul together with [[Manius Aquillius (129 BC)|Manius Aquillius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Quintum fratrem'' 3.5.1; ''de re publica'' 1.14; ''de natura deorum'' 2.14; [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Velleius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#4 ''Roman history'' 2.4.5]&lt;/ref&gt; He had to govern the province of Italy and was ordered by a resolution of the senate to decide on the legitimacy of the accusations of dispossessed Roman allies whose estates had been annexed by the [[Gracchi]]an commission for the allocation of fields. However, Tuditanus did not want to fulfill his task. Instead he went to [[Illyria]], allegedly because of an imminent war. In this way he also prevented the allocation of additional fields.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil wars'' 1.80&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Livy, "Consul Gaius Sempronius at first fought unsuccessfully against the [[Iapydes|Iapydians]], but the defeat was compensated by a victory won through the qualities of Decimus Junius Brutus (the man who had subdued Lusitania)." &lt;ref&gt;Livy, Periochae. 59.20&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Appian, "Sempronius Tuditanus and Tiberius Pandusa waged war with the Iapydes, who live among the Alps, and seem to have subjugated them." &lt;ref&gt; Appian, [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_illyrian_2.html#%A710 ''Illyrica'' 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Tuditanus was granted a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. He immortalized his victories over the Iapydes with a dedication to the river god [[Timavus]] in [[Aquileia]] which bore a victory inscription in [[Saturnian (poetry)|Saturnian verse]] and of which were found two fragments in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Dessau 8885 = [http://www.attalus.org/docs/cil/honorary.html#652 CIL I² 652]&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the Roman poet [[Hostius]] celebrated his deeds in the poem ''Bellum Histricum''.

[[Pliny the Elder]], in his geographical work, quoted an inscription on the statue of Tuditanus (whom he called the conqueror of the Istrians because the Iapydes lived in [[Istria]]) which listed the Roman towns in Istria, gave the river Arsa as the border with Italy and stated that the area was 400 kilometres wide. &lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 3.19&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing is known about the later life of Tuditanus.

== Works ==

Tuditanus was also an author but only a few fragments of his works have been preserved. Cicero emphasized his elegant style.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://www.attalus.org/old/brutus1.html#95 ''Brutus'' 95].&lt;/ref&gt; In the internal Roman power struggles Tuditanus belonged to the [[Optimates]] and wrote a tendentious treatise on Roman constitutional law (''libri magistratuum'') in at least 13 books for the political support of his party.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.13.21; [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' 13.15.4&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side [[Marcus Junius Congus Gracchanus]] was the author of a similar work, ''De potestatibus'', at least seven books in length, that served the purposes of the party of the Gracchi. Both works were the earliest of their kind in the Roman literature. The ''libri magistratuum'' dealt with the [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]], the appointment of the Plebeian Tribunes, the [[nundinae]] (market and feast days of the old Roman calendar), etc.

Because some quotations (e.g., about the original inhabitants of [[Latium]] called Aborigines, about the discovery of books, that allegedly belonged to the legendary Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]], etc.) do not seem to fit into a work about constitutional law, some scholars attribute to Tuditanus another work dealing with the history of Rome from its foundation to the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Sempronius [I 22]''. In: ''Der Neue Pauly'', vol. 11, col. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was probably the Roman universal scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] who found out that Tuditanus used the annalists [[Cato the Elder]] and [[Lucius Cassius Hemina]] as sources for his works, as well as the fact that his account corresponded with that given by his contemporary [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi]], but differed (because of the above-mentioned) from that by Junius Gracchanus. And it was again Varro who delivered the most preserved quotations of Tuditanus by later authors ([[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius]]). But two quotations by [[Aulus Gellius]] (''Attic Nights'' 7.4.1 and 13.15.4) go back to the historian Quintus Aelius Tubero (whose [[Quintus Aelius Tubero|son of the same name]] was consul in 11 BC) and the augur Messalla respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Münzer, ''Realencyclopädie'', vol. IIA 2, col. 1442-1443&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Global Regional Powers.png|thumb|Global Regional Powers]]

'''Global regionalization''' is a process which is parallel to [[globalization]]. The most important feature of the [[global community]] is globalization of many processes and phenomena of the development of [[international relations]], strengthening relationships and interdependence of modern states in the second half of the 20th century. Globalization is evident not only globally, but also regionally. An important component of international relations in the 21st century is regional development and cooperation. In this regard, the importance of regional significant factor in current international relations.
Most of the changes which is observed in today's world are associated with the development of the information sphere.
There were predictable [[transformation of culture|transformation]] and give rise to the beginning of the entry of humanity into a global information society. The researchers are note five definitions of information society-related parameters identification newness of the world which are technological, economic, concerning employment, spatial or cultural nature.
The significance of the information society in terms of its impact on system are consisting of international relations. In 2000 [[G-8 Summit]] in Okinawa adopted a Charter on Global Information Society, which are reflected to the changes in the world  information. The same issues in lot of attention were paid to the Millennium Summit.

== Regionalization as a trend of global development ==
The driving forces of regionalization are  not only state, but also non-governmental structure (the economic "interest groups", NGOs, political parties, etc.). World regionalism is one of the manifestations of globalization and at the same time it is the opposite trend. Globalization is accompanied by a regionalization of international relations,  transfer of public functions to sub-national or international level. Regions helps to protect public relations of globalization from negative impact and act as an independent subject of international relations. Many developing countries see in regionalization attempt to confront global competition. In the context of globalization acquires special relevance selective protectionism - gradual global economic integration, combining openness to the outside world with the protection of national interests.
Universal theories of regions are exist on the theories of the problem, type, goals and objectives of the study. The following theoretical concepts are reflect to the processes of regionalism, which is a consequence of globalization. They are can be as : [[Multipolar world|Multipolar world theory]], the theory of large spaces, the theory of convergence and regional joint doctrine.
In the study of regionalism are analyzed the regionalization emerging in response to the challenges of globalization, regionalization, such as institutional integration of the process of interpenetration merging national productions which are combine together social and political institutional structure of the state. 
There are different forms and types of integration. They are characterized by the degree of freedom of movement within groups factors of production. Currently there are mentioned forms of regional economic integration as: [[Free-trade area|free trade area]] (FTA); [[Customs union|Customs Union]] (CU); [[Common Market|single or common market]] (BP); [[Economic union|Economic Union]] (EU); [[Economic and monetary union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU) and others.

== Information society and international relations ==

Increased of exposure information changes on the international relations caused by a number of features of the information. The first feature - information not only decreases or disappears in his large-scale use but it is starting point for the formation of new species and new qualities. The second feature - information is a fundamental principle for the development and decision-making at all levels of government, including the level of global governance. Third - feature information is "[[Oedipus effect]]", is the ability to influence the mind and behavior of individuals and society in general.
Developing of the [[Global Information Society Watch|global information society]] are  influenced by the progress of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in conjunction with the globalization of markets, both within individual countries and internationally. As a result, the harmonious joining the information society and respecting the necessary balance required coordinating efforts by the state as a body that can fully express the interests of society. Creating of a global information society are requires to the overcoming informational imbalances that exist in the world  between different countries and regions, as well as information imbalances existing within themselves, for example, between different social groups. Because of these disparities, the task of building the information society acquire varying degrees of importance for different countries. Due to the intensification of information exchange and its interplay with economic imbalances interaction available information provided to the growing influence of politics, economics and culture.
 
In 1993 the Vice President of US - A. Gore used the term "[[information superhighway]]." In the field of information, the states like Singapore, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Australia and Iceland are according to the United States. In the information technology ratings Russia is in the  sixth place in the top ten. Below - Morocco, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Bulgaria, Vietnam, the Philippines, Peru, Tanzania. In 1996 was adopted the programme " Participation in international cultural exchange" by the Federal Law.
To stay among the countries that affect global politics and largely define it, needs to strengthen active in shaping the global information society. At the end of 2001 Russia issued to the First Committee of the UN General Assembly resolution "Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security". However, according to the Institute of the Information Society, 64% of the population of Russia does not feel the need to use the Internet.	This figure was the result of adding Methodology Center for International Development at Harvard University "Ready for the networked world" (Readiness for the Networked World) and Russian realities which is relevant to the assessment: human capital, business climate and using of ICT in culture. It appears to the "effect resource economy." It is most clearly seen when comparing the two global markets: the global oil market which is estimated at 650 billion dollars, (Russia's share in it - 16%); ICT world market - about $1 trillion share in it represents the hundredths of a percent (Vaganov, 2004).
The impact which formed of global information society on international relations has not only positive but also negative effects. Thus, the importance of international cooperation is often less important for the media industry, which allows for requests of the audience. Everywhere we are seeing a decline in international news programs, very costly and have a constant audience for stories related to the consumption and criminal chronicle (Atlas Monde diplomatique, 2007). Media increasingly contribute to the formation of world opinion, laying patterns to assess the achievements of globalization as well as risks and challenges of globalization.
For example, growth media publications about the terrorist threat is much ahead of terrorist activity in the world (Chernikov, 2002). However, there is no sufficient information on such global issues as water crisis, or human trafficking. All this points are need for the transformation of information policy.

== Unrecognized states ==

The list of current [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized states]] in scientific publications is large. It includes the Republic of China on Taiwan and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Often can be added the Republic of Somaliland, Tamil Eelam (Ceylon), and more recently - the Islamic State of Waziristan, whose independence was proclaimed in February 2006. Occasionally in this context refers to Southern Sudan, Kashmir, Western Sahara, Palestine, Kurdistan and some other areas (e.g. exotic Sealand). 
Consequently, the unrecognized state -  it is the common name of public entities who are possessing all the attributes of statehood (control of territory, control system, the actual sovereignty) at the same time deprived of full or partial international diplomatic recognition and thus can not de jure act as in international relations. They should not be confused with self-declared republics (- it is education, which is itself declared, but no more). Some authors believe that the term of "unrecognized state" - incorrect (they believe that unrecognized state - is education that passed even though the short period of statehood, it ended in failure) and prefer the term "State de facto".
International legal conflict between the right of nations and self-determination are enshrined in the famous decision of the [[UN General Assembly]] on decolonization in 1960. The principle of territorial integrity of States -  is the principle of inviolability of borders which is officially recognized by all European countries, USA and Canada in the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Conference on Security and Cooperation]] in Europe in Helsinki in 1975.
Uncertainty state by the international community negatively affects its legal status and operational capabilities. Such a state can not be in active economic activities can not conclude trade contracts and implement multilateral investment and infrastructure projects. The area relies only on the international community to humanitarian aid, social and cultural projects, cooperation with various countries and regions in its infancy. Thus the political and legal recognition of any territory depends for its existence and development.
Top prospects in terms of possible transformations is the current status of Kosovo. It is about independence in some form, as this concerned the United States and the European Union. Apparently, Serbia will only be able to postpone such a decision or to bargain for themselves some political and economic concessions (integration of Serbia into the EU or Kosovo section). On the other hand, if the recognition of Kosovo be qualified as a unique case (a unique case) it could provoke a serious precedent in countries where the problem of ethnic separatism.
Abkhazia, Transnistria and South Ossetia can rely on partial, incomplete recognition of Russia, but their future prospects far from obvious. This "half independence" will not be recognized by the United States, European Union, India, China and many other countries. There is the slightest chance of changing the status of Nagorno Karabakh. This situation is mainly determined by the position of the US, EU, Russia, Iran and Turkey.
To effectively address the problem of unrecognized states is likely to develop the clear international legal criteria under which after a certain period unrecognized state formation can count on international recognition.
With all the reservations can be stated that unrecognized independent state players are the regional and international politics. Their influence on political processes is quite noticeable. Globalization has created additional opportunities for long-term existence of unrecognized states without their formal recognition by other countries. It is gradually becoming the norm.

His books investigate the work of [[Austria]]n [[cosmology|cosmologist]], [[Hanns Hörbiger]] and German [[selenographer]], [[Philipp Fauth]], whose now-defunct Cosmic Ice (''[[Welteislehre|Glacial Kosmogonie]]'') Theory:&lt;ref&gt;Hans Hoerbiger and Philipp Fauth, ''Glazialkosmogenie''. 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

:"... considers the Moon to be a metallo-mineral body covered with a sphere of ice... captured out of transterrestrial space where, probably not so very long ago, it existed as an independent planet ...".

:"... [[Hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] exist in the universe in their natural combination H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, water, in its cosmic form: ice".

:"When a block of this 'Cosmic Ice' plunges into a glowing star the impact generates heat. The ice turns into steam. Thermo-chemical decomposition splits the steam into its constituents. Most of the oxygen is bound to the stellar matter, producing more heat. Practically all the hydrogen is exhaled into space. The star-matter-bound oxygen and the 'spatial' hydrogen for the vast stores out of which the Cosmic Ice is generated and its supplies repleted". (''Moons, Myths and Man'', 1936)

Bellamy's first book, ''Moons, Myths and Man'', describes Hoerbiger's theory in detail, and its application to world myths, and his subsequent books develop the theory in light of the Bible, the [[Atlantis]] myth, and the [[Tiahuanaco]] ruins.

''H.S. Bellamy'' may be a pseudonym of ''Hans Schindler''.&lt;ref&gt;According to The Faber Archive and his index card record, at his publisher, [http://faber.co.uk Faber and Faber Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abū al-Hassan ‘Alī ibn Abī Zar‘ al-Fāsī''' ({{lang-ar|أبو الحسن علي بن أبي زرع الفاسي}}) (d. between 1310 and 1320) is the commonly presumed original author of the popular and influential medieval history of [[Morocco]] known as ''[[Rawd al-Qirtas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Arabic literature: A-J'', Vol.1,  Ed. Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey, (Routledge, 1998), 307.&lt;/ref&gt; said to have been written at the instigation of [[Marinid]] Sultan [[Abu Sa'id Uthman II]]. His full [[Arabic name#Nasab|nasab]] is sometimes given as ''ibn Abd Allah ibn Abi Zar'' and sometimes as ''ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Umar ibn Abi Zar''. The uncertainty about his name and authorship of the [[Rawd al-Qirtas|Rawd]] is caused by the many variant manuscripts in circulation since the Middle Ages. Very little is known about his life except that he was evidently a scholar at [[Fes]].

The '''Inglis Barracks bombing''' was a bomb attack carried out by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) on 1 August 1988 on a [[British Army]] barracks called [[Inglis Barracks]] in [[Mill Hill]], [[London]]. The attack killed one soldier from the [[Royal Engineers]], injured nine more and destroyed large parts of the barracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch88.htm#Aug|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1988|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first IRA attack in England since the [[Brighton hotel bombing|1984 Brighton Bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=12&amp;month=10&amp;year=1984|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Provisional IRA had carried out sustained bombing campaigns in England before, between 1973 and 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch73.htm#Mar|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1973|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch75.htm#Dec|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1975|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; carrying out hundreds of bombings in the process killing over 60 people and injuring over 1,000. The IRA carried out sporadic attacks in England between 1977 and 1984. The bombing at Inglis barracks commenced a new sustained bombing campaign that would last until the 1994 IRA ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-28957532|title='It's Over': Reporting the IRA ceasefire 20 years ago|publisher=BBC|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bombing==
The living quarters of the barracks were demolished by the blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-01/news/mn-5021_1_ira-bomb|title=IRA Bomb Hits Barracks in London; 1 Dead|last=Reuters|date=1988-08-01|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction worker Frank McParland, who was working inside the barracks, said the middle section was obliterated. The roof of the two-story red brick building was blown off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/02/world/ira-bombing-in-london-kills-1-british-soldier-and-wounds-10.html|title=I.R.A.

Corporal Ian Booth was rescued alive after he was trapped beneath the debris. He was saved by a radiator that fell across him and shielded him from falling masonry.
Fires raged for three hours as rescuers pulled the injured from heaps of rubble and smoldering timber. Half of the barracks, the army's main postal depot in the capital, used to lie in then [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley constituency]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boundaries of Parliamentary Constituencies 1885–1972'', compiled and edited by F.W.S. Craig (Parliamentary Reference Publications 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA issued a statement the next day in London and Dublin claiming responsibility for the bombing and said more attacks in England would follow.

'''Ivo Pilar''' (19 June 1874 – 3 September 1933) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] historian, politician and lawyer. His book ''The South Slav Question'' is a work on the [[South Slavs|South Slav]] geopolitical issues.

== Early career ==
Pilar was born in [[Zagreb]], where he graduated from high school. He completed the studies in law in [[Vienna]] and attended lectures at the prestigious Ecole de Droit in [[Paris]]. He was one of the ideologues of the Croatian [[modernism]] and belonged to the group of the Croatian writers led by [[Silvije Strahimir Kranjčević]] after 1900.

He went from Paris back to Vienna, where he worked as a secretary in an ironworks corporation. Then he left for [[Sarajevo]], where he was the secretary of the National Bank. He published essays and articles in Kranjčević's ''[[Nada (journal)|Nada]]'' and literary magazines in Zagreb, where he was employed at the [[Royal Court Table, Zagreb|Royal Court Table]]. In 1905 he went to [[Tuzla]] and opened his own legal practice. He stayed in Tuzla till 1920 and developed strong legal and Croatian patriotic activities. As he studied the conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially the position of the [[Croats|Croatian people]], he actively engaged in politics, believing that Croats should be more forceful in defending their interests in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

He published the brochure ''[[Josip Štadler]] and the Croat People's Union'' (Sarajevo, 1908), which was opposed by the clergy and provoked a political rift between him and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vrhbosna|Archbishop of Vrhbosna]]. In his brochure, Pilar concluded that the [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]] had undoubtedly an exceptional role in preserving the national identity of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but he believed there were certain differences between the interests of the people and the Church as an organisation. In 1910 he founded the [[Croat People's Union]], trying to politically awaken impassive Croatian Catholics and prepare them for the incoming portentous events. When [[World War I]] started, he was still in Tuzla.

While many Croats eagerly awaited the dissolution of the hated [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], Pilar warned that it was the only guarantee for a Croatian identity and that the country had to be reformed, but not destroyed. He published the [[essay]] ''World War and the Croats. An Attempt to Orient the Croatian People Even Before the War Ends'' in [[Zagreb]] in 1915, under the [[pseudonym]] dr. Jurčić. He was convinced that the Croatian political elite was lost in the contemporary events and that it was letting the [[Serbs]] take the initiative, instead of clearly formulating the goals and the program of the fight of the Croatian people in the world war. The essay was recognized by well-informed readership, so there was a second edition in 1917.

The developments in the [[Transleithania]]n part of the Monarchy were going against Pilar's wishes and beliefs, so he published a booklet of 32 pages in Sarajevo in 1918. It was called ''Political Geography of the Croatian Lands. A Geopolitical Study'' and it was the founding stone of Croatian [[geopolitics]]. Pilar was aware of its historical significance, since he said: ''We do not have any knowledge of any work on political geography of this kind in Croatian literature. (...) Therefore, this essay is the first of its kind in this area of our literature.'' In the essay, Pilar pointed out that the Croatian lands since 1908, i.e. since the [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], were incorporated in a single strong state, which guaranteed Croatian survival and where "today's Croatian lands flourish like never before".

== The South Slav Question ==
[[File:PILAR-SVJ-RAT.jpg|right|thumb|Pilar's ''World War and the Croats'', 1915]]
Both essays were just a preparation for Pilar's ''magnum opus'', best known under the title ''The South Slav Question''. Pilar wrote it under the pseudonym of L. v. Südland. The full original title of the work in German language was: L. v. Südland, ''Die südslawische Frage und der Weltkrieg. Übersichtliche Darstellung des Gesamt–Problems'' (The South Slav Question and the World War. The Presentation of the Entire Problem). It was published in Vienna in 1918.

The second edition (also published in Vienna), as stated by Pucek (see below) in his introduction to the Croatian translation, was ''heavily censored, since such honest but formally mild criticism of the Austrian policy in the Croatian lands in the 19th century was not allowed by the Austrian government of the time''. Pilar wrote the book in German because he intended it for the German linguistic area, especially the Austrian readers, but also the military and political circles of the embattled Monarchy.

In ''The South Slav Question'' Pilar placed great emphasis on [[scientific racism|racial determinism]] arguing that Croats had been defined by the so-called "Nordic-Aryan" racial and cultural heritage, while Serbs had "interbred" with the "Balkan-Romanic Vlachs." &lt;ref&gt;Bartulin, Nevenko. ''The Racial Idea in the Independent State of Croatia''. Brill, 2013, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Book's reception ===
The interest for the book was below expectations, however. Still, for prevention's sake, as Pucek said, it was being confiscated. The Croatian politicians and intellectuals showed even less interest, since they were intent on the future union with the Serbs. At first, the book could not promote the mission of its author.

But this work in the area of [[South Slavs|South Slav]] issues was immediately recognized by Serbs and other promoters of a [[South Slavic Union]], since the book warned Croats not to enter into states that would cause their ruin. They were buying its copies in Vienna and other cities of the Monarchy to destroy them. For this reason, it became a bibliographic rarity soon after its publication.

=== Croatian translation ===
When the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was created, any book's new edition became a problem. The first two parts of Pucek's Croatian translation were published in the youth magazine ''Hrvatska mladica'', edited by Mile Starčević and Rikard Flogel, in 1928, but as the translator said, "the dictatorship of 6 January terminated ''Hrvatska mladica'' and this translation".

The third German edition of the book was printed in Zagreb in 1944, with all the faults of the censored second edition. It was finally translated to Croatian in 1943, a year before the third German edition, also with all the mentioned faults. It was translated, arranged and commented by the industrious South Slav expert [[Fedor Pucek]] and published by [[Matica hrvatska]]. Two years later, in 1945, Pucek was summarily executed by the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist regime]]. The second Croatian edition (1990) is just a reprint of the first.

== Quotations ==
''Hrvatima oteše današnju zapadnu Srbiju, nekadašnju Duklju, a jedna od glavnih sila koja je dovela do današnjeg rata (Prvi svjetski rat - S.T.), jest zagriženo nastojanje Srba, da Hrvatima konačno otmu i Bosnu i Hercegovinu''

[The Serbs] ''took from the Croats modern-day western Serbia, that is ancient [[Duklja|Doclea]], and one the main forces that brought to today's war'' [First World War] '', is the continuous seeking of the Serbs, to finally snatch away both Bosnia and Herzegovina too from the Croats.''

== Later years and death ==
Pilar moved to [[Zagreb]] in 1920. He was not actively engaged in politics any more. While working as a lawyer, he continued writing. In 1921, he was tried together with [[Milan Šufflay]] and other members of the [[Party of Rights]] in a fake political trial for high treason, for their alleged contacts with the [[Croatian Committee]], a Croatian nationalist organization that was based in Hungary at the time.&lt;ref name="Janjatović-2002"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://bib.irb.hr/prikazi-rad?rad=114009&amp;lang=EN | language = Croatian | title = Dr. Ivo Pilar pred Sudbenim stolom u Zagrebu 1921. godine |trans-title=Dr. Ivo Pilar on Trial at the Zagreb's District Court in 1921 | last = Janjatović | first = Bosiljka | journal = Prinosi za proučavanje života i djela dra Ive Pilara | issn = 1333-4387 | volume = 2 | year = 2002 | pages = 121–139 | publisher = Institute of Social Sciences Ivo Pilar | location = Zagreb, Croatia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought to court, and despite the lack of evidence of wrongdoing, Pilar was given a two-month prison sentence and a one year of probation.&lt;ref name="Janjatović-2002"/&gt;

He published expert and scientific works about philosophy and history (e.g. about the [[Bogumils]]). In 1933, he published the essay ''Serbia Again and Again'' in German, under the pseudonym of Florian Lichttrager, since he feared for his life.

Soon after that essay was published, Pilar was found killed in his apartment. The press in Belgrade claimed it was a suicide, but the open window of his apartment and the fact that Pilar never owned a weapon make his death suspicious. Even today, there are two theories about his death: the first, that Pilar was so depressed by the Yugoslav dictatorship that he killed himself; the second, that he was killed by Serbian secret agents like other Croatian patriots such as Milan Šufflay in 1931.

Pilar is buried in [[Mirogoj Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gradskagroblja.hr/Trazilica/MapPreview.aspx?CemeteryID=1&amp;Field=7&amp;DeptID=1&amp;PersonID=119041 Ivo Pilar at Gradska Groblja] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718134935/http://www.gradskagroblja.hr/Trazilica/MapPreview.aspx?CemeteryID=1&amp;Field=7&amp;DeptID=1&amp;PersonID=119041 |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Social Sciences in Zagreb was named after him in 1997 &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170525045415/http://www.pilar.hr:80/o-institutu/fotogalerija/category/4-povijest-instituta-ivo-pilar]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Jan Błoński''' (15 January 1931 &amp;ndash; 10 February 2009) was a Polish historian, literary critic, publicist and translator. He was a leading representative of the [[Kraków]] school of literary criticism, regarded as one of the most influential critics of postwar [[Poland]].

Professor of the [[Jagiellonian University]], Błoński was habilitated there for the work entitled ''[[Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński]] and the beginnings of the [[Polish Baroque]].'' He was the literary editor for the publication of [[Witold Gombrowicz]]'s collected works in 1986–88 through ''[[Wydawnictwo Literackie]]''. He was also the Fellow of [[Collegium Invisibile]]. In 1996–2001 he served as juror for the [[Nike Award|Nike Literary Award]]. In November 1995 he was awarded the Kraków Book of the Month Award for the collected works of [[Sławomir Mrożek]], his long-time friend from the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Stalinist period]].&lt;ref name="ci.edu.pl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.edu.pl/index.php?id=tutorzy&amp;kat=Czlonkowie |title=List of Fellows |publisher=Collegium Invisible ''ci.edu.pl'', Warsaw |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Jan Błoński was born in [[Warsaw]] in 1931. During the [[occupation of Poland]] by Nazi Germany, he witnessed the liquidation of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] in 1942 when some 300,000 Jews were sent to [[Treblinka]] and exterminated in a [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|single classified operation]].&lt;ref name="ushmm.org-uprising"&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?ModuleId=10005188 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.] {{nobreak|Retrieved March 6, 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Błoński later wrote that a Jewish boy who escaped, run into him on the street but he didn't help, which many years later brought about a deep feeling of guilt, and inspired his best-known piece of writing published by ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' in 1987 under the Polish title "Biedni Polacy patrzą na getto" (the Poor Poles look at the Ghetto) invariably undermining the historical significance of the [[rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="tp-blonski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tygodnik.onet.pl/30,0,21303,artykul.html |title=Biedni Polacy patrzą na getto |publisher=''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' |author=Jan Błoński |accessdate=March 6, 2013 |format=Internet Archive |pages=7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214135615/http://tygodnik.onet.pl/30%2C0%2C21303%2Cartykul.html |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johannes von Müller''' (3 January 1752 – 29 May 1809) was a  [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[historian]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Schaffhausen]], where his father was a clergyman and rector of the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. In his youth, his maternal grandfather, Johannes Schoop (1696–1757), roused in him an interest in the history of his country. At the age of eight he is said to have written a history of Schaffhausen, and at eleven he knew the names and dates of all the kings of the four great monarchies. His ardour for historical studies was further stimulated by [[August Ludwig von Schlözer|Schlözer]], when Müller went (1769–1771) to the [[University of Göttingen]], nominally to study theology. In July 1771 he undertook a sketch of Swiss history for a publisher of [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], but his theological studies and the preparation of a Latin dissertation on the ''Bellum cimbricum'' (publ. in 1772) prevented much progress.

In April 1772 he passed his theological examination, and soon after became professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] at the Collegium Humanitatis in Schaffhausen. He now began to devote his leisure hours to the investigation of Swiss chronicles and documents. Early in 1774, on the advice of his friend [[Charles Victor de Bonstetten]], he gave up this post and became tutor in the Tronchin family at Geneva. But in 1775 he resigned this position also, and passed his time with various friends, as [[Francis Kinloch (Congressman)|Francis Kinloch]] from [[South Carolina]], in [[Geneva]] and [[Vaud]], engaged in carrying his historical scheme into effect. Having accumulated much material, he began the actual composition of his work in the spring of 1776, and the printing in the summer of 1777. But difficulties arose with the censor, and matters came to a standstill.

In 1778–1779 Müller delivered a set of lectures on [[universal history]] (revised between 1782 and 1784), which were published as ''Vierundzwanzig Bücher allgemeiner Geschichte'' in 1811, and often republished. In 1780 the first volume (extending to 1388) of his ''Geschichten der Schweizer'' appeared, nominally at Boston (to avoid the censor), though really at [[Bern]]; and it was well received. In 1781 he published at Berlin, in French, his ''Essais historiques''. During his visit to Berlin, he had an interview with [[Frederick the Great]] from whom he had hoped to obtain an office, but he did not receive it. He was on his way back to Switzerland when the landgrave of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel) named him professor of history. He stayed at [[Kassel]] till 1783, publishing in 1782 his ''Reisen der Päpste'', a book wherein certain leanings towards [[Roman Catholicism|Romanism]] are visible, also his distrust of emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]'s hegemonial politics.

On his return to [[Geneva]] (1783) he accepted the post of reader to the brother of his old patron, Tronchin, and occupied himself with remodelling his published work of 1780. In order to improve his financial position, he accepted early in 1786 the post of librarian to [[Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal]], the [[prince-elector]] and of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|archbishop of Mainz]], who bestowed many important offices upon him and obtained his elevation to nobility from the emperor Leopold II. in 1791. In June 1786 he issued vol. i. (reaching to 1412) and two years later vol. ii. (to 1436) of the definitive form of his Swiss history, which was received with great praise. In 1787 he issued an important political tract, ''Zur Darstellung des Fürstenbundes'', and also ''Briefe zweier Domherren''. But in October 1792 Mainz was taken by the French, so that Müller had to seek for another post. In February 1793 he entered the service of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Francis II]] as an imperial aulic councillor.

At [[Vienna]] he spent many years, becoming chief librarian of the imperial library in 1800, and in 1795 he issued vol. iii. (to 1443) of his Swiss history. In 1804 he became historiographer, war councillor, and member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy]] at Berlin. In 1805 vol. iv. (to 1475) of his Swiss history appeared. He edited the works of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and wrote various treatises for the Academy, including ''Über die Geschichte Friedrich's II'' (On the history of Frederick II).

In 1806 he became strongly inclined towards [[Napoleon]], by whom he was received in audience after the [[Battle of Jena]] (November 1806), and from whom he accepted (end of 1807) the office of secretary of state for the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], exchanging this position early in 1808 for the posts of privy councillor and general director of public instruction. At the end of 1808 he published vol. v. (to 1489) of his great work. He died at Kassel on 29 May 1809.

==Evaluation==
Müller's ''Swiss History'' now possesses a literary value only, but it was an excellent and much admired work in every way for the 18th century and the [[German Romanticism|Romantics]].  His contributions to history are marred by the occasional extravagance and obscurity of his style, and by his inadequate appreciation of the tests of historic credibility; but his learning, his generous sympathies, his grasp of great principles, and his power of vividly presenting some aspects of character secure for his writings an enduring place in German literature.

==Works==

Müller's works were published under the care of his brother Johann Georg Müller (1759–1819), pupil of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], at [[Tübingen]], in 27 vols. (1810–1819), and re-issued, in 40 vols., at [[Stuttgart]] (1831–1835). Vols. 1-3 contain a revised, but unfinished, German version of Müller's ''Universal History''. The ''Swiss History'' was re-issued at Leipzig and Zurich, in 15 vols. (1824–1853), with continuations by [[Robert Glutz-Blotzheim]] (to 1517), [[Johann Jakob Hottinger (historian)|J. J. Hottinger]] (to 1531), [[Louis Vulliemin]] (to 1712), and [[Charles Monnard]] (to 1815). A French translation of the German edition (as above) appeared, in 18 vols., at Paris and Geneva (1837–1851).

Important minor works are ''Essais historiques'', published in French under the auspices of [[Frederick the Great]] (Berlin, 1780); ''Reisen der Päpste'' (new ed., Aix-la-Chapelle, 1831; French translation, 1859), written against the anti-papal reforms of [[Emperor Joseph II|Joseph II]], although he was a Protestant; and ''Vierundzwanzig Bücher allgemeiner Geschichten'', lectures delivered in Switzerland (3 vols., Tübingen, 1811; often republished).

Müller's letters to Füsslin (1771–1807) were issued at Zürich (1812), and those to Charles Bonnet, etc., at Stuttgart (1835). Many letters addressed to him by various friends were published by [[Maurer-Constant]], in 6 vols. (Schaffhausen, 1839–1840); and those written to him by his brother (1770–1809), [[Johann Georg Müller]], appeared, under the editorship of [[Eduard Haug]] and [[André Weibel]], at Frauenfeld (2 vols., 1893) and Göttingen (6 vols. 2009-2011).

'''John Clapham''' (1566–1619) was an English historian and poet.

==Life==
John Clapham was born in London and began his professional life as clerk to the lord treasurer, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil, Lord Burghley]] from around 1590. During this period he performed various roles, acting as burgess for Sudbury, dealing with the repair of English coastal defences, tending to wardship affairs, and becoming closely acquainted with the state of Burghley's health. He was present at Burghley's deathbed in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan-Jones, Katherine and H.R. Woudhuysen eds. ''Shakespeare's Poems: Venus and Adonis, The Rape of Lucrece and The Shorter Poems'' (Arden Shakespeare: Third Edition, 2007) p27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1602 he was admitted to [[Gray's Inn]], serving as one of the Six Clerks in [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] until 1618.

In 1608 Clapham built Christ's Hospital in his father's home parish of [[Firby]] ([[Bedale]]), which he continued to support until his death in 1619. He was survived by his wife, Ann, daughter of Edmund Kiderminster, and one son. He is believed to be buried at [[St. Dunstan-in-the-West]] on [[Fleet Street]].

==Works==
Clapham was the author of ''Narcissus'' (1591), a poem written in Latin hexameters treating the youth as a warning against the dangers of ''philautia'' (self-admiration). It is based on [[Ovid]]'s account of Echo and Narcissus in the [[Metamorphoses]] (III.339–510) and contains echoes of [[Virgil]], especially Book VI of the [[Aeneid]].&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, Charles and Colin Burrow. "Clapham's Narcissus: A Pre-Text for Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis? (text, translation, and commentary)." English Literary Renaissance vol. 22.2 (1992) pp148-9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Katherine Duncan-Jones' summary, "it locates the Narcissus myth in England, the 'Fortunate Island', presided over by a Virgin Queen. In a palace in a wood Love proffers Ovidian advice to Narcissus about how to win over the woman he loves, however moody she may be. But Narcissus is carried off on a galloping horse called 'blind Lust', falls in love with the nymph Echo, and after a frustrating dialogue with her is soon drowned in the river of Self-Love and metamorphosed into the yellow flower that still bears his name."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan-Jones and Woudhuysen (2007) p26.&lt;/ref&gt; Most academic interest in the work derives from its being the first poem dedicated to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]]'s ward, the 17-year-old [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]], the next being Shakespeare's erotic narrative [[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]] (1593),&lt;ref&gt;Martindale and Burrow (1992) p150.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Rape of Lucrece]] (1594) and, according to some,&lt;ref&gt;Duncan-Jones, Katherine, ed. ''Shakespeare's Sonnets'' (Arden, 2010) p52. See also, for example, Bradbrook, M. C. "Shakespeare's Recollections of Marlowe" in Edwards, Philip ed. ''Shakespeare's Styles: Essays in Honour of Kenneth Muir'' (Cambridge University Press, 1980) p197.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare's Sonnets]], which also address the "Sin of self-love".&lt;ref&gt;Sonnet 62, quoted by Wilson, Richard. ''Secret Shakespeare: studies in theatre, religion, and resistance'' (Manchester University Press, 2004) p136.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is thought likely that Burghley prompted Clapham to write ''Narcissus'' for Southampton because of his reluctance to marry, commentators are not agreed about whether the poem itself argues in favour of marriage;&lt;ref&gt;Martindale and Burrow assert that the poem "could scarcely be regarded as an argument for marriage": Martindale and Burrow (1992) p151. Katherine Duncan-Jones sees it as essentially "a pro-marriage poem" designed to "tempt or cajole" the youth: Duncan-Jones and Woudhuysen (2007) pp27-28; Duncan-Jones, Katherine. ''Ungentle Shakespeare: Scenes from a life'' (Arden, 2001) p62.&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, some read the presentation of Narcissus (like Shakespeare's Adonis) as a "compliment" to its dedicatee,&lt;ref&gt;Duncan-Jones and Woudhuysen (2007) p31.&lt;/ref&gt; others as a "rebuke" and a "taunt".&lt;ref&gt;Akrigg, G.P.V. ''Shakespeare and the Earl of Southampton'' (Harvard University Press, 1968) p34; p195. See also Bate, Jonathan. ''The Genius of Shakespeare'' (Picador, 1997) p49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clapham also wrote verses upon the death of [[Sir Thomas Bodley|Thomas Bodley]] in 1613, and other original works and translations.

''Historie of Great Britannie'', his most substantial history, was published initially in 1602, covering the period of the Roman occupation of Britain from the invasion of [[Julius Caesar]] in 55 BC. In 1606 he published a longer edition, ending his account in the ninth century with the Anglo-Saxon [[Egbert of Wessex|King Egbert]].

Clapham began writing his other history in 1603. ''Certain Observations Concerning the Life and Reign of Queen Elizabeth'' contains a substantial biography of Burghley, among other eminent figures, based partly on his own recollections and information provided by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], Burghley's younger son.

'''Karel Dežman''', also known as '''Dragotin Dežman''' and '''Karl Deschmann''' (3 January 1821 &amp;ndash; 11 March 1889), was a [[Carniola]]n [[Liberalism|liberal]] politician and natural scientist. He was one of the most prominent personalities of the political, cultural, and scientific developments in the 19th-century [[Duchy of Carniola]].&lt;ref name="ZRS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zrs-kp.si/konferenca/govorica/avtorji/Janez_C.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504105958/http://www.zrs-kp.si/konferenca/govorica/avtorji/Janez_C.htm |archivedate=4 May 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the fathers of modern archeology in what is today [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nms.si/slovensko/12_oddelki/arheoloski/zgodovina/zgodovina.html&lt;/ref&gt; He also made important contributions in botany, zoology, mineralogy, geology and mineralogy.&lt;ref name="SBL"&gt;http://nl.ijs.si:8080/fedora/get/sbl:0362/VIEW/&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first director of the Provincial Museum of Carniola, now the [[National Museum of Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.pms-lj.si/razstave/darwin/dezman.html&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his switch from [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[liberal nationalism]] to Austrian [[centralism]] and pro-German cultural stances,&lt;ref&gt;Janez Cvirn, Kdor te sreča, naj te sune, če ti more, v zobe plune: Dragotin Dežman in slovenstvo In Zgodovina za vse 14/2 (2007), pp. 38–56&lt;/ref&gt; he became a symbol of national renegadism.&lt;ref name="ZRS" /&gt;

==Early life and career==
He was born to an upper middle class [[Slovenes|Slovene]] family in [[Idrija]], [[Duchy of Carniola]] (now in [[Slovenia]]). After his father's death in 1824, he moved to [[Ljubljana]], where he was raised by his uncle Mihael, who was a financial supporter of the [[Slovene national revival]], and a personal friend of the philologist [[Franc Metelko]].

After finishing high school in Ljubljana and [[Salzburg]] in 1839, he enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]], where he studied medicine and law. In [[Vienna]], he soon came under the influence of Slovene [[Romantic nationalism|romantic nationalists]], and became part of the Slovene radical youth. Among others, he participated in the public funeral of the [[Great Emigration|Polish exile patriot]] [[Emil Korytko]] in Ljubljana, and was chosen to carry his coffin.

During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolution of 1848]], he supported the [[United Slovenia]] program, and helped organize the boycott of the elections to the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] in the [[Slovene Lands]]. In this period, he started using the name Dragotin, a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] version of the name Karel (Charles).

In 1849, he returned to Ljubljana. Initially, he taught at the local [[Gymnasium (school)|state secondary school]]. In 1852, he was appointed director of the [[National Museum of Slovenia|Carniolan Provincial Museum]]. He continued to be active in the Slovene national movement, working with figures such as [[Janez Bleiweis]] and [[Franc Miklošič]]. Among other things, he wrote a bibliography of the poet [[Valentin Vodnik]], and compiled the natural science terminology for [[Maks Pleteršnik]]'s [[Slovene language|Slovene]]-[[German language|German]] dictionary. As an author of articles supporting [[progressivism|progressive]] and [[national liberal]] ideals, he influenced many young Slovene political activists, such as [[Fran Erjavec]] and [[Fran Levec]].

==Political evolution==
Dežman began his political career in the [[Slovene National Movement]], but in the mid-1850s, he became alienated from it, disenchanted with the conservatism and pragmatism of its leaders [[Janez Bleiweis]] and of [[Lovro Toman]]. Nevertheless, he was elected as a Slovene nationalist MP at the Austrian Parliament in 1861. He however did not join the Slovene national [[caucus]], but joined the [[Bohemia]]n [[federalists]]. He supported the peaceful coexistence of Slovene and German culture in the Slovene Lands. In 1862, Dežman's break with the Slovene national movement became manifest when he published a brochure entitled 'The German Culture in Carniola' (''Das Deutschtum in Krain''), in which he argued it is the duty of [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] to civilize and bring economic and political progress to Carniola, without [[Germanization|Germanizing]] it.

Dežman himself turned to more rigid and anti-Slovene positions in the late 1860s and early 1870s, accusing the Slovene nationalists of [[pan-Slavism]], opposing the establishing of a Slovene language university, and the equality of Slovene in public administration. Dežman's political evolution provoked fierce reactions in the Slovene public. The writer [[Janez Trdina]] compared him to [[Judas Iscariot]].&lt;ref name="SBL" /&gt; The Slovene press used his name as a synonym for national [[Turncoat|renegade]]s.&lt;ref name="ZRS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livesjournal.eu/library/lives2/damgl2/stereotipi2g.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1871 and 1874, he served as mayor of Ljubljana. In 1873, he was re-elected to the Austrian Parliament on the list of the centralist liberal Austrian [[Constitutional Party (Austria)|Constitutional Party]] (''Verfassungspartei''). After the death of [[Count Anton Alexander von Auersperg]], Dežman became the undisputed leader of the Constitutionalist Party in Carniola, and tried unsuccessfully to prevent its demise by attempting to forge an alliance with the national progressivist [[Young Slovene]] party.

He died in Ljubljana in 1889, and was buried in [[Navje|St. Christopher's Cemetery]] in the [[Bežigrad]] district.

==Scholarly achievements==
{{expand section|date=December 2010}}
Dežman was a prominent archaeologist. From 1852 till 1889, he was the [[curator]] for archeology and also the first director of the [[Provincial Museum of Carniola]]. In 1875, he started archeological excavations on the [[Ljubljana Marshes]], which brought to the discovery of prehistorical [[stilt house|pile dwellings]] at [[Ig, Slovenia|Ig]]. These are now [[prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps|protected]] as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. He also discovered many important [[iron age]] settlements in [[Lower Carniola]].

Dežman was also interested in ethnology. In 1868, he was the first one to publish the legend of the [[Goldhorn]], which he heard in one of his expeditions to the [[Julian Alps]].

'''Klaus Bachmann''' (born 1963, in [[Bruchsal]]), journalist, writer, historian and political scientist, author of books and writings on German, Austrian and Polish culture, history and politics, as well as on the European Union and German-Polish as well as Polish-Ukrainian relations. In 1988, Bachmann settled in Poland and began to write on a regular basis for various Austrian and German newspapers and weeklies (''[[Die Presse]]'', ''[[Falter]]'', ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]''), reporting on the revolutionary and evolutionary political, economic, social and cultural changes in the post-Soviet bloc countries. Since 1989, he worked as the accredited foreign correspondent based in Poland, and also from 1992, in [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]] and [[Vilnius]]. During the mid-90s he wrote for a Berlin daily, ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', for ''Die [[Stuttgarter Zeitung]]'', ''Die [[Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', and also for Polish mainstream newspapers and weeklies (''[[Rzeczpospolita]]'', ''[[Polityka]]'', and ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'').

==Biography==
He was born in [[Bruchsal]], the largest city in the district of [[Karlsruhe (district)|Karlsruhe]]. He studied history, political science and Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian, and Serbo-Croatian) at the universities in [[Heidelberg]], Vienna and [[Krakow]]. During his studies he also served as a town councillor in his hometown. In 2000, Bachmann defended his doctoral thesis on a period of political regional instability in Austro-Hungarian Galicia between 1907 and 1914, and completed his PhD degree at the University of Warsaw. The work was published in Austria and Germany as ''Ein Herd der Feindschaft gegen Russland Galizien als Krisenherd in den Beziehungen der Donaumonarchie mit Russland (1907–1914). Dissertation. ''("A Hotbed of Hostility towards Russia. Galicia as a Flashpoint in Relations between Austria-Hungary and Russia (1907–1914). PhD").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perlentaucher.de/buch/7564.html |title=Klaus Bachmann – Ein Herd der Feindschaft gegen Russland |publisher=Perlentaucher.de |date=27 September 2001 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Bachmann moved to Brussels where he worked for three years as a correspondent for German and Austrian newspapers in the Benelux countries. In 2004, he returned to Poland and wrote a postdoctoral thesis: ''The Convention on the Future of Europe. Deliberative Democracy as a Method of Legitimizing Authority in a Multilevel Political System'',&lt;ref name="dhi.waw.pl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhi.waw.pl/fileadmin/katalog/grec.php?urN=58 |title=Deutsches Historisches Institut Warschau Nr. 58 |publisher=Dhi.waw.pl |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which earned him a ''Doctorus Habilitatus'' degree at the Faculty of Social Sciences, [[University of Wroclaw]]. Subsequently, he was appointed Chair of Political Science at the Willy Brandt Center for German and European Studies at the University of Wroclaw. Between 2000 and 2001, and again since 2005, he was a member of the Governing Board of the Stefan Batory Foundation based in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batory.org.pl/english/about/govern.htm |title=Stefan Batory Foundation |publisher=Batory.org.pl |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Bachmann became associate professor at the Institute of Political Science at the [[SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities|School of Social Psychology in Warsaw]]. He also lectures at the Institute for International Studies at the University of Wroclaw. His articles have been published in Polish mainstream weeklies (''[[Polityka]]'') and dailies (''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''), and also in diverse Austrian, German and Swiss newspapers. In 2004, he delivered lectures as a visiting professor at the Institute of East European History, University of Vienna (on recent history of Poland) and the Institute of Political Studies (IEP) at the University of Bordeaux (2008). He pursued scholarly research at the [[People's University of China]] (Renmin) in Beijing in 2007 and at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicgs.org/fellows/bios/bachmann.aspx |title=FELLOWS : Dr. Klaus Bachmann |publisher=AICGS |accessdate=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927054151/http://www.aicgs.org/fellows/bios/bachmann.aspx |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007. He also conducted research at the Faculty of Law at [[Stellenbosch University]] (South Africa, 2009). He is a member of the Central European International Studies Association (CEISA), the European Studies Association (EUSA), and a Fellow and Associate of the Center for International Relations based in Warsaw. He is also the Principal Officer of the Foundation for European Studies (FEPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feps.pl/people/klaus-bachmann |title=Klaus Bachmann &amp;#124; FEPS |publisher=Feps.pl |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2014, he was awarded a full tenured professorship by Polish President Bronisław Komorowski &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wroclaw.pl/nominacje-profesorskie-dla-wroclawian |accessdate=13 January 2014 |title=Nominacje profesorskie dla wroclawian, Wroclaw.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debalie.nl/artikel.jsp;jsessionid=028D185E55628AB101554470F6F99958?dossierid=15978&amp;subdossierid=0&amp;articleid=6653 |title=De Balie: Nieuw Europa: Verslag No. 1 |publisher=Debalie.nl |accessdate=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927165721/http://www.debalie.nl/artikel.jsp%3Bjsessionid%3D028D185E55628AB101554470F6F99958?dossierid=15978&amp;subdossierid=0&amp;articleid=6653 |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as [[E. M. Forster]] attempted to improve the troubled relationship between Germany and England (''[[Howards End]]'' (1910), "Only connect"), and that between England and India (''[[A Passage to India]]'' (1924), Bachmann is working arduously to build links between erstwhile redoubtable enemies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4120">'''Legal Marxism''' was a [[Russia]]n [[Marxism|Marxist]] movement based on a particular interpretation of Marxist theory whose proponents were active in socialist circles between 1894 and 1901. The movement's primary theoreticians were [[Pyotr Struve]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky]] and [[Semyon Frank]]. The name was derived from the fact that its supporters promoted their ideas in legal publications.

Unlike the earlier generation of Russian [[socialists]] known as [[narodniks]] (populists), who emphasized the role of the peasantry in transitioning to socialism, Legal Marxists used the economic theory of [[Karl Marx]] to argue that the development of [[capitalism]] in the [[Russian Empire]] was both inevitable and beneficial. As Struve put it, they provided a "justification for capitalism" in Russia.

Legal Marxists held numerous open debates from the mid-1890s through the early 1900s, notably at the [[Free Economic Society]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], and published three magazines between 1897 and 1901, all of them eventually suppressed by the imperial government:

*''[[Novoye Slovo]]'' (1897)
*''[[Nachalo]]'' (1899)
*''[[Zhizn]]'' (1899–1901, resumed abroad in 1902)

Legal Marxists became particularly influential after the arrest and imprisonment of the leaders of the revolutionary wing of Russian Marxism (including [[Julius Martov]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]) in 1895-1896.  Legal Marxists and revolutionary Marxists were allied in the late 1890s within the newly formed [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]], whose Manifesto Struve wrote in 1898 and Legal Marxists magazines were extensively used by revolutionary Marxists living in exile or abroad to publish their writings. However, Legal Marxists became increasingly supportive of [[Eduard Bernstein]]'s [[Marxist revisionism|revision]] of Marxism from 1897 on, which drew criticism from [[Georgy Plekhanov]], Lenin and other revolutionary Marxists. Struve and other Legal Marxist leaders soon abandoned philosophical [[materialism]] for [[neo-Kantianism]] while Berdyaev, Bulgakov and Frank eventually became philosophers of [[religion]]. Tugan-Baranovsky developed a theory of cyclical economic crises under capitalism, which was also criticised by revolutionary Marxists {{ref|Tugan}}.

Starting in 1901, Legal Marxists' abandonment of Marxism led to a break with Russian [[social democrat]]s and they drifted toward liberalism with Struve editing ''Osvobozhdenie'' (''Liberation''), a liberal magazine, from 1902 on. Eventually the leaders of the movement became allied with the radical part of the [[Zemstvo]] within ''Soyuz Osvobozhdeniya'' (''Liberation Union'') in 1903-1905. Most of them were prominent supporters of the [[Constitutional Democratic party]] after the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].

The '''list of Roman hoards in Britain''' comprises significant [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[hoard]]s of coins, jewellery, precious and scrap metal objects and other valuable items discovered in [[Great Britain]] ([[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]) that are associated with period of [[Romano-British culture]] when [[Roman Britain|Southern Britain]] was under the control of the [[Roman Empire]], from AD 43 until about 410, as well as the subsequent [[Sub-Roman Britain|Sub-Roman]] period up to the establishment of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.  It includes both hoards that were buried with the intention of retrieval at a later date (personal hoards, [[Foundry|founder's]] hoards, merchant's hoards, and hoards of loot), and also hoards of [[votive offering]]s which were not intended to be recovered at a later date, but excludes [[grave goods]] and single items found in isolation.

Most Roman hoards are composed largely or entirely of coins, and are relatively common in Britain, with over 1,200 known examples.&lt;ref name="didcot"/&gt;  A smaller number of hoards, such as the [[Mildenhall Treasure]] and the [[Hoxne Hoard]], include items of silver or gold tableware such as dishes, bowls, jugs and spoons, or items of silver or gold jewellery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11826">In [[art history]], an '''[[Notname|anonymous master]]''' is an [[Old Master]] whose work is known, but whose name is lost.

==Renaissance==
Only in the Renaissance did individual artists in Western Europe acquire personalities known by their peers (some listed by [[Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''), such as those known by :
* Their true name or their father's name  :
** [[Filippino Lippi]] after his father [[Fra Filippo Lippi]]
* A chosen [[pseudonym]], possibly linked to his birthplace or his father's trade :
** [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] worked on the gate of saint Gall
** [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], after his father, a chicken farmer (pollo in Italian)
** [[Jacopo del Sellaio]], after his father, a saddler (''sellier'')
** The [[Della Robbia]]s (after the Tuscan word ''robbia'', dyers' [[Rubia tinctorum|madder]], and his father, the dyer [[Luca della Robbia]])
** [[Masuccio Segondo]], student of [[Masuccio Primo]]
** etc.
* '''A surname attributed to him :'''
** [[Simone del Pollaiolo|Il Cronaca]], who never stopped talking about the ruins he had seen in Rome
** [[Daniele da Volterra]], nicknamed  ''Il Braghettone'' (the [[breeches]] maker) for having censored nudes in paintings by adding cloths or branches, at the request of [[pope Paul IV]]
** [[Luca della Robbia]], for the madder colour he used as a ceramicist
** [[Masaccio]], known as the idiot
** etc.
* '''A [[corporation]], whose generic name is given to works made by all its members :'''
** the [[Campionesi Masters]], sculptors and builders of religious buildings (Ugo da Campione, [[Bonino da Campione]], Giovanni da Campione, Zenone de Campione, Matteo da Campione)

==20th-century problems of attribution==
The idea of a named and recognised painter originated among art historians early in the 20th century, who were attributing works they recognised to known painters. They later went back on some of these attributions, renaming as anonymous the painters they had formerly named. One example is the case of [[Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], to whom [[Bernard Berenson]] attributed a number of works which were later re-attributed to [[Pseudo Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], a Florence copyist. Some painters have even been described as anonymous (even many times like [[Barthélemy Eyck]]) before later being recognised. They thus held several names historically (those who are noted on the page devoted to them), although doubts continue surrounding some, such as [[Giovanni Gaddi (painter)|Giovanni Gaddi]] (after 1333 – 1383) maybe the ''Master of the Misericordia dell’Accademia''.

==Artists whose names have since been established==
In recent years the names of a variety of artists who were formerly listed as "anonymous" have become known; accordingly scholarly writings and museum labels have been changed to reflect their new identities. Much the most famous of these is the Master of Flémalle (c 1378–1445), painter of the [[comté de Hainaut]], who was established as [[Robert Campin]]. Other examples include:
* [[Jehan Bellegambe]], sometimes called the "master of colours".
* Master of 1419 – recognised as [[Battista di Biagio Sanguigni]], having painted and dated in 1419 the central panel for a triptych executed for Santa Maria a Latera, broken up and dispersed
* Master of the Chiostro degli Aranci – recognised as being [[Giovanni Consalvo]], fresco painter at the monastery at [[Badia Fiorentina]]
* [[Barthélemy d'Eyck]] is the generally accepted as the painter known as the Master of the Aix Annunciation for paintings, and the Master of René of Anjou for illuminated manuscripts; he is also thought by many to be the Master of the Shadows
* The Dombild Master, as [[Stefan Lochner]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4736">The '''Mark Lynton History Prize''' is an annual award in the amount of $10,000 given to a book "of history, on any subject, that best combines intellectual or scholarly distinction with felicity of expression".&lt;ref name=Lukas&gt;{{cite web|title=J. Anthony Lukas Prize Project|url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/NiemanFoundation/Awards/AwardsAtAGlance/JAnthonyLukasPrizeProject.aspx|publisher=Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is one of three awards given as part of the [[J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize]] administered by the [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J. Anthony Lukas Prize Project|url=http://nieman.harvard.edu/awards/j-anthony-lukas-prize-project/|website=Neiman Foundation|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Columbia University School of Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The J. Anthony Lukas Prize Project|url=https://journalism.columbia.edu/lukas|website=Columbia Journalism School|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is named in honor of [[Mark Lynton]], a refugee from [[Nazi Germany]], Second World War officer, and automobile industry executive. In 1939 Lynton was a [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] German-born student, studying history at Cambridge when he and other German nationals were rounded up and interned in detention camps in England and Canada as [[enemy alien]]s, suspected of being Nazi sympathizers. When Lynton was released he joined the [[British Army]], became a tank commander, and was later promoted to Major in the occupying force, [[British Army of the Rhine|Army of the Rhine]], where he helped interrogate high-ranking Nazi officers. Lynton memorialized his odyssey in his memoir, ''Accidental Journey: A Cambridge Internee's Memoir of World War II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynton|first1=Mark|title=Accidental journey : a Cambridge internee's memoir of World War II|date=1995|publisher=Overlook Press|location=Woodstock [u.a.]|isbn=978-0879515775|pages=276|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was established by his wife, Marion, children, Lili and [[Michael Lynton|Michael]], and grandchildren, Lucinda, Eloise Lynton and Maisie Lynton, to honor Lynton who was an avid reader of history. The Lynton family has underwritten the Lukas Prize Project since its inception in 1998.

'''Mary Renault''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|oʊ|l|t}};&lt;ref&gt;"She always pronounced it 'Ren-olt', though almost everyone would come to speak of her as if she were a French car." {{cite book |last=Sweetman |first=David |title=Mary Renault: A Biography |publisher=Harvest/HBJ |year=1994 |location=Orlando, FL |pages=74 |isbn=0-15-600060-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 4 September 1905 – 13 December 1983), born '''Eileen Mary Challans''',&lt;ref name="st-hughs.ox.ac.uk"/&gt; was an English and South African writer best known for her [[historical novel]]s set in [[ancient Greece]]. In addition to vivid fictional portrayals of [[Theseus]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Alexander the Great]], she wrote a non-fiction biography of Alexander.

==Biography==
Born at Dacre Lodge, 49 Plashet Road, Forest Gate, [[Essex]] (now in London), of physician Frank Challans and Mary Clementine Newsome Baxter Challans, Renault was educated first at Levick family school and [[Clifton High School, Bristol|Clifton Girls School]] in Bristol. She read English at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], then an all-women's college, receiving an undergraduate degree in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/renault-mary-1905-1983|title=Renault, Mary (1905–1983) - Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 she began training as a [[nurse]] at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] in [[Oxford]]. During her training she met Julie Mullard (1912 – 1996), a fellow nurse with whom she established a lifelong romantic relationship.

She worked as a nurse while beginning a writing career, treating [[Dunkirk]] evacuees at the [[Winford#Winford Hospital|Winford Emergency Hospital]] in [[Bristol]], and working in Radcliffe Infirmary's brain surgery ward until 1945. She published her first novel, ''Purposes of Love'', in 1939: it has a contemporary setting, like her other early novels, and the novelist Linda Proud has described it as "a strange combination of Platonism and hospital romance".&lt;ref name="hns"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historicalnovelsociety.org/solander%20files/glimpse_of_a_strong_greek_light_.htm |title=The Glimpse of a Strong Greek Light |first=Linda |last=Proud |periodical=Historical Novel Society |year=1999 |accessdate=23 October 2007 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174301/http://www.historicalnovelsociety.org/solander%20files/glimpse_of_a_strong_greek_light_.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her novel ''The Friendly Young Ladies'' (1943), which is about a lesbian relationship between a writer and a nurse, seems to have been inspired by her own relationship with Mullard.

In 1948, after her novel ''Return to Night'' won an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] prize worth $150,000, Renault and Mullard emigrated to South Africa, where they remained for the rest of their lives. There, according to Proud, they found a community of gay expatriates who had "escaped the repressive attitudes towards homosexuality in Britain for the comparatively liberal atmosphere of [[Durban, South Africa|Durban]].... Mary and Julie found themselves able to set up home together in this new land without causing the outrage they had sometimes provoked at home."&lt;ref name="hns" /&gt; However, both Renault and Mullard were critical of the less liberal aspects of their new home, and participated in the [[Black Sash]] movement against [[apartheid]] in the 1950s.

Shortly before her death, Mary was listed as one of the famous alumnae who had brought the Radcliffe Infirmary Nurses' Home much honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sweetman|first1=David|title=Mary Renault|date=1993|publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|location=United States|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the especially wet winter of 1983 in Cape Town, Mary picked up a small cough. At first, the cough was no more than a mild irritant for Mary, but it soon "become a persistent, hacking attempt to clear her lungs and catch her breath." After Julie voiced her fears to their mutual friend Dr. Sonnenberg, x-rays were performed, and Mary was diagnosed with pneumonia and was directed to a nursing home. After failing to eliminate the pneumonia with antibiotics, a visiting British surgeon performed a bronchoscopy under general anaesthetic. Shortly after, the doctor revealed to Julie that he had "found fluid on the lung and had aspirated some it: the cause was cancer." Julie begged the doctors to say nothing to Mary unless she demanded to be told. By October, a friend of Dr. Sonnenberg, Dr. Slome, was draining off liquid twice a week and was convinced that there was a pocket he could not reach. Mary was then put on oxygen in order to ease her breathing. On 12 December 1983, as a last hope, the doctors decided to inject a new chemical into the pleura early the next morning, in the hope that it would stop further fluid from forming. Before the operation even began, Julie received a phone call, which she knew "could only mean one thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sweetman|first1=David|title=Mary Renault|date=1993|publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|location=United States|pages=301–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Renault died in Cape Town on 13 December 1983.

==Themes==
In South Africa Renault was able to write forthrightly about homosexual relationships for the first time. Her sympathetic treatment of love between men won her a wide gay readership, but it also led to rumours that Renault was really a gay man writing under a female pseudonym. Renault found these rumours amusing but also sought to distance herself from being labelled a "gay writer".

Her historical novels are all set in ancient Greece. They include a pair of novels about the mythological hero Theseus and a trilogy about the career of Alexander the Great. In a sense, ''The Charioteer'' (1953), the story of two young gay servicemen in the 1940s who try to model their relationship on the ideals expressed in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', is a warm-up for Renault's historical novels. By turning away from the twentieth century and focusing on stories about male lovers in the warrior societies of ancient Greece, Renault no longer had to deal with homosexuality and anti-gay prejudice as social "problems".  Instead she was free to focus on larger ethical and philosophical concerns while examining the nature of love and leadership. ''The Charioteer'' could not be published in the US until 1959, which made it a somewhat later addition to homosexual literature in the United States because American readers and critics had accepted serious gay love stories in such works as [[Djuna Barnes]]' ''[[Nightwood]]'' (1936), [[Carson McCullers]]' ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (novel)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'' (1941), [[Truman Capote]]'s ''[[Other Voices, Other Rooms (novel)|Other Voices, Other Rooms]]'' (1948) and [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[The City and the Pillar]]'' (1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Slide | first = Anthony | authorlink = Anthony Slide| year = 2003 | title = [[Lost Gay Novels]]: A Reference Guide to Fifty Works from the First Half of the Twentieth Century | publisher = Routledge | pages = 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a [[Classics|classicist]] by training, Renault was admired in her day for her scrupulous recreations of the ancient Greek world. Some of the history presented in her fiction and in her non-fiction work, ''The Nature of Alexander'' has been called into question, however. Her novels about Theseus rely on the controversial theories of [[Robert Graves]], and her portrait of Alexander has been criticized as uncritical and romanticized.&lt;ref name="beyondrenault"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Beyond Renault: Alexander the Great in Fiction |url= http://myweb.unomaha.edu/~mreames/Beyond_Renault/beyondrenault.html |accessdate= 23 October 2007 |first= Jeanne |last= Reames |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035929/http://myweb.unomaha.edu/~mreames/Beyond_Renault/beyondrenault.html |archivedate= 12 October 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Kevin Kopelson]], professor of English at the [[University of Iowa]], Renault "mischaracterize[s] pederastic relationships as heroic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Kevin | last = Kopelson |title= Love's Litany: The Writing of Modern Homoerotics | publisher= Stanford University Press |year=1994| chapter = Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Defying centuries of admiration for [[Demosthenes]] as a great [[orator]], Renault portrayed him as a cruel, corrupt and cowardly [[demagogue]]. Renault defended her interpretation of the available sources in author's notes attached to her books.

Though Renault appreciated her gay following, she was uncomfortable with the "[[gay pride]]" movement that emerged in the 1970s after the [[Stonewall riots]].  Like Laurie Odell, the protagonist of ''The Charioteer'', she was suspicious of identifying oneself primarily by one's sexual orientation. Late in her life she expressed hostility to the gay rights movement, troubling some of her fans&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Lisa Lynne |title=Lesbian Migrations: Mary Renault's South Africa |journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies |date=2003 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=23-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[David Sweetman]] remarks in his biography of Renault that her novels generally portray mothers in a poor light and that, particularly in her later novels, this is extended to women in general.{{Sfn | Sweetman | 1993 | p = 166}}  Her generally negative depiction of women has also been noted by the critic [[Carolyn Heilbrun]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reinventing Womanhood'' Carolyn Heilbrun, 1979 (Chapter Three)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The powerful impact Renault's work may have had on many readers, especially emerging young gay men, is suggested in a personal memoir by author and critic [[Daniel Mendelsohn]].&lt;ref name= Mendelsohn&gt;{{cite web |last= Mendelsohn |first= Daniel |title= Personal History The American Boy |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/07/130107fa_fact_mendelsohn|publisher= Condé Nast|accessdate= 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Berger''' is an American [[cultural historian]], [[curator]], and [[art critic]].

== Biography ==
Berger is research professor and chief curator at the [[Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture]], [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]]. Berger writes the monthly ''Race Stories'' column, "a continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race", for the Lens Section of the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;'' [http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/?s=maurice+berger&amp;_r=0/ Lens Blog: Race Stories by Maurice Berger]'', ''New York Times'', July 2012-present&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger engages the issues of racism, whiteness, and contemporary race relations and their connection to visual culture in the United States. In the mid-1980s he was an assistant professor of art and gallery director at Hunter College.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5D9153CF936A35756C0A96F958260 Ibid]''&lt;/ref&gt; His interdisciplinary project "Race and Representation", co-organized with the anthropologist [[Johnnetta B. Cole]] at Hunter College in 1987, included a book, art exhibition, and film program. His study on institutional racism, "Are Art Museums Racist?", appeared in ''[[Art in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Aesthetics-A-Reader-in-Philosophy-of-the-Arts-2E/9780131121447.page "Art Art Museums Racist?]'', Maurice Berger, excerpt from ''Art in America'', September 1990 {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, Berger extended his work on visual culture and race to include sustained study of the work of African-American artists, performers, filmmakers, producers, and cultural figures, culminating both in solo exhibitions ("Adrian Piper: A Retrospective" and "Fred Wilson Objects and Installations"), multimedia projects (including compilation videos and elaborate context stations for art exhibitions), and essays (on subjects as diverse as black artists and the limitations of mainstream art criticism, the racial implications of art historical and curatorial efforts to evaluate "outsider" art, the Harlem Document project of New York's [[Photo League]], and the photography, writing, and films of [[Gordon Parks]]).

Berger has curated a number of race-related concept-based exhibitions, including ''For All The World To See: Visual Culture and the Struggle for Civil Rights''—a joint venture of the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the Center for Art, Design &amp; Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

== Media projects ==
Since the mid-1990s, Berger has produced cinematic “culture stories,” syncopated compilations of historic clips from American film and television that explore issues of identity and self-representation. His film ''Threshold'' was featured in the 2012 Whitney Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2012Biennial/AliciaHallMoranAndJasonMoran Bleed: Alicia Hall Moran and Jason Moran on Whitney Museum Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203094857/http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2012Biennial/AliciaHallMoranAndJasonMoran |date=2013-02-03 }},&lt;/ref&gt; The film was inspired by his conversations with Alicia Hall Moran and [[Jason Moran (musician)|Jason Moran]] about their ideas for ''Bleed,'' their residency for the biennial. ''Threshold'' is a continuum of images from popular culture produced during the period of or about the historic civil rights movement. Critic [[Ben Ratliff]], writing in the ''New York Times'', observed that "''Threshold'' strung together clips from movies and television shows of African-Americans beginning various journeys, passages or challenges: Diana Ross and Michael Jackson on the yellow brick road in “The Wiz”; dancers on “Soul Train”; Denzel Washington as Malcolm X stepping up to a podium. The mood of that film carried through the whole week:  moving forward, crossing lines, evolving."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/arts/music/alicia-hall-moran-and-jason-moran-in-bleed-at-whitney.html?pagewanted=all Art, Ancestry, Africa: Letting It All Bleed]'', Ben Ratliff, ''New York Times'', 14 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
'''Numen''', pl. '''numina''',  is a [[Latin]] term for "[[divinity]]", or a "divine presence", "divine will." The Latin authors defined it as follows.&lt;ref name=lewisnumen&gt;For a more extensive account, refer to {{cite encyclopedia | author1=Charlton T. Lewis | author2=Charles Short | language=Latin | encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary | title=numen | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dnumen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] writes of a "divine mind" (''divina mens''), a god "whose numen everything obeys," and a "divine power" (''vim divinam'') "which pervades the lives of men." It causes the motions and cries of birds during augury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Cicero | title=De Divinatione | at=I.119-120 | publisher=Loeb Classical Library; penelope.uchicago.edu | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Divinatione/1*.html}} {{cite web | author=Marci Tulli Ciceronis | title=De divinatione Prior | language=Latin | at=I.119-120 | publisher=The Latin Library | url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Virgil]]'s recounting of the blinding of the one-eyed giant, [[Polyphemus]], from the Odyssey, in his [[Aeneid]], he has Odysseus and his men first "ask for the assistance of the great numina" (''magna precati numina'').&lt;ref&gt;3. 634.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing public opinion of [[Augustus]] on the day of his funeral, the historian [[Tacitus]] reports that some thought "no honor was left to the gods" when he "established the cult of himself" (''se ... coli vellet'') "with temples and the effigies of numina" (''effigie numinum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=C. Cornelius Tacitus | title=Annales | at=1.10 | language=Latin | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0077%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the younger]] in a letter to Paternus raves about the "power," the "dignity," and "the majesty;" in short, the "''numen'' of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=C. Plinius Cæcilius Secundus | title=Letters | at=9.27.1 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | language=Latin | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0139%3Abook%3D9%3Aletter%3D27%3Asection%3D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucretius]] uses the expression ''numen mentis'',&lt;ref&gt;T. Lucretius Carus, ''De Natura rerum'', 3.144.&lt;/ref&gt; or "bidding of the mind,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Lucretius |title=On the Nature of Things | author2=R. Allison, Translator | publisher=Arthur Humphries | location=London | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; where "bidding" is ''numen'', not, however, the divine numen, unless the mind is to be considered divine, but as simply human will.&lt;ref name=lewisnumen/&gt;

Since the early 20th century, numen has sometimes been treated in the [[History of religions|history of religion]] as a [[animism|pre-animistic]] phase; that is, a belief system inherited from an earlier time. ''Numen'' is also used by [[sociologists]] to refer to the idea of magical power residing in an [[magical object|object]], particularly when writing about ideas in the western tradition. When used in this sense, ''numen'' is nearly synonymous with ''[[mana]]''. However, some authors reserve use of ''mana'' for ideas about [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] from [[Polynesia]] and southeast [[Asia]].

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the word means "a nod of the head", here referring to a [[deity]] as it were "nodding", or making its will or its presence known). According to [[H. J. Rose]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The literal meaning is simply "a nod", or more accurately, for it is a passive formation, "that which is produced by nodding", just as ''flamen'' is "that which is produced by blowing", ''i.e.'', a gust of wind. It came to mean "the product or expression of power" — not, be it noted, power itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=H. J.|title=Primitive Culture in Italy|year=1926|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co.|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, ''numen'' (divinity) is not personified (although it can be a personal attribute) and should be distinguished from ''[[deus]]'' (god).&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bailey| first=Cyril |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |year=1907|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co Ltd| url =http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm}}, freely available from [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman cults of the numina==
Numen was also used in the [[imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|imperial cult]] of ancient Rome, to refer to the [[Genius (mythology)#Imperial genii|guardian-spirit]], 'godhead' or divine power of a living emperor—in other words, a means of worshiping a living emperor without literally calling him a god.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]] of [[Augustus]] was promoted by [[Tiberius]], who dedicated the ''Ara Numinis Augusti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishwick|first=Duncan|title=''Genius'' and ''Numen''|journal = Harvard Theological Review|volume = 62| issue = 3| pages = 356–367| date = July 1969| doi=10.1017/s0017816000032405}} Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context, a distinction can be made between the terms ''numen'' and ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishwick|first=Duncan|title='Numina Augustorum|journal = The Classical Quarterly |series=New Series|volume = 20| issue = 1| pages = 191–197| date = May 1970| doi=10.1017/s0009838800044773}} Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition as a pre-animistic phase of religion==
The expression ''Numen inest'' appears in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' (III, 296) and has been translated as 'There is a spirit here'.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. Fasti. Translated by Frazer, James George. Loeb Classical Library Volume. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Its interpretation, and in particular the exact sense of ''numen'' has been discussed extensively in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Herbert Jennings|title=Nvmen inest: 'Animism' in Greek and Roman Religion|journal = Harvard Theological Review|volume = 28| issue = 4| pages = 237–257| date = October 1935| doi=10.1017/s0017816000023026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposition that a ''numinous presence'' in the natural world supposed in the earliest layers of [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] religion, as it were an "[[animism|animistic]]" element left over in historical Roman religion and especially in the etymology of Latin theonyms, has often been popularly implied, but was criticised as "mostly a scholarly fiction" by McGeough (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McGeough ''The Romans: new perspectives'' 2004:179 "Numinous Forces and Other scholarly Inventions"; "Scholars may have to content themselves with nodes of meanings for the Italic gods rather than hard-and-fast definitions," observes Charles Robert Phillips III, in "A Note on Vergil's Aeneid 5, 744," ''Hermes'' '''104'''.2 (1976:247–249) p. 248, with recent bibliography; Gerhard Radke's classification of the forms and significances of these multifarious names in ''Die Götter Altitaliens'' (Münster, 1965) was criticized as "unwarranted precision" in the review by A. Drummond in ''The Classical Review'', New Series, '''21'''.2 (June 1971:239–241); the coupling and uncoupling of Latin and Italic [[cognomen|cognomina]] of the gods, creating the appearance of a multitude of deities, were classically dissected in Jesse Benedictus Carter, ''De Deorum Romanorum Cognominibus: Quaestiones Selectae'' (Leipzig, 1898).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numina and specific religions==
The phrase "numen eris caeloque redux mirabere regna" appears on line 129 of the poem ''Metrum in Genesin'',&lt;ref name="KreuzPseudo-Hilary2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gottfried Kreuz|author2=Pseudo-Hilary|title=Pseudo-Hilarius Metrum in Genesin, Carmen de Evangelio: Einleitung, Text und Kommentar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaEXAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|isbn=978-3-7001-3790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to [[Hilary of Arles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pavlovskis|first=Zoja|title=The Pastoral World of Hilarius' "in Genesin"|journal = The Classical Journal|volume = 85| issue = 2| pages = 121–132| date = December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{In popular culture|date=May 2017}}
In modern times, the term (referring to the Christian God) has been used in various expressions:

'''Petro Tronko''' (12 July 1915 - 12 September 2011) was a Ukrainian academician of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] and veteran of [[World War II]].

He was a head of editorial collegium for the 26 volume encyclopedia on "[[The History of Cities and Villages of the Ukrainian SSR]].

Born during [[World War I]] in 1915 to peasant family in [[Sloboda Ukraine]], Tronko started to work in 1932 in mines of [[Dzerzhynsk, Ukraine|Dzerzhynsk]] city in [[Donbas]]. Eventually after finishing some teacher classes, he worked as teacher of social sciences and Ukrainian language in village school of [[Bohodukhiv Raion]] and director of Lebedyn children home. Since 1937 he worked in [[Komsomol]] and in 1939 joined the [[Communist Party of Soviet Union]].

In 1939 Tronko was a member of Western Ukrainian People's Assembly that voted in for the [[Western Ukraine]] to join the [[Ukrainian SSR]].
During [[World War II]] he was a member of the South-western, Stalingrad, Southern, 4th Ukrainian fronts, participated in defense of Kiev and Stalingrad and later in liberation of Rostov, Donbas, Left-bank Ukraine, and Kiev. One of the first, Tronko entered the liberated Kiev on 6 November 1943 as a major and appointed the first secretary of the city and regional [[Komsomol of Ukraine|Komsomol]] organization. In 1947 he was dismissed from the position due to accusations of [[Lazar Kaganovich]] in "nationalistic perversions".

His dismissal from Komsomol work, Tronko used for education and in 1948 he graduated from the Historical faculty of Kiev University. The same year Tronko enrolled into [[aspirantura]] of the Academy of Social Sciences (today &amp;ndash; [[Russian Academy of State Service]]) of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] defending his dissertation in three years.

In 1951-60 Tronko worked for the Kiev regional committee of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] and in 1960-61 he headed the department of propaganda and ideological agitation for the party. During the next 17 years (1961–78) Tronko worked as a Deputy Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR]] taking care of matters on culture, education, healthcare, press, book publishing, cinema, radio and television broadcasting, social sciences and archives. He was a member of [[Verkhovna Rada]] for nine convocations.

In 1968 Tronko defended his doctorate dissertation "Ukrainian people in fight against Hitlerites occupiers during the Great Patriotic War (1941-45)".

In 1969 Tronko initiated the creation of [[Pyrohiv]] scansen that was opened in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141129085620/http://all-kyiv.com/en/varto-vidvidati/pamyatki/muzeyi/muzej-narodnoj-arxitekturyi-i-byita-pirogovo.html Pyrohiv museum of folk architecture and life of Ukraine].

'''Poporo''' is a device used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] cultures in present and [[pre-Columbian]] [[South America]] for storage of small amounts of [[lime (mineral)|lime]].  It consists of two pieces:  the receptacle, and the lid which includes a pin that is used to carry the lime to the mouth while chewing [[coca]] leaves.  Since the chewing of coca is sacred for the indigenous people, the poporos are also attributed with mystical powers and social status.

In Colombia, poporos are found in archeological remains from the [[Chibcha]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], and [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]] cultures among others. The materials used in the early periods are mainly [[pottery]] and carved stone.  In classic periods [[gold]] and [[tumbaga]] are the most frequent: an example of this is the [[Poporo Quimbaya]] exhibited in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]] which is a national symbol.  At the present time, the indigenous people of [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] still use poporos made with the dried fruits of a plant of genus [[cucurbita]] (totumo), in the traditional way.

==Poporo Quimbaya==
One particularly famous poporo, the Poporo Quimbaya, is a [[pre-Colombian]] artpiece of the classic [[Quimbaya civilization|quimbaya]] period, currently exhibited in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]] in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. Its primary use was as a ceremonial device for chewing of [[coca]] leaves during religious ceremonies.  It was made around 300 CE with a [[lost-wax casting]] process.

It is believed that the artpiece was stolen from a [[burial chamber]] in the early 1930s, on Loma del Pajarito ("Birdie Hill") near [[Yarumal]] in the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] department, where, at the time, the [[grave robbing]] of indigenous  tombs was very common, often ending with destruction of important archeological pieces in order to extract the gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/esp/o_quim_O0001509.htm "Quimbaya Poporo."] ''Museo del Oro.'' Retrieved 15 Jan 2011. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 the Banco de la República (Colombian Central Bank and owner/operator of the Gold Museum in Bogotá), purchased the poporo, in an effort to preserve it from destruction. This began a larger project of preservation of pre-Colombian [[Goldsmith|goldwork]] that allowed the creation of [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]].

The Poporo Quimbaya is an unusual piece, made of [[tumbaga]], with oddly [[minimalism|minimalistic]] lines, that give it a modern look.   It is one of the most recognized pre-Colombian artpieces, being often used as a symbol of the indigenous pre-Colombian culture.  It has been depicted in the Colombian currency, in coins and bills.

The '''Raoued operation''' (''{{lang-fr|Operation de Raoued}}'') was an anti-terrorist operation that was conducted in February 2014 in [[Raoued]], Tunisia against [[Salafist]] extremists.

==Operation==
On 3 February 2014, the Tunisian police were informed of the presence of armed jihadists in the city of Raoued, located in the suburbs of [[Tunis]].&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/international/tunisie-huit-morts-dont-un-gendarme-dans-un-assaut-anti-terroriste-pres-de-tunis-04-02-2014-3559045.php « Opération anti-terroriste en Tunisie : huit morts, dont l'assassin présumé de Belaïd », ''Le Parisien'', 4 février 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;.

More than 150 men from the [[Tunisian National Guard|National Guard]] were sent in the afternoon to surround a house where [[Salafi jihadism|Salafist]] fighters were located, while all the roads leading to the city were blocked. In the following hours and until the following day, several firefights broke out between the jihadists and the National Guards. After being dislodged from one house, the Salafists took refuge in a second. Finally, on 4 February at midday, the National Guards launched an assault that defeated the besieged.&lt;ref name="RFI2"&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20140204-tunisie-fin-affrontements-meurtriers-raoued-tunis-police-terrorisme-transition-constitution « Tunisie : fin des affrontements meurtriers à Raoued », ''Radio France internationale'', 4 février 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20140204-tunisie-affrontements-entre-policiers-islamistes-banlieue-tunis?ns_campaign=google_choix_redactions&amp;ns_mchannel=editors_picks&amp;ns_source=google_actualite&amp;ns_linkname=afrique.20140204-tunisie-affrontements-entre-policiers-islamistes-banlieue-tunis&amp;ns_fee=0 « Tunisie : affrontements entre policiers et islamistes dans la banlieue de Tunis », ''Radio France internationale'', 4 février 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casualties ==
According to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Tunisia)|Ministry of the Interior]], seven terrorists were killed in the fight and another was taken prisoner. A National Guard member was also killed - 29-year-old Atef Jabri and sergeant of the special brigade - and another wounded.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[http://www.babnet.net/cadredetail-79326.asp « Tunisie : Un sergent de la Garde nationale et six terroristes tués lors de l'opération sécuritaire à Raoued (source sécuritaire) », ''Babnet'', 4 février 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20140204-tunisie-autorites-annoncent-mort-kamel-gadhgadhi-assassin-presume-chokri-belaid « Tunisie: les autorités annoncent la mort de Kamel Gadhgadhi, assassin présumé de Chokri Belaïd », ''Radio France internationale'', 4 février 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the jihadists killed was Kamel Gadhgadhi, a leader of [[Ansar al-Sharia]], suspected of the February 2013 assassination of [[Chokri Belaid]], and a participant in the [[Battle of Chaambi]].

Three other dead were quickly identified: Mohamed Naceur Dridi, Haykel Badr, and Alaeddine Najahi. In addition to Kamel Gadhgadhi, among the dead would be two other people - Alaeddine Ben Abdelwaheb Njahi said "Abu Haydar" and Ali Ben Mustapha Ben Saad Kala - who allegedly took part in the mutilation of Tunisian soldiers killed during the Battle of Chaambi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessnews.com.tn/lotfi-ben-jeddou--la-mort-de-gadhgadhi-est-le-meilleur-cadeau-pour-la-famille-de-belaid-video,520,44054,3 Sarra Hlaoui, « Lotfi Ben Jeddou : la mort de Gadhgadhi est le meilleur cadeau pour la famille de Belaïd », ''Business News'', 4 février 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regency reenactment''' is [[historical reenactment]] of the [[British Regency]] period. Groups portray the period from 1811 to 1820 through costume, manners, food, and social gatherings that celebrate the spirit of the era. Groups often include a mix of [[Jane Austen]] fans, English country and Regency dancers, historical reenactors, costumers, artisans, craftsfolk, regency romance readers, and history buffs. Their websites and newsletters are designed to teach members about Regency history, politics, and literature. Many groups provide extensive bibliographies so that group members can research the era on their own. Events and activities include period balls, entertainments, parties, teas, craft workshops, readings, movie marathons, costume sewing classes, dance classes, meals and picnics using Regency recipes, old-fashioned games, and discussions centered on a period theme. The dress code is always Regency-themed and group members are encouraged to make their own costumes or to purchase or rent the clothes.

The following quote, consisting of a question and answer, and taken from a 2003 SF Gate interview with a reenactment group, discusses why people are attracted to history-themed events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Question: These Balls are about far more than dancing aren’t they?

Answer: Certainly, yes. As enjoyable as period music and dance can be we also like to add in skits, singing, historic speeches and interpretations and reenactments of actual events depending on the time period and theme of any given Ball.

Beyond history, it is also very important to me that these events provide an opportunity for families to come together in a wholesome atmosphere for some good old-fashioned joy and excitement which everyone can feel comfortable participating in. The multi-generational aspect is enjoyable as well and is another example of something good from the historic culture of previous times which has been lost along the way. Various age groups interact at our Balls who normally would have little if any contact in modern “age-segregated” social settings.

Together, reconnecting folks with their heritage, providing wholesome activities for families and creating a venue for respect, manners and higher culture make up the three main thrusts of ''We Make History''. They are our raison d’etre.'' - *[http://www.wemakehistory.com/SFInterview.htm 2003 SF Gate Interview with a Comtesse” and Mr. Scott H. of Scottsdale, Arizona; founder of “We Make History.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Rhys Llywelyn Isaac''' (20 November 1937 in [[Cape Town, South Africa]] – 6 October 2010 in [[Blairgowrie, Victoria]], Australia)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vagazette.com/articles/2010/10/09/obituaries/doc4cafc4764440c958272427.txt The Virginia Gazette, 10 October 2010]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a South African-born Australian historian of American history who also worked in the United States.

[[File:Small picture of Rhys with book 1983.jpg|thumb| Rhys Isaac with book 1983]]

Isaac and his twin brother [[Glynn Isaac|Glynn]] were born in South Africa to William Edwyn Isaac and [[Frances Margaret Leighton]], both professional botanists.

Isaac earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the [[University of Cape Town]].  In 1959 he was the Cape Province Rhodes Scholar at [[Balliol College]] (Oxford), earning his Ph.D. in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BIdEedwsbcEC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=rhys+llywelyn+isaac+born&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HKtry7DYmv&amp;sig=6Czt5UEkszUJJgFPnln9c-ZM7DU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0jehVYGsFYPcoAS2zZqIAw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rhys%20llywelyn%20isaac%20born&amp;f=false books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 Isaac emigrated to [[Australia]], where he taught at the [[University of Melbourne]], and later at [[La Trobe University]] (1971–91), where he was Emeritus Professor of American History.  In 1975 he was a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Early American History at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].

Isaac won the 1983 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for History for his book ''[[The Transformation of Virginia, 1740-1790]]'' (1982), becoming the first and only Australian historian to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]].

In 2004 Isaac published ''Landon Carter's Uneasy Kingdom: Revolution and Rebellion on a Virginia Plantation'', which made use of the exemplary diary of a Virginian landholder and member of the [[House of Burgesses]].

==Death==
Isaac died at his home in [[Blairgowrie, Victoria]], Australia, on 6 October 2010, aged 72, from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wm.edu/news/announcements/archive/2010/former-history-professor-rhys-isaac-dead-at-72.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented allegations of the existence of "web brigades" appear to be in the April 2003 Vestnik Online article "The Virtual Eye of [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]" by [[French people|French]] journalist Anna Polyanskaya (a former assistant to assassinated [[Russians|Russian]] politician [[Galina Starovoitova]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2003/0611/win/polyanskaya.htm "They are killing Galina Starovoitova for the second time"], by Anna Polyansky&lt;/ref&gt;) and two other authors, Andrey Krivov and Ivan Lomako. The authors claim that up to 1998, contributions to forums on Russian Internet sites ([[Runet]]) predominantly reflected [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[democratic values|democratic]] values, but after 2000, the vast majority of contributions reflected [[totalitarian]] values. This sudden change was attributed to the appearance of teams of pro-Russian commenters who appeared to be organized by the [[FSB (Russia)|Russian state security service]].&lt;ref name="Polyanskaya"&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2003/0430/win/polyanskaya_krivov_lomko.htm ''Virtual Eye of the Big Brother''] by Anna Polyanskaya, Andrei Krivov, and Ivan Lomko, Vestnik online, April 30, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestnik.com/eng/index.html |title=Russian-American Russian Language biweekly magazine "Vestnik": Main Page [English&amp;#93; |publisher=Vestnik.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vestnik online, April 30, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bagryansky"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.library.cjes.ru/online/?a=con&amp;b_id=318 ''Eye for an eye''] by [[Grigory Svirsky]] and Vladimur Bagryansky, publication of the Russian Center for Extreme Journalism [http://www.cjes.ru/]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the authors, about 70% of Russian Internet posters were of generally liberal views prior to 1998–1999, while a surge of "antidemocratic" posts (about 60–80%) suddenly occurred at many Russian forums in 2000. This could also be a reflection to the fact that access to Internet among the general Russian population soared during this time, which was until then accessible only to some sections of the society.

In January 2012, a [[hacktivist]] group calling itself the Russian arm of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] published a massive collection of email allegedly belonging to former and present leaders of the pro-Kremlin youth organization [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]] (including a number of government officials).&lt;ref name="guardian-hacked-emails"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/putin-hacked-emails-russian-nashi|title=Polishing Putin: hacked emails suggest dirty tricks by Russian youth group|author=Miriam Elder|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists who investigated the leaked information found that the pro-Kremlin movement had engaged in a range of activities including paying commentators to post content and hijacking blog ratings in the fall of 2011.&lt;ref name="kremlinBlogshop"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1868022 "Kremlin's Blogshop"] by Anastasia Karimova. Kommersant Dengi, February 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freedom-net-2013"/&gt; The e-mails indicated that members of the "brigades" were paid 85 rubles (about US$3) or more per comment, depending on whether the comment received replies. Some were paid as much as 600,000 roubles (about US$21,000) for leaving hundreds of comments on negative press articles on the internet, and were presented with iPads. A number of high-profile bloggers were also mentioned as being paid for promoting Nashi and government activities. The Federal Youth Agency, whose head (and the former leader of Nashi) [[Vasily Yakemenko]] was the highest-ranking individual targeted by the leaks, refused to comment on authenticity of the e-mails.&lt;ref name="guardian-hacked-emails"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://izvestia.ru/news/514901 "Kommersant Director General Files Complain against Nashi Spokesperson"]. Izvestia, February 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a [[Freedom House]] report stated that 22 of 60 countries examined have been using paid pro-government commentators to manipulate online discussions, and that Russia has been at the forefront of this practice for several years, along with China and Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202013%20Summary%20of%20Findings.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="propaganda-army"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/russias-online-comment-propaganda-army/280432/ Russia's Online-Comment Propaganda Army], ''The Atlantic'', by Olga Khazan, 9 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, Russian reporters investigated the St. Petersburg [[Internet Research Agency]], which employs at least 400 people. They found that the agency covertly hired young people as "Internet operators" paid to write pro-Kremlin postings and comments, smearing opposition leader [[Alexei Navalny]] and U.S. politics and culture.&lt;ref name="OperationPetersburg"&gt;[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=100&amp;story_id=38052 "Internet Troll Operation Uncovered in St. Petersburg"], ''The St. Petersburg Times'', by Sergey Chernov, 18, September,2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trollArmy"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31962644 Ukraine conflict: Inside Russia's 'Kremlin troll army'], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Further investigations were performed by Russian opposition newspaper ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' and [[Institute of Modern Russia]] in 2014–15, inspired by the peak of activity of the pro-Russian brigades during the [[War in Donbass|Ukrainian conflict]] and [[assassination of Boris Nemtsov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpretermag.com/the-menace-of-unreality-how-the-kremlin-weaponizes-information-culture-and-money/ |title=The Menace of Unreality: How the Kremlin Weaponizes Information, Culture and Money |work=The Interpreter Magazine |date=2014-11-22 |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america |title=Documents Show How Russia’s Troll Army Hit America |publisher=BuzzFeed |date=2014-07-08 |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-update-march-12-2015/#7432 |title=Novaya Gazeta Publishes List of Kremlin Trolls, Finds Further Information About 'Troll Farm' |work=The Interpreter Magazine |date=2015-03-06 |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rferl.org/content/how-to-guide-russian-trolling-trolls/26919999.html | title=One Professional Russian Troll Tells All | publisher=Radio Liberty | date=2015-03-26 | accessdate=2015-03-26 | author=Dmitry Volchek, Daisy Sindelar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort of using "troll armies" to promote Putin's policies is reported to be a multimillion-dollar operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sindelar |first=Daisy |date=12 August 2014 |title=The Kremlin's Troll Army |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-kremlins-troll-army/375932/ |journal=The Atlantic |location=United States |publisher=Atlantic Media |access-date=6 June 2015 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america#.ghvY0zarp |title=Documents Show How Russia’s Troll Army Hit America |last=Seddon |first=Max |date=2 June 2014 |website=BuzzFeed |access-date=5 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an investigation by the British ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper, the flood of pro-Russian comments is part of a coordinated "informational-psychological war operation".&lt;ref name="Guardian20150409"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/09/kremlin-hall-of-mirrors-military-information-psychology | title=Inside the Kremlin’s hall of mirrors | publisher=The Guardian | date=2015-04-09 | accessdate=2015-04-11 |last=Pomerantsev|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Pomerantsev}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Twitter]] bot network was documented to use more than 20,500 fake Twitter accounts to spam negative comments after the death of Boris Nemtsov and events related to the Ukrainian conflict.&lt;ref name="AL20150403"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/04/02/analyzing-kremlin-twitter-bots/ | title=Social Network Analysis Reveals Full Scale of Kremlin's Twitter Bot Campaign | publisher=Global Voices Online | date=April 2, 2015| accessdate=April 13, 2015 | author=Lawrence Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = #KremlinTrolls and Other Acquaintances of RU EMB Canada|url = http://kremlintrolls.com/t/20150907-canada_plus.html|website = kremlintrolls.com|accessdate = September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article based on the original Polyanskaya article, authored by the Independent Customers' Association, was published in May 2008 at Expertiza.Ru. In this article the term ''web brigades'' is replaced by the term ''Team "G"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expertiza.ru/expertiza.phtml?id=671 Team "G" (How to unveil agents of siloviks at popular forums in the Internet)], May 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/article/russia-theme/the-kremlins-virtual-squad|title=The Kremlin's virtual squad|work=openDemocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Web brigades commentators sometimes leave hundreds of postings a day that criticize the country's opposition and promote Kremlin-backed policymakers.&lt;ref name="freedom-net-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2013/russia|title=Russia - Country report - Freedom on the Net - 2013|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="propaganda-army"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OperationPetersburg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trollArmy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freedom-net-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2014/russia|title=Russia - Country report - Freedom on the Net - 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buzzfeed"&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america Documents Show How Russia’s Troll Army Hit America], buzzfeed&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators simultaneously react to discussions of "taboo" topics, including the historical role of Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], political opposition, dissidents such as [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], murdered journalists, and cases of international conflict or rivalry (with countries such as [[Estonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and Ukraine, but also with the foreign policies of the United States and the [[European Union]]).&lt;ref name="freedom-net-2013"/&gt; Prominent journalist and Russia expert [[Peter Pomerantsev]] believes Russia's efforts are aimed at confusing the audience, rather than convincing it. He states that they cannot censor information but can "trash it with conspiracy theories and rumours".&lt;ref name="trollArmy"/&gt;

To avert suspicions, the users sandwich political remarks between neutral articles on travelling, cooking and pets.&lt;ref name="trollArmy"/&gt; They overwhelm comment sections of media to render meaningful dialogue impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/04/pro-russia-trolls-ukraine-guardian-online The readers' editor on… pro-Russia trolling below the line on Ukraine stories], the Guardian, 4 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/putin-s-g20-snub/511377.html Putin's G20 Snub], The Moscow Times, Nov. 18 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The effect created by such Internet trolls is not very big, but they manage to make certain forums meaningless because people stop commenting on the articles when these trolls sit there and constantly create an aggressive, hostile atmosphere toward those whom they don’t like.

A collection of leaked documents, published by Moy Rayon, suggests that work at the "troll den" is strictly regulated by a set of guidelines. Any blog post written by an agency employee, according to the leaked files, must contain "no fewer than 700 characters" during day shifts and "no fewer than 1,000 characters" on night shifts. Use of graphics and keywords in the post's body and headline is also mandatory. In addition to general guidelines, bloggers are also provided with "technical tasks" – keywords and talking points on specific issues, such as Ukraine, Russia's internal opposition and relations with the West.&lt;ref name="trollArmy"/&gt; On an average working day, the workers are to post on news articles 50 times. Each blogger is to maintain six Facebook accounts publishing at least three posts a day and discussing the news in groups at least twice a day. By the end of the first month, they are expected to have won 500 subscribers and get at least five posts on each item a day. On Twitter, the bloggers are expected to manage 10 accounts with up to 2,000 followers and tweet 50 times a day.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed"/&gt;

In 2015, Lawrence Alexander disclosed a network of propaganda websites sharing the same Google Analytics identifier and domain registration details, allegedly run by Nikita Podgorny from Internet Research Agency. The websites were mostly [[internet meme|meme]] repositories focused on attacking Ukraine, [[Euromaidan]], Russian opposition and Western policies. Other websites from this cluster promoted president Putin and Russian nationalism, and spread alleged news from Syria presenting anti-Western and pro-[[Bashar al-Assad]] viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kremlin-trolls-burned-across-the-internet-as-washington-debated-options/2017/12/23/e7b9dc92-e403-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html|title=Kremlin trolls burned across the Internet as Washington debated options|first1=Adam|last1=Entous|first2=Ellen|last2=Nakashima|first3=Greg|last3=Jaffe|date=25 December 2017|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Open-Source Information Reveals Pro-Kremlin Web Campaign|url = http://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/07/13/open-source-information-reveals-pro-kremlin-web-campaign/|website = Global Voices|accessdate = 2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Russian researchers correlated Google search statistics of specific phrases with their geographic origin, observing increases in specific politically loaded phrases (such as "Poroshenko", "Maidan", "sanctions") starting from 2013 and originating from very small, peripheral locations in Russia, such as Olgino, which also happens to be the headquarters of the [[Internet Research Agency]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google выдал логово кремлевских троллей|url = http://www.stopfake.org/google-vydal-logovo-kremlevskih-trollej/|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  Internet Research Agency also appears to be the primary sponsor of an anti-Western exhibition [[Material Evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stopfake.org/en/emails-link-kremlin-troll-farm-to-bizarre-new-york-photography-exhibit/ | title=Emails Link Kremlin Troll Farm to Bizarre New York Photography Exhibit | publisher=StopFake.org | date=August 20, 2015 | access-date=September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salman Hamud Falach''' (16 February 1935 – 12 August 2016), was an educator, writer, and a history researcher who established the Druze Scouts movement in Israel. He was a supervisor on the Druze Education department and a vice president of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Falach wrote more than 80 books in Arabic, Hebrew and English about history and education. As a teenager he moved to Haifa city, where he graduated secondary school at the Hebrew Reali School&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Reali_School|title=Hebrew Reali School|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1954.
After graduating his studies for the first and second degree (1963), he fulfilled his PHD at Princeton University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University|title=Princeton University|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the USA (1997). Dr. Salman Hamud Falach implemented the legacy of the druze studies as an integral part of the higher education curriculum.
In 2017 the Centre of the Druze Legacy was established in his name in his native village [[:he:כסרא-סמיע|Kisra-Smea]].

==Biography==
The family tree of the Falach family is connected to the Shahin family who immigrated to Smeav village in 1711. The family name was changed to Falach which includes four home family names: Fandy, Joseph, Said and Ali.

Fandy Falach, the grandfather of Salman was on the one hand an autodidact, and broad minded and on the other hand a merchant who successfully coped with the Ottoman government.
His son Hamud, who was Salman's father, was a religious man who earned his living from agriculture, raising tobacco and raising goats and sheep. His mother Hizna used to nurse ill people and supported their families. The family included four children: Fares, Salman, Fatma and Temima. 
`										
Salman studied at Pikiin village in the elementary school and continued at Tera Santa School in Nazareth. In 1953 he began his studies at The Hebrew Reali School Haifa.
The mayor of Haifa (1955), Abba Hushi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aba_Hushi|title=Abba Hushi|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; i took an interest and followed after the first Druze&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze_in_Israel|title=Druze|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; student in the Reali School.
After graduating high school in 1955, Salman was refused as a volunteer the army service and only after his first academic degree was he called as a lecturer to the reserve forces during 19 years.

Later, Salman married Kamilia, they have six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Legacy|last=Falach|first=Salman|publisher=Pardes|year=2015|isbn=|location=Haifa Israel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education, society, higher education and public activity ==
[[File:Falch family.jpg|thumb|Salman, his father Hamud and his brother Fares]]
While studying for the BA at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem|title=The Hebrew University in Jerusalem|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1957-1959), Salman worked as a teacher at Beit Zafafa.

In 1959, Falach worked as a parliamentary correspondent at the Israeli Parlament representing El-Yum newspaper, later, he enlarged his activity as radio correspondent of Kol Israel in Arabic. 
He was a member of the organization named "Tolerance" working towards tolerance in the Israeli society, a member of the Druze community Center and a member of the board at the high school in Yarka.

After the six day war in 1967 he was nominated as an inspector general general for Arab Education in Israel and developed curriculum for schools in the west bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza strip and Golan Heights.

In 1975 Falach was dominated as a chairman of the Druze Education and Culture executive committee in the government office. He continued this role up to 2000 when he retired.

The main achievement by Falach was a separation between the Arab and the Druze curriculum, which created an independent educational system for the Druze sector.

Falach established the Druze scouts on 1954 with his teacher at the Reali school Arie Chroch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Scouts_Movement_in_Israel|title=Arie Chroch|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The president of Israel Izchak Ben Zvi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_Ben_Zvi|title=Izchak Ben Zvi|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; greeted him by joining the Druze Scouts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze_Scouts_Association|title=Druze Scouts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Israeli Scouts. 
Sheik Amin Tarif&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amin_Tarif|title=Cheik Amin Tarif|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported this initiative and the first scouts troops was established in Smea village. Later there were other Druze troops in the Druze villages. The activity of those troops was a cultural breaking point among the new generation for enlarging new horizons beyond the village and the group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8506">The '''Société des Antiquaires de France''' (Society of Antiquaries of France) is a Parisian  historical and archaeological society, founded in 1804 under the name of the '''Académie celtique''' (Celtic Academy).  It is now based at the [[Louvre]], in the pavillon Mollien.

== History ==
The Académie celtique was founded by prefect [[Jacques Cambry]], [[Jacques-Antoine Dulaure]] and [[Jacques Le Brigant]] on 9 [[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|germinal]] Year XII (30 March 1804), with the goal of studying [[Gaul|Gallic]] civilization and French history and archaeology.  Cambry was its first president, until his death in 1807.  In 1813 it changed its name to the Société des Antiquaires de France, after the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], and from 1814 to 1848 it changed again to the '''Société royale des antiquaires de France''' under the [[Bourbon Restoration]].  According to the regime in France, it was then called the '''Société impériale des antiquaires de France''' or '''Société nationale des antiquaires de France''', but it re-assumed its present name in 1871, and has not changed it since.

Since its foundation it has published a collection of ''[[Mémoire]]s'', and of ''Bulletins'', as well as an annual directory of its members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="850">The '''Speculative Period''' (1492a.-1840a.) was a term created by [[Gordon Willey]] and Sabloff (1993:12-37) to describe the [[archaeological]] methods and approaches employed in [[North America]] at the time.  All the data during this time was based mainly on the notes from accounts from explorers and missionaries.  It was very primitive compared with modern archaeological methods.  A major problem with using the accounts from explorers and missionaries in North America was how they labeled the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] as one group because of the lack of visual physical differences.

1748: Italian mathematician [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi|Maria Agnesi]] published the first book discussing both differential and integral calculus, called ''Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventù italiana''.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Dirk Jan Struik]], Agnesi is "the first important woman mathematician since [[Hypatia of Alexandria|Hypatia]] (fifth century A.D.)".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="epigenesys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epigenesys.eu/index.php/en/science-and-you/women-in-science/665-maria-gaetana-agnesi|title=Epigenesys - Maria Gaetana Agnesi &amp;#124; Women in science|publisher=epigenesys.eu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1759: French mathematician [[Émilie du Châtelet]]'s translation and commentary on Isaac Newton's work ''Principia Mathematica'' was published posthumously; it is still considered the standard French translation.&lt;ref name="brooklynmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/emilie_du_chatelet.php|title=Brooklyn Museum: Elizabeth A.

1827: French mathematician [[Sophie Germain]] saw her theorem, known as [[Sophie Germain's theorem|Germain's Theorem]], published in a footnote of a book by the mathematician [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]].&lt;ref name="agnesscott.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/germain.htm|title=Sophie Germain|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rochester"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/UGpages/sophie.html|title=Sophie Germain page|publisher=math.rochester.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theorem Germain proved that if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are integers and if ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; then either ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' must be divisible by&amp;nbsp;5. Germain's theorem was a major step toward proving [[Fermat's last theorem]] for the case where n equals 5.&lt;ref name="agnesscott.edu"/&gt;

1913: American mathematician [[Mildred Sanderson]] published her theorem about modular invariants in her thesis. It states: “To any modular invariant i of a system of forms under any group G of linear transformations with coefficients in the GF[pn], there corresponds a formal invariant I under G such that I = i for all sets of values in the field of the coefficients of the system of forms.” She was [[Leonard Dickson]]’s first female graduate student, and he later wrote of her thesis, “This paper is a highly important contribution to this field of work; its importance lies partly in the fact that it establishes a correspondence between modular and formal invariants. Her main theorem has already been frequently quoted on account of its fundamental character. Her proof is a remarkable piece of mathematics.” [[E.T. Bell]] wrote, “Miss Sanderson’s single contribution (1913) to modular invariants has been rated by competent judges as one of the classics of the subject.”&lt;ref name="agnesscott2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/sander.htm|title=Mildred Leonora Sanderson|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Virginalist''' denotes a composer of the so-called virginalist school, and usually refers to the English [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] composers of the late [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and early [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods. The term does not appear to have been applied earlier than the 19th century. Although the [[virginals]] was among the most popular keyboard instruments of this period, there is no evidence that the composers wrote exclusively for this instrument, and their music is equally suited to the [[harpsichord]], the [[clavichord]] or the [[Organ (music)#Chamber organs|chamber organ]].

The term is sometimes also applied to other northern European composers of this period, such as [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck]] and [[Samuel Scheidt]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">'''Vladimir Nevezhin''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Александрович Невежин}}) is a [[Russians|Russian]] historian (''Doctor of History Sciences''), is working as a professor in [[Moscow]], chief scientific collaborator at the ''Institute of Russian History'' (of the [[Russian Academy of Science]]) and member of the editorial board of the journal ''Отечественная история'' (''History of the Fatherland'').

During the 1990s, he took part in the discussion and dispute over the pre-history of the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Nevezhin has analysed the content of Stalin's speeches, propagandistic directives in spring 1941 and notes of the contemporaries, drawing conclusions that the numerous documents unambiguously expressed the preparations of the country for an offensive in 1941.

'''Women of Rock Oral History Project''' is an oral history project based at [[Smith College]] focusing on American women and [[gender non-conformance|gender non-conforming]], [[LGBT]], and [[feminism|feminist]] [[rock and roll]] and [[punk music]] musicians from the 1970s to the present.&lt;ref name=FeministMag-WomenOfRock-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jasmine|first1=Lucretia Tye|last2=Pearson|first2=Tanya|title=FM Jan 10: SafetyPin Box / GameChangers / Women of Rock|url=http://feministmagazine.org/2017/01/fm-jan-10/|work=Feminist Magazine|date=9 January 2017|format=Radio show}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FeministMag-WomenOfRock-Audio-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jasmine|first1=Lucretia Tye|last2=Pearson|first2=Tanya|title=FM Jan 10: SafetyPin Box / GameChangers / Women of Rock|url=http://archive.kpfk.org/mp3/kpfk_170110_150050femmag.MP3|work=Feminist Magazine|date=9 January 2017|format=Audio|quote=Starts at 33:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith-RedressingRockHistory-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hobbes|first1=M|title=Redressing Rock History: Tanya Pearson ‘AC Creates ‘Women of Rock’ Collection at Smith|url=https://www.smith.edu/news/redressing-rock-history/|work=Grécourt Gate, [[Smith College]]|date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Women of Rock Oral History project was started in December 2014 as a collection of digital video interviews conducted by [[Smith College]] [[Ada Comstock]] scholar and archivist, Tanya Pearson.&lt;ref name=WomenOfRockOralHistoryProject-FindingAid-2014&gt;{{cite news|title=Women of Rock Oral History Project oral histories, 2014-2017 (MS 756)|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss590.html|work=[[Smith College]]|date=2014|format=Finding aid}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The inspiration for the project came from a seminar on [[censorship]] in the United States Pearson took while at [[Smith College|Smith]], where she worked as an assistant archivist at the Sophia Smith Collection while completing an undergraduate degree in American Studies with concentrations in oral history and archives. For the seminar, Pearson wrote about women rockers from the 1990s. During the process she was discouraged at the difficulty of finding widely available information about musicians she needed to find source material on, illustrating the fact that bands like [[L7 (band)|L7]] were not covered in detail in rock and roll history.&lt;ref name=Smith-RedressingRockHistory-2015 /&gt; Thematic devices she saw seemed to devalue their music and their musicianship, where the musicians were subject to [[sexism]] and [[tokenism]], especially in popular journalism.&lt;ref name=HalfHoursOfPowerShow-Podcast&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pio|last2=Chelsie|last3=Pearson|first3=Tanya|title=THHOP: Women of Rock Oral History Project [2/11/2016]|url=https://soundcloud.com/oliomedia/womenofrock|website=The Half Hours Of Power Show|publisher=Olio Media|language=en|format=Podcast|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project highlights the limitations and bias within music scholarship and journalism.&lt;ref name=Vanyaland-Feature-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marotta|first1=Michael|title=Women of Rock Oral History Project aims to create equal representation in music's narrative|url=http://www.vanyaland.com/2016/03/01/women-of-rock-oral-history-project-aims-to-create-equal-representation-in-musics-narrative/|work=Vanyaland|date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the musicians were also active pre-internet, where press and coverage weren't available online and are not digitized.&lt;ref name=DailyHampshire-RightingTheWrongs-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willingham|first1=Leah|title=Women who rock: Sophia Smith Collection introduces first-ever oral-history project about female rock ‘n’ rollers|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/Archives/2015/09/womenrockers-hg-102215|work=[[Daily Hampshire Gazette]]|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project includes written transcripts and is housed at the Sophia Smith Collection at [[Smith College]].&lt;ref name=DailyHampshire-RightingTheWrongs-2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Preview-WomenOfRock-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drane|first1=Amanda|title=Rocking the Project: Tanya Pearson wants to acquaint you with the women who helped forge rock and roll|url=https://view.publitas.com/p222-4389/preview-april-2017/page/20-21|work=Preview Massachusetts|date=April 2017|pages=20-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of the project is to document the influence and history of women in rock and roll, and to bring focus to the unheralded role of women musicians.&lt;ref name=ValleyAdvocate-Feature-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drane|first1=Amanda|title=Women Rock: sexism and music go together like rock and roll|url=http://valleyadvocate.com/2016/01/25/women-rock/|work=[[Valley Advocate]]|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
The digital interviews with the musicians is the core focus of the project.&lt;ref name=HalfHoursOfPowerShow-Podcast /&gt; [[Nina Gordon]] and [[Louise Post]], who make up [[Veruca Salt]], were the first band and musicians that were interviewed. The interviews include biographies of their lives and their work as musicians. A portion of each interview includes what it was like to work as a musician in the time period that they were active as well as their experiences in the current day.&lt;ref name=DailyHampshire-RightingTheWrongs-2015 /&gt;

As a supplemental part of the project, the Women of Rock Oral History Project has conducted panels and roundtable discussions often with some of the subjects of the interviews to discuss issues of gender gap and challenges women face in the music industry.&lt;ref name=HalfHoursOfPowerShow-Podcast /&gt;&lt;ref name=RightingTheWrongsPanel-2015&gt;{{cite news|title=Righting the Wrongs of Rock History Panel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulHaCUuEDlQ|work=Women of Rock Oral History Project|date=22 October 2015|language=en|format=Video panel recording}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NEPR-RightingTheWrongsPanel-2015&gt;{{cite news|title=Righting the Wrongs of Rock History Panel|url=https://soundcloud.com/newenglandpublicradio/rightingthewrongsofrockhistorypanel|work=[[New England Public Radio]]|date=22 October 2015|language=en|format=Audio panel recording}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sophian-RightingTheWrongsPanel-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Going|first1=Eliza|title=Recognizing Women in Rock Music|url=http://www.thesmithsophian.com/recognizing-women-in-rock-music/|work=The Sophian|publisher=[[Smith College]]|date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClickWorkspace-PanelDiscussion-2016&gt;{{cite news|title=P L A T F O R M 5: Tanya Pearson // Sam Chaplin // Sara Smith|url=http://clickworkspace.org/events/2016/9/30/p-l-a-t-f-o-r-m-5-tanya-pearson-sam-chaplin-sara-smith|work=Click Workspace|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearson has also organized concerts, local shows, and events in support of the grassroots project, which often includes performances by subjects of the oral histories.&lt;ref name=SoundingOut-LePoissonRouge-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bad Cover Version|title=An Evening with Three Legendary Rebel Women at Le Poisson Rouge, January 27, 2017: Margot Olavarria, Bibbe Hansen, and Alice Bag|url=https://soundstudiesblog.com/2017/03/23/an-evening-with-three-legendary-rebel-women-at-le-poisson-rouge-january-27-2017-alice-bag-bibbe-hansen-and-margot-olavarria/|work=Sounding Out!|date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of these performances, another component of the project is addressing [[gender bias on Wikipedia]] and its coverage of women and [[gender non-conformance|gender non-conforming]] musicians by holding strategy discussions and Wikipedia editathons.&lt;ref name=ValleyAdvocate-WikiRant-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Will|title=Basemental: A Wikipedia Rant by Will|url=http://valleyadvocate.com/2017/11/20/basemental-a-wikipedia-rant-by-will/|work=[[Valley Advocate]]|date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===
The project has been funded by a Rosenthal Fund grant from [[Smith College]] and a [[Helen Gurley Brown]] Magic Grant awarded to Ada Comstock Scholars.&lt;ref name=Smith-RosenthalFund&gt;{{cite web|title=Smith College: Archives Concentration – The Rosenthal Fund|url=https://www.smith.edu/archives/rosenthal.php|website=[[Smith College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith-MagicGrant-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hobbes|first1=M|title=Two Smithies Awarded Magic Grants for Novel Oral History Projects|url=https://www.smith.edu/news/two-smithies-awarded-magic-grants-for-novel-oral-history-projects/|work=Grécourt Gate, [[Smith College]]|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The project includes over 20 underrepresented female musicians from various [[rock and roll]] and [[punk music]] bands that were active from the 1970s to 2010, with some musicians and bands still actively performing music. Bands are listed next to each subject below. Each musician participated in video interviews which were digitized and made available on [[Vimeo]]. There are over 29 videos that are part of the project.&lt;ref name=ValleyAdvocate-MissingWiki-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levesque|first1=Jennifer|title=Valley Show Girl: The Case of the Missing Wiki Edits|url=http://valleyadvocate.com/2017/11/13/the-case-of-the-missing-wiki-edits/|work=[[Valley Advocate]]|date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A corresponding transcription project corresponding to the videos is in process of being created.&lt;ref name=WomenOfRockOralHistoryProject-FindingAid-2014 /&gt;

The timeframe of the project is from December 2014 to the present.&lt;ref name=ValleyAdvocate-MissingWiki-2017 /&gt; The collection is ongoing, with additional video interviews being conducted.&lt;ref name=WomenOfRockOralHistoryProject-FindingAid-2014 /&gt; Pearson has said that the priority of subjects is on women musicians from the 1960s and 1970s, in an effort to capture their stories before their stories are lost.&lt;ref name=ValleyAdvocate-Feature-2016 /&gt; A book that focuses on the stories of pioneering women musicians in rock is planned.&lt;ref name=Smith-MagicGrant-2016 /&gt;

The '''World Archaeological Congress''' (WAC) is a non-governmental, not-for-profit organization which promotes world archaeology.  It is the only global archaeological organisation with elected representation.

Established in 1986, WAC holds an international Congress every four years to promote the exchange of results from archaeological research; professional training and public education for disadvantaged nations, groups and communities; the empowerment and betterment of Indigenous groups and [[First Nations peoples]]; and the conservation of archaeological sites.

==History==

The World Archaeological Congress was established in 1986, after the controversial 11th meeting of the [[International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences]] was banned from meeting in [[Southampton|Southampton, Great Britain]] during which the Southampton City Council and other organizations funding the meeting demanded that scholars from [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]] were banned from participation in view of [[Apartheid in South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golson|first=Jack|title=The World Archaeological Congress, Southampton, and its aftermath|journal=Australian Archaeology|year=1986|volume=23|url=http://blindio.library.uq.edu.au/ojs/index.php/aa/article/view/1582/0|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British organizers complied with this demand, but the Executive Committee of UISPP ultimately ruled that it was against the organization's constitution to exclude any international scholars, and withdrew the conference. The National Secretary of the Congress, [[Peter Ucko]], moved forward with the meeting under a new name, the World Archaeological Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gero|first=Joan|title=Why? And Whither? WAC|url=http://www.nps.gov/seac/gero.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting meeting drew in 1000 people from 100 countries, with the special attempt to include people from new nations and minority groups to participate in the congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golson|first=Jack|title=The World Archaeological Congress, Southampton, and its aftermath|journal=Australian Archaeology|year=1986|volume=23|url=http://blindio.library.uq.edu.au/ojs/index.php/aa/article/view/1582/0|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, WAC has "constituted itself as a uniquely representative non-profit organization of worldwide archaeology that recognizes the historical and social role, and the political context, of archaeology, and the need to make archaeological studies relevant to the wider community. It especially seeks to debate and refute institutionalized views that serve the interests of a privileged few to the detriment of disenfranchised others. WAC explicitly values diversity against institutionalized mechanisms that marginalize the cultural heritage of [[indigenous peoples]], [[minorities]] and the [[poverty|poor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gero|first=Joan|title=Why? And Whither? WAC|url=http://www.nps.gov/seac/gero.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congresses==

World Archaeological Congresses are held every four years, with several Inter-Congresses between the main congresses. The congresses vary in their seasonality, but present the opportunity to present research, participate in panels, and socialize with other members. Congresses have been held on six continents and attract large, multinational attendance. The locations of the congresses are chosen to encourage inclusivity within the means of people from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Peter. 2006. ‘All Smoke and Mirrors...’ The World Archaeological Congress 1986-2004, in A Future for Archaeology, eds. Layton, R. Shennan, S. and Stone, P. UCL Press, London. 41-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Locating congresses outside of 'First World' venues has led to political and social complications for WAC. For example, WAC-3 in India was besieged by media coverage after the then president of the international executive committee J. Golson banned discussion of the destruction of the [[Ayodhya dispute|Ayodhya mosque]] during the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Bernbeck, Reinhard and Pollock, Susan. 1996. Ayodhya, Archaeology, and Identity. Current Anthropology, Vol. 37, No. 1, Supplement: Special Issue: Anthropology in Public. S138-S142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrons for past Congresses have included [[Prince Charles]] (WAC-1), [[Nelson Mandela]] (WAC-4), [[Harriet Fulbright]] (WAC-5), and [[Abdullah II of Jordan]] (WAC-7)

==Protocols==

The World Archaeological Congress has produced ground-breaking [http://www.worldarchaeologicalcongress.org/about-wac/codes-of-ethics/167-codes-of-ethics Codes of Ethics] for the conduct of archaeologists. These include the Vermillion Accord on Human Remains which calls for respect for the dead and descendent communities and the Tamaki Makau-rau Accord on the Display of Human Remains and Sacred Objects which requires permission from community members before displaying human remains and artifacts.

==Global Libraries Program==
The [http://www.worldarchaeologicalcongress.org/activities/global-libraries/198-global-libraries-program Global Libraries Program] aims to develop the archaeological literary collections of economically-disadvantaged institutions. By supporting such libraries, we hope to assist archaeological and cultural heritage management students and professionals to undertake and excel at their study and work.
