'''The 2017-18 SAFA Second Division''' (known as the ABC Motsepe League for sponsorship reasons) was the 20th season of the [[SAFA Second Division]], the third tier for South African association football clubs, since its establishment in 1998. Due to the size of South Africa, the competition was split into nine divisions, one for each region. After the league stage of the regional competition was completed, the nine wining teams of each regional division entered the playoffs.

It was won by [[Maccabi F.C.]], who beat [[TS Sporting F.C.|TS Sporting]] 5-4 on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mysafa.net/2018/06/maccabi-crowned-abc-motsepe-league-champions/ |title=Maccabi crowned ABC Motsepe League champions |last=Mazibuko |first=Thabang |date=9 June 2018 |website=mysafa.net |access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams were promoted to the [[2018-19 National First Division]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.safa.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ABCMOTSEPEPlay-offsProgramme.pdf |title=2018 Motsepe League National Playoffs |website=safa.net |access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annfield Stadium''' was a football stadium in [[Stirling]], Scotland. The stadium was home to [[Stirling Albion F.C.]] until 1993 when it closed after Stirling Albion moved to [[Forthbank Stadium]].

==History==

Before [[World War II]], [[King's Park F.C.|King's Park]] was the [[Scottish Football League]] club based in Stirling, but their [[Forthbank Park]] ground was destroyed by the [[Luftwaffe]] during the war.&lt;ref name="Inglis313"&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1987|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than resurrect King's Park, a group of local businessmen led by coal merchant Tom Fergusson, decided to purchase the Annfield Estate.&lt;ref name = "Inglis313"/&gt; They formed new club called [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]]. Oak trees were cleared from the estate to lay a pitch and Albion trucks were used as viewing platforms until a stand was built.&lt;ref name="Inglis313"/&gt; Annfield opened on 1 August 1945 and the first game played at Annfield was Stirling Albion's tie with [[Edinburgh City F.C.|Edinburgh City]] on 18 August 1945, Stirling Albion won the game 8&amp;ndash;3.

The club constructed a main east stand in 1946 and rebuilt three years later, while a west stand was built in the early 1950s. The record attendance of 26,400 was set by a [[1958–59 Scottish Cup]] tie against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Soon after this, the club erected a roof over the northern terracing. It installed floodlights in 1961 and inaugurated with a friendly match against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in November. During this period, the Annfield House provided the dressing rooms and club offices. In 1974, these functions moved to a new block erected behind the east stand.&lt;ref name="Inglis313"/&gt;

Stirling Albion sold Annfield to [[Stirling Council]] in 1981 when it was on the verge bankruptcy. The club's only choice to avoid insolvency was selling the ground for £250,000 to the council and then renting it for £3,000 per annum. In April 1984, the council conducted a safety assessment that resulted in condemnation of parts of the east stand.&lt;ref name="Inglis313"/&gt; Stirling Council decided that it would only invest further public funds in Annfield if it were more accessible to the community.  This resulted in the installation of a [[synthetic turf|synthetic pitch]], which the Scottish Football League approved in 1987.&lt;ref name="Inglis313"/&gt; The first match in Scottish football history played on a synthetic surface was at Annfield in September 1987, between Stirling Albion and [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]].

The Stirling Council spent significant funds on Annfield during the 1980s; £100,000 for new floodlights, barriers and gates in 1986 and £450,000 on the synthetic pitch.&lt;ref name="Inglis313"/&gt; The cost of the pitch was relatively high because the sloped surface required leveling. The stadium added 600 plastic seats in the west stand in 1987, but the east stand was largely demolished resulting in a capacity of 14,000.&lt;ref name="Inglis313"/&gt;

Stirling Council decided in the early 1990s that Annfield should be replaced as the cost of upgrading the buildings and the pitch was not economical. The council constructed [[Forthbank Stadium]] and closed Annfield on 31 May 1993, at the end of the [[1992–93 in Scottish football|1992–93 season]] an after 48 years of use. It demolished the facility to make way for a new housing development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3506">A '''batting cage''' (or '''tunnel''') is an enclosed area for [[baseball]] or [[softball]] players to practice the skill of [[Batting (baseball)|batting]].

The optimal material for batting cages is netting, and they are typically rectangular in shape. [[Chain-link fence]] is not required but can be useful to enclose the netting to prevent vandalism. However, this material is not suitable for the primary impact layer because it will warp the fencing and damage balls. The ideal netting for a batting cage is either diamond- or square-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is The Best Backyard Batting Cage|url=http://www.backyardbattingcages.net/best-backyard-batting-cage/|website=Backyard Batting Cages|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of netting have their advantages and disadvantages.

==Usage==

A [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] stands at one end of the cage, with a [[pitching machine]] (or, less often, a human [[pitcher]]) at the opposing end.  The pitcher or pitching machine pitches baseballs to the batter, who hits them. It is recommended to use a protective pitcher's L-screen to prevent batted balls from striking the pitcher or machine.

The cage is used to keep the loose baseballs within a certain range so that they're easy to pick up and are not lost.  Batting cages are found both indoors and outdoors.

The interior floor of a batting cage may be sloped, to automatically feed the baseballs back into the automatic pitching machine. The automatic pitching machines using sloped floors usually pitch out a synthetic baseball or softball, rather than an official solid core leather hardball.

Commercial batting cages pitch with several different speeds, which can range from {{convert|30|mi}} (for [[softball]]) to {{convert|90|mi}} per hour.

[[Cricket nets]] and tunnels, used by [[cricket]] [[Batsman (cricket)|batsmen]] are similar in purpose, but [[bowling machine]]s are much less common than facing a live [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]] (this reflects the fact that nearly half of the members of a cricket team are specialist bowlers, and therefore proportionately more bowling practice is needed in cricket than pitching practice in baseball).

Netting can greatly vary in quality and durability. #21 Gauge is suitable for little-league players, #36 Gauge is suitable for High-School players, and #60 is recommended for Commercial facilities and Pro Players. Resources such as this [http://www.practicesports.com/playbook/netting-101-a-visual-guide-to-sports-netting/ Netting Infographic Guide] are helpful for identifying the best netting for an application.

==Types==
===Indoor===
Indoor batting cages are typically suspended by steel cable lines, 1 line every 6–8 feet. The anchor points being the most important component, typically connected using a steel plate to the wall. Without strong anchors, the netting will sag.

===Outdoor===
Outdoor batting cages are typically installed using steel pole sections (2 uprights and 1 cross-bar per section), spaced every 12–20 feet. The greater the span between supports, the more sag in the netting and less usable the cage becomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Chad|title=Batting Cage Getting Started Guide|url=http://www.practicesports.com/playbook/netting-getting-started-guide-what-kind-of-cage-system-do-i-need/|work=Practice Sports|publisher=Joe Stubler|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Besti squat''' is a [[figure skating]] move. It is similar to the [[spread eagle (figure skating)|spread eagle]] in that the skater travels along an edge with both skates on the ice, the toes turned out to the sides and the heels facing each other. The knees are bent outwards into a [[Partial squat|squatting position]] with the thighs held parallel to the ice and the torso kept upright.
In [[ballet]] terminology, it is a [[Glossary of ballet#Plié|plié]] with the feet in [[positions of the feet in ballet#Second_position|second position]].

The move is unofficially named after [[Natalia Bestemianova]], who performed the move repeatedly in her 1988 free dance with [[Andrei Bukin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966927-2,00.html Time Magazine article on 1988 Olympics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/sports/88-winter-olympics-ice-dancing-taking-a-step-backward.html New York Times article on 1988 Olympics]&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, financial constraints forced Hull City to allow [[Kwik Save]] and [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]] supermarkets to embed themselves into the stadium's structure.&lt;ref&gt;Photos at Tim's 92, http://tims92.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/hull-city-boothferry-park-with-wolves.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091645/http://tims92.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/hull-city-boothferry-park-with-wolves.html |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the ground were demolished in early 2008, more than five years after the last game was played there, and the remainder in 2011.

__TOC__

==History==
=== The planning years ===

The ground was originally planned in 1929, and work began on the site from 1932 based near the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. Financial difficulties severely hampered this development, with the playing area and part of the [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] appearing over the following 12 months before work and progress ground to a halt. A proposal in 1939 for a sports stadium on the site was the catalyst for further development, as even though this threw up doubt for the original stadium plans, no suitable financial offer for the land was forthcoming, and instead the Hull City board enquired after, and were granted, a [[The Football Association|Football Association]] loan to the sum of £6,600. This meant the new ground would be ready for the opening of the 1941 season.

The onset of the [[Second World War]] was to again frustrate the development of the football ground, as during the war, the ground was used by the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]], and was, for a period, used to repair tanks. This, not unexpectedly, had an adverse effect on the playing area – following the end of the war, the pitch was in very poor shape and prone to waterlogging.

Building materials were hard to come by in the post-war years for something as "frivolous" as a football stadium in the [[Hull Blitz|heavily bombed city]], this and the state of the pitch meant that the ground was still not in a usable state by the 1945–46 season, so the club was forced to return to playing its matches at one of its former homes, [[The Boulevard (stadium)|the Boulevard]], the then home of [[Hull F.C.|Hull rugby league club]], one of the city's two [[rugby league]] clubs.

===Opening and continued construction===

The ground was opened in August 1946, 17 years after its initial proposal, but only had planning permission for one stand along the west side with an upper cost limit of £17,000. The ground was still not fully completed and it became a race against time to make the stadium ready for its opening match against visiting [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Mike|title=A Century of City|year=2005|publisher=Yore Publications|isbn=0-9547830-7-7|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-thousand people gathered to watch the opening ceremony performed by the city's lord mayor. The teams were led onto the pitch by Sergeant JT "Tommy" Brooke riding a white horse. Sergeant Brooke was a detective and mounted officer in the Hull Police and was a veteran of the [[First World War]] and the [[Battle of the Somme]] where he was a machine gunner with the [[Royal Horse Guards]].

By 1948 the attendance record had swelled to 40,179 as the stadium hosted visitors [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the [[FA Cup]]. The terracing embankments were raised and by February 1949 a ground and club record which still stands was hit – 55,019 turned out to watch Hull City play [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The locally famous [[Boothferry Park Halt railway station|Boothferry Halt]] opened in 1951.  The ground now had its own railway station, its first use being a fixture against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] when six trains ran the football service between [[Hull Paragon railway station|Paragon Station]], Hull's central railway station and Boothferry Park. At the same time, work proceeded on the covering of the North Stand.

The East Terrace was the next to be covered, albeit with a [[temporary structure]]. This [[temporary structure]] was never replaced, and stood throughout the years of the ground. The popular East Terrace became known as the Kempton Stand after Kempton Road on the other side of the railway station. With the three stands completed, the ground was now suited to a floodlight installation. Two gantries housing 96 lamps were built, one on the west and one opposite on the east following a licence being granted. Although this lighting system was the envy of many clubs, advancements in stadium lighting came rapidly, and the system soon needed replacement. A six pylon system replaced the old gantries in 1963.

[[File:Boothferry lights.JPG|thumb|right|Lights of Boothferry Park]]
The new lights were used for the first time in 1964, using four of the six available, in an evening match against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] which ended in a 7–0 win for the Tigers.

In 1965 a new South Stand was built over the Bunker's Hill Terrace. The new two-tiered structure included a propped [[cantilever]] roof, 2,500 seats in the upper tier and terracing for 4,000 more in the lower tier. The new stand was arguably the best stand at Boothferry Park, and a reminder of the golden days in the declining years to come.

[[File:Boothferry park last day.jpg|thumb|right|Celebrations taking place on the pitch on the last day that football was played before demolition]]
On 20 March 1967, Boothferry Park hosted an [[FA Cup]] 2nd replay between [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. Over 40,000 fans attended and Leeds United won 2–1. It was standard procedure in the pre penalty shoot-out days for 2nd and subsequent replays to be held on neutral grounds.

On 16 February 1972 Boothferry Park hosted a full international match between [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. The result was drawn at 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/1972/02/16/europe/european-championships/northern-ireland/spain/627598/|title=Northern Ireland vs. Spain  1 – 1|accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final football match to be staged at Boothferry Park saw Hull City lose 0–1 to [[Darlington F. C.|Darlington]] in December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/2553217.stm|title=Hull 0–1 Darlington|date=14 December 2002|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was scored by [[Simon Betts]]; it would be his only goal in Darlington colours.  Darlington goalkeeper [[Michael Ingham (footballer)|Michael Ingham]] played in both the final match at Boothferry Park and the first match to be played at Hull City's new home (in [[Sunderland A. F. C.|Sunderland]] colours).

Boothferry Park was also the scene of a [[rugby league]] international when it hosted the first [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes series]] test of the [[1982 Kangaroo tour]] between [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] on 30 October. The Aussies ran in eight [[Try|tries]] to nil in a 40–4 thrashing watched by a vocal crowd of 26,771.

===Rugby League===
Boothferry Park hosted nine top grade rugby league matches, including five internationals, from 1980–1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/venues/boothferry-park/results.html Boothferry Park @ Rugby League Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demolition===
[[File:Boothferry been knocked down.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Boothferry Park being demolished in March 2008]]
Demolition of the ground eventually started on 10 January 2008, over five years after the final game was played there, and was completed during March. The North Stand and the terracing on the South and East Stands were eventually demolished in January 2010 after years of vandalism and arson attacks. [[Humberside Fire and Rescue Service]] had to be called out nearly 100 times during 2009 to deal with the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
The six floodlights that had dominated the West Hull skyline were finally dismantled in early 2011.

==Records==
The highest attendance before the new stand was built was 40,179 in 1948 when Hull City played [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the [[FA Cup]]. In 1949 55,019 witnessed the visit of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] when the height of the terracing was increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Mike|title=A Century of City|year=2005|publisher=Yore Publications|isbn=0-9547830-7-7|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest Scoring Game came in a friendly Match in 1950. When Hull City played [[Nuneaton Town F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]] the score ended 8-6 to Hull City with the score having been 0-1 to Nuneaton Borough at halftime.

== Nicknames ==
[[File:Boothferry park.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Boothferry Park from the car park with the "o" missing.]]
The stadium became affectionately known by supporters as "Fer Ark" in its later days, due to the lack of finances for maintenance which meant that only those letters were illuminated on the large "booth'''FER'''ry p'''ARK'''" signage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/964/38/ When Saturday Comes – The Half Decent Football Magazine – Hull on earth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522121521/http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/964/38/ |date=22 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this it had been known as "Bothferry Park" when one of the illuminated "O"s fell off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccerprint.co.uk/shop/hull-city/hull-city-b-othferry-park-t-shirt.html Soccerprint Football T Shirts – Hull City B'othferry Park T Shirt]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was also known simply as "BP".

These trials have been used to determine the Canadian representatives in the year's Winter Olympic Games since Mixed Doubles Curling was added to the Olympic programme for the 2018 Winter Olympic games.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.curling.ca/2018mixeddoublestrials/2017/05/02/2018-olympic-mixed-doubles-curling-trials-to-be-held-in-portage-la-prairie-man/|title=2018 Olympic Mixed Doubles Curling Trials to be held in Portage La Prairie, Man.|publisher=[[Canadian Curling Association]]|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Canada's Olympic four-player teams are not eligible to compete in the Canadian Mixed Doubles Trials because of the rigours of the Olympic curling schedule. If their teammate did qualify for the Olympics as part of a four-player team, they must name a replacement to compete alongside them in the Trials.

The '''Circuit des Ardennes''' was an [[auto race]] held annually at the [[Circuit de Bastogne]], [[Bastogne]], from 1902 to 1907.  It was the first major race to run on a closed course instead of from one city to another. The name was later used for a [[Rallying|rally]], part of the Dutch as well as the Belgian national rally championships.&lt;ref name="AV246"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Autovisie | date = 1979-03-24 | volume = 24 | number = 6 | publisher = Arnold van der Wees | location = Amersfoort, Netherlands | language = Dutch | title = Sportjournaal | editor-last = de Jong | editor-first = Nico | page = 62 | ref = stjärt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2010}}

A '''club''' (also known as a '''cudgel''', '''baton''', '''truncheon''', '''cosh''', '''nightstick''', or '''bludgeon''') is among the simplest of all [[weapon]]s: a short staff or stick, usually made of [[wood]], wielded as a weapon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Club|volume=6|page=564}}&lt;/ref&gt; since prehistoric times. There are several examples of blunt-force trauma caused by clubs in the past, including at the site of [[Nataruk]] in Turkana, Kenya, described as the scene of a prehistoric conflict between bands of hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Inter-group violence among early Holocene hunter-gatherers of West Turkana, Kenya|url= http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature16477|journal= Nature|pages= 394–398|volume= 529|issue= 7586|doi= 10.1038/nature16477|first= M. Mirazón|last= Lahr|first2= F.|last2= Rivera|first3= R. K.|last3= Power|first4= A.|last4= Mounier|first5= B.|last5= Copsey|first6= F.|last6= Crivellaro|first7= J. E.|last7= Edung|first8= J. M. Maillo|last8= Fernandez|first9= C.|last9= Kiarie|pmid=26791728|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, clubs are associated with primitive cultures, especially [[caveman|cavemen]].

Most clubs are small enough to be swung with one hand, although larger clubs may require the use of two to be effective. Various specialized clubs are used in [[martial arts]] and other fields, including the [[club (law enforcement)|law-enforcement baton]]. The military [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] is a more sophisticated descendant of the club, typically made of metal and featuring a spiked, knobbed, or flanged head attached to a shaft.

The wounds inflicted by a club are generally known as ''bludgeoning'' or ''[[blunt trauma|blunt-force trauma]]'' injuries.

==Law enforcement==
{{Main|Baton (law enforcement)}}
[[Police]] forces and their predecessors have traditionally favored the use, whenever possible, of [[less-lethal weapon]]s than guns or blades. Until recent times, when alternatives such as [[taser]]s and [[capsicum spray]] became available, this category of policing weapon has generally been filled by some form of wooden club variously termed a truncheon, baton, nightstick, or [[lathi khela|lathi]]. Short, flexible clubs are also often used, especially by plainclothes officers who need to avoid notice. These are known colloquially as blackjacks, saps, or coshes. They are also used in olden ages of the Philippines to punish citizens.

Conversely, criminals have been known to arm themselves with an array of homemade or improvised clubs, generally of easily concealable sizes, or which can be explained as being carried for legitimate purposes (such as [[baseball bat]]s).

In addition, [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin monks]] and members of other religious orders around the world have employed cudgels from time to time as defensive weapons.

==Types==
Though perhaps the simplest of all weapons, there are many varieties of club, including:
:''For other types see [[Baton (law enforcement)]].''
*'''[[Aklys]]''' – a club with an integrated leather thong, used to return it to the hand after snapping it at an opponent. Used by the legions of the [[Roman Empire]].
*'''Ball club''' – These clubs were used by the Native Americans. There are two types; the stone ball clubs that were used mostly by early Plains, Plateau and Southwest Native Indians and the wooden ball clubs that the Huron and Iroquois tribes used. These consisted of a relatively free-moving head of rounded stone or wood attached to a wooden handle.
*'''Baseball, cricket and T-ball bats''' – The [[baseball bat]] is often used as an improvised weapon, much like the [[pickaxe handle]]. In countries where baseball is not commonly played, baseball bats are often first thought of as weapons (e.g. in Poland, baseball bats or similar are defined as weapons by law, so have been illegal to carry or possess).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/Download?id=WDU19990530549&amp;type=3 |title=Act of Weapons and Munition (polish only) Art.4.1.4a "(weapon is) club made of wood or other heavy and hard material, imitating a baseball bat"|publisher=isap.sejm.gov.pl (Polish Gov. Site) |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tee ball]] bats are also used in this manner. Their smaller size and lighter weight make the bat easier to handle in one hand than a baseball bat.
*'''[[Baton (law enforcement)|Baton]]'''
*'''Blackjack''': see '''''cosh'''''.
*'''Clava''' (full name ''clava mere okewa'') – a traditional stone hand-club used by [[Mapuche]] Indians in Chile, featuring a long flat body. In Spanish, it is known as ''clava cefalomorfa''. It has some ritual importance as a special sign of distinction carried by the tribal chief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chileprecolombino.cl/coleccion/clava-cefalomorfa/ Image of ''clava cefalomorfa''] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140314081208/http://chileprecolombino.cl/coleccion/clava-cefalomorfa/ |date=2014-03-14 }} Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Cosh''':
*# A weapon made of covered metal similar to a blackjack. See [[Baton (law enforcement)#Blackjack|Blackjack]].
*# Any of various sorts of [[blunt instrument]] such as [[Bludgeon (weapon)|bludgeon]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheon]] or the like.&lt;ref&gt;1991 edition of [[Chambers's Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Cudgel''' – A stout stick carried by peasants during the Middle Ages. It functioned as a walking staff and a weapon for both self-defence and wartime. Regiments of [[clubmen]] were raised as late as the [[English Civil War]]. The cudgel is also known as the [[singlestick]].
*'''[[Crowbar (tool)|Crowbar]]''' – The crowbar is a commonly used improvised weapon, though some examples are too large to be wielded with a single hand, and therefore should be classified as [[wikt:staff|staves]].
*'''[[Flashlight]]''' – A large metal flashlight, such as a [[Maglite]], can make a very effective improvised club. Though not specifically classified as a weapon, it is often carried for self-defense by security guards, bouncers and civilians, especially in countries where carrying weapons is restricted.
*'''[[Gunstock war club]]''' – The wooden stocks of [[muskets|firearms]] introduced during the [[European colonization of the Americas]] were reportedly re-used by [[First Nations]] as improvised weapons; other sources claim that the club was an indigenous weapon before European contact, and acquired the term ''gunstock'' from the similarity of its shape. Regardless, the [[stock (firearm)|gunstock]] is an essential part of firearms, but it was stylized as a war club made famous by the American Indians as the [[gunstock war club]]. Another more modern variation of this kind of war club is the combat skill of [[bayonet]] usage. Even without a knife or blade type attachment, the rifle's body itself is used for [[close combat|close-quarters combat]] (CQC).
*'''[[Jutte]]''' – One of the more distinctive weapons of the [[samurai]] police was the [[jutte (weapon)|jutte]]. Basically an iron rod, the jutte was popular because it could parry and disarm a sword-wielding assailant without serious injury. A single hook on the side near the handle allowed the jutte to be used for trapping or even breaking the blades of edged weapons, as well as for jabbing and striking. The hook could also be used to entangle the clothes or fingers of an opponent. Thus, feudal Japanese police used the jutte to disarm and arrest subjects without serious bloodshed. Eventually, the jutte also came to be considered a symbol of official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-budokai.com/hibuki/jutte.htm |title=Jutte |publisher=E-budokai.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Kanabō]]''' (nyoibo, konsaibo, tetsubō, ararebo) – Various types of different-sized Japanese clubs made of wood and or iron, usually with iron spikes or studs. First used by the [[Samurai]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tuttle dictionary of the martial arts of Korea, China &amp; Japan'' – Page 168 Daniel Kogan, Sun-Jin Kim – 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pauley's Guide – A Dictionary of Japanese Martial Arts and Culture'' – Page 90 Daniel C.

*'''''Kiyoga''''', a spring baton similar in concept to the Asp collapsible police baton, but with the center section made of a heavy duty steel spring. The tip and first section slide into the spring, and the whole nests into a seven-inch handle. To deploy the kiyoga, all that is necessary is to grasp the handle and swing. This causes the parts to extend from the handle into a baton seventeen inches long. The kiyoga has one advantage over a conventional collapsible baton: it can reach around a raised arm trying to block it to strike the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awma.com/productdetail/1280-spring-baton.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211084413/https://www.awma.com/productdetail/1280-spring-baton.asp |archivedate=2017-02-11 |df= }}.

*'''[[Knobkierrie]]''', occasionally spelled ''knopkierie'' or ''knobkerry'', is a strong, short wooden club with a heavy rounded knob or head on one end, traditionally used by [[Southern Africa]]n ethnic groups including the [[Zulu people|Zulu]], as a weapon in warfare and the chase. The word ''knobkierrie'' derives from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''knop'' (knob or button), and the [[Khoisan languages|Bushman and Hottentot]] ''kerrie'' or ''kirri'' (stick); in the Zulu language it was called the ''[[iwisa]]''. The weapon is employed at close quarters, or as a missile, and in time of peace may serve as a walking-stick. The head, or knob, is often ornately carved with faces or shapes that have symbolic meaning. The knobkierrie itself serves this function in the crest of the [[coat of Arms of South Africa]]. The name has been extended to similar weapons used by the natives of Australia, the Pacific islands and other places.
*[[Kubotan]] – a short, thin, lightweight club often used by law enforcement officers, generally to apply pressure against selected points of the body in order to encourage compliance without inflicting injury.
*[[Leangle (weapon)|Leangle]] An Australian Aboriginal fighting club with a hooked striking head, typically nearly at right angles to the weapon's shaft. The name comes from [[Kulin]] languages such as [[Wemba-Wemba]] and [[Woiwurrung]], based on the word ''lia'' (tooth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/leangle|title=leangle - Definition of leangle in English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823205631/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/leangle|archivedate=2017-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Life preserver''' (also [[hyphen]]ated '''life-preserver''') – a short, often weighted club intended for self-defense. Mentioned in Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and several [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sherlockholmes.stanford.edu/2007/notes9_1.html |title=Notes on the Sherlock Holmes story '&amp;#39;The Bruce Partington Plans'&amp;#39; |publisher=Sherlockholmes.stanford.edu |date=1908-12-12 |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226072738/http://sherlockholmes.stanford.edu/2007/notes9_1.html |archivedate=2011-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lil Lil - An aboriginal club with boomerang like [[aerodynamics]]. Can be thrown or hand held.
*'''[[Mace (bludgeon)|Mace]]''' – a metal club with a heavy head on the end, designed to deliver very powerful blows. The head of a mace may also have small studs forged into it. The mace is often confused with the spiked [[Morning star (weapon)|morning star]].
*'''[[Mere (weapon)|Mere]]''' – a type of short, broad-bladed club ([[patu]]), usually made from [[Nephrite jade]] ([[Pounamu]] or greenstone). A mere is one of the traditional, [[close combat]], one-handed [[weapon]]s of the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]] of New Zealand. The designed use of the mere for forward striking thrusts is an unusual characteristic of Maori patu, whereas in other parts of the world, clubs are generally wielded with an ax-like downward blow.&lt;ref name="hiroa"&gt;{{cite book | first=Te Rangi | last=Hiroa  |authorlink=Te Rangi Hīroa| year=1949 | title=The Coming of the Maori  | url= http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucTheC-t1-g1-t2-body1-d12-d6.html#BucTheC-fig-BucTheC279a|pages=Short Clubs, 278–280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Morning star (weapon)|Morning star]]''' - a medieval club-like weapon consisting of a shaft with an attached ball adorned with one or more spikes.
*'''Nulla-nulla''' – a short, curved hardwood club, used as a hunting weapon and in tribal in-fighting, by the Aboriginal people of Australia.
*'''[[Nunchaku]]''' (also called ''nunchucks'') – an Asian weapon consisting of two clubs, connected by a short rope, thong or chain, and usually used with one club in hand and the other swung as a [[flail (weapon)]].
*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Oslop|ru|3=Ослоп}}''' – a two-handed, very heavy, often iron-shod, Russian club that was used as the cheapest and the most readily available infantry weapon.
*Paddle Club - Common in the [[Solomon Islands]] these clubs could be used in warfare or for propelling a small dugout canoe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.new-guinea-tribal-arts.com/tribal-war-clubs/|title=Tribal War Clubs {{!}} sell Tribal War Clubs {{!}} melanesian War Clubs|date=2018-04-12|work=new guinea tribal arts|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Pickaxe handle''' – [[Pickaxe]]s were common tools in the United States in the early 20th century, and replacement handles were widely available. In developing countries, where manual labor is still prevalent, it is pervasive. Strong and heavy, they make a formidable club and have often been used as club weapons. Pickaxe handles were handed out by segregationist [[Lester Maddox]] to the white patrons of his Pickrick Restaurant to keep that establishment from being "integrated". In the [[British Army]] pickaxe handles are or were officially used as guards' batons.
*'''[[Rungu (weapon)|Rungu]]''' ([[Swahili language|Swahili]], plural ''marungu'') – a wooden throwing club or baton bearing special symbolism and significance in certain [[East Africa]]n tribal cultures. It is especially associated with [[Maasai people|Maasai]] [[morans]] (male warriors) who have traditionally used it in warfare and for hunting.
*'''Sally rod''' – A Sally [[Switch (rod)|rod]] is a long, thin wooden stick, generally made from [[willow]] (Latin ''salix''), and used chiefly in the past in Ireland as a disciplinary implement, but also sometimes used like a club (without the fencing-like technique of [[stick fighting]]) in fights and brawls. In Japan this type of stick is called the [[Hanbō]] meaning half stick, and in FMA (Filipino martial arts) it is called the [[eskrima]] or [[escrima]] stick, often made from [[rattan]].
*'''Shillelagh''' – A [[shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]] is a wooden club or cudgel, typically made from a stout knotty stick with a large knob on the end, that is associated with Ireland in folklore. Shillelaghs have traditionally been made from oak, holly, or more famously blackthorn. It is surmised that the name of the weapon came from Shillelagh Forest in County Wicklow, Ireland. It is also known as a ‘bata’. Shillelaghs are almost exclusively made from blackthorn today. Whether made as a club, a walking stick, or a combination of the two, the stickmaker will generally pull up a sapling and carve the head out of the root ball, with the trunk serving as the shaft. A large branch with a section of the trunk has also been used. A properly made shillelagh can take up to two years to make, which includes curing time.
*'''[[Slapjack (weapon)|Slapjack]]''' – This is a variation of the [[blackjack (weapon)|blackjack]]. It consists of a longer strap which lets it be used [[Flail (weapon)|flail]]-type, and can be used as a club or for trapping techniques as seen in the use of [[nunchaku]] and other flexible weapons.
*'''Telescopic''' – [[Baton (law enforcement)#Expandable baton|Telescopic batons]] are rigid batons that are capable of collapsing to a shorter length for greater portability and concealability. They are illegal in the United Kingdom and some other countries. In Hungary these weapons are named ''vipera'' ("viper") and though officially illegal, they were reported as being repeatedly used by riot police units.
*'''[[Tipstaff]]'''
*'''[[Tonfa]]''' (also known in slang as a "[[Baton (law enforcement)#Side-handle baton|PR-24]]" or "Stanky Doodle") – a staff of Okinawan origin and featuring a second handle mounted perpendicular to the shaft
*'''[[Totokia]]''' - traditional [[Fiji]]an weapon&lt;ref name="Kjellgren"&gt;Eric Kjellgren, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wkriAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153 How to Read Oceanic Art]'' ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]/[[Yale University Press]], 2014), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Waddy]]''' – a heavy hardwood club, used as a weapon for hunting and in tribal in-fighting, and also as a tool, by the Aboriginal people of Australia. The word ''waddy'' describes a club from New South Wales, but is also used generally by Australians to include other Aboriginal clubs, including the ''nulla nulla and'' ''leangle''.

In many [[sport]]s, a '''competition number''' is used to identify and differentiate the competitors taking part in the competitive endeavour. For example, runners in a race may wear a prominent competition number so that they may be clearly identified from a distance. It is also called a '''bib number''' when worn on a [[Bib (garment)|bib]] over, or affixed to, the athlete's top.

==Vehicles==
In [[motorsport]], competition numbers are attached to the vehicles taking part, also for identification. In some types of motorsport such as [[rallying|rallyes]], the competition number works in conjunction with special kinds of timing system (for example [[targa timing]]) and as a result numbers also usually relate to the competitors' [[due time]] and thus may exhibit gaps such as skipping from number 59 to number 100 (59 minutes to 1 hour due time).

==Athletics==
Since the 2000s, [[track and field]] athletes at major competitions wear their names as well as their numbers on their bibs. In relay events, all team members have the [[IOC country code]].  [[Track event|Track]] athletes also wear a lane number on the shorts.

The '''Dick Schaap Award for Outstanding Journalism''' was established in 2002 to honor the memory of one of America's pre-eminent sports writers, [[Dick Schaap]]. The award is presented by the [[Nassau County Sports Commission]] and is given out to the journalist, in any medium, who best exemplifies the principles and talents of Dick Schaap during the past year. The award recipient is determined by confidential balloting of the Dick Schaap Selection Committee, which is composed of respected members of the media, and chaired by Dick's son, [[ESPN]] reporter [[Jeremy Schaap]].

Although the recipient need not be a [[sports journalism|sports journalist]], he/she must convey the passion and insight for stories and people he/she covers as Schaap did.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10508">'''East Kent''' and '''West Kent''' were titles sometimes given to two [[cricket]] teams from their respective areas of the [[English county]] of [[Kent]] which generally played in matches prior to the foundation of the official [[Kent County Cricket Club]] in the mid 19th century. West Kent (or West of Kent) teams have been recorded from 1705 but there is no known record of an East Kent team until 1781. There were seven major matches from 1781 to 1790 in which teams of this type faced each other, although there is doubt about the match titles with sources using different team names.

The first Kent Cricket Club was founded in [[Canterbury]] on 6 August 1842, formed out of the [[Beverley Ground|Beverley Cricket Club]], and played its first match against [[All-England cricket teams|All-England]] three weeks later. In 1859 a second county club was formed at [[Maidstone]] to support the Canterbury club, the two often being known as the East Kent and West Kent clubs respectively.&lt;ref name=wisden07&gt;[[George Marsham|Marsham G]] (1907) [http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150186.html A short history of Kent cricket], ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', 1907.

Teams called East Kent and West Kent played each other twice in 1856 in minor matches. Those two matches are the last known to involve an East Kent team. West Kent became the name of a 19th-century club which played minor cricket only and was for a long time based at [[Chislehurst Cricket Club]], with which it ultimately amalgamated in 1980 as the Chislehurst and West Kent Cricket Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chislehurst-cc.co.uk/CWKCC-Info/History.aspx |title=CWKCC History |publisher=Chislehurst and West Kent Cricket Club |accessdate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310090324/http://www.chislehurst-cc.co.uk/CWKCC-Info/History.aspx |archivedate=2010-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Matches==
The earliest known record of a "West Kent" or "West of Kent" team is in a match against [[Chatham Cricket Club]] on 7 August 1705,  played at a place called "Maulden" in the primary source. There is no such place although it is generally believed to refer to [[Old County Ground|Town Malling]] near [[Maidstone]].&lt;ref name=tmcc26may18&gt;Town Malling Cricket Club [TownMallingCC] [https://twitter.com/TownMallingCC/status/1000304835722346496 The Old County Ground in @west_malling #westmalling 191yrs of cricketing history in The Garden Of England @VisitKent @westmallingCEP @west_mallingpc #KentDay], (Tweet), via [[Twitter]], 2018-05-26.

Cambridge: Roger Heavens. {{isbn|978-1-900-59252-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khistory /&gt; The result and details of the teams are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The next mention is a match on 22 September 1769, played at [[Vine Cricket Ground|Sevenoaks Vine]] between West Kent and [[Surrey county cricket teams|a Surrey team]]. The original report merely states that the [[wicket]]s will be "pitched soon after 10".&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known match involving an "East Kent" team is one played against West Kent at Sevenoaks Vine on 20 and 21 June 1781. The question of nomenclature arises here because, with at least three "given men" (i.e., borrowed players), on each side the match is also called [[Duke of Dorset's XI cricket team|Duke of Dorset's XI]] versus [[Sir Horatio Mann's XI cricket team|Sir Horatio Mann's XI]] after the two team patrons [[John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]] and [[Sir Horatio Mann, 2nd Baronet|Sir Horatio (Horace) Mann]]. The "East Kent" team, Mann's XI, included [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]], [[Richard Aubrey Veck]] and [[Lamborn (Hambledon cricketer)|Lamborn]] of [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] and [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]]. The "West Kent" team, Dorset's XI, featured the Hambledon players [[Noah Mann]] and [[Tom Sueter]] with the [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]] and Surrey players [[William Bedster]] and [[Lumpy Stevens]]. Noted Kent players involved in the match include [[Joseph Miller (cricketer)|Joseph Miller]], [[William Bullen]], [[William Bowra]], [[Robert Clifford (cricketer)|Robert Clifford]] and [[Thomas Pattenden]].&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Sevenoaks Vine was Dorset's home ground and there was a return match at [[Bourne Paddock]] at Mann's [[Bourne Park House]] near [[Bishopsbourne]] from 8 to 11 August. This also featured guest players with Surrey's [[William Yalden]] and Hampshire's [[James Aylward (cricketer)|James Aylward]] joining Small, Lamborn, Sueter, Bedster, Mann and Stevens.&lt;ref name="Haygarth, pp. 49–50"&gt;Haygarth, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorset's West Kent XI won both matches, the first by 10 wickets and the return by 106 runs.

Part of the confusion around match titles comes from the ways in which [[Arthur Haygarth]] records matches. He calls the June match "West Kent with Mann, Sueter &amp; Lumpy versus East Kent with Small, Veck &amp; Lamborn", but then calls the August match "Sir Horace Mann's Side versus the Duke of Dorset's Side". In its "Important Cricket Matches" guide, the [[Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians]] follows Haygarth by using the abbreviated titles "East Kent with 3 gm v West Kent with 3 gm" for the June match and "Duke of Dorset v Sir H. Mann" for the August match ("gm" meaning "given men").&lt;ref name=ACS25&gt;ACS, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 and 26 June 1783, a match at Sevenoaks Vine involved "West Kent with [[David Harris (English cricketer)|Harris]], Stevens and Bedster versus East Kent". East Kent won this by 2 wickets. A curious condition of the match was that Lumpy Stevens, generally reckoned the outstanding bowler of the time, "was not to bowl, by agreement". This would have severely handicapped his team, which lost the match, as he was not a good batsman and so, as Haygarth says, "not much use as a given man". [[Stephen Amherst]], who was a [[Maidstone]] man and the patron of later West Kent teams, played in this match for the East.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amherst had become a match organiser by the start of the 1789 season and led his team to a five-wicket victory against that of Mann at Coxheath on 22 and 23 May. A contemporary report in the ''Maidstone Journal'' describes the game as "Sir H. Mann with a select eleven of the County against S. Amherst, Esq. and the County at large, for 100 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]]".&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACS calls the match "Sir H. Mann v S. Amherst".&lt;ref name=ACS27&gt;ACS, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next Mann-Amherst match on 29 and 30 June, also at Coxheath, is called "East Kent v West Kent with each side having 4 gm".&lt;ref name=ACS27/&gt; This follows Haygarth, whose title is "East Kent with Boorman and Four of Hampshire versus West Kent with Four of Surrey". East Kent won by 8 runs and Haygarth confirms Mann and Amherst as respective managers.&lt;ref name="Haygarth, pp. 49–50"/&gt; The guest players in this match were [[John Boorman (cricketer)|John Boorman]], [[Richard Purchase]], John Small, David Harris and [[Thomas Taylor (cricketer)|Tom Taylor]] for the East and [[Billy Beldham]], [[Harry Walker (cricketer)|Harry Walker]], [[Tom Walker (cricketer)|Tom Walker]] and [[John Wells (cricketer)|John Wells]] for the West. Apart from a couple of changes in the East Kent lineup, the same teams met again at Coxheath on 4 and 5 August, East Kent winning by 57 runs.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final match between Amherst's West and Mann's East took place at Bishopsbourne from 7 to 11 September 1790. Haygarth called it "East Kent with Purchase versus West Kent". West Kent won by 130 runs.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Horatio Mann became [[Member of parliament|MP]] for [[Sandwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Sandwich]] in 1790 and reduced his involvement in cricket. The match in September 1790 is the last East Kent v. West Kent match that can be considered a major fixture.

'''''Gold's Gym: Cardio Workout''''' is an [[exergaming|exercise video game]] for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] [[video game console]], created by Japanese [[video game developer]] Rocket Company. Based on the "shape boxing" fitness regimen used at Kyoei Boxing Gym&lt;ref name="Kyoei"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2008/09/05/get-in-shape-with-shape-boxing-wii-de-enjoy-diet/ |title=Get in shape with Shape Boxing Wii de Enjoy Diet |first=Spencer |last=Yip |work=Siliconera |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes [[shadowboxing]], [[press-up]]s, and [[sit-up (exercise)|sit-up]]s, the game also features a diet management feature. Originally announced in mid-2007 as ''Wii Exercise'' with a release target of later that year,&lt;ref name="Wii Exercise"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2007/08/02/wait-a-second%e2%80%a6-wii-exercise/ |title=Wait a second...

'''Goldsmith–Schiffman Field''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. From 1934 through 2012, it was used mainly for middle school and high school [[American football|football]].&lt;ref name="hnt091015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hsv121210"/&gt; It was also home to the [[Huntsville Rockets]] from 1962 through 1967 and the now-defunct [[Alabama Renegades]] of the [[National Women's Football Association]].

==History==
[[File:Goldsmith-Schiffman Field construction.jpg|thumb|left|Stadium under construction in 1934.]]
On January 25, 1934, Oscar Goldsmith, Lawrence B. Goldsmith, Annie Schiffman Goldsmith, Robert L. Schiffman, and Elsie Strauss Schiffman gave the property to the city for an "athletic field or playground "for the enjoyment of the white students of the public schools."&lt;ref name="hsv121210"/&gt; The [[Civil Works Administration]] provided $6,500 in materials and labor to construct the field, the first in Huntsville to accommodate night athletic games. The field was dedicated during the first night game on October 4, 1934, when 1,000 fans saw Coach Milton Frank's [[Huntsville High School (Alabama)|Huntsville High]] team defeat [[Gadsden High School (Alabama)|Gadsden High]].&lt;ref name="hismk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lees"/&gt;

The [[Racism in the United States#WWII to Civil Rights Era|racist language]] in the deed was unenforceable and ignored as desegregation came to [[Huntsville City Schools]].&lt;ref name="hsv121210"/&gt;

The city moved activities to [[Louis Crews Stadium]] at [[Alabama A&amp;M University]] in 2012, and because of disuse, heirs reclaimed title to the land. On September 5, 2014, after consulting with heirs "as far away as Scotland," Margaret Ann Goldsmith deeded the property to the city again, this time without restriction.&lt;ref name="hsvt140915"/&gt;

[[File:John 3 7.png|thumb|The ''JOHN 3:7 sign''. "Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’"|250px]]
A sign with the legend "'''JOHN 3:7'''" is often seen at [[Gaelic games]] stadiums in [[Ireland]]. It refers to a verse in the [[Gospel of John]] and for at least two decades has been displayed by fan Frank Hogan during matches. 

The sign featured in the national media following its second disappearance in August 2009: Hogan launched an extensive, and ultimately successful, media campaign for its return before the next match. During that brief disappearance, bookmakers offered odds as to where it might next reappear and [[Paddy Power]] offered to purchase a replacement. The sign is so recognisable that, according to Hogan, "everybody wants to steal it or buy it. People regard it as a trophy."&lt;ref name="Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard"/&gt; However, this recognition would also make it difficult for anyone else to display the sign in the event of its theft.&lt;ref name="Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard"/&gt;

==Verse==
[[John 3:7|The seventh verse of the third chapter]] of the [[Gospel of John]] reads, "Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’"

==Symbolism==
Hogan, originally from [[County Tipperary]], but living in [[County Limerick]],&lt;ref name="Garda station hot favourite for return of sign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seek and ye will find missing banner"/&gt; carries the John 3:7 sign as "a reminder that [[Jesus]] died for the sins of man".&lt;ref name="Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard"/&gt; Hogan originally had a sign which read "[[John 3:16]]" but changed this to the well known JOHN 3:7 after the Michael Jackson concert in Cork in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishnewsarchive.com/A-President-goes-AWOL.html |title=A President goes AWOL |newspaper=[[Nenagh Guardian]] |date=2000-07-08 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some time after Hogan started bringing the sign to the GAA games, Shane O'Brien started taking it to various events around Ireland like the Rose of Tralee, Galway Races, Cork Jazz Festival etc.... After doing this for a while he started recruiting a team to work with him on the streets at these festivals, and at weekends in Dublin.  Some of this team also bring signs to GAA games to which Hogan can't make it.  Since 2008, with the help of Philip Thompson, other teams have been formed in cities across Ireland and Britain.  They just stand there on the streets with the signs ready to talk with anyone who stops to ask. Hogan said, "People ask me what it means and I can tell them because they have asked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2000/0821/00082100047.html|title=Evangelist uses football to spread gospel message|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=2000-08-08|accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Hogan was banned from displaying the sign in Croke Park. However, stadium director Peter McKenna claimed this was a mistake and that Hogan and the sign would be welcome in Croke Park any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Allison |last=Bray |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/banned-biblical-banner-back-to-croker-2238268.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120903221056/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/banned-biblical-banner-back-to-croker-2238268.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-03 |title=Banned biblical banner back to Croker |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]] |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2010-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearances===
The sign was first tossed from a train window by some fanatical supporters.&lt;ref name="Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard"/&gt;
Hogan reported the sign missing again after a train journey which he undertook to return home from the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 2009|All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] quarter-final between [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] and [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] at [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]] on 2 August 2009.&lt;ref name="Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard"/&gt; Hogan had placed the billboard between carriages,&lt;ref name="Garda station hot favourite for return of sign"/&gt; and he first feared it had been stolen when "a lot of fellows got off and I discovered my sign was missing" as the train passed through [[Kildare]].&lt;ref name="Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard"/&gt; After quizzing some of his fellow passengers, some suggested that there had been jokes about stealing the sign from some of those who had left the train.&lt;ref name="Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard"/&gt; Hogan immediately contacted [[Garda Síochána|the Gardaí]] (police).&lt;ref name="Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard"/&gt; CCTV footage of the train journey was viewed but the sign was not found.&lt;ref name="Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0806/1224252080527.html|title=Fan on a mission for lost biblical billboard|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its disappearance, bookmakers offered odds as to where it might next reappear, including such novelty bets as Gaelic games stadium Croke Park where it had last been displayed at a match, a [[Lap dance|lap dancing]] club, [[Dáil Éireann]], the music festival [[Oxegen]] in 2010, or at religious sites such as [[Knock, County Mayo|Knock]] in [[County Mayo]] and the holy tree stump of [[Rathkeale]] in [[County Limerick]].&lt;ref name="Garda station hot favourite for return of sign"/&gt; [[Paddy Power]] also offered to purchase a replacement.&lt;ref name="Garda station hot favourite for return of sign"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leinsterleader.ie/news/Garda-station-hot-favourite-for.5535013.jp |title=Garda station hot favourite for return of sign |newspaper=[[Leinster Leader]] |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813011257/http://www.leinsterleader.ie/news/Garda-station-hot-favourite-for.5535013.jp |archivedate=2009-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign eventually turned up at Kildare Garda station in time for the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 2009|All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] semi-final between [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] and [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]].&lt;ref name="Seek and ye will find missing banner"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/breakaway-uda-group-claims-to-have-decommissioned-guns-and-explosives-1855268.html|title=Seek and ye will find missing banner|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=2009-08-09|accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making contact with the ''[[Leinster Leader]]'' newspaper, Hogan had returned from Dublin following an appearance on ''[[The Marian Finucane Show]]'', when he was informed that the sign had been retrieved.&lt;ref name="John 3:7 returned after tour of Kildare"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ruth |last=O'Brien |url=http://www.leinsterleader.ie/news/John-37-returned-after-tour.5546028.jp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218160501/http://www.leinsterleader.ie/news/John-37-returned-after-tour.5546028.jp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-18 |title=John 3:7 returned after tour of Kildare |newspaper=Leinster Leader |date=2009-08-12 |accessdate=2009-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It then emerged that the sign had spent an evening in a [[Kildare]] [[public house]] before embarking on a [[minibus]] journey to the south of the country via [[Kildangan]].&lt;ref name="John 3:7 returned after tour of Kildare"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
At the [[2001 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]], Galway fans came up with their own sign, "EUGENE 2:11". This was in reference to Galway full-forward [[Eugene Cloonan]], who scored 2-11 in the semi-final against [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] that same year.

On 1 November 2009, the Irish-language television channel [[TG4]] first aired a documentary about Frank Hogan and the JOHN 3:7 sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.limerickpost.ie/index.php/navigation-mainmenu-30/local-news/1151-frank-tells-it-as-it-is-in-tg4-documentary.html |title=Frank tells it as it is in TG4 documentary |newspaper=[[Limerick Post]] |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2011-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403031159/http://www.limerickpost.ie/index.php/navigation-mainmenu-30/local-news/1151-frank-tells-it-as-it-is-in-tg4-documentary.html |archivedate=2012-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John 3:16#Popular culture|Holding such signs]] is not unique to Ireland. It can be seen at many televised events in the United States. One famous practitioner in that country is the [[Rollen Stewart|Rainbow Man]].&lt;ref name=straightdope&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/457/whats-with-those-john-3 What's with those "John 3:16" signs] at ''[[The Straight Dope]]''. 23 January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

A John 3:7 sign was present in the crowd during the Buffalo Bills historic comeback versus the Houston Oilers in a 1993 National Football League playoff game.

'''Sir Lester Bryant Bird''', [[Order of the National Hero (Antigua and Barbuda)|KNH]] (born 21 February 1938) was the [[Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda#Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda, 1981-present|second Prime Minister]] of [[Antigua and Barbuda]] from 1994 to 2004 and a well-known athlete. He was chairman of the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP) from 1971 to 1983, then became Prime Minister when his father, [[Vere Bird|Sir Vere Bird]], the previous Prime Minister, resigned.

==Early life and education==
Bird was born in [[New York City]] on 21 February 1938.&lt;ref name="East"&gt;Roger East and Richard Thomas, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mz-fXRsedPMC Profiles of people in power: the world's government leaders]" (2003). Psychology Press, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lester and his elder brother [[Vere Bird Jr.]], also a British-educated lawyer, have been considered sometime rivals, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' writing in 1990 that Lester had always overshadowed his brother, according to those who have known them both.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;Howard W. French, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/16/world/island-s-hushed-scandals-unhushed.html Island's Hushed Scandals, Unhushed]", ''The New York Times'', June 16, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glass"&gt;Robert Glass, "Caribbean Island Focus of International Arms Scandal", Associated Press, May 14, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Antigua Grammar School and was brought up as a [[Methodism|Methodist]]. Bird was a [[cricket]] player in his youth, playing for the [[Leeward Islands]], and a [[long jump]] champion. He won a bronze medal in the long jump at the [[1959 Pan American Games]] in [[Chicago]] while representing the [[West Indies Federation|British West Indies]]. He attended the [[University of Michigan]], where he was [[All-American]] long jumper in 1960 and graduated in 1962.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glass"/&gt; Bird completed his study of law in Britain and was [[called to the bar]] at [[Gray's Inn]] in 1969. From 1969 to 1976, Bird engaged in private practice in Antigua.&lt;ref name="East"/&gt;

==Political career==
Bird's political career began in 1971, when he was nominated to the [[Senate of Antigua and Barbuda|Senate]]. The frequently-dominant Antigua Labour Party was in opposition for a five-year period. Bird was named chairman of the ALP and the [[leader of the opposition]] in the Senate. Lester continued to served as leader of the opposition until he was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Antigua and Barbuda|House of Representatives]] at the 1976 elections, when the ALP returned to power.&lt;ref name="East"/&gt; Bird joined his father's government as Deputy Prime Minister. In addition to serving as Deputy Prime Minister, Bird also served as Minister of Economic Development, Tourism, and Energy. Bird's tenure as Minister of Tourism and Minister of Economic Development was controversial, and he personally benefited from tourism partnerships with foreign investors, including in the construction of the Royal Antiguan Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn L. Cartier and Alan A. Lew, ''Seductions of place: geographical perspectives on globalization and touristed landscapes'' (2005). Psychology Press: p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following independence in 1981, Bird gained the external affairs portfolio and was the first chairman of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States in 1982. He was chairman of OECS for a second time in 1989.&lt;ref name="East"/&gt; The ALP government and Bird himself won [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1994|re-election in 1994]] and [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1999|1999]]. These elections, as well as the 1989 elections, were highly controversial; the 1989 elections were "marred by irregularities and fraud" and charges made by the opposition, described as credible by [[Freedom House]], that the ALP used bribery and intimidation and exerted undue influence over the elections supervisor.&lt;ref name="Freedom House"&gt;[[Freedom House]], ''Freedom in the World: The Annual Survey of Political Rights &amp; Civil Liberties, 1993-1994'' (1994). University Press of America, pp. 117-119.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 was deemed nor free or fair in an independent report which concluded that the opposition [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] (UPP) could "conceivably could have won a majority of seats in parliament" if the election had been fair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ero-en/regions/americas/AG/Antigua%20and%20Barbuda%20-%20elctions%201999.pdf "The Failings of Governance in Antigua &amp; Barbuda: The Elections of 1999"], June 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALP had been divided by a succession crisis between Lester Bird and Vere Bird, Jr., since 1989. Lester Bird lost his deputy prime minister post in 1991, but retained the external affairs ministry and the planning and trade portfolio. Sir Vere Bird was initially thought to have favoured Vere Jr. until an arms scandal in which the elder son had been found to have been involved in the smuggling of weapons from Antigua to the [[Colombia]]n [[Medellín Cartel]].&lt;ref name="East"/&gt;&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedom House"/&gt; Vere Bird, Jr., then Minister of Public Works, was dismissed from office and an inquiry, led by [[Louis Blom-Cooper|Sir Louis Blom-Cooper]], [[Queen's Counsel|Q.C.]], recommended that he never be allowed to hold office again (although he subsequently did return to office), boosting Lester Bird's chances to follow his father in the prime ministership and defusing pressure for Vere Bird to step down.&lt;ref name="East"/&gt;&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedom House"/&gt;

In 1992, another scandal, involving Sir Vere Bird's siphoning of public funds into a personal account, furthered calls for him to step down, with three opposition parties uniting to form the UPP under the leadership of [[Baldwin Spencer]]. Following a successful [[general strike]] called by the UPP, Sir Vere announced in March 1992 he would step down at the 1994 general elections.&lt;ref name="East"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedom House"/&gt; The ALP succession crisis continued following this, with a special convention to elect a successor on May 24, 1992 resulting in a deadlock between Lester Bird and John St. Luce, the [[information minister]]. The ALP leadership question was finally settled at the party's September 1993 convention, at which Lester won the leadership of the party, defeating St Luce, 169 votes to 131. The party post of ALP chairman went to Vere Jr.&lt;ref name="East"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedom House"/&gt;

In the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1994|March 1994 elections]], the ALP under Bird's leadership won 11 out of 17 seats even as the opposition criticized the ALP over corruption issues. During the election the ALP pledged [[open government]], an [[ombudsman]] to deal with citizen complaints, and new jobs, especially in [[Economy of Antigua and Barbuda|tourism]]. Bird assumed the prime ministership on March 9, 1994.&lt;ref name="East"/&gt; He appointed St. Luce (but not his brother Vere Jr.) to the cabinet. (Vere Jr. was subsequently named special adviser). Lester Bird took the portfolios for external affairs, planning, [[social services]], and information for himself, and in a 1996 [[cabinet reshuffle]] also took the communications, [[civil aviation]], international transport, and [[Gambling|gaming]] portfolios.&lt;ref name="East"/&gt;

In the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1994|1999 elections]], the ALP increased its parliamentary majority by one seat, holding 12 seats. Bird was reconfirmed as prime minister and elevated Vere Jr. to the cabinet as [[minister of agriculture]], marking his full [[political rehabilitation]].  Bird also shuffled his own portfolios and by December 2002 held the foreign affairs, finance, legal affairs, justice, and [[national security]] ministries in addition to being the prime minister.&lt;ref name="East"/&gt;

In the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2004|March 2004 election]], the ALP was defeated by the [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] (UPP) led by [[Baldwin Spencer]]. Bird's party lost eight seats, and he himself was defeated by [[Errol Cort]], who became Minister of Finance in the new UPP government.

Bird remained the ALP's political leader following the party's 2004 defeat. He led the party in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2009|March 2009 election]]; although the ALP lost the election, it gained 3 seats from the UPP and Bird defeated Cort by 96 votes in the St John's Rural East constituency, where he had lost in 2004. He subsequently held the position of [[Leader of the Opposition|Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caribbeanelections.com/antigua/results/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125051829/http://www.caribbeanelections.com/antigua/results/default.asp |archivedate=2009-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiguasun.com/paper/?as=view&amp;sun=281935077507132005&amp;an=140029119612282007&amp;ac=Columnist "Different parties similar woes - Reviewing the political affairs of 2007"], ''Antigua Sun'', December 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird was succeeded as ALP leader by [[Gaston Browne]] in 2012, who led the party to victory in [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2014|June 2014 general election]]. Bird won a seat and again defeated Errol Cort.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Charles, [http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/13/4175779/antigua-prime-minister-baldwin.html "Browne becomes new prime minister of Antigua, youngest ever"], ''Miami Herald'', 13 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, he was made a [[Order of the National Hero (Antigua and Barbuda)|Knight of the Order of the National Hero]] (KNH) by Antigua and Barbuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://antiguaobserver.com/sir-lester-bird-receives-abs-highest-national-honour/|title = Sir Lester Bird receives A&amp;B’s highest national honour|date = 2014|accessdate = 10 January 2016|website = |publisher = The Daily Observer|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:luha.jpg|right|thumb|A spoon-fork combination used by Finnish military]]
'''Lusikkahaarukka''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈlusikːɑhɑːrukːɑ}}, ''spoon-fork'') is a [[stainless steel]], folding spoon-fork combination issued together with a [[mess kit]] in the [[Finnish Army]]. It is widely used in camping and outdoors activities.

The spoon portion is a slightly oversized [[soup spoon]] which makes it useful for stirring when the mess kit is used to cook rations in the field. The fork portion is rarely used as most foods are more easily eaten with the spoon. When folded, the {{lang|fi|lusikkahaarukka}} can be inserted in a fitting slot on the Finnish army mess kit, although this is discouraged because, more often than not, it slips off from the fittings and starts to rattle around. The Finnish army conscripts are allowed to carry their civilian [[puukko]]s while in uniform, and everyone is assumed to own one, so a separate knife is not needed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Originally invented along {{lang|fi|pakki}} ([[mess kit]]) in [[Imperial Germany]] in late 19th or early 20th century it came to [[Finland]] along [[Jäger Movement|Jägers]] in 1918. The copy of original model of the {{lang|fi|lusikkahaarukka}} is manufactured by [[Hackman]] and is one of the oldest items still in use by the Finnish army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of folks and other designer cutlery|url=http://www.studiowillia.com/GB/shop/who-we-are.html|year=2014|publisher=STUDIO WILLIAM WELCH}}{{deadlink|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|fi|lusikkahaarukka}} are very hard wearing, indeed current conscripts are commonly issued with {{lang|fi|lusikkahaarukka}} manufactured during [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Also known as==
* LuHa – [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]] analogous to [[spork]]
* Lusikkahaarukka-mysteeri – Translates as "spoon-fork mystery".
* Mysteerio – literally "[[mystery play]]".

'''Palestine Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|ملعب فلسطين}}) is located in [[Gaza City]] on the [[Gaza Strip]]. It is the national [[stadium]] and the home of [[Palestine national football team]]. The stadium's capacity is around 10,000. 

It was bombed by [[Israel]] on April 1, 2006, directly on the centre spot, and is currently unusable due to the crater formed. [[FIFA]] has announced that it will fund the repair work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalgame.com/blog/2006/04/field-artillery-bombings-in-kibbutz-and-gaza-represent-new-pitch-invasion/|title=Field artillery - Bombings in kibbutz and Gaza represent new pitch invasion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3239176,00.html|title=FIFA to fund Gaza soccer field repair|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was again bombed on November 19, 2012, by the [[Israeli Defence Force]] as part of [[Operation Pillar of Cloud]]. Israel claimed that the latest bombing was due to its  use by militants to launch rockets targeting Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/iaf-bombed-the-gaza-stadium-where-missiles-were-fired-from-the-grass/2012/11/19/?src=ataglance|title=IAF Bombed the Gaza Stadium, where Missiles Were Fired from the Grass|author=Jewish Press Staff|work=The Jewish Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6335">[[File:Freire Hincapie RVV2008.JPG|thumb|[[Óscar Freire]] became the new holder of the Ruban Jaune when he won [[Paris–Tours]] in October 2010.]]
The '''Ruban Jaune''' ''(English; Yellow Ribbon)'' is a cycling trophy created in 1936 by [[Henri Desgrange]], awarded to the rider recording the fastest average speed in a professional [[Bicycle racing|cycling race]] or [[Race stage#Bicycle race stage|stage]] longer than 200&amp;nbsp;km. The trophy’s name is thought is to have come from comparison with the [[Blue Riband]] trophy awarded to the passenger liner crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in record time. Desgrange changed the colour to yellow to reflect the [[newsprint]] of [[L'Équipe#L'Auto|L'Auto]], the sports newspaper he edited. The timing of the record must be by two independent timekeepers using certified timing equipment which has been recently calibrated. Because of these strict rules it was unofficially accepted in the latter part of the 20th century that only times in [[Classic cycle races|classic races]] would be accepted.&lt;ref name="memoire"&gt;[http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/dossiers/dos_ruban_jaune.php  Memoire du Cyclisme.net.] Gives some history and list of holders.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first holder of the Ruban Jaune was [[Gustave Danneels]] of Belgium, who won the 1936 [[Paris–Tours]] in 41.455&amp;nbsp;km/h. Paris–Tours was long associated with the Ruban Jaune because its flat course, coupled with a following wind, makes for a fast speed. [[Jules Rossi]] of Italy took the record in 1938 when covering 251&amp;nbsp;km at an average 42.092 in Paris–Tours.

The suspension of top-class cycling during [[World War II]] meant Rossi’s record stood for ten years until April 4, 1948, when [[Rik Van Steenbergen]] won [[Paris–Roubaix]] at 43.612&amp;nbsp;km/h. The race had a violent tailwind. Van Steenbergen attacked at [[Hem, Nord|Hem]] 6&amp;nbsp;km from the finish, catching [[Emile Idée]] and [[Fiorenzo Magni]] and then beating Idée in a sprint in [[Roubaix Velodrome]]. In 1955 the record returned to Paris–Tours when [[Jacques Dupont (cyclist)|Jacques Dupont]] covered the 253.7&amp;nbsp;km at 43.766&amp;nbsp;km/h.

Dupont held the record until 1962 when [[Jo de Roo]] won Paris–Tours at 44.903&amp;nbsp;km/h over 267.5&amp;nbsp;km. However, the previous year had two unratified claims. Jean Anastasi won a 218&amp;nbsp;km stage of the 1961 [[Paris–Nice]] between [[St Etienne]] and [[Avignon]] at 44.917&amp;nbsp;km/h. The record was not recognised because the course had not been properly measured. Also in 1961 Walter Martin of Italy won [[Milano–Torino]] in 45.094&amp;nbsp;km but this too was not accepted.

In 1964 [[Peter Post]] claimed the Ruban Jaune in winning Paris–Roubaix in 45.129&amp;nbsp;km/h,the race run at speed from the start. This was augmented by the final break at [[Attiches]] 33&amp;nbsp;km from the finish. It contained two riders from the Flandria team and three from Weils-Groene-Leeuw and they worked together to keep a high speed with the race decided in a sprint.&lt;ref name="sergent"&gt;''"A Century Of Paris–Roubaix"'', Pascal Sergent, {{ISBN|0-9531729-0-2}}, Gives details of 1948 and 1964 editions of Paris–Roubaix.&lt;/ref&gt; Post’s record stood for more than a decade although the 1969 [[Milano–Vignola]] was initially won by Roger Kindt in a record average of 45.995&amp;nbsp;km/h before he was disqualified at the medical control and victory was awarded to Attilio Rota. Post’s record was beaten by [[Freddy Maertens]] in the 1975 Paris-Brussels, an average 46.11&amp;nbsp;km/h over 285.5&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;''"European Cycling: The 20 Greatest Races"'', Noel Henderson, {{ISBN|0-941950-20-4}}, pp129-130, Gives history and details of 1975 Paris-Brussels.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrei Tchmil]] set a record in 1997 when he won the 254.5&amp;nbsp;km Paris–Tours in 47.168&amp;nbsp;km/h. The race covered 49.3&amp;nbsp;km in the first hour and 48.9&amp;nbsp;km in the second. Tchmil beat [[Max Sciandri]] in a sprint after the two had broken away 5&amp;nbsp;km from the finish.&lt;ref name="cycling news 1"&gt;[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/results/archives/oct97/parto97a.html  Cyclingnews.com] Gives details of 1997 edition of Paris–Tours.&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Zabel set a new best in the 2003 Paris–Tours of 47.55&amp;nbsp;km/h over 257&amp;nbsp;km, a brisk tailwind pushing the race over 51&amp;nbsp;km in the fourth hour as the riders flew down the [[River Loire|Loire]] valley. Zabel eventually won the race in a bunch sprint in [[Tours]].&lt;ref name="cycling news 2"&gt;[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2003/worldcup03/paristours03/?id=results  Cyclingnews.com] Gives details of 2003 edition of Paris–Tours.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, 2010 [[Óscar Freire]] broke the record yet again in Paris–Tours, taking advantage of a favourable wind over a new shortened course of 233&amp;nbsp;km, he covered the distance in 4 hours 52 mins 54 seconds at an average speed of 47.730&amp;nbsp;km per hour.&lt;ref name="cycling news 3"&gt;[http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/paris-tours-1-hc/results  Cyclingnews.com] Gives details of 2010 edition of Paris–Tours.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saurimo FC''', formerly '''Bikuku FC''' is an [[Angola]]n [[sports club]] from the city of [[Saurimo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jornaldeangola.sapo.ao/desporto/bikuku_fc_e_uniao_do_cuanza-norte__fazem_estreia |title=Bikuku FC e União do Cuanza-Norte fazem estreia |publisher=jornaldeangola |accessdate= 18 Jun 2018 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was named after the original owner, Angolan businessman Ernesto dos Santos Lino, aka Santos ''Bikuku''.

In 2018, the team qualified to the Gira Angola, the qualifying tournament for Angola's top division, the [[Girabola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angop.ao/angola/pt_pt/noticias/desporto/2018/5/24/Futebol-Bikuku-vence-Sporting-Benguela-Ficha-Tecnica,69c3266f-a0b5-4b4f-b68c-980fd63903b2.html |title=Futebol: Bikuku FC vence Sporting de Benguela (Ficha Técnica) |publisher=ANGOP.com |date=17 Jun 2018 |accessdate= 18 Jun 2018 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its participation in the Girabola, the club changed its name to '''Saurimo FC'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19592">{{About|the baseball history organization|baseball statistical analysis|Sabermetrics|other uses|SABR (disambiguation)}}
The '''Society for American Baseball Research''' ('''SABR''') is a membership organization dedicated to fostering the research and dissemination of the history and record of [[baseball]].  Established in [[Cooperstown, New York]], in August 1971 by sportswriter [[Bob Davids]],&lt;ref name=BobDavids&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Davids|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|url=http://citrix.drharoldseymour.com/about/bob-davids|accessdate=2011-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426061310/http://citrix.drharoldseymour.com/about/bob-davids|archive-date=2012-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

==Membership==
While the acronym "SABR" may have lent its root to the word [[sabermetrics]] (for the use of sophisticated mathematical tools to analyze baseball), the Society is about much more than [[statistics]].  Well known figures in the baseball world such as [[Bob Costas]],  [[Keith Olbermann]], [[Craig R. Wright]], and [[Roland Hemond|Rollie Hemond]] are members, along with highly regarded "sabermetricians" such as [[Bill James]] and [[Rob Neyer]].

Among [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] players [[Jeff Bajenaru]] was believed to have been (until 2006) the only active player with a SABR membership; [[Elden Auker]], [[Larry Dierker]], and [[Andy Seminick]] also have been involved.

Some prominent SABR members: 
{{div col}}
* [[Bob Davids]], founder (deceased)
* [[Bob McConnell]], Home Run Log (deceased)
* [[Bill Carle]], Biographical Committee
* [[Don Daglow]], computer game designer, writer&lt;ref name="cgw199208"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=97 | title=Designing People... | work=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1992 | accessdate=3 July 2014 | pages=48–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bill James]], analyst, writer
* [[Larry Lester]], Negro Leagues Committee
* Ron Liebman. Historical Stats &amp; Trivia
* [[David Nemec]], prolific writer
* [[Rob Neyer]], analyst, journalist
* [[Pete Palmer]], analyst, encyclopedist
* [[David Smith (baseball historian)|Dave Smith]], analyst, [[Retrosheet]] founder
* [[Lyle Spatz]], Records Committee
* [[John Thorn]], historian, encyclopedist
* [[Robert L. Tiemann]], historian  
* [[David W. Vincent]], Home Run Log (deceased)
{{div col end}}

==Activities==
Only a minority of members pursue "number crunching" research.  Rather, the SABR community is organized both by interest and geography:

*'''Research Committees''' study a particular issue
*'''Regional Chapters''' link members by proximity.  The latter are frequently named after baseball personalities relevant to their region.
* SABR also has an active '''Biography Project''',[http://sabr.org/bioproject/] with members authoring well-researched and engaging biographies of a growing list of former big league ballplayers and other notable contributors to the game.

SABR members keep in touch through online directories and electronic mailing lists set up through the SABR headquarters. The headquarters also maintains a number of research tools on its website, including a lending library, home run and triple play logs, and course syllabi related to the game.

SABR holds annual conventions in a different city each year.  The conference generally includes panel discussions, research presentations, city-specific tourism, a ballgame, and an awards banquet. The 2007 convention in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] set the attendance record with 726 registered attendees out of approximately 7,000 SABR members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabr.org/content/sabr-convention-history|title=SABR Convention History - Society for American Baseball Research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also sponsors a [[baseball analytics]] conference in Phoenix&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabr.org/analytics|title=SABR Analytics Conference - Society for American Baseball Research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an annual [[Jerry Malloy Negro League Conference|Negro Leagues conference]], held in a different location each year.

'''''The Baseball Research Journal''''' (BRJ) is SABR's flagship publication since 1972 for members to publish and share their research with like-minded students of baseball. '''''The National Pastime''''' is an annual, published from 1982 to 2008 as '''''The National Pastime: A Review of Baseball History''''', when it was intended as a more literary outlet than the stats oriented ''BRJ''; since 2009 it is a convention-focused journal, with articles about the geographic region where the convention is taking place that year.&lt;ref name="Publications"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sabr.org/about/publications | title=Publications | publisher=Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Society publications are an increasing variety of books (since 1976) and ebooks (since 2011);&lt;ref name="Other Society Publications"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sabr.org/about/history/10 | title=Other Society Publications  | publisher=Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8-10 new e-books published annually are all free to members.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sabr.org/about | title=The SABR Story| publisher=Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South African Polo Association''' ''(SAPA)'' is the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for the [[sport]] of [[polo]] in [[South Africa]]. It is affiliated with the [[Federation of International Polo]] (FIP) and the [[Hurlingham Polo Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SA Polo|url=http://www.sapolo.co.za/about/about-sa-polo|website=sapolo.co.za|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board of SAPA is made up of an elected President, a Vice-President along with an Executive Committee consisting of provincial representatives,  Ladies Polo representative, amongst other members elected during the association's AGM. SAPA's constitution was originally instituted in 1905 confirming it as one of the earliest sporting organizations established in South Africa. SAPA administers the season fixtures list for competitions, the handicaps of both amateur and professional polo players, the resolution of disciplinary issues related to the sport, the coordination of development programmes for the formerly disadvantaged persons and the governing of policies associated with polo and polo ponies. SAPA is accountable for providing sponsorship for its representative national teams participating in several international polo matches and competitions.

==History==
Initially polo was originally the domain of British cavalry, but it was army officers from the infantry that introduced the game to the country. The former [[75th (Stirlingshire) Regiment of Foot]], then acknowledged as [[Gordon Highlanders]], after military service in Singapore and Hong Kong, was posted to the Cape Province, and was engaged in minor exercises in Lower [[Drakensberg]]. The [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (the first Battalion), was stationed in South Africa around this time from [[Mauritius]]. The two regiments were based in [[King William’s Town]], close to [[East London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EsxYBYIFEoYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=%C2%A0also+known+as+the+gordon+highlanders+after+service+in+hong&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aqaQozqeXM&amp;sig=nF1BuaCh_4N0DVPmjcSqjKn5J6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt3o6D4_TWAhUFfRoKHTWYBRkQ6AEIITAB  |title= Polo in Britain: A History |page=68 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAPA_History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Polo in South Africa|url=http://www.sapolo.co.za/about/history-of-polo-in-south-africa|website=sapolo.co.za|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cape Mounted Rifles]], which was a local South African unit was also stationed in the area. The first polo game on record was played in October 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Partnership South African Polo Association – POLO+10|url= http://www.poloplus10.com/media-partnership-south-african-polo-association-polo10-40599/|website=poloplus10.com|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=noT2BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA350&amp;dq=The+first+recorded+polo+game+in+south+africa+was+in+October+1874&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20first%20recorded%20polo%20game%20in%20south%20africa%20was%20in%20October%201874&amp;f=false |title=The Polo Encyclopedia, 2d Ed. |page=351 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9i-bgOjaVysC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=The+first+recorded+polo+game+in+south+africa+was+in+October+1874&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20first%20recorded%20polo%20game%20in%20south%20africa%20was%20in%20October%201874&amp;f=false |title=The Evolution of Polo |page=44 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the Cape Mounted Rifles and the Gordon Highlanders in [[King William's Town]] Parade Ground.

Polo playing as a sport continued in [[Cape Town]] around 1885 at a polo club established by army officers, while in [[Natal Province|Natal]], it was played by army officers based at Fort Napier. The following year, in 1886, the Garrison Polo Club was established in [[Pietermaritzburg]].&lt;ref name="SAPA_History"/&gt; The Military Ninth Division engaged in polo matches around the 1880s at [[Harrismith]], in the Free State, whereas the playing of polo in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] started in [[Johannesburg]] in 1894. The Dargle Polo Club was regarded as the first civilian club established in South Africa, although this claim is a subject of dispute by members of the Mooi River Polo Club. The South African Polo Calendar in 1902 noted the year of foundation as – 1886 for Dargle Polo Club and – 1889 for Mooi River Polo Club. Another of the pioneering civilian polo clubs was Tintern Polo Club, established around 1893. Subsequently, other civilian polo clubs established in the 1890s were Greytown, Durban,  the Shaws’ Karkloof, Nottingham Road, Kokstad, Matatiele, Merino Walk and Underberg.&lt;ref name="SAPA_History"/&gt;

Polo started in [[Port Elizabeth]] around 1888. The South African Polo Association was established in 1906 to which five provincial associations became its affiliates – East Griqualand, Highveld, Free State, KwaZulu Natal and the Cape.&lt;ref name="SAPA_History"/&gt; There are around 38 polo clubs in South Africa with an estimated 450 polo players. It was around the late 1940s and the early 1950s that women’s polo began in South Africa mainly through the efforts of Cicely FitzPatrick, that was highlighted when she launched the Addo Polo Club at [[Uitenhage]], in the Cape Province.&lt;ref name="SAPA_History"/&gt; In 1932 the first officially recorded ladies' match was played between the ladies’ teams from Durban and Connington. In 1948, the Natal Ladies’ Polo Association was established.

'''''Weeds on Fire''''' ({{zh|c=點五步|j=dim2 ng5 bou6}}; literally "half a step") is a 2016 Hong Kong film adapted from the true story of the Shatin Martins, the first [[baseball]] team from Hong Kong to win a league. The film is directed by Stevefat and stars [[Liu Kai-chi]], [[:zh:林耀聲|Lam Yiu-sing]] and [[:zh:胡子彤|Tony Wu Tsz-tung]]. The film was released on 25 August 2016.

==Plot==
1984 is a year where many changes take place, such as the signing of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] as well as the opening of [[New Town Plaza]] and the first dragon boat race on [[Shing Mun River]].

Tse Chi-lung "Lung" ([[:zh:林耀聲|Lam Yiu-sing]]), a resident of [[Wo Che Estate]], and his neighbour and long-time friend Fan Chun-wai "Wai" (Tony Wu) enter Kei Kok College, a lowest-tier secondary school whose students' discipline is notorious in [[Sha Tin District]]. Kei Kok's principal, Lu Kwong-fai ([[Liu Kai-chi]]), receives fundings from the [[Sha Tin District Council|District Board]] with the support of District Officer [[Donald Tsang|Mr Tsang]] ([[:zh:潘燦良|Poon Chan-leung]]) to establish the territory's first Chinese teenage baseball team, which he believes can turn bad students good. Acting also as the coach, Lu recruits Lung, Wai and eight of their fellow schoolmates, who all live under uneasy conditions, to the baseball team named the Shatin Martins. He enforces strict discipline so as to remind the members to work and behave as a team, especially after their first humiliating defeat to a junior team.

Lung often looks up to Wai, who is smarter and physically stronger than him. Wai has started a romantic relationship with his schoolmate Tsz-ching ([[:zh:談善言|Hedwig Tam]]) whereas Lung does not even dare to speak to Ling (Sadie Wang) whom he has a crush on. After Wai is chosen as the [[pitcher]] of the Shatin Martins, he takes pride in himself and belittles his teammates. In the first match of the Little League, Wai starts a fight with the rival team, prompting Lu to publicly replace him with Lung. Feeling betrayed by his friend, an ashamed, Wai withdraws from baseball and school, rejoins gang activities and abandons his now-pregnant girlfriend. Lung is at first angry with Lu for alienating Wai, but later reconciles with him. With the departure of the most outstanding member, the Shatin Martins work closer and train harder together, finally winning the tickets to the final of the league.

Right before the final match, Lung experiences several shocks in his life. First, his family is torn apart by his mother's extramarital affairs. Second, although he has summoned the courage to speak to Ling, she has a boyfriend already. Third, he finds out Wai is involved in illegal acts in order to attempt to provide subsidy for Tsz-ching's abortion since she is now on her own after splitting with her family. But she refuses to give up her baby. Lu reminds him to stay focused as the half-a-step he takes at the pitcher's mound will decide the fate of the team.

At the final, the Shatin Martins have a hard match against the Japan-based Buffaloes, being far behind in four [[inning]]s. Wai cannot keep his promise to show up to support them, as he is performing a dangerous mission. Worried about Wai, Lung fails to concentrate on playing and is hit in the face by the ball struck by the [[Batting (baseball)|batter]]. As he falls onto the ground, he realises he must stand up by himself to prove himself capable to Wai. The Shatin Martins manages to come up from behind and eventually wins by 13-12, becoming the first Hong Kong team to win the championship.

Although Wai is seriously injured, he survives and is taken care of at hospital. Lung learns how to adapt to changes, looking to his father and Tsz-ching as examples. Lu remains unmarried and dedicates himself to education and baseball. In recognition of the historic title, the [[Hong Kong Government|government]] names a bridge over Shing Mun River after the team.

On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Shatin Martins, Lung visits the [[Umbrella Square|Admiralty Occupy Site]] during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|Umbrella Movement]] and recalls the spirit of not giving up hopes despite of failures.

==Production==
The director Chan Chi-fat (Stevefat) and scriptwriter Wong Chi-yeung are alumni of the Academy of Film, [[Hong Kong Baptist University]]. Chan won the First Feature Film Initiative competition (Higher Education Institutions Group) of Creative Hong Kong in 2013 and was awarded a budget of HK$2 million by the Film Development Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hkbuenews.hkbu.edu.hk/?t=enews_details/433 |title=Academy of Film alumnus Steve Chan awarded HK$2 million in Government funding to make his first feature film |publisher=Hong Kong Baptist University |date= 2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the budget was insufficient to produce a normal-size commercial film, the crew had to mobilise support from fresh graduates and students of the Academy of Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=zh-hk |url=http://www.hk01.com/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/9106/%E6%B8%AF%E7%89%88-KANO-%E9%9B%BB%E5%BD%B1%E7%AF%80%E7%86%B1%E8%B3%A3-%E9%BB%9E%E4%BA%94%E6%AD%A5-%E5%B0%8E%E6%BC%94-%E7%8F%8D%E6%83%9C-%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%9F- |title=港版《KANO》電影節熱賣 《點五步》導演：珍惜「本土」 |publisher=香港01 |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the crew and the cast were underpaid or even unpaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=zh-hk |url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/entertainment/art/20160417/19574226 |title=好戲派：80後熱血導演大膽作 《點五步》屋邨仔發圍 |publisher=''Apple Daily'' |date= 2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film was featured at the 40th [[Hong Kong International Film Festival]] in March 2016, where its tickets sold out quickly. It was distributed by Golden Scene and publicly released on 25 August 2016.

==Historical references==
Based on historical events, ''Weeds on Fires'' made some alternation for dramatic purpose. Historical photos and accounts were provided at the epilogue of the film. The historical Shatin Martins was established in 1982 whereas it was altered to 1984 in the film, in order to fit into the time-line of the story. The historical [[:zh:盧光輝|Lu Kwong-fai]] was the principal of Kei Kok Primary School instead of a secondary school; therefore, the Shatin Martins were formed by primary schoolers rather than teenagers. Mr Tsang, Sha Tin District Officer portrayed by Poon Chan-leung, was based on [[Donald Tsang]], who provided elemental support in the establishment of the team and recalled it as the most memorable event during his service in Sha Tin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=zh-hk |url=http://mos.hk/shatin/10/18/26 |title=全港第一支華人少年棒球隊 沙燕隊 |publisher=馬鞍商民康促進會}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=zh-hk |url=http://topick.hket.com/article/1481819/%E6%A3%92%E7%90%83%E6%A0%A1%E9%95%B7%E7%9B%A7%E5%85%89%E8%BC%9DX%E5%BB%96%E5%95%9F%E6%99%BA%EF%BC%9A%E5%BE%9E%E4%B8%8D%E6%A8%99%E7%B1%A4%E5%AD%B8%E7%94%9F |title=棒球校長盧光輝X廖啟智：從不標籤學生 |publisher=TOPick |date= 2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
