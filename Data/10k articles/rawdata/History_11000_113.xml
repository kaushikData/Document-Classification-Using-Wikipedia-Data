On the evening of 26 March 1997, the [[Provisional IRA]] [[Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade|East Tyrone Brigade]] launched an improvised grenade attack on the fortified [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]/[[British Army]] base in [[Coalisland]], [[County Tyrone]], Northern Ireland. The blast sparked an immediate reaction by an undercover [[Special Air Service]] unit, who shot and wounded Gareth Doris, an [[Irish republican]] and alleged IRA volunteer. The SAS unit was then surrounded by a crowd of protesters who prevented them approaching Doris or leaving. RUC officers arrived and fired [[plastic bullet]]s at the crowd, allowing the special forces to leave the area.&lt;ref name=elite&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/09:40+TERRORISTS+BOMB+BASE+09:41+SAS+GUN+DOWN+SUSPECT;+MINUTE+BY...-a061117667 "How Elite Squad Pounced"] by Conor Hanna. Daily Mirror, 28 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

== Previous incidents ==
{{See also|Clonoe ambush|1992 Coalisland riots}}
Coalisland is a town in County Tyrone that had a tradition of militant republicanism; five residents had been killed by British security forces before the first IRA ceasefire in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, Kevin (1995).''Rebel Hearts: journeys within the IRA's soul''. Picador, p. 38. {{ISBN|0-312-15632-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1992, four IRA volunteers were killed in a gun battle with the SAS during their escape after a machine gun attack on the RUC/British Army barracks there.&lt;ref&gt;McKittrick, David (1999). ''Lost lives''. Mainstream, p. 965. {{ISBN|1-84018-227-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, an IRA bomb attack on a British Army patrol at [[Cappagh, County Tyrone|Cappagh]], in which a paratrooper lost his legs, triggered a series of clashes between local residents and British troops on 12 and 17 May. A number of civilians and soldiers were injured, a soldier's [[Clansman (military radio)|backpack radio]] destroyed and two British weapons stolen.&lt;ref&gt;Fortnight issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The meleé was followed by a 500-strong protest in the town and bitter exchanges between Republic of Ireland and British officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37020&amp;Itemid=18 ''The Irish Emigrant''], "Paratroopers remain in North". Issue No.277, 25 May 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident at the RUC base ==

=== Bomb attack ===

At 9:40 pm on Wednesday 26 March 1997, a grenade&lt;ref name=cousin/&gt; was thrown at the joint British Army/RUC base at Coalisland, blowing a hole in the perimeter fence. The RUC reported that a 1&amp;nbsp;kg device hit the fence {{convert|10|ft|m}} off the ground.&lt;ref name=elite/&gt; Another source claimed that the device was a coffee-jar bomb filled with [[Semtex]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/05/0510/ulster.shtml BBC Politics 97] Retrieved on 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The grenade was thrown or fired&lt;ref name=fear/&gt; by two unidentified men.&lt;ref name=cousin/&gt; At the time of the attack, there was an art exhibition at Coalisland Heritage Hall, also known as The Mill, from where the explosion and the gunshots that followed were clearly heard. The incident lasted one to two minutes.&lt;ref name=human/&gt;

===Undercover operation===
Just one minute after the IRA attack, bypassers heard high-velocity rounds buzzing around them.&lt;ref name=elite/&gt; A number of men, apparently SAS soldiers, got out of civilian vehicles wearing baseball caps with "Army" stamped on the front.&lt;ref name=human/&gt; A first-hand source initially described them as members of the [[14 Intelligence Company]]. The men were firing [[Browning Hi-Power|Browning pistol]]s and [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5|Heckler &amp; Koch sub- machine guns]]. Witnesses said there were eight to ten gunshots,&lt;ref name=human&gt;Smith, Christopher H. (1999).''Human Rights in Northern Ireland: Congressional Hearing ''. DIANE Publishing, p.111. {{ISBN|0-7881-8107-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a republican source claimed that up to 18 rounds were fired.&lt;ref name=rep&gt;[http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/28107 An Phoblacht, 3 April 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen-year-old Gareth Doris was shot in the stomach and fell to the ground.&lt;ref name=elite/&gt; Doris was allegedly returning from the local church&lt;ref&gt;Communist League candidate says: "Include Sinn Féin in talks now" by Marcella Fitzgerald. [[The Militant]], 28 March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and was in the company of a priest when he was shot.&lt;ref&gt;The need for new and acceptable policy in Northern Ireland: hearing before the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, One Hundred Sixth Congress, first session, 22 April 1999, Volumen 4&lt;/ref&gt; A local priest, Seamus Rice, was driving out of the church car park when his car was hit by bullets, smashing the windscreen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch97.htm#Mar CAIN – 1997 chronology of events]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Platers Hill, Coalisland - geograph.org.uk - 1413571.jpg|thumb|250px|Platers Hill in Coalisland (2009), looking toward the town center and former RUC/Army base (middle)]]
Three minutes after the blast, hundreds of angry residents gathered at the scene and confronted the undercover soldiers. The soldiers fired live rounds at the ground&lt;ref name=human/&gt; and into the air to keep people back.&lt;ref name=elite/&gt; The crowd kept drawing back and moving forward again&lt;ref name=human/&gt; until 9:50, when the RUC arrived and began firing [[plastic bullet]]s at the protesters. Two women were wounded by plastic bullets&lt;ref name=elite/&gt; and the undercover soldiers then fled in unmarked cars, setting off crackers or fireworks at the same time.&lt;ref name=elite/&gt;&lt;ref name=human/&gt; [[Sinn Féin]] councillor [[Francie Molloy]] claimed that the protesters forced the SAS to withdraw, saving Doris's life in the process. Witnesses allegedly feared an undercover soldier brandishing a pistol would have killed the wounded Doris with a shot to his head.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt;

Afterward, hundreds of residents were forced to leave their homes as security forces searched the area near the base.&lt;ref name=cousin/&gt; This kept tensions high, according to local republican activist [[Bernadette McAliskey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1997.html CAIN – Listing of Programmes for the Year: 1997 – ITV news, 27 March 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Two men were later questioned by the RUC about the attack.&lt;ref name=elite/&gt;

== Aftermath ==

The attack—along with two large bombings the same day in [[Wilmslow]], England—raised concerns that the IRA was trying to influence the upcoming [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|UK general election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1997_1402934/blasts-light-fuse-to-fears-of-ira-bomb-campaign.html Blasts light fuse to fears of IRA bomb campaign] by Ron Kampeas. [[Associated Press]], 27 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin McGuinness]] described the shooting as "murderous", while independent councillor Jim Canning said that more than a dozen soldiers "were threatening to shoot anybody who moved [...] while a young man lay shot on the ground". Republican sources claimed that this was another case of [[Shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland|shoot-to-kill policy]] by the security forces;&lt;ref name=elite/&gt; [[Ulster Unionist Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Ken Maginnis, Baron Maginnis of Drumglass|Ken Maginnis]], however, praised the SAS for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1997.html CAIN – Listing of Programmes for the Year: 1997 – ITV news, 28 March 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gareth Doris was admitted to South Tyrone Hospital in [[Dungannon]],&lt;ref name=fear&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IrtAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BAQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4445,9326811&amp;dq=dungannon+ira+bomb&amp;hl=en Explosions raise fears of IRA bomb campaign] Associated Press, 27 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; where he was arrested after undergoing surgery. He was later transferred to [[Musgrave Park Hospital|Musgrave Park military hospital]] in [[Belfast]].&lt;ref name=cousin/&gt; Doris was later convicted for involvement in the bombing and sentenced to ten years in jail, before being released in 2000 under the terms of the [[Good Friday Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1350551/Republicans.html Republicans] [[The Daily Telegraph]], 27 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Gareth was the cousin of Tony Doris, an IRA member killed in [[Coagh ambush|an SAS ambush]] in the nearby village of [[Coagh]] on 3 June 1991 and a cousin of Sinn Fein leader [[Michelle O'Neill]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. According to Sinn Féin councillor Brendan Doris, another cousin of Gareth, "He absolutely denies being involved in terrorist activity of any description". [[Amnesty International]] raised its concerns over the shooting&lt;ref name=human/&gt; and the fact that no warning was given beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International Report, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 1997, on the eve of the [[1997 nationalist riots in Northern Ireland]], the British Army/RUC base was the scene of another attack, when an IRA volunteer engaged an armoured RUC vehicle with gunfire beside the barracks. One female officer was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=guEqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k4oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4206,1772365&amp;dq=coalisland+policewoman&amp;hl=en Militants Angry About Police's Defense Of Protestant March] by Shawn Pogatchnik.

'''Andrew Lang''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (1844–1912) was a Scottish poet, novelist, [[literary critic]], and contributor to the field of [[anthropology]]. He is best known as a [[folkloristics|collector]] of [[folklore|folk]] and [[fairy tales]]. The [[Andrew Lang lecture]]s at the [[University of St Andrews]] are named after him.

== Biography ==
Lang was born on 31 March 1844 in [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]]. He was the eldest of the eight children born to John Lang, the town clerk of Selkirk, and his wife Jane Plenderleath Sellar, who was the daughter of Patrick Sellar, [[factor (Scotland)|factor]] to the first duke of Sutherland. On 17 April 1875, he married [[Leonora Blanche Alleyne]], youngest daughter of C.&amp;nbsp;T. Alleyne of Clifton and Barbados. She was (or should have been) variously credited as author, collaborator, or translator of [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|Lang's Color/Rainbow Fairy Books]] which he edited.&lt;ref name=Yellow&gt;{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Leonora Blanche Alleyne|title=The Yellow Fairy Book|year=1894|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Co.|page=1|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28314|editor=Andrew Lang|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at Selkirk Grammar School, [[Loretto School]], and the [[Edinburgh Academy]], as well as the [[University of St Andrews]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he took a first class in the final classical schools in 1868, becoming a fellow and subsequently honorary fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]]. He soon made a reputation as one of the most able and versatile writers of the day as a journalist, poet, critic, and historian.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Lang, Andrew|volume=16|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, he was elected [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='''LANG, Andrew'''|journal=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of [[angina pectoris]] on 20 July 1912 at the Tor-na-Coille Hotel in [[Banchory]], [[Kincardineshire|Banchory]], survived by his wife. He was buried in the cathedral precincts at St Andrews, where a monument can be visited in the south-east corner of the 19th century section.

== Scholarship ==

=== Folklore and anthropology ===
[[File:Rumpelstiltskin.jpg|thumb|''"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]," from Lang's'' Fairy Tales]]

Lang is now chiefly known for his publications on [[folklore]], [[mythology]], and [[religion]]. The interest in folklore was from early life; he read [[John Ferguson McLennan]] before coming to Oxford, and then was influenced by [[E. B. Tylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Wyon Burrow]], ''Evolution and Society: a study in Victorian social theory'' (1966), p. 237; [https://books.google.com/books?id=OUM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA237 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest of his publications is ''Custom and Myth'' (1884). In ''[[s:Myth, Ritual, and Religion (Volume 1).djvu|Myth, Ritual and Religion]]'' (1887) he explained the "irrational" elements of mythology as survivals from more primitive forms. Lang's ''Making of Religion'' was heavily influenced by the 18th century idea of the "[[noble savage]]": in it, he maintained the existence of high spiritual ideas among so-called "savage" races, drawing parallels with the contemporary interest in occult phenomena in England.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; His ''[[The Blue Fairy Book|Blue Fairy Book]]'' (1889) was a beautifully produced and illustrated edition of [[fairy tale]]s that has become a classic. This was followed by many other collections of fairy tales, collectively known as [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books]]. In the preface of the Lilac Fairy Book he credits his wife with translating and transcribing most of the stories in the collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=3028569 |title=Online Reader – Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang examined the origins of [[totemism]] in ''Social Origins'' (1903).

=== Psychical research ===
Lang was one of the founders of "[[Parapsychology|psychical research]]" and his other writings on [[anthropology]] include ''The Book of Dreams and Ghosts'' (1897), ''Magic and Religion'' (1901) and ''The Secret of the Totem'' (1905).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  He served as President of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness|Grattan-Guinness, Ivor]]. (1982). ''Psychical Research: A Guide to Its History, Principles and Practices: In Celebration of 100 Years of the Society for Psychical Research''. Aquarian Press. p. 123. {{ISBN|0-85030-316-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang extensively cited nineteenth- and twentieth-century European [[spiritualism]] to challenge the idea of his teacher, Tyler, that belief in spirits and [[animism]] were inherently irrational. Lang used Tyler's work and his own psychical research in an effort to posit an anthropological critique of [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 101 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical scholarship ===
{{see also|English translations of Homer#Lang}}
He collaborated with [[Samuel Henry Butcher|S.&amp;nbsp;H. Butcher]] in a prose translation (1879) of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', and with [[E. Myers]] and [[Walter Leaf]] in a prose version (1883) of the ''[[Iliad]]'', both still noted for their archaic but attractive style. He was a [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric scholar]] of conservative views.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Other works include ''Homer and the Study of Greek'' found in ''Essays in Little'' (1891), ''Homer and the Epic'' (1893); a prose translation of ''The Homeric Hymns'' (1899), with literary and mythological essays in which he draws parallels between Greek myths and other mythologies; ''Homer and his Age'' (1906); and "Homer and Anthropology" (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, "Homer and Anthropology," in ''Homer and the Classics: Six Lectures Delivered before the University of Oxford by Arthur J. Evans, Andrew Lang, Gilbert Murray, F.B. Jevons, J.L. Myres, and W. Warde Fowler,'' ed. R.R. Marett, 44-65 (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1908).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historian ===
[[File:Portrait of Andrew Lang.jpg|thumb|right|Andrew Lang at work]]
Lang's writings on Scottish history are characterised by a scholarly care for detail, a piquant literary style, and a gift for disentangling complicated questions. ''The Mystery of Mary Stuart'' (1901) was a consideration of the fresh light thrown on [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], by the Lennox manuscripts in the University Library, [[university of Cambridge|Cambridge]], approving of her and criticising her accusers.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He also wrote monographs on ''The Portraits and Jewels of Mary Stuart'' (1906) and ''[[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] and the Gowrie Mystery'' (1902). The somewhat unfavourable view of [[John Knox]] presented in his book ''John Knox and the Reformation'' (1905) aroused considerable controversy. He gave new information about the continental career of the [[Charles Edward Stuart|Young Pretender]] in ''Pickle the Spy'' (1897), an account of [[Alestair Ruadh MacDonnell]], whom he identified with Pickle, a notorious Hanoverian spy. This was followed by ''The Companions of Pickle'' (1898) and a monograph on Prince Charles Edward (1900). In 1900 he began a ''History of Scotland from the Roman Occupation'' (1900). ''The Valet's Tragedy'' (1903), which takes its title from an essay on [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]]'s ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne|Man in the Iron Mask]]'', collects twelve papers on historical mysteries, and ''A Monk of Fife'' (1896) is a fictitious narrative purporting to be written by a young Scot in France in 1429–1431.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

=== Other writings ===
Lang's earliest publication was a volume of metrical experiments, ''The Ballads and Lyrics of Old France'' (1872), and this was followed at intervals by other volumes of dainty verse, ''Ballades in Blue China'' (1880, enlarged edition, 1888), ''Ballads and Verses Vain'' (1884), selected by Mr [[Henry Austin Dobson|Austin Dobson]]; ''Rhymes à la Mode'' (1884), ''Grass of Parnassus'' (1888), ''Ban and Arrière Ban'' (1894), ''New Collected Rhymes'' (1905).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Lang was active as a journalist in various ways, ranging from sparkling "leaders" for the ''Daily News'' to miscellaneous articles for the ''Morning Post'', and for many years he was literary editor of ''[[Longman's Magazine]]''; no critic was in more request, whether for occasional articles and introductions to new editions or as editor of dainty reprints.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He edited ''The Poems and Songs of [[Robert Burns]]'' (1896), and was responsible for the ''Life and Letters'' (1897) of [[John Gibson Lockhart|JG Lockhart]], and ''The Life, Letters and Diaries'' (1890) of [[Stafford Henry Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh|Sir Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh]]. Lang discussed literary subjects with the same humour and acidity that marked his criticism of fellow folklorists, in ''Books and Bookmen'' (1886), ''Letters to Dead Authors'' (1886), ''Letters on Literature'' (1889), etc.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Azriel Graeber''' is a freelance [[journalist]], scholar, PhD and founder of the [[Jewish Scholarship Society]]. He is also known under his pen name, ''Azriel Radifker''. He has contributed to several [[Magazine|journals]], [[periodicals]] and newspapers ranging on many topics. His organization which is a branch of his journalistic interests, actively attempts to bridge several sectors of [[Judaism]] together.

== Biography ==
Graeber, born in 1948, is the second child born to [[Holocaust]] survivors. He wrote about his experience as the child of survivors in an essay published in [[Louis Finkelstein]] Quarterly (Fall 1978). He describes the sensitivity that he fostered for all victims of oppression under governmental abuses of power.

In 1974 he was awarded a PhD from [[Dropsie College]] in [[Jewish history]] for his study on the ability of building a historical narrative of the Jewish people based on questions posed to Jewish law deciders from the 12th century to today. A main focus of his [[thesis]] was on the [[responsa]] of [[Rabad of Posquières]], later to be the subject of a book by [[Isadore Twersky]] of [[Harvard]]. He also received a [[B.Th]] from Derech Ayson Seminary.

From 1999 through 2003 he served as director of The Tri-State Jewish Community Council. He was also on the directors board of the Bal Teshuva Halfway House of New York, and is currently the president of The Jewish Scholarship Society.

Graeber has never retained any formal teaching positions, although he was listed as holder of the Akiba and Sara Gurtner [[Chair of Jewish Studies]] at [[Touro College]] for the scholastic year of 1992. His absence was due to his contracting an obscure psychological disorder, [[Capgras syndrome]]. He regularly submits papers to various Jewish and secular journals for publication.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

After a trip to [[Israel]] in 1997 he authored an essay on the need for the inclusion of Yiddishist principles into the fabric of Orthodox Jewish life. He wrote:

:''Only through the acceptance of Yiddishism will Judaism finally after its 2,000 year [[exile]] reach the apex of its purpose...The opposition to Yiddishism historically was primerally from the extreme right wing of the religion. The modern Jewish community should not fear integration".{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The article was highly controversial and much debate ensued. The debate within the Jewish community led Graeber to found the Jewish Scholarship Society.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== The JSS ==
The Jewish Scholarship Society, also known as (in [[Yiddish]]) Der Yiddisher Gelerntkeit Gelzelshaft, according to its mission statement is to "mesh together Yiddishist principles with an active Jewish lifestyle". The organizations headquarters in [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence, New York]] houses a vast library. The libraries holdings include several [[antique]] items of significant historical importance as well as books ranging on topics from the Social Sciences to biographies on notable Jewish personalities.

It was founded in 1997 in New York. Its member base now exceeds 4,500, with members from several different countries and backgrounds. All prospective members must provide proof of their [[Orthodoxy]] with their application.

== Scholarship ==
Graeber, as [[freelance journalist]] and scholar, has written on many topics, mainly within the scope of Jewish studies. He has been published in most Jewish newspapers, as well as on several on-line news sources.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} He has also been published in secular journals. Subjects of his writing have included [[graphology]], rabbinical history, dangerous animals and several works of fiction. His most recent essay, "[[Eybeschutz]]–[[Emden]] Controversy Alive And Well", appeared this past March.{{When|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.5tjt.com/news/read.asp?Id=2232 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906190438/http://www.5tjt.com/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2564%3Asplenda-and-purim |archivedate=2011-09-06 |title=Splenda And Purim |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several notable essays include: "The Spanish [[Cholov Yisroel]] Controversy of 1763 and its effects on the Jews of [[Barcelona]]", "[[Slabodka, Belarus|Slobodka]] Yeshiva: Myth or Musser", "How Hungarian Jews have ruined American Judaism: A Complete History" and "West Side vs. East Side: Two communities. One park".

His article "How Hungarian Jews have ruined American Judaism: A Complete History" won the Rabbi [[Solomon Schechter]] Literary Award, and was published in March 1983 in "Rabbi [[Louis Finkelstein]] Quarterly". Other awards include the annually awarded [[Chazon Ish]] Grant for his contribution to the study of the prohibitions involved in Amirah L'Otzmoi.

He is currently{{When|date=May 2015}} working on his first book, tentatively titled ''The [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]]'s Jewish Inventors''.

'''Batu kenongs''', also known as stone kenongs, is a type of [[megalith]]. They became prevalent sometime between the neolithic and early iron ages as megalithic culture spread to Indonesia. Archeological research of the stones began in the late 19th century, continuing to present day. There is much uncertainty in how they came to Indonesia, but they are believed to have been used to support buildings. 

==Definition==
Betu kenongs are upright cylindrical or rounded stones and receive their name from their physical resemblance to the gamelan music instrument, the [[kenong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/12/09/in-search-megaliths-bondowoso.html|title=In search of megaliths in Bondowoso|last=Kurniawan|first=Alez|date=December 9, 2014|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|accessdate=26 June 2017|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as "cylindrical stones with a knob on top", and  classified into three separate categories: those with a single cylindrical knob, those with two cylindrical knobs, and those with rounded knobs.&lt;ref name=Prasetyo2000&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prasetyo|first=Bagyo|year=2000|title=The Distribution of Megaliths in Bondowoso|url=http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/BIPPA/article/viewFile/11724/10353|journal=Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association|volume=19|issn=1835-1794|pages=77-80|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations have revealed them in patterns of rectangles and circles, which has led archeologists to believe they were used for foundations of structures.&lt;ref name=Simanjuntak2006&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last1=Simanjuntak |editor-first1=Truman |editor-last2=Hisyam|editor-first2=Mohammad |editor-last3=Prasetyo |editor-first3=Bagyo |editor-last4=Nasiti |editor-first4=Titi Surti |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dSFfD0dpdS4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=kenong+stones&amp;ots=F83FsKvOec&amp;sig=6Zd3nAVF-76W3EdvkullAjkJccg#v=onepage&amp;q=kenong%20stones&amp;f=false |title=Archaeology: Indonesian Perspective: R.P. Soejono's Festschrift |date=2006 |publisher=LIPI Press |location=Jakarta |isbn=979-26-2499-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with their organization, the archeological excavation done by Willems (1938) has continued to support this theory. The excavation found two different purposes for Kenong stones, each used in conjunction to create a foundation.  Kenong stones surrounding structures were used to support bamboo stilts in which a bamboo pole would be placed onto the knobs of the stone. Adversely, stones in the center of the construction were used to carry the majority of the house's weight. The stones in the center were supported by a large stone tab, thus the weight was deferred onto it from the kenong stones creating a steady foundation. This, along with the arrangement of stones in a circular or rectangular pattern, helps to solidify their use as building implements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Majapahit City Limits and Excursion Trails Outside the City|last=Adrisijanti|first=Inajati|publisher=Penerbit Kepeo Press|year=2014|isbn=978-602-1228-70-8|location=Puri Arsita A-6, JI. Kalimantan, North RingRoad, Yogyakarta|pages=88-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Megaliths can be seen all over Indonesia, spreading from the East to the West. However, even with such a large distribution historians have yet to be able to exactly pinpoint a time and reason for the introduction of megaliths into the region. Theories suggest the culture started in Asia, Ancient Egypt, or along the Mediterranean. Overall, most contribute the appearance of megaliths to cultural diffusion sometime between the neolithic and early iron ages.&lt;ref name=Simanjuntak2006/&gt; 

Bondowoso, located in the Java region, has attracted much archeological attention for its extensive number of megaliths. 1898 marked the first documentation of the artifacts in the area and led to the kenong stone, along with three other megaliths, first being classified for its distinct characteristics. More excavation and research into the early 1940s generated interest in megaliths in Indonesia, leading to a new wave of investigation by the National Research Centre of Archeology after World War 2. This new research discovered 47 megalithic sites in Bondowoso, 13 of them containing Batu kenongs.&lt;ref name=Prasetyo2000/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9091">'''Christian A. R. Christensen''' (17 December 1906 – 27 January 1967) was a Norwegian newspaper editor. He is known for his work in the [[Norwegian resistance movement]], as editor of ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' and as a historical writer. He also helped shape the [[Ethical Code of Practice for the Norwegian Press]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Solum, Norway|Solum]] as a son of merchant Nils Christian Christensen (1872–1957) and his wife Ellen Kristine Reiersen (1883–1953). He was a brother of [[Nils-Reinhardt Christensen]]. Following miscellaneous education,&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|volume=|title=Christian A R Christensen|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Arne|last=Bonde|authorlink=Arne Bonde|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Christian_A_R_Christensen/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was hired in ''[[Dagbladet]]'' in 1926.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Christian Arthur Richard Christensen|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=Henriksen, Petter|url=http://www.snl.no/Christian_Arthur_Richard_Christensen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 he married Else Marie Østvedt (1906–1982).&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; They lived in [[Vestre Aker]].&lt;ref name=grini&gt;{{cite book|title=Norsk fangeleksikon. Grinifangene|editor=Giertsen, Børre R.|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|date=1946|page=116|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 Christensen was hired in the publishing house [[Aschehoug]]. He also wrote news analyses for the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] [[radio]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Also, Christiansen was a deputy member of the [[Liberal Party of Norway]] national board.&lt;ref name=nkl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Dahl|first=Hans Fredrik|authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl|editor=Dahl, Hans Fredrik|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=Christensen, Christian A.R.|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/c/c1.html#christensen-christian|accessdate=9 June 2009|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|volume=|location=Oslo|isbn=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929024655/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/c/c1.html#christensen-christian|archivedate=29 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
In 1940, Norway was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded]] and [[German occupation of Norway|occupied by Germany]] as a part of [[World War II]]. Christiansen participated for the Liberal Party in early negotiations with the occupying power, but as Germany seized tighter control in September 1940 Christiansen joined the [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]],&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; and acted as a middle man between the Norwegian press and the Home Front. He co-founded the written organ of the Home Front, ''[[Bulletinen]]''. A co-founder was [[Einar Gerhardsen]],&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; and editors were Christensen, [[Olaf Solumsmoen]] and [[Olav Larssen]].&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; Christensen also wrote news analyses for several [[Underground media in German-occupied Europe|illegal newspapers]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was arrested by the Nazi authorities in late February 1941, for "[[spy]]ing", and sat for three months at [[Møllergata 19]] and for five days in [[Grini concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=grini/&gt; While at Møllergata 19 he penned the crime novel ''Telefon til myrdede'', issued in 1942. He also continued writing news analyses, which were smuggled out of the prison. Upon release in late May 1942, he continued his work.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; In 1943 he was arrested for the second time. Via [[Gjerpen]] and [[Larvik]] he was brought to Grini, and sat there from 19 to 31 August.&lt;ref name=grini/&gt;

==Later career==
After the war, some members of the Home Front discussed a restart of the newspaper ''[[Tidens Tegn]]'', but this did not go through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hjeltnes|first=Guri|authorlink=Guri Hjeltnes|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl, Hans Fredrik]]|encyclopedia=Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45|title=''Tidens Tegn''|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/t/t2.html#tidens-tegn|accessdate=18 June 2009|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|volume=|location=Oslo|isbn=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315114629/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/t/t2.html#tidens-tegn|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a new newspaper with roots in the Home Front was created, with Christensen as editor-in-chief: ''[[Verdens Gang]]''.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He remained editor-in-chief until his death.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; From 1953 he co-edited with [[Oskar Hasselknippe]], and he was succeeded by [[Vegard Sletten]].&lt;ref name=snl-vg&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=''Verdens Gang''|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=Henriksen, Petter|url=http://www.snl.no/Verdens_Gang|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial hardships,&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; the newspaper grew influent and has been the largest in Norway since 1981.&lt;ref name=snl-vg/&gt; In 1963 it assumed the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format as the first in Norway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=tabloid|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=Henriksen, Petter|url=http://www.snl.no/tabloid|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly to Christensen's dismay.&lt;ref name=henbast&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastiansen|first=Henrik G.|authorlink=Henrik G.

He also participated in the non-press sphere after the war; already in 1944 he helped shape the Common Platform (''Fellesprogrammet'') which was meant to unite [[List of political parties in Norway|political parties in Norway]] after the war. In May 1945 he supported [[Paal Berg]], head of [[Hjemmefrontens Ledelse]] in his endeavors to create a broad, non-partisan coalition.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; The road was open as the pre-war [[cabinet Nygaardsvold]] resigned, but the increasingly popular [[Communist Party of Norway|Communist Party]] were particularly skeptical to Berg, and the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative]] [[President of the Storting]] [[C. J. Hambro]] got his way in reconvening the pre-war [[Parliament of Norway]]. Berg faced unexpected opposition from this Parliament, and gave up on 20 June. Instead Einar Gerhardsen formed [[Gerhardsen's First Cabinet|a cabinet]], and also won the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1945|first free post-war election]].&lt;ref name=furre&gt;{{cite book|title=Norsk historie 1914–2000|first=Berge|last=Furre|authorlink=Berge Furre|year=2000|series=Volume six of ''[[Norsk historie (Samlaget)|Norsk historie]]''|publisher=Det Norske Samlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=|pages=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen was a board member of the [[Norwegian Institute of International Affairs]] and the [[Norwegian News Agency]]. In addition, he continued his writing of historical books. Notable works included ''Fra verdenskrig til verdenskrig'' ('From World War to World War') and ''Okkupasjonsår og etterkrigstid'' ('Occupation Years and Post-war Era'), volumes eight and nine of the series ''Vårt folks historie'' ('Our People's History'), both issued in 1961. He died of a heart attack while on a [[Cruising (maritime)|cruise]] in 1967, in a hospital in [[Las Palmas]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

'''Clas Jonas Theodor Odhner''' (June 17, 1836 in [[Alingsås, Sweden]] &amp;ndash; June 11, 1904 in [[Stockholm, Sweden]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] historian, and director of the [[Swedish National Archives]] (''Riksarkivet'').

The son of a clergyman, Odhner's mother was a sister of [[Nils Ericson]] and [[John Ericsson]]. Odhner went to school in [[Skara]] and matriculated at [[Uppsala University]] in 1851, completing the degree of ''[[filosofie magister]]'' and becoming a [[docent]] of History in 1860. He taught at [[Lund University]] from 1865, as professor of history from 1870 until 1887, when he was appointed ''riksarkivarie'', director of the National Archives, a position where he remained until 1901. Odhner was a member of the Second Chamber of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] 1894-1897. He was elected Member of the [[Swedish Academy]] in 1885, and was member of several other learned societies.

Odhner was a productive writer, and the schoolbooks he authored were influential. He was the main mover in the introduction of the new organisation of the archives for government agencies with a number of provincial archives (''landsarkiv''), to some extent subordinate to the National Archives.

He was father of the zoologist and explorer [[Teodor Odhner]]. The engineer [[Wilgott Theophil Odhner|Willgodt Odhner]] was the son of his first cousin.

[[File:The Structure Claimed to be the Noah's Ark near the Mount Ararat in Turkey.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The Durupınar site in 2007]]

The '''Durupınar site''' is a large [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] structure&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcgeo005/Sutton%20Hoo%2014.pdf|last=Collins |first=Lorence G.|title=A supposed cast of Noah's ark in eastern Turkey|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Avci&gt;{{cite news |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10064-007-0084-3 |title="Noah’s Ark": its relationship to the Telçeker earthflow, Mount Ararat, Eastern Turkey |journal=Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment |last=Avci |first=Murat |year=2007 |volume=66 |pages=377–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Mount Tendürek]] in eastern [[Turkey]]. The site is 3 kilometres (2&amp;nbsp;mi) north of the [[Iran]]ian border, 16&amp;nbsp;km (10&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Doğubeyazıt]], in the [[Ağrı Province]], and 29&amp;nbsp;km (18 miles) south of the Greater [[Mount Ararat]] summit, at an elevation of 1,966 to 2,004&amp;nbsp;m (6,449 to 6,575&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.

The size and shape of the structure has led to its promotion by some believers as the original [[Noah's Ark]], but geologists&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Avci" /&gt; and even some creationists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Snelling |title=Special Report: Amazing 'Ark' Exposé |url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/cm/v14/n4/special-report-amazing-ark-expose |date=September 1, 1992 |journal=Creation Magazine |volume=14 |issue=4 |publisher=[[Answers in Genesis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that it is merely a natural formation. The site is near several officially-unnamed peaks, though locals call one of the nearby peaks ''Cudi Dağı'' in Turkish and ''Çîyaye Cûdî'' in Kurdish, which [[David Fasold]] linked to [[Mount Judi]] ({{lang-ar|الجودي}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Ǧūdī}}''), the mountain named in the [[Quran]] as the final resting place of Noah's Ark.{{sfn|Fasold|1988|pp=92–3}}&lt;ref&gt;Sura 11:044 from the [[Marmaduke Pickthall]] translation of the Qur'an: "And it was said: O earth! Swallow thy water and, O sky! be cleared of clouds! And the water was made to subside. And the commandment was fulfilled. And it (the ship) came to rest upon (the mount) al Cudi and it was said: A far removal for wrongdoing folk!"&lt;/ref&gt;  Some researchers place Mount Judi in another location farther south near the Turkish/Iraqi border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noahsarksearch.com/resources/mt-cudi/ |title=Mt.

==Discovery and exploration==
[[File:NuhunGemisi.jpg|thumb|An official road sign near [[Doğubeyazıt]] in Turkey with the words ''Nuhun Gemisi'' ("Noah's Ship") pointing the way to the Durupınar site and away from [[Mount Ararat]]]]
According to local reports, heavy rains combined with three earthquakes exposed the formation from the surrounding mud in May 19, 1948. It was discovered by a [[Kurds|Kurdish]] shepherd named Reshit Sarihan.{{sfn|Fasold|1988|pp=319–25}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noahsarksearch.com/reshit.htm Edwin B. Greenwald, "Turk Reports 'Ship' Atop Mt. Ararat]," [[Associated Press]] article, 13 November 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently identified by [[Turkish Land Forces|Turkish Army]] Captain İlhan Durupınar&amp;nbsp;— for whom it was subsequently named&amp;nbsp;— in a [[Turkish Air Force]] aerial photo while on a mapping mission for [[NATO]] in October 1959. Durupınar informed the Turkish government of his discovery and a group from the Archeological Research Foundation which included [[George Vandeman]], İlhan Durupınar, and Arthur Brandenberger, professor of photogrammetry, surveyed the site in September 1960. After two days of digging and dynamiting inside the "boat-shaped" formation, the expedition members found only [[soil]] and [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]. Their official news release concluded that "there were no visible archaeological remains" and that this formation "was a freak of nature and not man-made".&lt;ref name=Noorbergen&gt; {{cite book|last1=Noorbergen|first1=Rene|title=The Ark File|date=2004|publisher=TEACH Services, Inc|isbn=978-1572582668|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s30u5yPM-5UC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=%22was+a+freak+of+nature%22+vandeman+%22news+release%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9sCvA4VUzC&amp;sig=kIo8m6OgOB_RkQhzLayfO8LX4Mc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9TRVU_zYNMPB0QWN-4GACQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22was%20a%20freak%20of%20nature%22%20vandeman%20%22news%20release%22&amp;f=false|access-date=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The site was then ignored until 1977, when it was rediscovered and promoted by self-styled archaeologist and amateur explorer [[Ron Wyatt]]. Throughout the 1980s, Wyatt repeatedly tried to interest other people in the site, including ark hunter and former astronaut [[James Irwin]] and [[creationism|creationist]] [[John D. Morris]], neither of whom was convinced the structure was the Ark.{{sfn|Fasold|1988|p={{page needed|date=December 2013}}}}{{sfn|Dawes|2000|p={{page needed|date=December 2013}}}}

In 1985, Wyatt was joined by [[David Fasold]] and geophysicist [[John Baumgardner]] for the expedition recounted in Fasold's ''The Ark of Noah''. As soon as Fasold saw the site, he exclaimed that it was a [[shipwreck]].{{sfn|Fasold|1988|p=7}} Fasold brought along state-of-the-art [[ground-penetrating radar]] equipment and a "[[signal generator|frequency generator]]", set it on the wavelength for [[iron]], and searched the formation for internal iron [[wikt:locus|loci]] (the latter technique was later compared to [[dowsing]] by the site's detractors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John D. |last=Morris |date=September 1, 1990 |title=That Boat-Shaped Rock… is it Noah's Ark? |url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/cm/v12/n4/noah |journal=Creation Magazine |volume=12 |issue=4 |publisher=[[Answers in Genesis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasold and the team states that the ground penetration radar revealed a regular internal structure and measured the length of the formation as {{convert|538|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, close to the 300 [[cubit]]s (157&amp;nbsp;m, 515&amp;nbsp;ft) of the Noah's Ark in the [[Bible]] if the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cubit of 20.6 inches (0.52&amp;nbsp;m) is used.{{sfn|Fasold|1988|pp=15–22}}&lt;ref name="Pockley" /&gt; Fasold believed the team found the fossilized remains of the upper deck and that the original reed substructure had disappeared. In the nearby village of Kazan (formerly Arzap), they examined so-called drogue (anchor) stones that they believed were once attached to the ark.

Creationist commentators, such as Andrew Snelling in the [[Creation Ministries International]] journal ''Creation'', wrote that "there are no scientific principles employed" in the "so-called frequency generator" used by Wyatt's team. He called it a "gadget, which is generally advertised in treasure-hunting magazines, not scientific journals" with "brass welding rods being used in essence, as [[Dowsing|divining rods]], similar to the use of a forked stick to search for water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Special report: Amazing ‘Ark’ exposé | journal = Creation | date = September 1992 | first = Andrew | last = Snelling | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 26–38| id = | url = http://creation.com/special-report-amazing-ark-expose | access-date = 2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fasold asserted in his 1988 book that locals call one of the peaks near to the Durupinar site al Cudi (Turkish ''Cudi Dagi'', Kurdish ''Çîyaye Cûdî'') and linked this to the [[Mount Judi]] named in the Quran as the final resting place of Noah's Ark.{{sfn|Fasold|1988|pp=92–3}} The assertion is controversial and not well supported by local toponymy.

After a few expeditions to the Durupınar site that included drilling and excavation in the 1990s, Fasold began to have doubts that the Durupınar formation was Noah's ark. He visited the site in September 1994 with Australian geologist [[Ian Plimer]] and concluded that the structure was not a boat.&lt;ref name =Pockley&gt;{{cite news |last=Pockley |first=Peter |title=Theory blown out of the water |newspaper=Australian Sun-Herald |date=6 November 1994 |url=http://www.boatsalvage.com.au/boat-salvage-articles/1994/11/6/theory-blown-out-of-the-water/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He surmised that ancient peoples had erroneously believed the site was the ark.&lt;ref name="Pockley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Fasold 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lorence D. |last1=Collins |first2=David |last2=Fasold |title=Bogus 'Noah's Ark' from Turkey Exposed as a Common Geologic Structure |journal=Journal of Geoscience Education |year=1996 |volume=44 |hdl=10211.2/3026 |pages=439–44}} [http://www.csun.edu/~vcgeo005/bogus.html full text]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, Fasold co-wrote a paper with geologist [[Lorence G. Collins|Lorence Collins]] titled "Bogus 'Noah's Ark' from Turkey Exposed as a Common Geologic Structure", which concluded that the boat-shaped formation was a natural stone formation that merely resembled a boat. The same paper pointed out that the "anchors" were local volcanic stone.&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Fasold 1996" /&gt;  The abstract reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A natural rock structure near Dogubayazit, Turkey, has been misidentified as Noah's Ark. Microscopic studies of a supposed iron bracket show that it is derived from weathered volcanic minerals. Supposed metal-braced walls are natural concentrations of [[limonite]] and [[magnetite]] in steeply inclined sedimentary layers in the limbs of a doubly plunging [[syncline]]. Supposed fossilized gopherwood bark is crinkled metamorphosed [[peridotite]]. Fossiliferous [[limestone]], interpreted as cross cutting the syncline, preclude the structure from being Noah's Ark because these supposed "Flood" deposits are younger than the "Ark." Anchor stones at Kazan (Arzap) are derived from local [[andesite]] and not from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Fasold 1996" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In April 1997, in sworn testimony at an Australian court case, Fasold repeated his doubts and noted that he regarded the claim that Noah's ark had been found as "absolute &lt;abbr title="bullshit"&gt;BS&lt;/abbr&gt;".&lt;ref name= Clifton&gt;{{Cite news | last = Clifton | first = Brad | title =  Doubts sank faith in Ark| newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]  | date = 9 April 1997 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Thomson&gt;{{Cite news | last = Thomson| first =Kirstyn | title =  Witness Tells How Ark Faith Sank| newspaper = The West Australian | date = 9 April 1997 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Finkel&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Finkel | first = Elizabeth | authorlink =  | title = Creationism Suit: Australian Geologist Battles 'Ark' Claim  | journal = Science | volume = 276| issue = 5311  | pages = 348  | publisher = | location = | date = 18 April 1997| url = | doi = 10.1126/science.276.5311.348 | id = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as fellow ark researcher David Allen Deal, reported that before his death, Fasold returned to a belief that the Durupınar site might be the location of the ark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Deal | first = David Allen | title = Noah's Ark: The Evidence | publisher = Artisan | location = Muscogee, OK | pages = | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-933677-02-2}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His close Australian friend and biographer June Dawes wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Fasold] kept repeating that no matter what the experts said, there was too much going for the [Durupınar] site for it to be dismissed. He remained convinced it was the fossilized remains of Noah's Ark.{{sfn|Dawes|2000|p=184}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arzap drogue stones==
[[File:DrogueStoneFasold.jpg|right|thumb|upright| [[David Fasold]], a promoter of the Durupınar site, stands beside what he claimed was a drogue stone (crosses are believed to have been added later)]]
The Arzap drogue stones are a number of large standing stones found near the Durupınar site by amateur archaeologist [[Ron Wyatt]] with the aid of David Fasold and others. Fasold interpreted the artifacts as [[drogue]]s, stone weights used to stabilize the Ark in rough seas, because they all have a [[chamfer]]ed hole cut at one end as if to fasten a rope to them, and his reading of the Epic of [[Gilgamesh]], the [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian mythical]] account of the flood, suggested to him that such stones were used.{{sfn|Fasold|1988|p={{page needed|date=December 2013}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noahsark-naxuan.com/turkmap.htm |title=Turkish Military Map |work=Noah |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207101619/http://www.noahsark-naxuan.com/turkmap.htm |archivedate=2012-02-07 |access-date=2015-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drogue stones were the equivalent of a storm [[anchor]] on ancient ships. They have been found in the [[Nile]] and elsewhere in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] area, and like the stones found by Wyatt and Fasold, they are heavy and flat with a hole for tying a line at one end. Their purpose was to create drag in the water or along shallow sandy bottoms:  the stone was attached to one end of a boat, and the drag produced would cause the bow or stern to face into the wind and wind-blown waves.{{sfn|Fasold|1988|p={{page needed|date=December 2013}}}}

A geological investigation of samples from the stones, published by geologist [[Lorence G. Collins|Lorence Collins]] in co-authorship with their original discoverer David Fasold, found that they are of local rock and thus could not have been brought from [[Mesopotamia]], the Ark's supposed place of origin.&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Fasold 1996" /&gt; Similar stones found throughout ancient Armenia are recognised as pagan "holy stones" converted to Christian use by the addition of crosses and other Christian symbols. Many are found in Christian cemeteries, as these were.&lt;ref name="Merling1993"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100312065805/http://www.andrews.edu/archaeology/archive/merling/newpage21.htm|title = Has Noah's Ark Been Found?|date = May 1993|work = Adventist Review|first = David|last = Merling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economic history of the Arab world''' addresses the history of economic activity in the [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic-speaking]] countries stretching from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Arabian Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the north to the [[Horn of Africa]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast from the time of its origins in the Arabian peninsula and spread in the 7th century [[Common Era|CE]] [[Muslim conquests]] and since.

The regions conquered in the Muslim conquest included rich farming regions in the [[Maghreb]], the Nile Valley and the [[Fertile Crescent]].  As is true of the world as a whole, agriculture dominated the economy until the modern period, with livestock grazing playing a particularly large role in the Arab world.  Significant trade routes included the [[Silk Road]], the [[spice trade]], and the trade in gold, salt, slaves and luxury goods including ivory and feathers out of sub-Saharan Africa.

Important pre-modern industries included tanning, pottery, and metal work.

== The economic importance of the Hajj ==
{{further|Hajj|Mecca}}
{{see also|Islamic Golden Age}}
[[File:Ibn Saud (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Ibn Saud]]
Trade was allowed on the Hajj and often those on it would have to trade along the way in order to finance their lengthy travels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/83977214|title=Tourism in the Middle East : continuity, change and transformation|date=2007|publisher=Channel View Publications|others=Daher, Rami|isbn=9781845410513|location=Clevedon|oclc=83977214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, money was brought along to give to the [[Bedouin]] tribes as well as to the holy cities which the pilgrims would journey through.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934585969|title=The Hajj : pilgrimage in Islam|others=Tagliacozzo, Eric,, Toorawa, Shawkat M.|isbn=9781107030510|location=New York, NY|oclc=934585969}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s control, these goods would be taxed.The level of taxes rose sharply under [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein]]. These levels were lowered when [[Ibn Saud]] took power.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Merchants would also participate in the Hajj as this allowed them to receive protection from the guards who accompanied pilgrims on the Hajj.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their trading in the regions along the pilgrimage often provided numerous economic benefits to those regions.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; This allowed the merchant caravans to become more successful and helped make them a greater part of the economy of the Arab world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Hajj travelers returned to their native lands, they would often bring goods with them which would cause shifts in designs, raising prices, as well as bringing back items to sell directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/690793981|title=Economie morale et mutations de l'islam en Afrique subsaharienne|date=2009|publisher=Éd.

=== Transportation ===
The pilgrims of the Hajj first traveled by Muslim state-sponsored caravans, but these were replaced by European-owned steam ships in the later 19th century, which increased the number of travelers but put the transportation industry of the Hajj in non-Muslim hands.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In 1908, the Ottoman Empire built a train system, returning some control of the industry to Muslims.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
[[File:Hajj.ogv|thumb|Gathering during the Hajj]]

=== Modern ===
In more recent years, [[Saudi Arabia]] has seen an increase in revenue due to the tourism industry during the Hajj. In 1994, the Saudi government emphasized tourism as a way to increase their economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2000 it was estimated that nearly sixty percent of all tourism in Saudi Arabia came for the Hajj or the similar ‘[[Umrah]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Over 40 percent of money spent by tourists being for the Hajj or the ‘Umrah.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The increase in the tourism industry during the Hajj has helped to solve the country's large segment of unemployed foreign workers from other countries&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; such as [[Egypt]] and [[India]] people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Jizya==
{{main|Jizya}}

Jizyah is what is taken from the People of the Book (people of Abrahamic faith and followers of the books revealed to them) – and from the mushrikeen (people who worship anything apart from the One God), according to some scholars – every year, in return for their being allowed to settle in Muslim lands, and in return for protecting them against those who would commit aggression against them. These people would not be required to pay the obligatory Zakaat (annual tax) that muslims would need to pay.

The word jizyah comes from the word jazaa’ (recompense). It is as if it is a recompense for allowing them to live in the land and for protecting their lives, property and dependents.

However, the exact meaning of the Jizya is debated.  It is mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] as part of the law, but the interpretation of the law has varied throughout time by the Muslims.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYPAVlM9-Y0C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=jizya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS1IyfibLXAhXBxYMKHeYtC_wQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=jizya&amp;f=false|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|last=Cohen|first=Mark R.|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=069101082X|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFbWEPGx7SkC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=jizya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS1IyfibLXAhXBxYMKHeYtC_wQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=jizya&amp;f=false|title=Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law|last=Emon|first=Anver M.|date=2012-07-26|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199661633|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Possible interpretations of the Jizya, and execution of these interpretations, have included a collective tribute, a poll tax, and a discriminatory tax.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFN2ismyhEYC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=jizya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS1IyfibLXAhXBxYMKHeYtC_wQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jizya&amp;f=false|title=The Jews of Arab Lands|last=Stillman|first=Norman A.|date=1979|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|isbn=9780827611559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One argument pertaining to the purpose of the Jizya is that it had nothing to do with discrimination, but only helped the government keep tabs on the population, and maintain a structured society.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  This argument, however, contradicts what is stated in the Qur'an’s verses about the Jizya.  These verses give the idea of the Jizya as an act of humiliation and ethnic diversion.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  The Jizya used to be a tribute required of non-Muslim people under the protection of the Muslims, which gave this lesser group or society, unable to protect themselves from outside Muslim opposition, the option to submit to the Muslim people and come under their protection.  In return for this protection, the minority people are required to pay a tribute to the Muslim government.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The Jizya often provided a source of financial support for the Muslims to continue their raids and expansion in the form of [[Jihad]]s.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

== Swahili Coast ==

=== Early history ===
[[File:Swahili coast.png|left|thumb|Map of the Swahili Coast]]
Trade along the [[Swahili coast]] dates back to 1st century C.E. up to 19th century C.E. Though there are not many reliable written records of Trade along the East African coast between 1st and 11th centuries, trade is still occurred between the [[Indian Ocean]] coast ([[Azania]]) and the rest of the world ([[India]], [[China]] and [[Arab world|Arabian]] Countries). Interaction between these areas was assisted by the knowledge of the monsoon winds by traders who traveled the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794702218|title=East Africa : an introductory history|last=M.|first=Maxon, Robert|date=2009|publisher=West Virginia University Press|isbn=1933202467|edition=3rd and revised|location=Morgantown|oclc=794702218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade along the Swahili coast that ranged from the 11th century to the 19th century, though already locally established, was greatly influenced by the spread of Islam, which came about from intermarriage between Islamic traders and the local [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Arab presence ===
Arabic presence along of the Swahili coast began with the migration of Arabs from Arabia to the East African coast because of demographic and political struggles back in Arabia. Later in the 8th century, trade along the coast was influenced the majority of Muslim visitors to the coast of East Africa. This trade fueled the development of coastal port towns such as [[Mogadishu]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Kilwa Empire|Kilwa]] and also the growth of [[Swahili language|Swahili]], a [[Lingua franca|lingua Franca]] stemming from the interaction between Local Bantu people and Arab immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=B. G.|date=1974|title=Arab Migrations to East Africa in Medieval Times|jstor=217250|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=367–390|doi=10.2307/217250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Omani Arabs ===
[[File:Gereza Kilwa Fort (34076199852).jpg|thumb|A Fort in Kilwa]]
One of the major Arabic influences along the Swahili coast was the arrival of the [[Oman]]i Arabs. Renowned as great mariners, the Omani traders were well known along the Indian Ocean. The arrival of the Omani Arabs along the east African coast in the late 17th century replaced the Portuguese influence along the Swahili Coast after their defeat at Mombasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/759806997|title=The Rough Guide to Oman|last=Gavin|first=Thomas|date=2011|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781405389358|location=London|oclc=759806997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade along the Swahili coast increased with the Omani Arabs' domination of the area. The development of Zanzibar between 1804 and 1856 increased the economic development of the Swahili coast due to its role as an importer of ivory and slaves from the African interior, through long-distance trading.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Africa_1840_1914_1840_1880.html?id=7GaNAAAAIAAJ|title=A History of Africa, 1840–1914: 1840–1880|last=Tidy|first=Michael|last2=Leeming|first2=Donald|date=1980|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Omani traders then exported slaves and ivory from the East African coast due to a high demand in Europe and India.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36430607|title=Plantation slavery on the east coast of Africa|last=1947-|first=Cooper, Frederick|date=1997|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0435074199|location=Portsmouth, N.H.|oclc=36430607}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of slaves made them a suitable source of labor on the growing clove plantations of [[Zanzibar]] and [[Pemba, Mozambique|Pemba]] and thus further increased the demand for slaves along the coast, which stimulated long-distance trading within Eastern and Central Africa. Some of these slaves were bought as household slaves in the Swahili Arabs homes.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Trade with the African interior ===
[[File:Tippu Tip.jpg|thumb|266x266px|Tippu Tip|left]]
Trading along the Swahili coast between the Swahili-Arabs and Interior tribes stimulated the development of the Interior African tribes. Because of the expansion of trade within the African interior, African rulers started developing politically with an aim to expand their kingdoms and territories in order to be able to have control of the trade routes and mineral sources within their territories. Due to the interaction between the Swahili-Arab traders and interior African tribes, Islam also spread as a religious language. The reign of the Sultans of Zanzibar between 1804 - 1888 and their dominion of the East African Coast from [[Somalia]] to [[Mozambique]] greatly influenced trade along the Swahili Coast.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Tippu Tip and the slave trade ===
Before the abolition of slave trade in 1873, when a Proclamation of the prohibition of slave trafficking from the interior to the coast was issued, [[Tippu Tip]] was among the best known Swahili-Arab traders. Having set out from Zanzibar in his conquest to obtain Ivory, he defeated Nsama of Trowa and established his own rule in Manyema country in order to control the ivory and slave trade.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Waqf==
{{Main|Waqf}}
A [[Waqf]] is a charitable endowment given by Muslims to help benefit their societies,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/893685769|title=Held in trust: Waqf in the Islamic world|others=Ghazaleh, Pascale,, Bouzidi, Fatiha|isbn=9789774163937|location=Cairo, Egypt|oclc=893685769}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they had a major role in the economy, the development of cities, and travel.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53093194|title=Constructing Ottoman beneficence : an imperial soup kitchen in Jerusalem|last=Amy|first=Singer|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780585471198|location=Albany|oclc=53093194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a Waqf took the form of rulers creating something for the benefit of their people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It required creating something that would be a source of renewable revenue and directing that revenue towards something, be it a specific individual, the community, or the local mosque so long as it brought one closer to God.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53226174|title=The public sphere in Muslim societies|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|others=Hoexter, Miriam., Eisenstadt, S.

[[File:Alexandria fortress Qaitbay.jpg|thumb|The [[Citadel of Qaitbay]] was maintained by Waqfs. |232x232px]]

=== Egypt ===
[[File:Tombs of the Mamluks, photo by Hatem Moushir 2.jpg|left|thumb|Tombs of the Mamluks]]
In [[Egypt]], The [[Mamluks of Egypt|Mamluks]] practiced Waqf, seeing it as a way of keeping their property safe from government hands and as a way of transferring the bulk of their wealth to their children, going around the laws that prevented this directly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This became problematic in the 14th century when soldiers in the Egyptian army were rewarded by giving them temporary fiefs. Many of these were turned into Waqfs by their owners however, meaning the Mamluk government could no longer reclaim them for redistribution. This would affect the size of the army. In 1378-79, [[Barquq]] argued this was causing harm to the state and used this as a justification for dissolving the agrarian Waqfs.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Waqfs also served as a way for the Mamluk converts to Islam to demonstrate their faith by participating in it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also provided a way for the Mamluk rulers to demonstrate their power and wealth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Waqf would become more popular under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rulers in later years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The Waqf enables a wealthy founder to insure the economic well-being of his descendants by the mechanism of donating his estate to a waqf or trust for the support of a [[madrasah]].  The founder could legally appoint himself and his heirs as professor of law and headmaster, a position that can be passed down through the family in perpetuity and one that had the important function of insuring the ongoing prominence of a man and his descendants while "sheltering family assets" from taxation.&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;Toby E. Huff, ''The Rise of Early Modern Science; Islam China and the West'', second edition, Cambridge University Press, 1993, 2003, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chamberlain"&gt;Chamberlain, Michael, ''Knowledge and Social Practice in Medieval Damascus, 1190–1350'', Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Waqf was often used in this way by families to keep money within the immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powers|first=David|date=October 1999|title=The Islamic Family Endowment (Waqf)|url=|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law|volume=32| issue =  4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century in [[Tripoli]], Waqf was often used to benefit the nuclear family, excluding the extended family that would have gotten a share of the wealth had the normal inheritance laws been followed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of this, the Waqf has been criticized for allowing wealth to be maintained by the few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/313730507|title=Land, law and Islam: property and human rights in the Muslim world|last=Siraj|first=Sait|date=2006|publisher=Zed Books|others=Lim, Hilary|isbn=9781842778104|location=London|oclc=313730507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the waqf contributed to the ossification of science in the Muslim world because the law of waqf "permitted little deviation form the original founder's stipulations."&lt;ref name="Huff"/&gt;

==Piracy==
{{Main|Barbary corsairs}}

The small Muslim states on the Persian Gulf and the coast of the Maghreb were supported by a unique economic model of piracy in which the ruler regularly plundered merchant ships and launched [[Ghazi (warrior)|Razzia]]s, raids, the coasts of non-Muslim lands as far off as Ireland and Iceland to capture slaves.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_02.shtml |title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The slaves could be profitably sold or chained as slave oarsmen to the pirate galleys, pulling the oars that powered the attacks that captured more slaves.  Ship owners or their governments could pay protection money to avoid capture.

==Raiding==

While Arab practiced participated in the traditional Arab occupation of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Razzia]]s, caravan raiding.  They led armed men to attack and plunder passing caravans.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;The historical Muhammad, Irving M. Zeitlin, Polity, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}} This economic model remained popular among Muslim tribes for many centuries.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"/&gt;{{rp|26}} Merchants could pay protection money to the caravan raiders.

Another model of Arab raiding was practiced by armed nomadic Bedouin tribes who attacked settled farmers - Christian in the early centuries, later also Muslim villages.  This was a successful and steady income model, especially since the villagers would pay protection money and save the Bedouin the trouble and risk of actual fighting.&lt;ref name="Ginat"&gt;J. Ginat, Anatoly Michailovich Khazanov, ''Changing Nomads in a Changing World'', Sussex Academic Press, 1998, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery==
{{Main|Arab slave trade}}

==Oil==
The discovery of large [[petroleum]] deposits in the early 20th century revolutionized the economy of much of the region,  particularly the states of [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[UAE]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Qatar]] surrounding the [[Persian Gulf]], which are among the top oil or gas exporters worldwide. [[Algeria]], [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Sudan]] all have smaller but significant reserves.

=== East Africa ===
Eastern Africa, more specifically [[Sudan]], positioned itself for growth through the oil trade.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Arab+crude+oil+AND+Africa+history+Haseeb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwietePCnv3WAhXFzIMKHYBNBfkQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20Oil&amp;f=false|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|last=Dumper|first=Michael|last2=Stanley|first2=Bruce E.|date=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781576079195|location=|pages=299|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a sense of possible hope for Sudanese economic profit, Arabs financed manufactory motives in Sudan, expanding products to help industrialize Sudan during the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Despite the Arabs placing finances within Sudan territory, this seemed to have caused more issues as Ethiopians swarmed into Sudan, putting Sudan in a financially tough situation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== South Africa ===
South Africa’s history of oil imports from the Middle East shows a reliance on Iranian oil during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sq43lnbklEUC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Crude+oil+in+Africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj52qL_qP3WAhVl64MKHXDsANUQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Crude%20oil%20in%20Africa&amp;f=false|title=South Africa: Time Running Out : the Report of the Study Commission on U.S. Policy Toward Southern Africa|last=(U.S.)|first=Study Commission on U.

{{History Of The Cold War}}

The [[Cold War]] had many effects on society, both today and in the past. Primarily, communism was defeated. In Russia, [[military budget|military spending]] was cut dramatically and quickly. The effects of this  were very large, seeing as the military-industrial sector had previously employed one of every five Soviet adults&lt;ref name = "Aslund"&gt;Åslund, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and its dismantling left hundreds of millions throughout the former Soviet Union unemployed.&lt;ref name="Aslund" /&gt;

After Russia embarked on economic reforms in the 1990s, it suffered [[1998 Russian financial crisis|a financial crisis]] and a recession more severe than the United States and [[Germany]] had experienced during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name = "Nolan"&gt;Nolan, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Russian living standards have worsened overall in the post–Cold War years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017 |title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|location= |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|pages=63 |isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R. Ghodsee}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the economy has resumed growth since 1995.&lt;ref name="Nolan" /&gt;

The legacy of the Cold War continues to influence world affairs.&lt;ref name = "Halliday"&gt;{{Harvnb|Halliday|2001|p=2e}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="educationspace360"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationspace360.com/index.php/the-effects-of-the-cold-war-on-us-education-39 |title=The Effects of the Cold War on us Education by Michael Totten |publisher=Education Space 360 |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the post–Cold War world is widely considered as [[Polarity in international relations#Unipolarity|unipolar]], with the United States the sole remaining superpower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1217752.stm Country profile: United States of America].

Military expenditures by the US during the Cold War years were estimated to have been $8&amp;nbsp;trillion, while nearly 100,000&amp;nbsp;Americans lost their lives in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the loss of life among Soviet soldiers is difficult to estimate, as a share of their gross national product the financial cost for the Soviet Union was far higher than that of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the loss of life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' [[proxy war]]s around the globe, most notably in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; the incidence of interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises has declined sharply in the post–Cold War years.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;[http://www.systemicpeace.org/PC2005.pdf Monty G. Marshall and Ted Gurr, ''Peace and Conflict 2005''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624210152/http://www.systemicpeace.org/PC2005.pdf |date=June 24, 2008 }} (PDF), Center for Systemic Peace (2006). Retrieved on June 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of Cold War conflict, however, is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute.&lt;ref name="Halliday" /&gt; The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by Communist governments has produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name = "Halliday" /&gt; In Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and a large increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], while in other parts of the world, such as [[Afghanistan]], independence was accompanied by [[failed state|state failure]].&lt;ref name = "Halliday" /&gt;

Many nuclear legacies can be identified from the Cold War, such as the availability of new technologies for nuclear power and energy, and the use of radiation for improving medical treatment and health. Environmental remediation, industrial production, research science, and technology development have all benefited from the carefully managed application of radiation and other nuclear processes.

On the other hand, despite the end of the Cold War, military development and spending has continued, particularly in the deployment of nuclear-armed [[ballistic missiles]] and defensive systems.

Because there was no formalized treaty ending the Cold War, the former superpowers have continued to various degrees to maintain and even improve or modify existing [[nuclear weapons]] and delivery systems. Moreover, other nations not previously acknowledged as nuclear-weapons states have developed and tested nuclear-explosive devices.

The risk of [[Nuclear terrorism|nuclear and radiological terrorism]] by possible sub-national organizations or individuals is now a concern.

The international [[nonproliferation]] regime inherited from the Cold War still provides disincentives and safeguards against national or sub-national access to nuclear materials and facilities. Formal and informal measures and processes have effectively slowed national incentives and the tempo of international nuclear-weapons proliferation.

Numerous and beneficial uses of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] have evolved such as the use of nuclear energy to create electricity. Commercial nuclear-reactor operation and construction have persisted, with some notable increase in worldwide energy production. The management of nuclear waste remains somewhat unresolved, depending very much on government policies. However, the quantity of waste produced from nuclear power plants is relatively small, and nuclear waste has been proven to be recyclable. Several countries, including France, Japan, and Finland, currently reprocess nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Nuclear-Wastes/Radioactive-Waste-Management/#.UlSFNNK-2uI|title=Radioactive Waste Management - Nuclear Waste Disposal - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As nuclear weapons are becoming surplus to national military interests, they are slowly being dismantled, and in some cases their fissile material is being recycled to fuel civilian nuclear-reactors.

==Radiation legacies==
[[File:Radiation warning symbol-US.svg|thumb|120px]]

Because of the military and non-military exploitation of [[nuclear fission]], the Cold War brought forth some significant involuntary exposures to high-level [[radiation]].  The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused large-scale destruction through intense blast and fire, as well as acute and lingering radiation. Moreover, as a result of decades of nuclear-weapons production, experimentation, and testing, exposure to radiation above normal background levels occurred to scientists, technicians, military personnel, civilians, and animals.  Several significant [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|radiation-related accidents]] occurred at military and civilian nuclear reactors and facilities, causing direct fatalities, as well as involuntary occupational and public exposures.

Because numerous diagnostic and epidemiological studies have since been conducted, the medical effects of [[Radiation poisoning|radiation exposure]] are now better understood than they were during the Cold War. Comparatively large and involuntary doses and effects from radiation, [[Chemical weapons|chemical]], and biological agents have been documented. Some exposures were from deliberate human medical experiments and some from residues of highly toxic materials at contaminated sites.

While the nuclear facilities and residual products of the Cold War are mostly contained within secure boundaries, that is not necessarily the case for nuclear-propelled submarines that have been sunk at sea.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Security legacies==
Because of potential risk to national and international security, nuclear-weapons states have inherited substantial responsibilities in protecting and stabilizing their nuclear forces.

Not only must nuclear weapons and their delivery systems be secured and protected, other nuclear facilities and devices, such as reactors and propulsion systems, must be safeguarded. An appropriate continuing level of security is necessary through all life-cycle phases, from production to decommissioning. In addition, the entire military nuclear infrastructure requires protection, and that requires a commensurate allocation of funding.

Having once had widespread overseas nuclear bases and facilities, both the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States#Current status|United States]] and the former [[Nuclear weapons and Russia#Nuclear arsenal of Russia|Soviet Union]] have inherited particular responsibilities and costs.  Moreover, all nuclear-weapons states had developed not only production and servicing facilities, but also sometimes extensive military staging and storage.

Although the Cold War has ended, domestic basing and overseas deployment of nuclear weapons has not ended. Moreover, the nuclear-weapon states remain in various reduced but palpable conditions of defensive alert.

Risks of deliberate, accidental, or unauthorized nuclear devastation remain.  Moreover, terrorists and hackers continue to interfere with nuclear stability and confidence. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

World inventories of weapons-grade fissile materials are substantial, {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} much greater than now needed for military purposes. Until these materials can be demilitarized, they need to be security safeguarded.  Many production facilities are yet to be shut down.

In the meantime, sensitive materials have to be safely and securely stored, pending their conversion to non-military use. In particular, the successor states of the former Soviet Union were generally not in a position to finance and maintain secure safeguards when the Cold War came to such an unprepared and relatively sudden end.

National security and defense for nuclear-weapons states must be frequently reevaluated. The international arms-control treaty and verification regime inherited from the Cold War is only slowly being updated to reflect the realities of a broken international security environment.

==Military legacies==
Internal national-security military postures still dominate behavior among sovereign nations. The former superpowers have not  formally consummated their stand-down from Cold War military equipoise.

Strategic and tactical nuclear and conventional forces remain at levels comparatively high for a [[peacetime]] environment.  Localized conflicts and tensions have replaced the former bilateral nuclear confrontation.

As a lingering result, large inventories of nuclear weapons and facilities remain. Some are being recycled, dismantled, or recovered as valuable substances. As well, some chemical and [[biological weapons]] that were developed during the Cold War are still in existence, although many are being demilitarized.

Military policies and strategies are slowly being modified to reflect the increasing interval without major confrontation.

Because of large extant inventories of weapons, [[fissile]] materials, and rapid-response delivery systems, a mutual danger coexists for accidental, misjudged, or miscalculated incidents or warfare.

Other Cold War weapons states, are slowly reducing their arsenals. In the meantime, they have not abandoned their dependency on nuclear deterrence, while a few more nations have attempted or succeeded in carrying out nuclear-explosive tests and thus creating their own nuclear deterrence.

During the Cold War, an international fabric of arms-control constraint had evolved, much of it carried over as a beneficial heritage with institutional mechanisms for multilateral or international function and verification.

==Institutional legacies==
Aside from tangible measures of national defense, such as standing military and security forces and hardware, are various institutional structures of government and functionality that have less to do directly with military or security factors, but more to do with underlying public attitudes and risks. These institutional structures and perceptions have had their own challenges and adjustments after the Cold War.

Strong impressions were made and continue to affect national psyche as a result of close brushes with all-out nuclear warfare.  In some cases this had resulted in aversion to warfare, in other cases to callousness regarding nuclear threats. Peaceful applications of nuclear energy received a stigma still difficult to exorcize.

Heightened fear of nuclear risk can result in resistance to military draw down.  What at one time was fastidious attention regarding nuclear security, secrecy, and safety could deteriorate to lax attitudes.

Public impressions and insecurities gained during the Cold War could carry over to the peacetime environment.&lt;ref name="educationspace360" /&gt; Continuing support for the weapons establishment depends on public support despite diminished threats to national security. Agencies and departments created during a time of crisis no longer need to fill the same role.

In fact, these same institutional structures can be modified to carry out knowledgeable new missions associated with the cleanup and storage of highly dangerous and toxic materials.  Some materials can be converted to non-military uses. Others need to be secured and safely stored almost indefinitely.

Also, misunderstandings that were prominent during the Cold War now need clarification so that closure can be reached, especially about the ability to demilitarize and peacefully use nuclear materials.

Underhanded practices in the name of national security are no longer countenanced. The existence of many third-world insurgencies and interventions is now being uncovered as the former cloak of secrecy unveils or their perpetrators confess.

==Economic legacies==

Among the more specific consequences of the Cold War was a huge fiscal mortgage placed on many domestic economies. Financial obligations included those necessary to avoid further dislocations while the change took place from a wartime footing to a peacetime environment. National military establishments and alliances had to be reconfigured. Highly dependent institutional frameworks were to be restructured, and new obligations were acquired by nations that were once bystanders to the East-West confrontation.

In the wake of the Cold War, freed or newly founded nations inherited expenses, commitments, and resources for which they were not prepared. The successor states also found themselves with contemporary national-security burdens and substantial environmental contamination legacies, all to be financed while new or revised civilian economies had to be instituted. Since the superpowers carried much of the confrontational burden, both Russia and the United States ended up with substantial economic liabilities.

The '''General Atomics Avenger''' (formerly '''Predator C''') is a developmental [[unmanned combat air vehicle]] built by [[General Atomics Aeronautical Systems]] for the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]].  Its first flight occurred on 4 April 2009.&lt;ref name=aviationweek41709&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/AVENGER041709.xml&amp;headline=Predator%20C%20Avenger%20Makes%20First%20Flights|title=Predator C Avenger Makes First Flights|last=Fulghum|first=David A.|author2=Sweetman, Bill|date=17 April 2009|work=[[Aviation Week]]|accessdate=18 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812041116/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news%2FAVENGER041709.xml&amp;headline=Predator%20C%20Avenger%20Makes%20First%20Flights|archive-date=12 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''Avenger UAV Revealed''", Air Force Magazine, June 2009, Volume 92, Number 6, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous [[MQ-1 Predator]] and [[MQ-9 Reaper]] (Predator B) drones, the Avenger is powered by a [[turbofan engine]], and its design includes [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] features such as internal weapons storage, and an S-shaped exhaust for reduced [[infrared signature|infrared]] and [[Radar cross-section|radar]] signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/AVENGE041509.xml New Predator C Hints At Stealth, Weaponry]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Avenger will support the same weapons as the MQ-9, and carry the Lynx [[synthetic aperture radar]] and a version of the [[F-35 Lightning II]]'s electro-optical targeting system (EOTS), called the Advanced Low-observable Embedded Reconnaissance Targeting (ALERT) system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/AVENGER091809.xml&amp;headline=Stealthy%20F-35%20Sensor%20To%20Fly%20On%20Avenger%20UAV Stealthy F-35 Sensor To Fly On Avenger UAV]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ga-asi.com/news_events/index.php?read=1&amp;id=186 |title=GA-ASI Successfully Executes First Flight of Predator C Avenger |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422175802/http://www.ga-asi.com/news_events/index.php?read=1&amp;id=186 |archivedate=22 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Avenger will use the same ground support infrastructure as the MQ-1 and MQ-9, including the [[ground control station]] and existing communications networks.&lt;ref name=aviationweek41709/&gt;

==Operational history==

===Flight testing===
The first flight of the first prototype Avenger occurred on 4 April 2009 at the company's [[Grey Butte Field Airport]] Flight Operations Facility in [[Palmdale, California]].  The aircraft took off and landed without any discrepancies and was ready to fly again once refueled.  Following flights were performed successfully on 13 and 14 April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deagel.com/news/Jet-Powered-Predator-C-Avenger-Successfully-Executes-First-Flight_n000005946.aspx Jet-Powered Predator C Avenger Successfully Executes First Flight] – Deagel.com, 20 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The second prototype Avenger performed its first flight on 12 January 2012, meeting all performance objectives and refining the first prototype design to an operational capability.  The Tail 2 prototype featured a four-foot longer fuselage to accommodate larger payloads and more fuel.  This larger Avenger can carry a larger payload of up to {{convert|3500|lb}} of weapons internally and on its wing hard points.

On 15 February 2012, the Air Force cancelled its MQ-X program, which was supposed to find an aircraft to replace the [[MQ-9 Reaper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2012/02/15/usaf-says-adios-to-mq-x/ USAF says adios to MQ-X] – DoDBuzz.com, 15 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Sea Avenger variant is part of the Navy's [[Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike]] (UCLASS) program.  If it is selected by the Navy, the Air Force may consider buying the ground-based version for service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/03/navy-next-killer-drone/?pid=1826&amp;viewall=true One of These Bots Will Be the Navy’s Next Killer Drone] – Wired.com, 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2012, the Avenger flew for three hours while being controlled by the General Atomics Advanced Cockpit Ground Control Station (GCS).  The Advanced Cockpit GCS has a wrap-around visual display and multi-dimensional moving map to increase situational awareness and reduce pilot workload.  The Advanced Cockpit GCS has flown an MQ-1 Predator and is planned to fly an MQ-9 Reaper as part of an Air Force initiative to enable interoperability with all USAF Remote Piloted Aircraft (RPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga.com/press-releases/588-advanced-cockpit-ground-control-station-flies-predator-c-avenger Advanced Cockpit Ground Control Station Flies Predator C Avenger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429230627/http://www.ga.com/press-releases/588-advanced-cockpit-ground-control-station-flies-predator-c-avenger |date=29 April 2013 }} – General Atomics press release, 24 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, a third Avenger was scheduled to begin flight testing. Assembly of the fourth Avenger was expected to be finished by spring 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcemag.com/DRArchive/Pages/2013/June%202013/June%2024%202013/Ready-to-Go.aspx Ready to Go] – Air Force Magazine, 26 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2016, General Atomics flew an extended-range Avenger featuring wings extended by {{convert|3.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|23.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  The extended wings add about {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of fuel totaling {{convert|4600|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, extending endurance from 15 hours to 20 hours but reducing internal payload to {{convert|3000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.  Since its first flight in 2009, the Avenger has completed more than 13,000 flight hours, reaching 11,000 hours in July 2016 and accumulating most of those hours within the past three years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/general-atomics-flies-extended-range-avenger-431398/ General Atomics flies extended-range Avenger] – Flightglobal.com, 11 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ainonline11nov16"&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2016-11-11/general-atomics-predator-c-avenger-er-makes-first-flight General Atomics Predator C Avenger ER Makes First Flight] – Ainonline.com, 11 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential deployments===
In December 2011, it was reported that the Air Force had ordered an Avenger and that it would be deployed to Afghanistan.  "This aircraft will be used as a test asset and will provide a significantly increased weapons and sensors payload capacity on an aircraft that will be able to fly to targets much more rapidly than the MQ-9 [Reaper] UAS," the USAF said in an announcement. "Since it has an internal weapons bay and four hardpoints on each wing it will also allow greater flexibility and will accommodate a large selection of next generation sensor and weapons payloads."  The aircraft ordered was the original Tail 1 prototype version.  This announcement sparked rumors that the aircraft would be deployed to monitor neighboring Iran and Pakistan.  These allegations were made because the Avenger is stealthy, while the battlespace over Afghanistan is free of radar guided missiles, as well as any other anti-aircraft weapons.  The announcement also came two weeks after the [[Iran-US RQ-170 incident]].  The Air Force responded by clarifying that the purchase was initiated in July of that year, well before the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-air-force-orders-general-atomics-avenger-365902/ US Air Force orders General Atomics Avenger] – Flightglobal.com, 12 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/12/stealth-drone-afghanistan/ New Armed Stealth Drone Heads to Afghanistan (And Maybe Iran, Too)] – Wired.com, 13 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Air Force later clarified that the Avenger was being purchased only as a test asset, and that it was not being sent to Afghanistan.  Discrepancies in the solicitation are believed to have caused the misinterpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defensetech.org/2011/12/22/predator-c-not-going-to-afghanistan/ USAF’s New Drone Not Going to Afghanistan] – Defensetech.org, 22 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After testing, the Air Force decided that the Avenger version they evaluated offered only modest improvements over the MQ-9 in terms of speed, payload, and reduced signature, and didn't meet survivability and reliability requirements to survive in contested environments needed to warrant buying a new aircraft of the type.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-u-s-air-force-was-not-fond-of-the-next-gen-predator-drone-77cb9a3d10b8 The U.S. Air Force Was Not Fond of the Next-Gen Predator Drone] – Medium.com/War-is-Boring, 13 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

With the drawdown of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|War in Afghanistan]], the U.S. may lose airbases inside the country that are necessary for striking targets in neighboring Pakistan.  Plans are being made to relocate drone bases to other countries in Central Asia to avoid needing U.S. military personnel to protect their bases in Afghanistan.  Due to the longer distances from potential targets, General Atomics has pitched the Avenger to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] as a better drone for the mission.  The jet-powered Avenger can fly {{convert|1800|mi|km|abbr=on}} from its operating base and stay airborne for 18 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2014/02/avenger/ New Jet-Powered Drone Can Kill 1,800 Miles From Home Base] – Wired.com, 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2016, the General Atomics vice president revealed that the Avenger was used to conduct a leaflet drop in Syria.&lt;ref name="ainonline11nov16"/&gt;

===Export===
General Atomics has offered the Predator C Avenger to Canada as a contender for its Joint Unmanned Surveillance and Target Acquisition System (JUSTAS) armed UAV project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/ain-defense-perspective/2013-04-26/canadas-uav-requirement-prompts-new-move-ga-asi Canada’s UAV Requirement Prompts New Move by GA-ASI] – Ainonline.com, 26 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the JUSTAS project was prioritized by the Royal Canadian Air Force and Liberal government. The RCAF has requested that the drones be armed, therefore making the General Atomics Avenger the only suitable contender as Northrop Grumman's [[RQ-4]] 'Arctic Hawk' is unarmed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/politics/vance-canada-armed-drones-1.3480278&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2015, the U.S. stated they backed India's membership in the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]], which would enable them to buy armed drones.  Two days later, the [[Indian Air Force]] sent a letter to General Atomics saying it wanted to purchase the Avenger.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/india-seeks-armed-u-s-predator-drones-in-challenge-to-Pakistan India Seeks Armed Drones From U.S. in Challenge to Pakistan] – Bloomberg.com, 9 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 17 August 2017, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) is in the early stages of negotiating the potential sale of as many as 90 Predator C Avenger remotely piloted aircraft to an unidentified international customer. The renewed international interest is believed to be led by India, which has requested access to the capability as a potential follow-on to the planned acquisition of as many as 22 GA-ASI MQ-9B Sea Guardian UAVs&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/defense/avenger-c-prospects-brighten-potential-international-deal?NL=AW-05&amp;Issue=AW-05_20170818_AW-05_447&amp;sfvc4enews=42&amp;cl=article_1&amp;elq2=bca494f7bbfe422baf207c26068301ef Avenger C Prospects Brighten With Potential International Deal]&lt;/ref&gt; and which wanted to acquire 100 Avengers for its air force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/india-us-ties-govt-eyes-8-bn-defence-deal-for-100-avenger-predator-drones-117092200288_1.html|title=India-US ties: Govt eyes $8-bn defence deal for 100 Avenger Predator drones|last=Team|first=BS Web|date=2017-09-22|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

===Sea Avenger===
On 3 May 2010, GA-ASI introduced Sea Avenger, a carrier-based derivative of the Predator C Avenger UAS, intended to fulfill the U.S. Navy's need for an [[Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike]] (UCLASS). The Sea Avenger included a retractable electro-optical/infrared sensor, internal weapons bay, and folding wings. The aircraft's structure was designed with the flexibility to accommodate carrier suitable landing gear, [[tailhook]], drag devices, and other provisions for carrier operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga-asi.com/news_events/index.php?read=1&amp;id=285 "GA-ASI Introduces Sea Avenger UAS for UCLASS Carrier Operations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062821/http://www.ga-asi.com/news_events/index.php?read=1&amp;id=285 |date=11 July 2011 }} [[General Atomics Aeronautical Systems]], Inc. Accessed 4 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, General Atomics displayed images of the Sea Avenger at the Navy League Sea Air and Space exposition.  As requirements for the UCLASS program were altered from a high-end strike aircraft to an [[ISTAR#ISR (Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance)|ISR]] machine operating in permissive environments, the Sea Avenger was modified accordingly.  It appeared to have four external hardpoints and a small weapons bay, a wing-mounted buddy-refueling store to perform as an aerial tanker, and a larger airframe with a larger engine.  If Navy requirements favored a UAV optimized for permissive ISR over broadband stealth, the Sea Avenger would better meet them, as it was originally pitched as having a reduced signature to be "stealthier" than other aircraft.  Sea Avenger stealth capabilities seemed to be limited to higher frequencies like C, X, and Ku bands, instead of broadband stealth effective against [[low-frequency radar]] bands like VHF and UHF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.usni.org/2014/04/10/general-atomics-shows-companys-uclass-option General Atomics Shows Off Company’s UCLASS Option] – News.USNI.org, 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, General Atomics released images of its submission for the Navy's [[MQ-25 Stingray]], an unmanned aerial tanker that formed out of the UCLASS effort. The aircraft is an Avenger-based wing-body-tail design with a standard D-704 buddy tank refueling system that has an electro-optical ball like the Predator and Reaper, landing gear that pulls into the fuselage, and a system for maneuvering around the flight deck using gestures from the flight crew. Though specifics are not known, the basic requirements will have the Stingray deliver about {{convert|15000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fuel {{convert|500|nmi|mi km}} from the aircraft carrier to increase the [[F/A-18 Super Hornet]]'s [[combat radius]] from {{convert|450|to|700|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.usni.org/2017/10/10/navy-releases-final-mq-25-stingray-rfp-general-atomics-bid-revealed Navy Releases Final MQ-25 Stingray RFP; General Atomics Bid Revealed] - News.USNI.org, 10 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; GA-ASI's design is larger than the Sea Avenger and is powered by the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW800|Pratt &amp; Whitney PW815 high-bypass turbofan]], the same engine used on the [[Gulfstream G600]]. Generating {{cvt|16000|lb|abbr=on}} of thrust, it is four times more powerful than the Predator C's PW545B turbofan,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2018-02-16/ga-asi-designs-new-uav-us-navys-mq-25-contest GA-ASI Designs a New UAV For U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 Contest].

===Avenger ER===
On 27 October 2016, [[General Atomics Aeronautical Systems]], Inc. (GA-ASI) conducted the maiden flight of the Avenger ER. GA-ASI extended the wingspan of the Avenger ER by {{cvt|3.2|m|abbr=on}} to {{cvt|23.2|m|abbr=on}}, and enlarged its fuel capacity by {{cvt|1000|kg|abbr=on}} to {{cvt|4600|kg|abbr=on}} compared to previous specifications. The aircraft carries up to {{cvt|1360|kg|abbr=on}} in its internal payload bay, {{cvt|227|kg|abbr=on}} less than previously described. The modifications extend its endurance from the original 15 hours to 20 hours. The Avenger ER utilizes a modified fuselage design (completed in 2012) extended by four feet (to {{cvt|13.4|m|abbr=on}}) to accommodate larger payloads and more fuel. Earlier in 2016, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration granted GA-ASI an experimental certificate that allows it to fly the Avenger in the National Airspace System.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2016-11-11/general-atomics-predator-c-avenger-er-makes-first-flight&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/general-atomics-flies-extended-range-avenger-431398/ General Atomics flies extended-range Avenger]. ''Flight International''. 11 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; From 24–25 January 2018, an Avenger ER set a new endurance record of 23.4 continuous hours, exceeding the 20 hour flight test goal and reflecting a 10-hour improvement over the baseline Predator C Avenger. The Avenger ER also has an increased maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW) of {{cvt|19500|lb|abbr=on}} using a co-cured composite center wing and heavyweight landing gear as well as a dual redundant, light weight brake control capability using a lightweight Hybrid Linear anti-lock brake system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180405006052/en/GA-ASI-Avenger-ER-Sets-New-Endurance-Record GA-ASI Avenger ER Sets New Endurance Record Flying 23.4 Consecutive Hours].

[[Image:Houston Gun Show at the George R. Brown Convention Center.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors at a [[gun show]]]] 
The term '''gun culture''' in the United States encompasses the behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs about [[firearm]]s and their usage by civilians. Gun ownership in the United States is constitutionally protected by the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. Firearms are widely used in the United States of America for self-defense, [[hunting]], and recreational uses, such as [[target shooting]].
[[Gun politics]] in the United States tends to be polarized between advocates of [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], often [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], and those who support stricter [[gun control]], often [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. 
The gun culture of the United States can be considered unique among developed countries in terms of the large number of firearms owned by civilians, generally permissive regulations, and high levels of [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fisher |first=Max |date=December 15, 2012 |title=What makes America's gun culture totally unique in the world, in four charts |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/15/what-makes-americas-gun-culture-totally-unique-in-the-world-as-demonstrated-in-four-charts/ |newspaper=Washington Post |location=Washington D.C. |publisher= |accessdate=January 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cowboy.1887.ws.jpg|thumb|Firearms became readily identifiable symbols of [[westward expansion]].]]

American attitudes on gun ownership date back to the [[American Revolutionary War]], and find an origin also in the hunting/sporting [[ethos]], and the militia/frontier ethos that draw from the country's early history.&lt;ref name="SpitzerCh1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spitzer|first=Robert J.|title=The Politics of Gun Control|year=1995|publisher=Chatham House|isbn=9781566430227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calamity jane.jpeg|right|upright|thumb|[[Calamity Jane]], notable pioneer frontierswoman and scout, at age 43. Photo by [[H.R. Locke]].]]
The American hunting/sporting passion comes from a time when the United States was an agrarian, subsistence nation where hunting was a profession for some, an auxiliary source of food for some settlers, and also a deterrence to animal predators. A connection between shooting skills and survival among rural American men was in many cases a necessity and a '[[rite of passage]]' for those entering manhood. Today, hunting survives as a central sentimental component of a gun culture as a way to control animal populations across the country, regardless of modern trends away from subsistence hunting and rural living.&lt;ref name="SpitzerCh1"/&gt;

The militia/frontiersman spirit derives from an early American dependence on arms to protect themselves from foreign armies and hostile Native Americans. Survival depended upon everyone being capable of using a weapon. Prior to the [[American Revolution]] there was neither budget nor manpower nor government desire to maintain a full-time army. Therefore, the armed citizen-soldier carried the responsibility. Service in militia, including providing one's own ammunition and weapons, was mandatory for all men—just as registering for military service upon turning eighteen is today. Yet, as early as the 1790s, the mandatory universal militia duty gave way to voluntary militia units and a reliance on a [[regular army]]. Throughout the 19th century the institution of the civilian militia began to decline.&lt;ref name = "SpitzerCh1"/&gt;

Closely related to the militia tradition was the frontier tradition with the need for a means of self-protection closely associated with the nineteenth century westward expansion and the [[American frontier]]. There remains a powerful central elevation of the gun associated with the hunting/sporting and militia/frontier ethos among the American Gun Culture.&lt;ref name="SpitzerCh1" /&gt; Though it has not been a necessary part of daily survival for over a century, generations of Americans have continued to embrace and glorify it as a living inheritance—a permanent element of the nation's style and culture.&lt;ref&gt;JERVIS ANDERSON, GUNS IN AMERICA 10 (1984), page 21&lt;/ref&gt; In popular literature, frontier adventure was most famously told by [[James Fenimore Cooper]], who is credited by Petri Liukkonen with creating the archetype of an 18th-century frontiersman through such novels as ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1826) and ''[[The Deerslayer]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/jfcooper.htm |title=James Fenimore Cooper |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823203150/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/jfcooper.htm |archivedate=23 August 2014 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buffalo bill wild west show c1899.jpg|right|thumb|A handbill for ''Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World'']]

== Popular culture ==
In the late 19th century, cowboy and [[American Old West|"Wild West"]] imagery entered the collective imagination. The first American female superstar, [[Annie Oakley]], was a [[sharpshooter]] who toured the country starting in 1885, performing in [[Buffalo Bill]]'s Wild West show. The cowboy archetype of individualist hero was established largely by [[Owen Wister]] in stories and novels, most notably ''The Virginian'' (1902), following close on the heels of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s ''The Winning of the West'' (1889–1895), a history of the early frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=American Literature: Prose, MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564847_8/American_Literature_Prose.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwqNkxgD?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564847_8/American_Literature_Prose.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/i_r/roosevelt.htm |title=New Perspectives on the West: Theodore Roosevelt, PBS, 2001 |publisher=Pbs.org |date=1919-01-06 |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/owister.htm |title=Owen Wister |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103126/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/owister.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowboys were also popularized in turn of the 20th century cinema, notably through such early classics as ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903) and ''A California Hold Up'' (1906)—the most commercially successful film of the pre-nickelodeon era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/westernfilms.html |title="Western Films", Tim Dirks, Filmsite, 1996-2007 |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gangster films began appearing as early as 1910, but became popular only with the advent of sound in film in the 1930s. The genre was boosted by the events of the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] era, such as bootlegging and the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] of 1929, the existence of real-life gangsters (e.g., [[Al Capone]]) and the rise of contemporary [[organized crime]] and escalation of urban violence. These movies flaunted the archetypal exploits of "swaggering, cruel, wily, tough, and law-defying bootleggers and urban gangsters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/crimefilms.html |title="Crime and Gangster Films", Tim Dirks, Filmsite, 1996-2007 |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of [[World War II]], Hollywood produced many morale boosting movies, patriotic rallying cries that affirmed a sense of national purpose. The image of the lone cowboy was replaced in these combat films by stories that emphasized group efforts and the value of individual sacrifices for a larger cause, often featuring a group of men from diverse ethnic backgrounds who were thrown together, tested on the battlefield, and molded into a dedicated fighting unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/hollywood_history.cfm#wartime |title=Hollywood as History: Wartime Hollywood, Digital History |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129043014/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/hollywood_history.cfm#wartime |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guns frequently accompanied famous heroes and villains in late 20th-century American films, from the outlaws of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), to the fictitious law and order avengers like ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971) and ''[[RoboCop (1987 film)|RoboCop]]'' (1987). In the 1970s, films portrayed fictitious and exaggerated characters, madmen ostensibly produced by the [[Vietnam War]] in films like ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976) and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), while other films told stories of fictitious veterans who were supposedly victims of the war and in need of rehabilitation (''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'' and ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', both 1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/hollywood_history.cfm#new |title=Hollywood as History: The "New" Hollywood, Digital History |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129043014/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/hollywood_history.cfm#new |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many action films continue to celebrate the gun toting hero in fantastical settings. At the same time, the negative role of the gun in fictionalized modern urban violence has been explored in films like ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' (1991) and ''[[Menace 2 Society]]'' (1993).

== Political and cultural theories ==
Gun culture and its effects have been at the center of major debates in the US's public sphere for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Armed America: The Remarkable Story of How and Why Guns Became as American as Apple Pie|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TLcGOLAa3BIC|publisher = Thomas Nelson Inc|date = 2009-08-24|isbn = 9781418551872|first = Clayton E.|last = Cramer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1970 article "America as a Gun Culture,"&lt;ref name="HofstadterAGC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofstadter |first=Richard |date=October 1970 |title=America as a Gun Culture |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/america-gun-culture |journal=American Heritage Magazine |publisher=American Heritage Publishing |volume=21 |issue=6 |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] used the phrase "gun culture" to describe America's long-held affection for guns, embracing and celebrating the association of guns and America's heritage. He also noted that the US "is the only industrial nation in which the possession of rifles, shotguns, and handguns is lawfully prevalent among large numbers of its population". In 1995, political scientist [[Robert Spitzer (political scientist)|Robert Spitzer]] said that the modern American gun culture is founded on three factors: the proliferation of firearms since the earliest days of the nation, the connection between personal ownership of weapons and the country's revolutionary and frontier history, and the cultural mythology regarding the gun in the frontier and in modern life.&lt;ref name="SpitzerPGC1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Spitzer |first=Robert J. |year=1995 |title=The Politics of Gun Control |publisher=Chatham House Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, in 2008, the US Supreme Court affirmed that considerable freedom for individuals to possess firearms is guaranteed by the Second Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf| title=US District of Columbia et al v Heller | publisher=US Supreme Court| date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms applied to opponents==
The terms that gun rights and gun control advocates use to refer to opponents are part of the larger topic of [[gun politics]].

The term "gun nut" has been used to describe firearms enthusiasts who are deeply involved with the gun culture. It is regarded as a [[pejorative]] [[stereotype]] cast upon gun owners by [[gun politics|anti-gun]] [[advocates]] as a means of implying that they are fanatical, exhibit abnormal behavior, or are a threat to the safety of others.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&amp;p_theme=bn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF9B07493D3700&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Shoot-out Confirms Foreign View of America as 'Gun Nut' Country]" by T.R.

Reid, ''Washington Post'', July 26, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Some gun owners embrace the term affectionately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fieldandstream.blogs.com/ The Gun Nut] blog at Field &amp; Stream&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hoplophobia]] is a political term used to describe an "irrational aversion to firearms, as opposed to justified apprehension about those who may wield them."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Jeff (1990). ''[http://www.usrepeals.org/ca/mtbpers/hoplophobia.html To Ride, Shoot Straight, and Speak the Truth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002191927/http://www.usrepeals.org/ca/mtbpers/hoplophobia.html |date=2013-10-02 }}''. Boulder, Colorado: Paladin Press. pp. 16–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign perspective==

The US attitude to guns generally perplexes those in other developed countries, who cannot understand the unusual permissiveness of American gun laws, and why the American public does not push for harsher gun control measures in the face of mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The world is 'mystified' by America's enduring racism and 'bizarre' gun laws|url = http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-world-is-mystified-by-americas-enduring-racism-and-bizarre-gun-laws-2015-6?r=US&amp;IR=T|website = Business Insider|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Rest of the First World Is Astounded by America's Enduring Gun Culture|url = http://www.thewire.com/global/2012/07/rest-first-world-astounded-americas-enduring-gun-culture/54967/|website = The Wire|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics contrast the US reaction to terrorism given how few deaths it causes, with their high death rates from non-terror related gun crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Australian Gun Reformer: 'It’s Time to Call Out the U.S.A.'|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/australia-tim-fischer-us-guns/418698/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US|first = Uri|last = Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = American gun use is out of control.

'''Hasan Beg Rumlu''' ({{Lang-fa|حسن بیگ روملو}}, born 1530 or 1531) was a 16th-century [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] military officer and historian. A cavalryman of the ''[[Qurchi (royal bodyguard)|qurchi]]'' corps, he is principally known for his [[chronicle]] of Safavid history; the ''Aḥsān al-tawārikh''.

== Biography ==
Most information about Hasan Beg's life stems from his own work, the ''Aḥsān al-tawārikh'', which he completed in 1578.{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}}{{efn|According to Quinn / ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' (2003), the ''Aḥsān al-tawārikh'' was "originally intended as a twelve-volume general history, of which only the last two volumes have survived".{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} According to Quinn &amp; Melville (2012): "he [Hasan Beg Rumlu] was a prolific writer if we are to believe that there were originally twelve volumes in his chronicle".{{sfn|Quinn|Melville|2012|page=213}}}} He was born in [[Qom]], a member of the [[Turkmens|Turkoman]] Rumlu tribe, and the grandson of Amir Soltan Rumlu, a prominent [[Qizilbash]] lord who served during the reign of King (''[[Shah]]'') [[Ismail I]] ({{reign|1501|1524}}).{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} Hasan Beg's Qizilbash background makes him "somewhat unique in the annals of Safavid historiography".{{sfn|Quinn|Melville|2012|page=213}} After his grandfather's death in 1539 or 1540, Hasan Beg found himself unable to gain command over his grandfather's army, because, according to his own explanation, "he was busy with his unpleasant duties as a ''[[Qurchi (royal bodyguard)|qurchi]]''".{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} Though a military officer, Hasan Beg "received the sort of training that was typical of a Persian administrator and bureaucrat".{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} For example, among other subjects he studied works on [[logic]] as well as the art of [[calligraphy]].{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} 

In 1541–1542, Hasan Beg accompanied King [[Tahmasp I]] ({{reign}}1524–1576) on an expedition to [[Dezful]], and from then he "was with the royal camp in all its journeys, and saw most events with his own eyes, thus becoming an eyewitness to most of the subsequent military events that he described".{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} In 1546–1547, some five years after the [[Dezful]] campaign, Hasan Beg fought in Tahmasp I's [[Safavid Georgia|Georgian]] campaigns. The last military episode in which Hasan Beg reports his own involvement was Tahmasp I's battle against the [[Ardalan]] Kurds in 1550.{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} 

Though Hasan Beg does not mention his involvement in succession matters after the death of Tahmasp I, contemporary author Abd-ol-Hossein Nava'i suggests that Hasan Beg sided with the other Rumlu's, who sought to install Prince Ismail Mirza (later known regnally as [[Ismail II]]; {{reign}}1576–1577) on the throne and who were adversaries of the pro-[[Haydar Mirza Safavi|Haydar Mirza]] camp.{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} Nava'i suggests that Hasan Beg may have been part of the Rumlu ''qurchis'' who took part in the murder of Haydar Mirza. When Ismail II died in 1577, Hasan Beg became part of the royal retinue of his successor, [[Mohammad Khodabanda]] ({{reign}}1578–1587).{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} 

Hasan Beg's "most enduring legacy is historiographical".{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} Later Safavid historians (e.g. [[Iskander Beg Munshi]]) used material from Hasan Beg's ''Aḥsān al-tawārikh'' in the sections of their works related to the rule of king Tahmasp I. Hasan Beg's work was used by [[Fazli Isfahani Khuzani]] for his ''Afżal al-tawārikh'' and also survives in "a very late cluster of mostly anonymous semi-fictional accounts of early Safavid history such as the ''ʿĀlamārā-ye Shah Esmāʿil''".{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}} Later historians also quoted material from Hasan Beg's work, even though they did not mention Hasan Beg by name.{{sfn|Quinn|2003|pages=31-32}}

The '''Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta)''' is a teaching and research institute at the [[ETH Zurich Faculty of Architecture|Department of Architecture]] of [[ETH Zurich]], situated on the ETH Zurich’s Hönggerberg Campus site.

== History ==
The Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) was founded on 1 January 1967 as a research body at the Architecture Department of ETH Zurich. &lt;ref&gt;  For the history of the institute see Martin Fröhlich, “Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur an der ETH-Zürich”, in Unsere Kunstdenkmaler, 24, no. 1 (1973), pp. 16–20; Katharina Medici-Mall, “Sammeln, forschen, ausstellen, publizieren: Das Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur an der ETH Zürich”, Aktuelles Bauen, 18 (April 1983), pp. 23–6; Ruth Hanisch and Steven Spier, “ ‘History is not the Past but Another Mightier Presence’: The Founding of the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich and its Effects on Swiss Architecture”, The Journal of Architecture, 14, no. 6 (2009), pp. 655–86.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The opening symposium was held on 23 June 1967. &lt;ref&gt;Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur (ed.), Reden und Vortrag zur Eröffnung (Birkhäuser: Basle, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since its beginnings in 1967, the past and the present, theory and practice, have been the cornerstones and reference framework for the work undertaken at the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta). Besides teaching activities in the fields of the history of art and architecture, [[architectural theory]] and [[urban design]], the institute’s core focus since its launch has lain in mediating and exploring architecture in its historical depth and thematic breadth. The results of the institute’s in-house research, which is primarily influenced by the areas of interest of the teaching staff and the holdings of the simultaneously established archive, have been presented since 1968 in a publication series. These first appeared in cooperation with the Birkhäuser publishing house (in the “rainbow series”), later with the Ammann publishing house and since the mid-1980s in the [[gta Verlag]], which today enjoys the reputation of being one of the leading architecture publishers.

The absorption of the so-called [[Gottfried Semper|Semper]] Archive from the ETH Bibliothek on the occasion of the creation of the institute forms the foundation of the [[gta Archives]], which over time has advanced to become an internationally renowned research facility. Since then, the main acquisition emphasis has been on the architecture of the nineteenth century and the pre-modern, modern (Swiss) architecture in the form of collections ([[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM)), as well as advance legacies and bequests of individual architects of international stature  (including [[Karl Moser]], [[Hans Bernoulli]], [[Lux Guyer]], [[Haefeli Moser Steiger]], [[Ernst Gisel]], [[Fritz Haller]] and [[Trix Haussmann|Trix]] and [[Robert Haussmann]]).

The organisational office for exhibitions by the ETH Zurich’s Department of Architecture became incorporated in the institute in 1974, and – since 1986 as gta Exhibitions – affords a wide public insight into contemporary architectural discourse and current research at the department.

=== Institute directors ===

* [[Laurent Stalder]] (born 1970), director since 2016

===Professorial chairs and divisions ===
Today the institute encompasses the following professorial chairs:
*  Chair of the History and Theory of Architecture, Maarten Delbeke 
*  Adjunct Professor of the History of Architecture of Modernity, Ita Heinze-Greenberg  
*  Chair of Theory of Architecture, Laurent Stalder 
*  Chair of the History of Art and Architecture, Philip Ursprung 
*  Chair of the History of Urban Design (vacant) 

The following divisions assist the research projects and convey their findings:
*  gta Archives 
*  gta Verlag
*  gta Exhibitions 

The gta Institute assists in the promotion of academic newcomers with its own doctoral programme (since 2012). The institute’s educational provisions are supplemented by the programme Master of Studies in the History and Theory of Architecture, which mediates between practice and scholarship (since 1992).
There is a close academic exchange with the Werner Oechslin Library Foundation, associated with the ETH Zurich via a cooperation agreement.

== Teaching and research areas ==

The institute’s task is to empirically appraise and theoretically reflect upon architecture in its historical depth and ideological breadth. Along with the establishing and verification of facts, the gta Institute has always been at pains to review applied methods in terms of their validity as models and to make them beneficial to contemporary architecture. As an institute, the gta researches and teaches the history of knowledge of architecture, building forms and techniques, the function of architecture and its relations to society and politics, the evolution of design and architectural thinking from the beginnings to today, as well as the methodologies of architectural history work ranging from building analysis through to the digital humanities.

He is currently the Richard Koret Professor of Modern [[Jewish history|Jewish History]] and Director of the Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry at Brandeis. On September 25, 2009, Reinharz announced his retirement as President of Brandeis,&lt;ref name ="resignation"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/09/25/brandeis_president_to_step_down/ Brandeis president to step down]&lt;/ref&gt; but at the request of the Board of Trustees, he stayed on until a replacement could be hired. On January 1, 2011, Reinharz became president of the Mandel Foundation.

==Biography==
Jehuda Reinharz was born in [[Haifa]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], now the [[State of Israel]]. He received his high school education in [[Germany]] and move to the United States as a teenager in 1961. Reinharz earned concurrent bachelor's degrees: a [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.S) from [[Columbia University]] and a [[Bachelor of Religious Education]] (B.R.E) from the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]]. He earned his master's degree in [[medieval]] Jewish history from [[Harvard University]] in 1968, and his Ph.D. in modern Jewish history from [[Brandeis University]] in 1972.

His wife, Shulamit Reinharz, is a professor of [[sociology]] at Brandeis University; she founded the [[Women's Studies Research Center]] and the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute, both of which she currently directs. They live in Brookline, MA. Their daughters Yael and Naomi live in New York City. 
==Academic career==
In 1972, Reinharz became the first professor of Jewish history at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], where he created the interdisciplinary program that formed the basis for the University's Frankel Center for Judaic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsa.umich.edu/judaic&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he became the Richard Koret Professor of Modern Jewish History in the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University. Two years later, he was named Director of the Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry at Brandeis, and eight years later he founded the Jacob and Libby Goodman Institute for the Study of [[Zionism]] and Israel. From 1991 to 1994, Dr. Reinharz served as [[Provost (education)|Provost]] and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs.

Reinharz was announced as the University's 7th president on March 2, 1994, succeeding [[Samuel O. Thier]]. During Reinharz's 17-year tenure, the university enjoyed major physical changes including the construction of the Village Residence Hall, Abraham Shapiro Academic Complex, Carl and Ruth Shapiro Campus Center, Carl Shapiro Science Center, Carl Shapiro Admissions center, Mandel Center for the Humanities, and many other major capital improvements. He raised $1.2 billion during his presidency and more than tripled the endowment, from $194 million to $772 million.

Reinharz announced his resignation as President of Brandeis University at midnight on September 25, 2009 after serving the Brandeis community for seventeen years. He stayed on as President until a successor was selected and ready to assume office. On January 1, 2011, Reinharz was officially replaced by [[Frederick M. Lawrence]],&lt;ref name ="resignation" /&gt; and on that date he became president of the Mandel Foundation. Upon stepping down, he made a $5 million gift to Brandeis for scholarships and fellowships.

==Awards and honors==
Reinharz is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, such as the President of Israel Prize, awarded by the Israeli Parliament ([[Knesset]]) in 1990. He was also elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1995 and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1999.

In 1998, Reinharz was appointed by President [[Bill Clinton]] to serve on the Presidential Advisory Commission on [[Holocaust]] Assets in the United States.

Reinharz is the recipient of honorary doctorates from [[Hebrew Union College]], the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]], [[Fairfield University]] in [[Connecticut]], [[Ben Gurion University]] in Israel, the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in Israel, [[Brandeis University]] and [[Hebrew College]].

Reinharz serves as chairman of the Advisory Board of the [[Genesis Prize|Genesis Prize Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Market Watch October 21, 2014 "Mayor Bloomberg Selected as Inaugural Genesis Prize Laureate" http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mayor-bloomberg-selected-as-inaugural-genesis-prize-laureate-2013-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he was elected chairman of the International Board of the Weizmann Institute in Israel.

==Published works==
Reinharz is the author of more than one hundred articles and 31 books in various languages. His ''Jew in the Modern World'' is one of the most widely adopted college texts in modern Jewish history. His two-volume biography of [[Chaim Weizmann]], the first [[President of Israel]], has won many prizes in Israel and the United States. His book, co-authored with the late Ben Halpern, entitled ''Zionism and the Creation of a New Society'', was published in 1998. ''Glorious, Accursed Europe'', co-authored with [[Yaacov Shavit]] was published in 2010.

His latest books are published in [[Hebrew]] and [[English language|English]]. In October 2005 he co-edited the letters and documents relating to the life and times of [[Manya Shochat]], a remarkable pioneer of the [[Second Aliyah]]. His book ''Israel in the Middle East'', co-edited with [[Itamar Rabinovich]], was published in 2007; three books, ''Darwin and Some of His Kind'' (2009), ''The Scientific God'' (2011) and ''Window Unto the World'' (2017), were co-authored with Yaacov Shavit.  In 2013 Reinharz co-authored ''The Road to September 1939'', with [[Yaacov Shavit]] (an English expanded version 2018), as well as ''Die Sprache der Judenfeindschaft im 21.Jahrhundert'', co-authored with Monika Schwarz-Friesel (2013).  An English translation appeared in January 2017 and is titled ''Inside the Antisemitic Mind''.

Reinharz co-wrote a book on the history of the donkey in literature, arguing that the animal is often used as a substitute for people. In the course of writing this book, he has said: "There are smart donkeys, stupid donkeys, evil donkeys, etc., and no one has ever contemplated this on a large scale... It’s probably the most ambitious topic Professor Shavit and I have ever contemplated."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/11/17/brandeis-president-reinharz-landed-college-jobs-with-big-pay-few-responsibilities/s9TXo4v2UdjE9lfqJND2pM/story.html#&lt;/ref&gt; The book, ''The Donkey: A Cultural History,'' was published in 2014 in Hebrew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3987">'''Jocelyn de Brakelond''' or ''Jocelin de Brakelonde'' was an [[English people|English]] [[monk]] and the author of a [[chronicle]] narrating the fortunes of the [[monastery]] of [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey]] between 1173 and 1202. He is only known through his own work.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Brakelond, Jocelyn de|volume=4|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joceylyn was a native of [[Bury St. Edmunds]]; he served his [[novitiate]] under [[Samson of Tottington]], who was at that time master of the novices, but afterwards sub-[[sacrist]], and, from 1182, [[abbot]] of the house. Jocelyn took the habit of religion in 1173, during the time of [[Abbot Hugo]] (1157–1180), through whose improvidence and laxity the abbey had become impoverished and the monks had lost discipline.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The fortunes of the abbey changed for the better with the election of Samson as Hugo's successor. Jocelyn, who became the abbot's chaplain within four months of the election, describes the administration of Samson at considerable length. He tells us that he was with Samson night and day for six years; the picture which he gives of his master, although coloured by enthusiastic admiration, is singularly frank and intimate. It is all the more convincing since Jocelyn is no stylist. His [[Latin language|Latin]] is familiar and easy, but the reverse of classical. He thinks and writes as one whose interests are wrapped up in his house; and the unique interest of his work lies in the minuteness with which it describes the policy of a monastic administrator who was in his own day considered as a model.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Jocelyn has also been credited with an extant but unprinted tract on the election of Abbot Hugo (Harleian manuscript 1005, fol. 165); from internal evidence this appears to be an error. He mentions a (non-extant) work which he wrote, before the ''Cronica'', on the miracles of Saint [[Robert of Bury]], a boy found murdered in 1181 whose death during a period of rising [[anti-Semitism]] was blamed on the local [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

J. G. Rokewood published an edition of ''Chronica Jocelini de Brakelonda de Rebus Gestis Samsonis Abbatis Monasterii Sancti Edmundi'' ([[Camden Society]]), in 1840. A translation and notes are given in TE Tomlin's ''Monastic and Social Life in the Twelfth Century in the Chronicle of Jocelyn de Brakelond'' (1844).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s 'book ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]'', which contrasted medieval and modern culture, used Tomlin's edition of Jocelyn as its principal source, making a hero of Abbot Samson, one of the main figures in Jocelyn's narrative.

A recent translation with a substantial introduction is: Jocelin of Brakelond, ''Chronicle of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds'', trans. Diana Greenway and Jane Sayers (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1989; reissue 2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4220">'''Julius Davidovich Brutzkus''' or '''Judah Loeb Brutzkus''' or '''Joselis Bruckus''' ({{lang-he|יהודה ליבּ בֶּן־דָּוִד ברוצקוס}}, ''Yehuda Loeb ben David Brutzkus'', {{lang-ru|Юлий Давидович Бруцкус}}; 1870, [[Palanga]], [[Courland Governorate]] – January 27, 1951 in [[Tel Aviv]]) was a [[Lithuanian Jew]]ish historian, scholar, and politician. 

He was born in 1870 in [[Palanga]], [[Courland Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (in present-day [[Lithuania]]). His brother was the economist [[Boris Brutskus|Boris Brutzkus]]. Julius studied in Moscow at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and the [[University of Moscow]]. His family, along with thousands of other Jewish families, was expelled from the city in 1892  (see [[May Laws]]). He was able to continue his education and received his doctorate in 1894. Brutzkus took part in the [[Russian Jewish]] bibliographical work, "{{lang|ru|Систематический Указатель Литературы о Евреях}}" (''Systematic Index of Literature concerning Jews'', "Sistematicheskiy Ukazatel Literatury o Yevreyakh"). Beginning in 1895, Brutzkus contributed to the Russian-Jewish periodical ''[[Voskhod (magazine)|Voskhod]]''. In 1899 he was appointed assistant editor of that periodical. 

Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Brutzkus authored a vast array of articles and books in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], Hebrew, and [[French language|French]] on the [[history of the Jews in Russia]]; he was particularly intrigued with the history of the [[Khazars]] and the early [[Rus' Khaganate]]. He also wrote numerous works on the economic and political history of [[Eastern Europe]] and the cultural history of [[Mizrahi Jew]]ry.

In 1923 he served as [[Lithuanian Ministry for Jewish Affairs|Minister for Jewish Affairs]] in the [[Lithuania]]n government and was elected to the [[Seimas|Lithuanian Parliament]] in November of that year.

Brutzkus was an ardent [[Zionist]] and encouraged Jews to engage in political action and self-defense.

[[Image:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|thumb|280px|Excavated dwellings at [[Skara Brae]]]]
'''Neolithic architecture''' refers to structures encompassing housing and shelter from approximately 10,000 to 2,000 BC, the [[Neolithic period]]. In southwest Asia, Neolithic cultures appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the [[Levant]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) and from there into the east and west. Early Neolithic structures and buildings can be found in southeast Anatolia, Syria, and Iraq by 8,000 BC with [[agriculture]] societies first appearing in southeast Europe by 7,000 BC, and central Europe by ca. 5,500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the  [[Kőrös culture|Star&amp;#269;evo-Koros (Cris)]], [[Linearbandkeramic]], and [[Vinca culture|Vin&amp;#269;a]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Housing==
[[File:AMK - Linearbandkeramik Modell Hienheim 3.jpg|thumb|Kelheim (Lower [[Bavaria]]), Germany. Archaeological Museum: Reconstruction of a settlement of the [[Linear Pottery culture]], 5th millennium BC.]]
The Neolithic peoples in the Levant, [[Anatolia]], [[Syria]], northern [[Mesopotamia]] and central Asia were great builders, utilising [[mud-brick]] to construct houses and villages. At [[Çatalhöyük]], houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. 

In Europe, the [[Neolithic long house]] with a timber frame, pitched roof, [[thatching|thatched roof]], and walls finished in [[wattle and daub]] could be very large, presumably housing a whole extended family.  Villages might comprise only a few such houses.

Neolithic [[pile dwelling]]s have been excavated in Sweden ([[Alvastra pile dwelling]]) and in the circum-Alpine area, with remains being found at the [[Mondsee (lake)|Mondsee]] and [[Attersee (lake)|Attersee]] lakes in [[Upper Austria]]. Early [[archeology|archaeologists]] like [[Ferdinand Keller (antiquity scholar)|Ferdinand Keller]] thought they formed artificial islands, much like the Scottish [[Crannog]]s, but today it is clear that the majority of settlements was located on the shores of lakes and were only inundated later on. Reconstructed pile dwellings are shown in [[open-air museum]]s in [[Pfahlbau Museum Unteruhldingen|Unteruhldingen]] and [[Zurich]] (Pfahlbauland).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, Neolithic settlements included wattle-and-daub structures with thatched roofs and floors made of logs covered in clay.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghiu, D. (2010). The technology of building in Chalcolithic southeastern Europe, pp. 95-100. In Gheorghiu, D. (ed.), ''Neolithic and Chalcolithic Architecture in Eurasia: Building Techniques and Spatial Organisation. Proceedings of the XV UISPP World Congress (Lisbon, 4–9 September 2006) / Actes du XV Congrès Mondial (Lisbonne, 4-9 Septembre 2006)'', Vol 48, Session C35, BAR International Series 2097, Archaeopress, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also when the [[burdei]] [[pit-house]] (below-ground) style of house construction was developed, which was still used by Romanians and Ukrainians until the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Neolithic [[List of archaeological sites|settlements and "cities"]] include:
* [[Jericho]] in the Levant, Neolithic from around 8,350 BC, arising from the earlier [[Epipaleolithic]] [[Natufian culture]]
* [[Çatalhöyük]] in [[Turkey]], 7,500 BC
* [[Mehrgarh]] in [[Pakistan]], 7,000 BC
* [[Göbekli Tepe]] in Turkey, ca. 9,000 BC
* [[Nevali Cori]] in Turkey, ca. 8,000 BC
* [[Knap of Howar]] and [[Skara Brae]], the [[Orkney Islands]], [[Prehistoric Scotland|Scotland]], from 3,500 BC
* over 3,000 settlements of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]], some with populations up to 15,000 residents, flourished in present-day [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]] from 5,400–2,800 BC.

==Tombs and ritual monuments==
Elaborate [[funerary monument|tombs]] for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousand still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built [[long barrow]]s and [[chamber tomb]]s for their dead and [[causewayed camp]]s, [[henge]]s and [[cursus]] monuments.

===Megalithic architecture===
[[File:Anta Cerqueira em Couto Esteves.JPG|thumb|280px|A dolmen at [[Couto Esteves]], [[Portugal]]]]
[[Image:Dscn5212-mane-braz 800x600.jpg|thumb|280px|Megalithic tomb, [[Mane Braz]], Brittany]]
[[Megalith]]s found in Europe and the Mediterranean were also erected in the Neolithic period. These monuments include both megalithic tombs, [[temple]]s and several structures of unknown function. Tomb architecture is normally easily distinguished by the presence of human remains that had originally been buried, often with recognizable intent. Other structures may have had a mixed use, now often characterised as religious, ritual, astronomical or political. The modern distinction between various architectural functions with which we are familiar today, now makes it difficult for us to think of some megalithic structures as multi-purpose socio-cultural centre points. Such structures would have served a mixture of socio-economic, ideological, political functions and indeed aesthetic ideals.

The megalithic structures of [[Ġgantija]], [[Tarxien Temples|Tarxien]], [[Ħaġar Qim]], [[Mnajdra]], [[Ta' Ħaġrat Temples|Ta' Ħaġrat]], [[Skorba Temples|Skorba]] and smaller satellite buildings on [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]], first appearing in their current form around 3600 BC, represent one of the earliest examples of a fully developed architectural statement in which aesthetics, location, design and engineering fused into free-standing monuments. [[Stonehenge]], the other well-known building from the Neolithic would later, 2600 and 2400 BC for the sarsen stones, and perhaps 3000 BC for the blue stones, be transformed into the form that we know so well. At its height Neolithic architecture marked geographic space; their durable monumentality embodied a past, perhaps made up of memories and remembrance.

In the Central Mediterranean, Malta also became home of a subterranean skeuomorphised form of architecture around 3600 BC. At the [[Ħal-Saflieni Hypogeum]], the inhabitants of Malta carved out an underground burial complex in which surface architectural elements were used to embellish a series of chambers and entrances. It is at the Neolithic Ħal-Saflieni Hypogeum that the earliest known skeuomorphism first occurred in the world. This architectural device served to define the aesthetics of the underworld in terms that well known in the larger megaliths. On Malta and Gozo, surface and subterranean architecture defined two worlds, which later, in the Greek world, would manifest themselves in the myth of [[Hades]] and the world of the living. In Malta, therefore, we encounter Neolithic architecture which is demonstrably not purely functional, but which was conceptual in design and purpose.

==Other structures==
Early Neolithic water wells from the [[Linear Pottery culture]] have been found in central Germany near [[Leipzig]]. These structures are built in timber with complicated [[woodworking joints]] at the edges and have been dated between 5,200 and 5,100 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0051374 Early Neolithic Water Wells Reveal the World's Oldest Wood Architecture] Tegel W, Elburg R, Hakelberg D, Stäuble H, Büntgen U (2012) Early Neolithic Water Wells Reveal the World's Oldest Wood Architecture. PLoS ONE 7(12): e51374. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051374&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest known engineered roadway, the [[Sweet Track]] in England, also dates from this time.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

An ''onnagata'' wearing a purple headscarf combs the hair of a ''wakashū-gata'' (identifiable by his forelocks and partially shaved head).]]

'''''Onnagata''''' or '''''oyama''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 女形・女方, "woman-role"), are male actors who played women's roles in Japanese [[Kabuki]] theatre.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Actors|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4346|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern all-male kabuki was originally known as ''yarō kabuki'' ("man kabuki") to distinguish it from earlier forms. In the early 17th century, shortly after the emergence of the genre, many kabuki theaters had an all-female cast (''onna kabuki''), with women playing men's roles as necessary. ''Wakashū kabuki'' ("adolescent-boy kabuki"), with a cast composed entirely of attractive young men playing both male and female roles, and frequently dealing in erotic themes, originated circa 1612.&lt;ref name="Leupp"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leupp|first=Gary P.|title=Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=0-520-20900-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=90}}

Both ''onnagata'' and ''[[wakashū]]'' (or ''wakashū-gata''), actors specializing in adolescent female roles (and usually adolescents themselves), were the subject of much appreciation by both male and female patrons, and were often prostitutes. All-male casts became the norm after 1629, when women were banned from appearing in kabuki due to the prevalent [[prostitution]] of actresses and violent quarrels among patrons for the actresses' favors.&lt;ref name="Leupp"/&gt;{{rp|pages=90–91}} This ban failed to stop the problems, however, since the young male (''wakashū'') actors were also fervently pursued by patrons{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}.

In 1642, ''onnagata'' roles were forbidden, resulting in plays that featured only male characters. These plays continued to have erotic content and generally featured many ''wakashū'' roles, often dealing in themes of ''[[LGBT in Japan#Ancient Japan|nanshoku]]'' (male homosexuality); officials responded by banning ''wakashū'' roles as well.&lt;ref name="Leupp"/&gt;{{rp|page=92}} The ban on ''onnagata'' was lifted in 1644, and on ''wakashū'' in 1652, on the condition that all actors, regardless of role, adopted the adult male hairstyle with shaved pate. ''Onnagata'' and ''wakashū'' actors soon began wearing a small purple headscarf (''murasaki bōshi'' or ''katsura'') to cover the shaved portion, which became iconic signifiers of their roles and eventually became invested with erotic significance as a result.&lt;ref name="Leupp"/&gt;{{rp|page=132}} After authorities rescinded a ban on wig-wearing by ''onnagata'' and ''wakashū'' actors, the ''murasaki bōshi'' was replaced by a wig and now survives in a few older plays and as a ceremonial accessory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leiter|first=Samuel L.|title=Historical dictionary of Japanese traditional theatre|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2006|pages=251|isbn=0-8108-5527-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After film was introduced in Japan at the end of the 19th century, the ''oyama'' continued to portray females in movies until the early 1920s. At that time, however, using real female actresses was coming into fashion with the introduction of realist ''[[shingeki]]'' films. The ''oyama'' staged a protest at [[Nikkatsu]] in 1922 in backlash against the lack of work because of this. Kabuki, however, remains all-male even today.&lt;ref&gt;Though there are all-female troupes, they represent a separate tradition, performing at separate theatres and for the most part not really playing a part in the 'core' kabuki world.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oyama'' continue to appear in Kabuki today, though the term ''onnagata'' has come to be used much more commonly.

Every Kabuki actor is expected to have facility with ''onnagata'' techniques; and while is it tempting for Western opinion to equate ''onnagata'' with mere cross-dressing, or female impersonation, no kabuki actor's training is complete without mastery of what constitutes the techniques the Kabuki ''onnagata.''  The phenomenon is best identified with the kanji, 女形, for there is no English equivalent.

==Notable Onnagata==
* [[Bandō Tamasaburō V]]
* [[Nakamura Utaemon VI]], 
* [[Yoshizawa Ayame]]
* [[Taichi Saotome]][[File:Actors in 1860.jpg|thumb|四代目中村芝翫 [Nakamura Shikan IV] as けいせいかほる [Beautiful Woman/Keise Ikahoru]; and  三代目 沢村田之助 [Sawamura Tanosuke III] as けいせいかほる [Beautiful Woman/Keise Ikahoru].  The print by 豊国画 [Toyokuni],1860, the year of Sawamura's debut under that name on the Kabuki stage.  Sawamura was, without question, one of the greatest 女形 of all time. Note here his blackened teeth, his お歯黒 [Ohaguro].  Sadly, he died prematurely in 1875, a triple amputee as a result of gangrene, leaving Japan sans a first-rate 女形 through 1900 and beyond (the efforts of Ichikawa Danjuro IX and Onoe Kikugoro V notwithstanding). Sawamura’s fashion sense set contemporaneous female taste, style which, to this day, pervades the Japanese psyche, especially evidenced in bridal wear.  Few appeared with him as 女形—but Nakamura Shikan IV, here, was noted for his versatility, both in masculine, heroic roles, and in 女形.]]

'''Jean Paul Gustave Ricœur''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ɪ|ˈ|k|ɜr}}; {{IPA-fr|ʁikœʁ|lang}}; 27 February 1913&amp;nbsp;– 20 May 2005) was a French [[Philosophy |philosopher]] best known for combining [[Phenomenology (philosophy) |phenomenological]] description with [[hermeneutics]]. As such, his thought is within the same tradition as other major hermeneutic phenomenologists, [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]. In 2000, he was awarded the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]] for having "revolutionized the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, expanding the study of textual interpretation to include the broad yet concrete domains of mythology, biblical exegesis, psychoanalysis, theory of [[metaphor]], and narrative theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul Ricœur |url=http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/k16_c_paul/prf_e.html |publisher=Inamori Foundation |accessdate=15 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523172410/http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/k16_c_paul/prf_e.html |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Paul Ricœur was born in 1913 in [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]], [[Drôme]], [[French Third Republic|France]], to Léon "Jules" Ricœur (23 December 1881 – 26 September 1915) and Florentine Favre (17 September 1878 – 3 October 1913),&lt;ref name="Enc"&gt;''Encyclopedia of World Biography: 20th century supplement'', Volume 13, J. Heraty, 1987: [http://biography.yourdictionary.com/paul-ricoeur "Paul Ricoeur"].&lt;/ref&gt; who were married on December 30, 1910 in Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://huguenots-france.org/france/celebrites/ricoeur/pag0.htm#19 Genealogy of the Ricœur family]&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a family of devout [[Huguenots]] (French [[Protestants]]), a religious minority in France.

Paul's father Jules, who served as a sergeant in the 75th Infantry Regiment of the French army during [[World War I]], went missing in Perthes-lès-Hurlus near the beginning of the [[Second Battle of Champagne]] (September 25&amp;nbsp;– November 6, 1915). On September 26, 1915, French military authorities declared that Jules had probably been killed in the battle. His body wasn't found until 1932, when a field was being ploughed, and the body was identified by its tags.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ricoeur - ''La critique et la conviction: entretien avec François Azouvi et Marc de Launay'' (Paris: Calmann-Lévy, 1995), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://craftinghistoryblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/on-an-impact-of-wwi/comment-page-1 "On an Impact of WWI"] - by Cherine Marie Veronique Munkholt (blog entry dated April 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers have stated that before World War I began, Paul's father (Léon "Jules" Ricœur) was a professor of English at the Lycée Emile Loubet in Valence. However, it was a different person — Jules Paul Ricœur (1887–1918) — who held that position.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Paul Ricoeur (April 28, 1887 - November 7, 1918) was a son of Paul Lucien Auguste Ricoeur (a.k.a. Paul Lucien Augustin Ricoeur) and Elisabeth "Mina" Elzer, who were married on December 4, 1886 in Poussay. Jules was born in Montbéliard, Doubs, and died from gas poisoning in World War I at Baccarat, Meurthe-en-Moselle. He was a Private in the 356th Infantry Regiment (2nd Class) of the French army. Before fighting in World War I he was a professor of English in the Lycée Emile Loubet in Valence. He had a brother named Louis Charles Adrien Ricoeur (October 1, 1889 – August 20, 1914) who was born in Épinal, Vosges. Louis was a Private in the 153rd Infantry Regiment of the French army. He was killed in WWI in 1914 at Morhange, Moselle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hgec2638.fr/lionel/apht/carnet_poilu/loubet/loubet.html "La Guerre et le lycée Loubet" (The War and Lycée Loubet)] - These are photos of commemorative plaques in the entrance hall of the Lycée Emile Loubet in Valence. The lycée started operating and enrolling students about 1904. The plaques list all the professors and students from the lycée who died in various wars (including WWI and WWII) in which France was involved. Scroll down the page to the chart which is titled "Ancien Professeurs" (Former Professors) in the upper left-hand corner of the chart. At the bottom of the chart, there is information on Jules Paul Ricœur (1887–1918), who was not the same person as Paul Ricœur's father Léon "Jules" Ricœur (1881–1915).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memorialgenweb.org/memorial3/html/fr/complementter.php?id=5162558 MémorialGenWeb - Ricoeur, Jules Paul (1887–1918)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memorialgenweb.org/mobile/fr/complementter.php?id=5077987&amp;largeur=1600&amp;hauteur=900 MémorialGenWeb - Ricoeur, Louis Charles Adrien (1889–1914)]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's father's death occurred when Paul was only two years old. Subsequently, Paul was raised in [[Rennes]], France by his paternal grandparents Louis Ricœur (1856–1932) and his wife Marie Sarradet (1856–1928), and by his father's sister Juliette "Adèle" Ricœur (December 20, 1892 - 1968),&lt;ref&gt;[https://huguenots-france.org/france/celebrites/ricoeur/pag1.htm#16 Genealogy of the Ricoeur and Sarradet families]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ricoeur - ''La critique et la conviction: entretien avec François Azouvi et Marc de Launay'' (Paris: Calmann-Lévy, 1995), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/29915352/Recognition_Reciprocity_and_Representation_Background_presentation_to_a_discussion_of_3_Ricoeur_texts "Recognition, Reciprocity and Representation: Background presentation to a discussion of 3 Ricoeur texts," p. 9 (dated Nov. 17, 2016) by Cherine Munkholt]&lt;/ref&gt; with a small [[stipend]] afforded to Paul as a war orphan. 

Paul, whose penchant for study was fueled by his family's Protestant emphasis on Bible study, was bookish and intellectually precocious. He discovered philosophy while attending the Lycée de Rennes (now {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Émile-Zola de Rennes|fr}}), where he studied under Roland Dalbiez (1893–1976), who was professor of philosophy at the lycée.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelino Agís Villaverde, ''Knowledge and Practical Reason: Paul Ricoeur's Way of Thinking'', LIT Verlag Münster, 2012, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Ricœur received his bachelor's degree in 1932 from the [[University of Rennes]]&lt;ref name="Enc"/&gt; and began studying philosophy, and especially phenomenology, at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1933–34, where he was influenced by [[Gabriel Marcel]].&lt;ref name="FL 417"&gt;Michaël Fœssel and Fabien Lamouche, ''Paul Ricœur. Anthologie'' (Paris, Éditions Points, 2007), p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 he completed a DES thesis (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) titled ''Problème de Dieu chez Lachelier et Lagneau'' (''The Problem of God in Lachelier and Lagneau''),&lt;ref name="FL 417"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 172"&gt;Alan D. Schrift (2006), ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers'', Blackwell Publishing, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; concerning some of the theological views of French philosophers Jules Lachelier (1832–1918) and Jules Lagneau (1851–1894). In 1935, Paul was awarded the second-highest [[agrégation]] mark in the nation for philosophy, presaging a bright future.

On August 14, 1935, in Rennes, Paul married Simone Lejas (October 23, 1911 – January 7, 1998),&lt;ref&gt;[https://huguenots-france.org/france/celebrites/ricoeur/pag0.htm#46 Genealogy of the Ricoeur and Lejas families]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reveil-fm.com/index.php/reveil-fm.com2013/03/28/3366-paul-ricoeur-un-philosophe-protestant "Paul Ricoeur, un philosophe protestant"]&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had five children: Jean-Paul (born January 15, 1937), Marc (born February 22, 1938), Noëlle (born November 30, 1940), Olivier (July 10, 1947 – March 22, 1986), and Etienne (born 1953).&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Reagan, ''Paul Ricoeur: His Life and His Work'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), pages 6, 8, 15, and 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enc"/&gt; In 1936–37, he fulfilled his military service.&lt;ref name="FL 417"/&gt;

[[World War II]] interrupted Ricœur's career, and he was drafted to serve in the French army in 1939. His unit was captured during the [[German invasion of France in 1940]] and he spent the next five years as a prisoner of war in [[Oflag II-D]].&lt;ref name="FL 417"/&gt; His detention camp was filled with other intellectuals such as [[Mikel Dufrenne]], who organized readings and classes sufficiently rigorous that the camp was accredited as a degree-granting institution by the [[Vichy government]]. During that time he read [[Karl Jaspers]], who was to have a great influence on him. He also began a translation of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s ''Ideas I''.

Ricœur taught at the [[University of Strasbourg]] between 1948 and 1956, the only French university with a Protestant faculty of [[theology]]. In 1950, he received his [[State doctorate]], submitting (as is customary in France) two theses: a "minor" thesis translating Husserl's ''Ideas I'' into French for the first time, with commentary, and a "major" thesis that he published the same year as ''Philosophie de la Volonté I: Le Volontaire et l'Involontaire'' (''Philosophy of the Will I: The Voluntary and the Involuntary'').&lt;ref&gt;A second volume under the title ''Philosophie de la Volonté II: L'homme faillible et La symbolique du mal'' (''Philosophy of the Will II: Fallible Man and The Symbolism of Evil'') appeared in 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Ricœur soon acquired a reputation as an expert on phenomenology, then the ascendent philosophy in France.

In 1956, Ricœur took up a position at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] as the Chair of General Philosophy. This appointment signaled Ricœur's emergence as one of France's most prominent philosophers. While at the Sorbonne, he wrote three works that cemented his reputation: ''Fallible Man'' and ''The Symbolism of Evil'' published in 1960, and ''[[Freud and Philosophy|Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation]]'' published in 1965. [[Jacques Derrida]] was an assistant to Ricœur during that time (early 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Bennington]] (1991), ''Jacques Derrida'', University of Chicago Press, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965 to 1970, Ricœur was an administrator at the newly founded [[University of Nanterre]] in suburban Paris.&lt;ref&gt;During that time, Ricœur was [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]' long-distance doctoral advisor (Dosse 2014, p. 264).&lt;/ref&gt; Nanterre was intended as an experiment in [[progressive education]], and Ricœur hoped that he could create a university in accordance with his vision, free of the stifling atmosphere of the tradition-bound Sorbonne and its overcrowded classes. Nevertheless, Nanterre became a hotbed of protest during the student uprisings of [[May 1968 in France]]. Ricœur was derided as an "old clown" (''vieux clown'') and tool of the French government.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan 1996, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disenchanted with French academic life, Ricœur taught briefly at the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] in Belgium, before taking a position at the [[Divinity School of the University of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;Dosse 1997, p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; where he taught from 1970 to 1985. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter R| url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences| accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study culminated in ''The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-Disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language'' published in 1975 and the three-volume ''Time and Narrative'' published in 1983, 1984, 1985 Ricœur gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] in 1985/86, published in 1990 as ''Oneself as Another''. This work built on his discussion of narrative identity and his continuing interest in the self.

''Time and Narrative'' secured Ricœur's return to France in 1985 as a notable intellectual. His late work was characterised by a continuing cross-cutting of national intellectual traditions; for example, some of his latest writing engaged the thought of the American political philosopher [[John Rawls]].

In 1995 he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]].

In 1999, he was awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] for Philosophy, the citation being "[f]or his capacity in bringing together all the most important themes and indications of 20th-century philosophy, and re-elaborating them into an original synthesis which turns language – in particular, that which is poetic and metaphoric – into a chosen place revealing a reality that we cannot manipulate, but interpret in diverse ways, and yet all coherent. Through the use of metaphor, language draws upon that truth which makes of us that what we are, deep in the profundity of our own essence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balzan.org/en/prizewinners/paul-ricoeur Balzan.org]&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he and his co-author André LaCocque (professor emeritus of Hebrew Bible at Chicago Theological Seminary) were awarded the [[Gordon J. Laing Award]] by the University of Chicago's Board of University Publications for their book ''Thinking Biblically: Exegetical and Hermeneutical Studies''.

On 29 November 2004, he was awarded with the second [[Kluge Prize|John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Human Sciences]] (shared with [[Jaroslav Pelikan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-04-200/|title=Library of Congress Announces Winners of John W.

Ricœur died on 20 May 2005 at his home in [[Châtenay-Malabry]], France, of natural causes.&lt;ref name="uchicago_pressrelease"&gt;University of Chicago News Office, [http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/05/050523.ricoeur.shtml University of Chicago philosopher Paul Ricoeur, 1913-2005]&lt;/ref&gt; French Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] declared that "the humanist European tradition is in mourning for one of its most talented exponents".

Paul Ricœur was buried in the Châtenay-Malabry New Cemetery, Châtenay-Malabry, Department des Hauts-de-Seine, Île-de-France, France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=11072366 Find A Grave - Paul Ricoeur (1913-2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==

===Hermeneutic phenomenology&lt;!--'School of suspicion' and 'Masters of suspicion' redirect here--&gt;===
One of Ricœur's major contributions to the field of hermeneutics was the entwining of hermeneutical processes with phenomenology. In this union, Ricœur applies the hermeneutical task to more than just textual analysis, but also to how each self relates to anything that is outside of the self. For Ricœur, hermeneutics is understanding the link between the self and the symbol—neither things in themselves, but the dialectical engagement between the two. Moreover, Ricœur, on the goal of hermeneutics, puts emphasis upon self-understanding as the outcome of the hermeneutical process: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In proposing to relate symbolic language to self-understanding, I think I fulfill the deepest wish of hermeneutics. The purpose of all interpretation is to conquer a remoteness, a distance between the past cultural epoch to which the text belongs and the interpreter himself. By overcoming this distance, by making himself contemporary with the text, the exegete can appropriate its meaning to himself: foreign, he makes it familiar, that is, he makes it his own. It is thus the growth of his own understanding of himself that he pursues through his understanding of others. Every hermeneutics is thus, explicitly or implicitly, self-understanding by means of understanding others."&lt;ref name="PPR"&gt;Ricœur, Paul, Charles E. Reagan, and David Stewart. "Existence and Hermeneutics." In ''The Philosophy of Paul Ricœur: An Anthology of His Work''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1978, pp. 101 and 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ricoeur maintains that the hermeneutical task is a coming together of the self and an other, in a meaningful way. This explication of self-meaning and other-meaning is principally bound up and manifested in existence itself. Thus, Ricoeur depicts philosophy as a hermeneutical activity seeking to uncover the meaning of existence through the interpretation of phenomena (which can only emerge as) embedded in the world of culture: &lt;blockquote&gt;"This is why philosophy remains a hermeneutics, that is, a reading of the hidden meaning inside the text of the apparent meaning. It is the task of this hermeneutics to show that existence arrives at expression, at meaning, and at reflection only through the continual exegesis of all the significations that come to light in the world of culture. Existence becomes a self – human and adult – only by appropriating this meaning, which first resides "outside," in works, institutions, and cultural movements in which the life of the spirit is justified."&lt;ref name="PPR" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, the process of hermeneutics, and extracting meaning, is a reflective task. The emphasis is not on the external meaning, but the meaning or insight of the self which is gained through encountering the external text—or other. The self-knowledge gained through the hermeneutical process is, thus, indirectly attained. This is in opposition to the [[Cartesian cogito]], "which grasps itself directly in the experience of doubt," and is "a truth as vain as it is invincible."&lt;ref name="PPR" /&gt; In point of fact, the difference Ricœur aims to distinguish is the means by which the self is discovered, which for him is only by means of interpreting the signified.

According to Ricœur, the aim of hermeneutics is to recover and to restore the meaning. The French philosopher chooses the model of the phenomenology of religion, in relation to psychoanalysis, stressing that it is characterized by a concern on the object. This object is the sacred, which is seen in relation to the profane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliade, Mircea]] (1987), ''The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion'', translated by Willard R. Trask. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ricœur's hermeneutical work ''Freud and Philosophy'' contains the famous assertion that [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] are masters of the [[school of suspicion]]&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricœur65p32"&gt;Paul Ricœur (1965), ''Freud and philosophy: an essay on interpretation'', Book I ''Problematic, section 2: ''The conflict of interpretations'', title: ''Interpretation as exercise of suspicion'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waite96"&gt;Waite, Geoff (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=otlcb3jYifkC ''Nietzsche's Corpse''], Duke University Press, 1996, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; (''maîtres du soupçon''/''école du soupçon''). Marx is reductionist, because he reduces society to economy, particularly to means of production; Nietzsche is a reductionist, because he reduces man to an arbitrary concept of [[Übermensch|superman]]; Freud is a reductionist because he reduces human nature to sexual instinct.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2002), ''Introducere în hermeneutică'' (''Introduction to Hermeneutics''), Brașov: Orientul latin, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''post-industrial economy''' refers to a period of growth within an [[industrialized]] [[economy]] or nation in which the relative importance of [[manufacturing]] reduces and that of services, information, and research grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krahn|first1=Harvey J.|last2=Lowe|first2=Graham S.|last3=Hughes|first3=Karen D.|title=Work, Industry, and Canadian Society|date=2008|publisher=Nelson Education|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=9780176501136|pages=26–27|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such economies are often marked by: 
* A declining manufacturing sector, resulting in [[de-industrialization]].
* A large [[service sector]].
* An increase in the amount of [[information technology]], often leading to an "[[information age]]". [[Information]], [[knowledge]], and [[creativity]] are the new [[raw material]]s of such an economy.

The industry aspect of a post-industrial economy is sent into less developed nations which manufacture what is needed at lower costs (''see'' [[outsourcing]]). This occurrence is typical of nations that industrialized in the past such as the [[United Kingdom]] (first industrialised nation), most of Western Europe and the [[United States]].

According to Galvan (2004), "The oral historical record, written accounts by early Arab and European explorers, and physical anthropological evidence suggest that the various Serer peoples migrated south from the Fuuta Tooro region (Senegal River valley) beginning around the eleventh century, when Islam first came across the Sahara."&lt;ref name="Galvan"&gt;Galvan, Dennis Charles, ''The State Must Be Our Master of Fire: How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal'' Berkeley, University of California Press, 2004 p.51&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.51}} Over generations these people, possibly [[Pulaar]] speaking herders originally, migrated through Wolof areas and entered the Siin and Saluum river valleys. This lengthy period of Wolof-Serer contact has left us unsure of the origins of shared "terminology, institutions, political structures, and practices."&lt;ref name="Galvan"/&gt;{{rp|p.52}}

Professor Étienne Van de Walle gave a slightly later date, writing that "The formation of the Sereer ethnicity goes back to the thirteenth century, when a group came from the Senegal River valley in the north fleeing Islam, and near Niakhar met another group of Mandinka origin, called the Gelwar, who were coming from the southeast (Gravrand 1983). The actual Sereer ethnic group is a mixture of the two groups, and this may explain their complex bilinear kinship system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van de Walle|first=Étienne|title=African Households: Censuses And Surveys|year=2006|publisher=M.E.

After the [[Arab invasion]] of North Africa, the [[Berbers]] of the north advanced Islam via the [[Almoravid]] movement, penetrating parts of Africa, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;{{Cite book|work=Muslim Societies in African History (New Approaches to African History)|author=David Robinson|title=Muslim Societies in African History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lombard, Maurice, ''The golden age of Islam'' p 84.

The [[jihad]]s that had affected [[Tekrur]] in the 11th century which led to the Serers of Tekrur [[wikt:exodus|exodus]] only affected  those Serers living in Tekrur at the time. It did not apply to all Serer people.

==In Senegambia, southward migration==
In the [[Senegambia|Senegambia region]], the Serer people were ruled by [[Lamane]]s. The Serer who have migrated from [[Tekrur]] to join their distant Serer relatives created a southward migration for Mandinka migrants.  [[Godfrey Mwakikagile]] proposed that the [[Mandinka people|Mandinkas]] were either defeated in battle or incorporated into Serer society.&lt;ref&gt;Mwakikagile, Godfrey, ''"Ethnic Diversity and Integration in the Gambia"'', p225&lt;/ref&gt; The Serers ruled over the Wolof kingdom of [[Kingdom of Jolof|Jolof]].  They were ruling Jolof before the ''Jaw'', ''Ngom'', ''Mengue'' (or ''Mbengue'') and ''Njie'' dynasties (who were all Serers with the exeception of the ''Mengue'' dynasty who were [[Lebou people|Lebou]]&amp;nbsp;– ''Mengue'' or ''Mbengue'' is a Lebou surname).&lt;ref&gt;Mwakikagile, Godfrey, ''"Ethnic Diversity and Integration in the Gambia"'', p 224&lt;/ref&gt; However, these Serer and Lebou rulers of Jolof (predominantly a Wolof area) became assimilated into Wolof culture.

==Migration from Kabuu to Sine==
The actual foundation of the Kingdom of Sine is unclear, but in the late 14th century [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] migrants entered the area. They were led by a matrilineal clan known as the Gelwaar. Here they encountered the Serer, who had already established a system of lamanic authorities, and established a Gelwaar led state with its capital in or near a Serer lamanic estate centred at [[Mbissel]].&lt;ref name="Galvan"/&gt;{{rp|p.54}}&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Martin A.

Marriages between the Serer paternal clans such as [[Faye (surname)|Faye]] and [[Joof family|Joof]] to the Guelwar women created the Serer paternal dynasties and a Guelowar maternal dynasty. According to Serer oral tradition a king named [[Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh]] (many variations in spelling: ''Maissa Wali'', ''Maissa Wally'' also known as ''Maysa Wali Jon'' or ''Maysa Wali Dione'')&amp;nbsp;– (reigned 1350)&lt;ref&gt;For Maysa Wali's reign, see : Sarr, Alioune, ''"Histoire du Sine-Saloum"'' (Sénégal), (introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker), in Bulletin de l'IFAN, tome 46, série B, nos 3–4, 1986–1987. p 19.  See also : {{fr}} Éthiopiques, Volume 2, pp 100–101, Grande imprimerie africaine (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; was the first Guelowar king of Sine.

Njaajan Njie was the founder of the first Wolof kingdom and claimed by the Wolof as their ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;Anyidoho, Kofi, ''"Cross rhythms"'', Volume 1, ''"Occasional papers in African folklore"'', p 118, Trickster Press (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Donnelly Fage]] suggests although dates in the early 13th century (and others say 12th century) are usually ascribed to this king and the founding of the empire, a more likely scenario is "that the rise of the empire was associated with the growth of Wolof power at the expense of the ancient Sudanese state of Takrur, and that this was essentially a fourteenth-century development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fage|first=John Donnelly|title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-20981-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qwg8GV6aibkC&amp;lpg=PA484&amp;dq=Takrur%7CTekrur%20serer&amp;pg=PA483#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Developments%20before%20the%20arrival%20of%20Europeans%22&amp;f=false|editor=Roland Oliver|chapter=Upper and Lower Guinea|page=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune also known as ''The Battle of Somb'' was a [[religious war]] (but also partly motivated by conquest&amp;nbsp;– [[empire building]]) between the [[Muslim]] [[Marabout]] movement of Senegambia and the [[Serer people]] of Sine.&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune, ''"Histoire du Sine-Saloum"'', Introduction, bibliographie et Notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3-4, 1986–1987. pp 37-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Niokhobaye.

(pp 727–729, pp 16–18)&lt;/ref&gt;  On 18 July 1867, the leader of the Marabouts [[Maba Diakhou Bâ]]  launched a [[jihad]] in the Serer [[Kingdom of Sine]] but was defeated and killed by the forces of [[Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof]], King of Sine.&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune, ''"Histoire du Sine-Saloum "'' (Sénégal) Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker. 1986-87, pp 37-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, pp 90-91 &amp; 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Niokhobaye, pp 728–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Maba Diakhou, a rather charismatic leader in the Marabout sect saw the propagation of Islam in Senegambia and an Islamic empire as his divine mission.&lt;ref name="Mark R p128"&gt;Lipschutz, Mark R., &amp; Rasmussen, R.

==The effects of Islam==

Although by the end of the twentieth century most Serer had converted to Islam(about 85% by the 1990s),&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=James Stuart|authorlink1=James S.

This division is not just religious but also has an ethnic dimension. As opponents of Islam for nearly a [[millennia]], anti-Serer sentiments are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Thiaw, Issa Laye, ''"La Religiosité des Sereer, Avant et Pendant Leur Islamisation"'', Éthiopiques, No: 54, Revue Semestrielle de Culture Négro-Africaine, Nouvelle Série, Volume 7, 2e Semestre 1991&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Serer countries, especially the [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]] area of Senegal, is reported to be a true bastion of the [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]].&lt;ref name="Thiam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galvan, ''"The state must be our master of fire:"'', pp 41, 44, 65, 260 &amp; 305&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Serer people}}
At present, the Serer population is estimated to be over 1.8 million  based on population figures for [[Senegal]], [[Gambia]] and [[Mauritania]] (2011)&amp;nbsp;– excluding the Serers living in [[Western world|the West]] and elsewhere. They are more numerous in Senegal than in Gambia and Mauritania. Though traditionally mixed-farmers, boat builders and land owners, the Serers are found in all major professions including politics, medicine, literature, commerce, law, agriculture, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchet, Gilles  ''"Élites et changements en Afrique et au Sénégal"'', ORSTOM (1983) pp 182–185&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyculture]] and boat building is still practiced by some Serers. Due to their [[Lamane|Lamanic]] land [[inheritance]] system, they tend to have valuable land. Recently however, President [[Abdoulaye Wade]]'s [[land reform]] law has affected many Serer farming communities in Senegal and they've lost their properties.&lt;ref&gt;Ubink, Janine M, Hoekema, André J, Assies, Willem J, ''"Legalising Land Rights: Local Practices, State Responses and Tenure Security in Africa, Asia and Latin America"'', pp 259–287, Amsterdam University Press, 2010. {{ISBN|90-8728-056-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Srpski Rjecnik Cover.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Front cover of ''Srpski rječnik'', first edition.]]
'''''Srpski rječnik''''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Српски рјечник}}, {{IPA-sh|sr̩̂pskiː rjê̞ːtʃniːk|pron}}, '''''The Serbian Dictionary'''''; full name: Српски рјечник истолкован њемачким и латинским ријечма, "The Serbian Dictionary, paralleled with German and Latin words") is a [[dictionary]] written by [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], first published in 1818. It is the first known dictionary of the [[vernacular]] [[Serbian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic {{!}} Serbian language scholar|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vuk-Stefanovic-Karadzic|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Karadžić began collecting words of the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[vernacular]] in 1815, as suggested by Slovene linguist [[Jernej Kopitar]]. While working in [[court of law|court]] during his time in [[Serbia]],{{when|date=September 2016}} he had a habit of "writing down an interesting word or two". The first published edition of the dictionary came out in 1818, and contained 26.270 words which Karadžić had heard in the common speech. His source could also have been the [[Avramović Dictionary]]. Karadžić's dictionary itself was one of the most important steps in his struggle for the Serbian language and [[grammar]] because it stated that the pure vernacular should provide the basis for a main [[literary language]]. Also reviewed in the dictionary were [[Sound change|phonetic changes]], later being a part of the ''Grammar of the Serbian language'', which was later merged with the dictionary and translated by [[Jacob Grimm]] into [[German language|German]] in 1824, while the dictionary itself was translated into [[Latin]] and German by Jernej Kopitar.
 [[File:Вуков Српски рјечник са Вуковим белешкама.jpg|thumb|left|Original with Vuk's notes.]]
While being officially completed in 1816, the dictionary could not yet be published for a number of reasons, mainly due to the lack of resources and therefore means to print the dictionaries. While at the time there were no printing presses present in Serbia, printing such a work in Austria required the permission of [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Stefan Stratimirović]], who saw Karadžić's work in [[orthography]] as a threat to the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and its habits of educating [[Serbs]] with the so-called [[Slavonic-Serbian]] language, an adaptation of the [[Church Slavonic]] language.

Karadžić had also implemented the use of new, reformed letters within the dictionary. These included [[Ј]], [[Љ]], [[Њ]], [[Ђ]], [[Ћ]] and [[Џ]]. Words including the letter [[Х]], which Karadžić insisted to be used with foreign words only, did not appear in the first edition of the dictionary. However, Karadžić was later persuaded by [[Lukijan Mušicki]] and [[Pavle Solarić]] that the letter be used in some words, however "Х" was never attributed in the dictionary as a starting letter, and no words beginning with "Х" were included.

== Criticism ==
The dictionary was sharply criticized and attacked by opponents of the language reform, a strong motive for this being the large amount of [[swear words]] present in the dictionary, which were included partly due to [[Jernej Kopitar|Kopitar]]'s and [[Jacob Grimm|Grimm]]'s persuasions. Jacob Grimm showed a distinct interest in [[profanity]] within the Serbian language and in his correspondence with Karadžić he requested their equivalent in German. Attacks held against the dictionary did not cease even after 1847, which was considered to be the year of victory for Karadžić's reforms. Some linguists have found that Karadžić has plagiarized some older Croatian dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/264345.Filologija_53_2009_001_053_Grcevic.pdf 264345.Filologija_53_2009_001_053_Grcevic.pdf], Jernej Kopitar kao strateg Karadžićeve književnojezične reforme&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teodoro Andal Agoncillo''' (November 9, 1912 – January 14, 1985) was a prominent 20th-century [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[historian]]. He and his contemporary [[Renato Constantino]] were among the first Filipino historians renowned for promoting a distinctly nationalist point of view of Filipino history ([[nationalist historiography]]). He was also an [[essayist]] and a [[poet]].

Agoncillo is related to [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Felipe Agoncillo]], the Filipino diplomat who represented the Philippines in the negotiations that led to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], and Dona [[Marcela Agoncillo]], one of the principal seamstress of the Philippine flag.

==Early life==
Born in [[Lemery, Batangas]] to Pedro Agoncillo and Feliza Andal, both from landed families in Batangas, Agoncillo obtained a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the [[University of the Philippines Manila|University of the Philippines]] in [[Manila]], in 1934, and a master's degree in the arts from the same university the following year. He earned his living as a linguistic assistant at the Institute of National Language and as an instructor at the [[Far Eastern University]] and the [[Manuel L. Quezon University]]. In 1956, he published his seminal work, ''Revolt of the Masses: The Story of Bonifacio and the Katipunan'', a history of the 1896 [[Katipunan]]-led revolt against Spanish rule and its leader, [[Andres Bonifacio]]. He garnered acclaim for this book, as well as criticisms from more conservative historians discomfited by the work's nationalist bent.

In 1958, Agoncillo was invited to join the faculty of the Department of History of his ''alma mater'', the University of the Philippines. He remained with the university until his retirement in 1977, chairing the Department of History from 1963 to 1969. After retiring from UP, Agoncillo taught Filipino history as a visiting professor at the [[International Christian University]] in [[Mitaka, Tokyo]], Japan, for one year from 1977 to 1978. Philippine President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] named Agoncillo as a member of the [[National Historical Institute (Philippines)|National Historical Institute]] in 1963. He served in this capacity until his death in 1985. Agoncillo was chair of the History Department in the University of the Philippines at the same time period that his cousin, General Abelardo Andal, served as Commander (Chair) of the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps (Philippines)|Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] of the same university.

==Accolades==
He was named [[National Scientist of the Philippines]] in 1985 for his distinguished contributions in the field of history. Agoncillo was also among the few academics who held the rank of University Professor, an academic rank given to outstanding faculty members with specialization in more than one of the traditional academic domains (Science &amp; Technology; Social Sciences; and Arts &amp; Humanities), at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]].

==Controversy==
Despite Agoncillo's controversial tone and for his perceived leftist bent, his book, ''History of the Filipino People'', first published in 1960, remains a popular standard textbook in many Filipino universities, as are many of Agoncillo's other works. [[Gregorio Zaide]], Teodoro Agoncillo, Reynaldo Ileto and [[Renato Constantino]] stand as the most prominent 20th-century Filipino historians to emerge during the post-war period. However, opponents of Agoncillo contend that Agoncillo's works suffer from uneven scholarship throughout, especially with his use (or especially, non-use) of reliable historical sources, even when his opponents could not offer solid rebuttals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

'''''The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines''''' is a book that [[economist]] [[William Stanley Jevons]] wrote in 1865 to explore the implications of Britain's reliance on [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |author-link=William Stanley Jevons|year=1865 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines    |edition=1 |publisher= Macmillan &amp; Co |publication-date=1865 |publication-place=London &amp; Cambridge |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAAKAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AAAotKDT6KKcC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 November 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |author-link=William Stanley Jevons|year=1866 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines    |edition=2 |publisher= Macmillan &amp; Co |publication-date=1866 |publication-place=London |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQdZAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AAAotKDT6KKcC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 November 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; Given that coal was a finite, non-renewable energy resource, Jevons raised the question of [[sustainability]]. "Are we [[wikt:wise|wise]]," he asked rhetorically, "in allowing the commerce of this country to rise beyond the point at which we can long maintain it?" His central thesis was that the supremacy of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] over global affairs was transitory, given the finite nature of its primary energy resource. In propounding this thesis, Jevons covered a range of issues central to sustainability, including [[limits to growth]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], overshoot,&lt;ref name="overshoot"&gt;{{cite book |last=Catton |first=William |authorlink=William R. Catton, Jr. |title=Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change |date=1982-06-01 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |isbn=978-0-252-00988-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; energy return on energy input ([[EROEI]]), taxation of energy resources, [[renewable energy]] alternatives, and resource peaking{{emdash}}a subject widely discussed today under the rubric of [[peak oil]].

==The significance of coal==
Jevons introduces the first chapter of ''The Coal Question'' with a succinct description of coal's wonders and of society's insatiable appetite for it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Coal in truth stands not beside but entirely above all other [[commodities]]. It is the material energy of the country — the universal aid — the factor in everything we do. With coal almost any feat is possible or easy; without it we are thrown back into the laborious poverty of early times. With such facts familiarly before us, it can be no matter of surprise that year by year we make larger draughts upon a material of such myriad qualities — of such miraculous powers."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...new applications of coal are of an unlimited character. In the command of force, molecular and mechanical, we have the key to all the infinite varieties of change in place or kind of which nature is capable. No chemical or mechanical operation, perhaps, is quite impossible to us, and invention consists in discovering those which are useful and commercially practicable...."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jevons further argues that coal is the source of the UK's prosperity and global dominance.

==Limits to growth and resource peaking==
[[File:Jevons-exponential growth.jpg|left|thumb|Jevons' graph extrapolating to 1970 the exponential growth of coal production.]]
Because coal was not unlimited, because its access became more difficult with time, and because the demand [[Exponential growth|grew exponentially]], Jevons argued that limits or boundaries to prosperity would appear sooner than was generally realized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I must point out the painful fact that such a rate of growth will before long render our consumption of coal comparable with the total supply. In the increasing depth and difficulty of coal mining we shall meet that vague, but inevitable boundary that will stop our progress."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Jevons' day, British geologists were estimating that the country had [[coal reserves]] of 90 billion tons. Jevons believed that extraction of much of this amount would prove to be uneconomical. But, even if the entire quantity could be extracted, Jevons argued, exponential economic growth could not continue unabated.

Using historical production estimates, Jevons showed that for the previous 80 years production had grown at a relatively consistent rate of 3.5% per year, or 41% per decade. If this growth rate were to continue, production would grow from approximately 100 million tons in 1865 to more than 2.6 billion tons in 100 years. Jevons then calculated that, in that case, the country would produce approximately 100 billion tons within that period.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{110} 82.17 (1.035)^t\, dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In short, resources were not sufficient for even 100 years, and long before the 100 years point, the growth rate, which was the measure of prosperity, would have to decline. At some point, production would simply hit a peak, which itself meant dire consequences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Suppose our progress to be checked within half a century, yet by that time our consumption will probably be three or four times what it now is; there is nothing impossible or improbable in this; it is a moderate supposition, considering that our consumption has increased eight-fold in the last sixty years. But how shortened and darkened will the prospects of the country appear, with mines already deep, fuel dear, and yet a high rate of consumption to keep up if we are not to retrograde."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even before the peak was reached, high extraction costs could cause the UK to lose the [[competitive advantage]] it currently enjoyed in manufacturing and shipping.

British coal production did in fact peak in 1913, but at 292 million tons, about half the amount Jevons' extrapolation suggested. Just under a third of this was exported. Since then, production has dropped to less than 20 million tons.&lt;ref name="uk2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file36183.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100304140252/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file36183.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-03-04 |title=Energy Trends and Quarterly Energy Prices |date=December 2006 |publisher=UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Current UK resources are estimated at about 400 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coal.gov.uk/media//286DC/CA-AnnualReport-0607.pdf 2007 Annual Report of the UK Coal Authority.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population and the "Malthus Doctrine"==
According to Jevons, [[coal depletion]] had serious ramifications for population growth. The population of the UK had increased by more than 10% each decade for the prior 70 years, not surprising given that coal production was growing at 40% per decade, meaning that the ''per capita'' wealth was growing.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For the present our cheap supplies of coal, and our skill in its employment, and the freedom of our commerce with other wide lands, render us independent of the limited agricultural area of these islands, and take us out of the scope of Malthus' doctrine. We are growing rich and numerous upon a source of wealth of which the fertility does not yet apparently decrease with our demands upon it. Hence the uniform and extraordinary rate of growth which this country presents. We are like settlers spreading in a rich new country of which the boundaries are yet unknown and unfelt."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as the growth in coal production slowed, the population growth might easily surpass the production growth, leading to a drop in living conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Now population, when it grows, moves with a certain uniform impetus, like a body in motion; and uniform progress of population, as I have fully explained before, is multiplication in a uniform ratio. But long-continued progress in such a manner is altogether impossible — it must outstrip all physical conditions and bounds; and the longer it continues, the more severely must the ultimate check be felt. I do not hesitate to say, therefore, that the rapid growth of our great towns, gratifying as it is in the present, is a matter of very serious concern as regards the future."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to [[Malthus]]'s view that resource growth was linear, Jevons took resource growth as being exponential, like population. This modification of Malthus's theory did not alter the conclusion that unrestrained population growth would inevitably surpass the nation's ability to expand its resources. Prosperity, in terms of ''per capita'' consumption, would therefore fall. Moreover, because the primary resource was non-renewable, the fall would be more dramatic than Malthus envisioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A farm, however far pushed, will under proper cultivation continue to yield forever a constant crop. But in a mine there is no reproduction, and the produce once pushed to the utmost will soon begin to fail and sink towards zero. So far then as our wealth and progress depend upon the superior command of coal we must not only stop—we must go back.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Jevons Paradox==
{{main article|Jevons paradox}}

Given that energy depletion posed long-term dangers for society, Jevons analyzed possible mitigation measures. In so doing, he considered the phenomenon that has come to be known as [[Jevons paradox]]. As he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
" It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jevons described the historical development of engine technology and argued that the great increase in the UK's consumption of coal was due to the efficiency (or "economy") brought about by technological innovations, with particular credit going to [[James Watt]]'s 1776 invention of the [[steam engine]]. Like many innovations that followed, such as improved methods for smelting iron, greater economy broadened usage and led to increased energy consumption.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Whatever, therefore, conduces to increase the efficiency of coal, and to diminish the cost of its use, directly tends to augment the value of the steam-engine, and to enlarge the field of its operations."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jevons also considered and rejected other measures that might reduce consumption, such as coal taxes and export restrictions. Similarly, although he deplored the wasteful practice of burning away low quality coal at the mine site, he did not support conservation legislation.

An alternative that he did consider practical was tightened government fiscal policy, based on using tax revenue to reduce the national debt. Tightened fiscal policy would have the effect of slowing economic growth, thereby slowing coal consumption, at least until the debt was erased. Still, Jevons admitted that the overall impact of such a measure, even if it were implemented, would be minimal. In short, the prospect that society would voluntarily reduce consumption was dim.

==Energy alternatives==
Jevons considered the feasibility of alternative energy sources, foreshadowing modern debates on the subject. Regarding wind and tidal forces, he explained that such sources of intermittent power could be made more useful if the energy were stored, for example by pumping water to a height for subsequent use as hydro power. He reviewed biomass, namely timber, and commented that forests covering all of the UK could not supply energy equal to the current coal production. He also mentioned possibilities for geothermal and solar power, pointing out that if these sources did become useful, the UK would lose its competitive advantages in global industry. He was not aware of the future importance of [[natural gas]] or [[petroleum]] as prime energy sources since they were developed after his book was published.

Regarding electricity, which he pointed out was not an energy source but a means of energy distribution, Jevons noted that hydroelectric power was feasible but that reservoirs would face the problem of silt build-up. He discounted hydrogen generation as a means of electricity storage and distribution, calculating that the energy density of hydrogen would never make it practical. He predicted that steam would remain the most efficient means of generating electricity.

==Social responsibility in time of prosperity==
Jevons held that despite the desirability of reducing coal consumption, the outlook for implementing significant constraints was dim. Still, the UK's prosperity should at least be seen as imposing responsibilities on the current generation. In particular, Jevons proposed applying the current wealth to righting social ills and to creating a more just society:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We must begin to allow that we can do today what we cannot so well do tomorrow....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Reflection will show that we ought not to think of interfering with the free use of the material wealth which Providence has placed at our disposal, but that our duties wholly consist in the earnest and wise application of it. We may spend it on the one hand in increased luxury and ostentation and corruption, and we shall be blamed. We may spend it on the other hand in raising the social and moral condition of the people, and in reducing the burdens of future generations. Even if our successors be less happily placed than ourselves they will not then blame us."&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, W. Stanley, The Coal Question, 2nd revised edition, 1866, Macmillan and Co., page xxv&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jevons also articulated several social ills that particularly concerned him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The ignorance, improvidence, and brutish drunkenness of our lower working classes must be dispelled by a general system of education, which may effect for a future generation what is hopeless for the present generation. One preparatory and indispensable measure, however, is a far more general restriction on the employment of children in manufacture. At present it may almost be said to be profitable to breed little slaves and put them to labour early, so as to get earnings out of them before they have a will of their own. A worse premium upon improvidence and future wretchedness could not be imagined."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Global developments after Jevons==
As Jevons predicted, coal production could not grow exponentially forever. UK production peaked in 1913, and the country lost its global superiority to a new giant of energy production, the United States, a turn of events that was also predicted by Jevons. The UK had by then developed [[oil]] resources in the [[Middle East]] and increasingly used the fuel for power generation.

Although UK production could not continue to grow at the annual rate of 3.5%, the world's fossil fuel consumption did grow at this rate until about 1970. According to Jevons, UK coal production in 1865 was estimated as being equal to production in the rest of the world, giving a rough world estimate of 200 million tons. According to the [[US Department of Energy]], global [[fossil fuel]] consumption in 1970 was 200 Quad [[BTU]], or 7.2 billion tons coal equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/aer/txt/ptb1101.html World Primary Energy Production by Source, 1970-2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, consumption grew by a factor of 36, representing average annual exponential growth over 105 years of about 3.4%.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[105]{36}-1=3.4\%&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 34 subsequent years, to 2004, consumption grew by a factor of 2.1, or 2.2% per year, an indication, according to organizations such as [[Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas|ASPO]] that global energy resources are thinning.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[34]{2.1}-1=2.2\%&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity of the world's remaining energy resources is a matter of dispute and serious concern. Between 2005 and 2007, despite the trebling of oil prices, oil production remained relatively flat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t14.xls December 2007 International Petroleum Monthly] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713064318/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t14.xls |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a sign according to many that oil production has peaked.&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.simmonsco-intl.com/files/AnotherNailintheCoffin.pdf{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Dave Rutledge of the [[California Institute of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutledge.caltech.edu/|title=Dave Rutledge website|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Energy Watch Group of Germany&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071024021553/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/Reports.24+M5d637b1e38d.0.html Energy Watch Group Reports]&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that global coal production will also peak within the current generation, perhaps as soon as 2030. A parallel study by the Energy Watch Group also indicates the limited supply of [[uranium]]; this report states that like UK coal production 200 years ago, the production of uranium has first targeted high quality ores, and remaining sources are less dense and more difficult to access.

Fetter states that at least 230 years of proven uranium reserves are available at present worldwide rates of consumption, and using uranium extraction from seawater, up to 60,000 years of uranium are available. Further, using advanced [[breeder reactor]]s and [[nuclear reprocessing]], the 230 years of proven uranium reserves may be extended up to 30,000 years; similar gains are achievable from the 60,000 years of uranium reserves from seawater.&lt;ref name="SciAm-UraniumSupplyLength"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fetter|first=Steve|title=How Long Will The World's Uranium Supplies Last|journal=[[Scientific American]]|date=2009-01-26|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last|accessdate=2010-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319063123/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last|archive-date=2011-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}

[[Julian Huxley]] used the phrase “'''the eclipse of Darwinism'''”{{efn|In {{Harv|Huxley|1942|pp=22–28}}. Used earlier, c. 1925, in an unpublished manuscript by [[David Starr Jordan]], to imply that Darwinism was in relative decline, the interest of biologists being elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Largent/&gt;}} to describe the state of affairs prior to what he called the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], when [[evolution]] was widely accepted in scientific circles but relatively few biologists believed that [[natural selection]] was its primary mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Huxley|1942|pp=22–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=196, 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of science such as [[Peter J. Bowler]] have used the same phrase as a label for the period within the [[history of evolutionary thought]] from the 1880s to around 1920, when alternatives to [[natural selection]] were developed and explored—as many biologists considered natural selection to have been a wrong guess on [[Charles Darwin]]'s part, or at least as of relatively minor importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|pp=216–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative term, '''the interphase of Darwinism''', has been proposed to avoid the largely incorrect implication that the putative eclipse was preceded by a period of vigorous Darwinian research.&lt;ref name=Largent/&gt;

While there had been [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|multiple explanations of evolution]] including [[vitalism]], [[catastrophism]], and [[structuralism]] through the 19th century, four major alternatives to natural selection were in play at the turn of the 20th century:

* Theistic evolution was the belief that God directly guided evolution.{{efn|This should not be confused with a more recent use of the term [[theistic evolution]], which refers to a theological belief in the compatibility of science and religion.}}
* [[Neo-Lamarckism]] was the idea that evolution was driven by the inheritance of characteristics acquired during the life of the organism.
* [[Orthogenesis]] was the belief that organisms were affected by internal forces or laws of development that drove evolution in particular directions
* [[Mutationism]] was the idea that evolution was largely the product of mutations that created new forms or species in a single step.

Theistic evolution largely disappeared from the scientific literature by the end of the 19th century as direct appeals to supernatural causes came to be seen as unscientific. The other alternatives had significant followings well into the 20th century; mainstream biology largely abandoned them only when developments in [[genetics]] made them seem increasingly untenable, and when the development of [[population genetics]] and the modern synthesis demonstrated the explanatory power of [[natural selection]]. [[Ernst Mayr]] wrote that as late as 1930 most textbooks still emphasized such non-Darwinian mechanisms.&lt;ref name="MayrX"&gt;{{Harv|Mayr|Provine|1998|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

Evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles within a few years after the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', but acceptance of [[natural selection]] as its driving mechanism was much less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six objections were raised to the theory in the 19th century:&lt;ref name=Bowler23&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blending Inheritance.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Blending inheritance leads to the averaging out of every characteristic, which as the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] pointed out, makes evolution by natural selection impossible.]]

# The [[fossil record]] was discontinuous, suggesting gaps in evolution.&lt;ref name=Bowler23/&gt;
# The physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] calculated in 1862 that the [[age of the earth|earth would have cooled]] in 100 million years or less from its formation, too little time for evolution.{{efn|Years later, the discovery of [[radioactivity]] provided for a continual source of heat within the earth, and an age in billions of years, supporting Darwin's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Bowler23/&gt;  
# It was argued that many structures were nonadaptive (functionless), so they could not have evolved under natural selection.&lt;ref name=Bowler23/&gt;  
# Some structures seemed to have evolved on a regular pattern, like the eyes of unrelated animals such as the [[squid]] and [[mammals]].&lt;ref name=Bowler23/&gt;  
# Natural selection was argued not to be creative, while variation was admitted to be mostly not of value.&lt;ref name=Bowler23/&gt;  
# The engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]]{{efn|Jenkin was a polymath, and a friend of Kelvin's.}} correctly noted in 1868, reviewing ''The Origin of Species'', that the [[blending inheritance]] favoured by Darwin would oppose the action of natural selection.{{efn|Blending inheritance was discarded in favour of [[Mendelian genetics]] early in the 20th century.}}&lt;ref name=Bowler23/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler196-250"&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson105-129"&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Darwin and his close supporter [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]{{efn|Huxley was known as "Darwin's Bulldog".}} freely admitted, too, that selection might not be the whole explanation; Darwin was prepared to accept a measure of Lamarckism, while Huxley was comfortable with both [[saltationism|sudden (mutational) change]] and directed (orthogenetic) evolution.&lt;ref name=Bowler28&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, criticism of natural selection had reached the point that in 1903 the German botanist, {{ill |Eberhard Dennert |de}}, wrote that "We are now standing at the death bed of Darwinism", and in 1907 the [[Stanford University]] entomologist [[Vernon Lyman Kellogg]], who supported natural selection, asserted that "... the fair truth is that the Darwinian selection theory, considered with regard to its claimed capacity to be an independently sufficient mechanical explanation of descent, stands today seriously discredited in the biological world." &lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Endersby|2007|pp=143,453}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, however, that there were problems preventing the widespread acceptance of any of the alternatives, as large mutations seemed too uncommon, and there was no experimental evidence of mechanisms that could support either Lamarckism or orthogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst Mayr wrote that a survey of evolutionary literature and biology textbooks showed that as late as 1930 the belief that natural selection was the most important factor in evolution was a minority viewpoint, with only a few population geneticists being strict selectionists.&lt;ref name="MayrX"/&gt;

===Motivation for alternatives===
{{further |Alternatives to evolution by natural selection}}

[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|[[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection]] included directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), sometimes invoking divine control directly or indirectly.]]

A variety of different factors motivated people to propose other evolutionary mechanisms as [[alternatives to natural selection]], some of them dating back before Darwin's ''Origin of Species''. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it was immoral, and left little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these scientists and philosophers, like [[St. George Jackson Mivart]] and [[Charles Lyell]], who came to accept evolution but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|pp=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Herbert Spencer]], the botanist [[George Henslow]] (son of Darwin's mentor [[John Stevens Henslow]] also a botanist), and [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others, including the American paleontologists [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], had an idealist perspective and felt that nature, including the development of life, [[Orthogenesis|followed orderly patterns]] that natural selection could not explain.&lt;ref name="Bowler196-250"/&gt;

Another factor was the rise of a new faction of biologists at the end of the 19th century, typified by the geneticists [[Hugo DeVries]] and [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], who wanted to recast biology as an experimental laboratory science. They distrusted the work of naturalists like Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], dependent on field observations of variation, adaptation, and [[biogeography]], considering these overly anecdotal. Instead they focused on topics like [[physiology]], and [[genetics]] that could be easily investigated with [[controlled experiment]]s in the laboratory, and discounted natural selection and the degree to which organisms were adapted to their environment, which could not easily be tested experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Endersby|2007|pp=143–147,182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Darwinist theories during the eclipse==
===Theistic evolution===
&lt;!--sure we'd like a main article here, but it's NOT [[Theistic evolution]] which is about 20th century beliefs, not 19th century theory--&gt;
[[File:Jean Louis Agassiz 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Agassiz]] (here in 1870, with drawings of [[Radiata]]) believed in a sequence of creations in which humanity was the goal of a divine plan.]]

British science developed in the early 19th century on a basis of [[natural theology]] which saw the [[adaptation]] of fixed species as evidence that they had been specially created to a [[teleological argument|purposeful divine design]]. The philosophical concepts of [[German idealism]] inspired concepts of an ordered plan of harmonious creation, which [[Richard Owen]] reconciled with natural theology as a pattern of [[Homology (biology)|homology]] showing evidence of design. Similarly, [[Louis Agassiz]] saw the [[recapitulation theory]] as symbolising a pattern of the sequence of creations in which humanity was the goal of a divine plan. In 1844 ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges]]'' adapted Agassiz's concept into theistic evolutionism. Its anonymous author [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] proposed a "law" of divinely ordered progressive development, with [[transmutation of species]] as an extension of recapitulation theory. This popularised the idea, but it was strongly condemned by the scientific establishment. Agassiz remained forcefully opposed to evolution, and after he moved to America in 1846 his idealist argument from design of orderly development became very influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=44–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858 Owen cautiously proposed that this development could be a real expression of a continuing creative law, but distanced himself from transmutationists. Two years later in his review of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' Owen attacked Darwin while at the same time openly supporting evolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Secord|2001|pp=424, 512}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressing belief in a pattern of transmutation by law-like means. This idealist argument from design was taken up by other naturalists such as [[George Jackson Mivart]], and the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] who rejected natural selection altogether in favor of laws of development that guided evolution down preordained paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=46, 49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Darwin's supporters accepted evolution on the basis that it could be reconciled with design. In particular, [[Asa Gray]] considered natural selection to be the main mechanism of evolution and sought to reconcile it with natural theology. He proposed that natural selection could be a mechanism in which the [[problem of evil]] of suffering produced the greater good of adaptation, but conceded that this had difficulties and suggested that God might influence the variations on which natural selection acted to guide evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=203–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Darwin and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] such pervasive supernatural influence was beyond scientific investigation, and [[George Frederick Wright]], an ordained minister who was Gray's colleague in developing theistic evolution, emphasised the need to look for secondary or known causes rather than invoking supernatural explanations: "If we cease to observe this rule there is an end to all science and all sound science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[secular]] version of this [[methodological naturalism]] was welcomed by a younger generation of scientists who sought to investigate natural causes of organic change, and rejected theistic evolution in science. By 1872 Darwinism in its broader sense of the fact of evolution was accepted as a starting point. Around 1890 only a few older men held onto the idea of design in science, and it had completely disappeared from mainstream scientific discussions by 1900. There was still unease about the implications of natural selection, and those seeking a purpose or direction in evolution turned to [[Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] or [[orthogenesis]] as providing natural explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=26–27, 44–45, 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Lamarckism===
{{main|Lamarckism}}
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|left|thumb|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] had originally proposed a theory on the [[transmutation of species]] that was largely based on a progressive drive toward greater complexity. Lamarck also believed, as did many others at the time, that characteristics acquired during the course of an organism's life could be inherited by the next generation, and he saw this as a secondary evolutionary mechanism that produced adaptation to the environment. Typically, such characteristics included changes caused by the use or disuse of a particular [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]. It was this mechanism of evolutionary adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that much later came to be known as [[Lamarckism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] completely rejected the concept in favor of natural selection, [[Charles Darwin]] always included what he called ''Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection'' in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the [[ostrich]], they could not fly at all.&lt;ref name=toos&gt;{{Harv|Darwin |1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=136 108].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blind insects in Packard's Mammoth Cave and its Inhabitants 1872.jpg|thumb|[[Alpheus Spring Packard]]'s 1872 book ''Mammoth Cave and its Inhabitants'' used the example of cave beetles (''[[Anophthalmus]]'' and ''[[Ptomaphagus|Adelops]]'') that had become blind to argue for [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian evolution]] through inherited disuse of organs.]]

In the late 19th century the term [[neo-Lamarckism]] came to be associated with the position of [[naturalists]] who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], the German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], the [[United States|American]] [[paleontologist]]s [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], and the American [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Alpheus Spring Packard|Alpheus Packard]]. They considered Lamarckism to be more progressive and thus philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of natural selection acting on random variation. Butler and Cope both believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution, since organisms that developed new behaviors would change the patterns of use of their organs and thus kick-start the evolutionary process. In addition, Cope and Haeckel both believed that evolution was a progressive process. The idea of linear progress was an important part of Haeckel's [[recapitulation theory]] of evolution, which held that the [[embryo]]logical development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Cope and Hyatt looked for, and thought they found, patterns of linear progression in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="Bowler236"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson125_129"&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of acquired characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Packard|first1=Alpheus Spring |last2=Putnam|first2=Frederic Ward|authorlink1=Alpheus Spring Packard|title=The Mammoth Cave and its Inhabitants |publisher=Salem Naturalists' Agency |date=1872 |page=12|url=https://archive.org/details/mammothcaveandi01putngoog |oclc=04356215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packard also wrote a book about Lamarck and his writings.&lt;ref name="Bowler236"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quammen217"/&gt;

Many American proponents of neo-Lamarckism were strongly influenced by [[Louis Agassiz]] and a number of them, including Hyatt and Packard, were his students. Agassiz had an idealistic view of nature, connected with [[natural theology]], that emphasized the importance of order and pattern. Agassiz never accepted evolution; his followers did, but they continued his program of searching for orderly patterns in nature, which they considered to be consistent with divine providence, and preferred evolutionary mechanisms like neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis that would be likely to produce them.&lt;ref name="Bowler236"&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=236–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quammen217"&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|pp=217–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the botanist [[George Henslow]], the son of  Darwin's mentor [[John Stevens Henslow]], was an important advocate of neo-Lamarckism. He studied how environmental stress affected the development of plants, and he wrote that the variations induced by such environmental factors could largely explain evolution. The historian of science [[Peter J. Bowler]] writes that, as was typical of many 19th century Lamarckians, Henslow did not appear to understand the need to demonstrate that such environmentally induced variations would be inherited by descendants that developed in the absence of the environmental factors that produced them, but merely assumed that they would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polarising the argument: Weismann's germ plasm====
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory stated that the hereditary material is confined to the [[gonad]]s. Somatic cells (of the body) [[embryology|develop afresh]] in each generation from the germ plasm, so changes to the body acquired during a lifetime cannot affect the next generation, as [[neo-Lamarckism]] required.]]
{{main|Germ plasm}}

Critics of neo-Lamarckism pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The experimental work of the German biologist [[August Weismann]] resulted in the [[germ plasm]] theory of inheritance. This led him to declare that inheritance of acquired characteristics was impossible, since the [[Weismann barrier]] would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation. This effectively polarised the argument between the Darwinians and the neo-Lamarckians, as it forced people to choose whether to agree or disagree with Weismann and hence with evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Weismann's criticism, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Larson125_129"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=253–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baldwin effect====
{{main|Baldwin effect}}

As a consequence of the debate over the viability of neo-Lamarckism, in 1896 [[James Mark Baldwin]], [[Henry Fairfield Osborne]] and [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] all independently proposed a mechanism where new learned behaviors could cause the evolution of new instincts and physical traits through natural selection without resort to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. They proposed that if individuals in a species benefited from learning a particular new behavior, the ability to learn that behavior could be favored by natural selection, and the end result would be the evolution of new instincts and eventually new physical adaptations. This became known as the [[Baldwin effect]] and it has remained a topic of debate and research in evolutionary biology ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=243, 367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthogenesis===
[[File:Titanothere Osborn.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]'s 1918 book ''Origin and Evolution of Life'' claimed the evolution of [[Titanothere]] horns was an example of an [[Orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] trend in evolution.]]
{{main |Orthogenesis}}

Orthogenesis was the theory that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion in a particular direction. The term was popularized by [[Theodor Eimer]], a German [[zoologist]], in his 1898 book ''On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation''. He had studied the coloration of butterflies, and believed he had discovered non-adaptive features which could not be explained by natural selection. Eimer also believed in Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics, but he felt that internal laws of growth determine which characteristics would be acquired and guided the long term direction of evolution down certain paths.&lt;ref name="Quammen221"&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthogenesis had a significant following in the 19th century, its proponents including the Russian biologist [[Leo S. Berg]], and the American [[paleontologist]] [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthogenesis was particularly popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed patterns of gradual and constant unidirectional change. Those who accepted this idea, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism driving orthogenesis was [[teleological]] (goal-directed). They did believe that orthogenetic trends were non-adaptive; in fact they felt that in some cases they led to developments that were detrimental to the organism, such as the large antlers of the [[Irish elk]] that they believed led to the animal's extinction.&lt;ref name="Quammen221"/&gt;

Support for orthogenesis began to decline during the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1940s, when it became apparent that orthogenesis could not explain the complex branching patterns of evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the [[fossil record]] by paleontologists. A few biologists however hung on to the idea of orthogenesis as late as the 1950s, claiming that the processes of [[macroevolution]], the long term trends in evolution, were distinct from the processes of [[microevolution]].&lt;ref name="Bowler196-250"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson105-129"/&gt;

===Mutationism===
{{Main |Mutationism}}
[[File:Hugo de Vries (1848-1935), by Thérèse Schwartze (1851-1918).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of [[Hugo de Vries]], making a painting of an [[Oenothera|evening primrose]], the plant which had apparently produced new forms by large mutations in his experiments, by [[Thérèse Schwartze]], 1918]]

[[Mutationism]] was the idea that new forms and species arose in a single step as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo de Vries]], who along with [[Carl Correns]] helped rediscover [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900, [[William Bateson]] a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=265–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1901 mutation theory of evolution held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. Its originator was the Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries. De Vries looked for evidence of mutation extensive enough to produce a new species in a single generation and thought he found it with his work breeding the evening primrose of the genus ''[[Oenothera]]'', which he started in 1886. The plants that de Vries worked with seemed to be constantly producing new varieties with striking variations in form and color, some of which appeared to be new species because plants of the new generation could only be crossed with one another, not with their parents. DeVries himself allowed a role for natural selection in determining which new species would survive, but some geneticists influenced by his work, including Morgan, felt that natural selection was not necessary at all. De Vries's ideas were influential in the first two decades of the 20th century, as some biologists felt that mutation theory could explain the sudden emergence of new forms in the fossil record; research on ''Oenothera'' spread across the world. However, critics including many field naturalists wondered why no other organism seemed to show the same kind of rapid mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Endersby|2007|pp=148–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan was a supporter of de Vries's mutation theory and was hoping to gather evidence in favor of it when he started working with the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' in his lab in 1907. However, it was a researcher in that lab, [[Hermann Joseph Muller]], who determined in 1918 that the new varieties de Vries had observed while breeding ''Oenothera'' were the result of [[polyploid]] hybrids rather than rapid genetic mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Endersby|2007|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramsey |first1=Justin |last2=Ramsey |first2=Tara S. |title=Ecological studies of polyploidy in the 100 years following its discovery |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.

The work in Morgan's lab with ''Drosophila'' also undermined the concept of orthogenesis by demonstrating the random nature of mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=269–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the eclipse==
[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], including competition for resources, [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance. This ended the eclipse of Darwinism.]]
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

During the period 1916–1932, the discipline of [[population genetics]] developed largely through the work of the geneticists [[Ronald Fisher]], [[J.B.S. Haldane]], and [[Sewall Wright]]. Their work recognized that the vast majority of [[mutation]]s produced small effects that served to increase the genetic variability of a population rather than creating new species in a single step as the mutationists assumed. They were able to produce statistical models of population genetics that included Darwin's concept of [[natural selection]] as the driving force of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mayr|Provine|1998|pp=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in [[genetics]] persuaded field naturalists such as [[Bernhard Rensch]] and [[Ernst Mayr]] to abandon neo-Lamarckian ideas about evolution in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mayr|Provine|1998| pp=124–127, 296}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1930s, Mayr and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] had synthesized the ideas of population genetics with the knowledge of field naturalists about the amount of genetic diversity in wild populations, and the importance of genetically distinct subpopulations (especially when isolated from one another by geographical barriers) to create the early 20th century [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mayr|Provine|1998|pp=xii–xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 [[George Gaylord Simpson]] integrated [[paleontology]] into the synthesis by statistically analyzing the fossil record to show that it was consistent with the branching non-directional form of evolution predicted by the modern synthesis, and in particular that the linear trends cited by earlier paleontologists in support of Lamarckism and orthogenesis did not stand up to careful analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr wrote that by the end of the synthesis natural selection together with chance mechanisms like [[genetic drift]] had become the universal explanation for evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="MayrX"/&gt;

==Historiography==

The concept of eclipse suggests that Darwinian research paused, implying in turn that there had been a preceding period of vigorously Darwinian activity among biologists. However, historians of science such as Mark Largent have argued that while biologists broadly accepted the extensive evidence for evolution presented in ''The Origin of Species'', there was less enthusiasm for natural selection as a mechanism. Biologists instead looked for alternative explanations more in keeping with their worldviews, which included the beliefs that evolution must be directed and that it constituted a form of progress. Further, the idea of a dark eclipse period was convenient to scientists such as Julian Huxley, who wished to paint the modern synthesis as a bright new achievement, and accordingly to depict the preceding period as dark and confused. Huxley's 1942 book ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]'' therefore, argued Largent, suggested that the so-called modern synthesis began after a long period of eclipse lasting until the 1930s, in which Mendelians, neo-Lamarckians, mutationists, and Weismannians, not to mention experimental embryologists and [[Haeckel]]ian [[Recapitulation theory|recapitulationists]] fought running battles with each other.&lt;ref name=Largent/&gt; The idea of an eclipse also allowed Huxley to step aside from what was to him the inconvenient association of evolution with aspects such as [[social Darwinism]], [[eugenics]], [[imperialism]], and [[militarism]].&lt;ref name=Largent/&gt; Accounts such as [[Michael Ruse]]'s very large&lt;!--Size (600 pages plus) matters here, as Ruse was certainly not trying to save space.--&gt;&lt;ref name=Largent/&gt; book ''Monad to Man''&lt;ref name=Ruse1996&gt;{{Harv|Ruse|1996|}}&lt;/ref&gt; ignored, claimed Largent, almost all the early 20th century American evolutionary biologists. Largent has suggested as an alternative to eclipse a biological metaphor, the interphase of Darwinism, [[interphase]] being an apparently quiet period in the cycle of [[cell division]] and growth.&lt;ref name=Largent&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Largent |title=The So-Called Eclipse of Darwinism |journal=Descended from Darwin: Insights into the History of Evolutionary Studies, 1900–1970 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |year=2009 |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/cain/projects/descended_from_darwin/pdfs/cain-and-ruse_01-largent.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">A scholar at the [[University of Toronto]], '''Theophile James Meek''' (1881–1966) published widely on [[archaeology]], corresponded with [[William Foxwell Albright|Wm. F. Albright]], and was a frequent contributor to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' on subjects related to the archaeology of both [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]].  He may have played a part in working out the chronology of Egypt which soon became the prevailing mainstream chronology among scholars, and which the [[Encyclopedia Americana]] still upholds today.  More recently, the Britannica has lowered its dates somewhat currently, with [[Manfred Bietak]], an eminent [[Egyptologist]] placing them even later.

In the book ''Hebrew Origins'', he suggested that the Conquest of Palestine occurred in two phases: the first being represented by the settlement of the central highlands seen at 1400 BCE, and the second being seen archaeologically in the conquests of the "[[Joshua]]" cities, then dated to around 1250.  He pointed out that the [[Song of Deborah]] ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] ch. 5) does not seem to know the three [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] territory tribes, but early stages of Joshua do, and that they were thus perhaps transposed in time.

He is also widely cited for having suggested that the "Song of Songs" (a.k.a. the "[[Song of Solomon]]") had striking similarities with a [[Babylon]]ian fertility myth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3922">'''Thomas Edgar Pemberton''' (1 July 1849 – 28 September 1905) was an English novelist, playwright and theatrical historian.

==Early career==
Born on 1 July 1849, he was the eldest son of Thomas Pemberton, the head of an old-established firm of brass founders in Livery Street, [[Birmingham]]. A brother was the novelist [[Max Pemberton]]. (The earlier actor and lecturer [[Charles Reece Pemberton]] was of the same family.) After education at schools in [[Edgbaston]], Pemberton at nineteen entered his father's firm, and in due course gained control of the business, with which he was connected until 1900.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB12|first=William John|last=Lawrence|wstitle=Pemberton, Thomas Edgar|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=35463|title=Pemberton, Thomas Edgar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pemberton married on 11 March 1873, in the Old Meeting House, Birmingham, Mary Elizabeth, second daughter of Edward Richard Patie Townley of Edgbaston.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Of literary taste from youth, Pemberton long divided his time between commerce and varied literary endeavours. His novels ''Charles Lysaght: a Novel devoid of Novelty'' (1873) and ''Under Pressure'' (1874) were less well regarded than his later novel ''A Very Old Question'' (3 volumes, 1877). There followed ''Born to Blush Unseen'' (1879) and an allegorical fairytale, ''Fair-brass'', written for his children.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

At his father's house he met in youth [[Edward Askew Sothern]], [[Madge Kendal]] and other players on visits to Birmingham, and he soon tried his hand at drama. His comedietta ''Weeds'', the first of a long list of ephemeral pieces, mainly farcical, was written for the Kendals, and produced at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, Birmingham, opening on 16 November 1874. His many plays were rarely seen outside provincial theatres.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==Collaboration with Bret Harte==
He came to know [[Bret Harte]], and his successful play ''Sue'' was adapted with Bret Harte's collaboration from the latter's story ''The Judgment of Bolinas Plain''. It was produced in America in 1896, and in London at the [[Garrick Theatre]], opening on 10 June 1898. ''Held Up'', a four-act play by Harte and Pemberton, was produced at the Worcester Theatre, opening on 24 August 1903. On Bret Harte's death in 1902, Pemberton wrote ''Bret Harte: a Treatise and a Tribute.''&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Vladimir Borisovich Kobrin''' (Владимир Борисович Кобрин; 1930-1990) was a leading authority on the [[aristocracy]] of late medieval [[Russia]].

He graduated from the [[Moscow University]] in 1951 and continued [[Stepan Veselovsky]]'s studies of medieval Russian aristocracy after the latter's death in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Археографический ежегодник за 1990 год. Изд-во Академии наук СССР, 1990. Стр. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed the [[Oprichnina]] as a prop for [[Ivan IV]]'s dictatorship and described it as a social catastrophe. Kobrin's popular biography of Ivan the Terrible was published in 1989.

After the [[Perestroika]] was launched in 1985, Kobrin was involved in the publication of [[Alexander Zimin|A. A. Zimin]]'s controversial manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Чтения памяти В.Б. Кобрина: "Проблемы отечественной истории и культуры периода феодализма" : Тезисы докладов и сообщений : Москва, 26-29 января 1992 года. РГГУ, 1992. Стр. 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter of [[Coventry]]''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1290), [[England|English]] monk and chronicler, who was apparently connected with a religious house in the [[province of York]], is known to us only through the historical compilation which bears his name, the ''Memoriale fratris Walteri de Coventria''.

The word ''Memoriale'' is usually taken to mean "commonplace book." Some critics interpret it in the sense of "a souvenir," and argue that Walter was not the author but merely the donor of the book; but the weight of authority is against this view. The author of the ''Memoriale'' lived in the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], and mentions the homage done to Edward as overlord of [[Scotland]] (1291).

Since the main narrative extends only to 1225, the ''Memoriale'' is emphatically a second-hand production. But for the years 1201-1225 it is a faithful transcript of a contemporary chronicle, the work of a [[Barnwell, Cambridgeshire|Barnwell]] canon. A complete text of the [[Barnwell chronicler|Barnwell chronicle]] is preserved in the [[College of Arms]]' (Heralds' College, manuscript 10) but has never yet been printed, though it was collated by [[William Stubbs|Bishop Stubbs]] for his edition of the Memoriale. The Barnwell annalist, living in [[Cambridgeshire]], was well situated to observe the events of [[First Barons' War|the barons' war]], and is our most valuable authority for that important crisis.

He is less hostile to [[John of England|King John]] than are [[Ralph of Coggeshall]], [[Roger of Wendover]] and [[Matthew Paris]]. He praises the king's management of the Welsh and Scottish wars; he is critical in his attitude towards the pope and the English opposition; he regards the submission of John to [[Holy See|Rome]] as a skilful stroke of policy, although he notes the fact that some men called it a humiliation. The constitutional agitation of 1215 does not arouse his enthusiasm; he passes curtly over the [[Runnymede]] conference, barely mentions [[Magna Carta]], and blames the barons for the resumption of war. It may be from timidity that the annalist avoids attacking John, but it is more probable that the [[middle classes]], whom he represents, regarded the designs of the [[feudalism|feudal baronage]] with suspicion.

The institution of the museum was established in 1983, but no construction work took place for many years. It opened on July 31, 2004, marking the 60th anniversary of the uprising.

The museum sponsors research into the history of the uprising, and the history and possessions of the [[Polish Underground State]]. It collects and maintains hundreds of [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s — ranging from weapons used by the insurgents to love letters — to present a full picture of the people involved. The museum's stated goals include the creation of an archive of historical information on the uprising and the recording of the stories and memories of living participants. Its director is [[Jan Ołdakowski]], with historian [[Dariusz Gawin]] from the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] as his deputy.&lt;ref name="sdp.pl"&gt;[http://old.sdp.pl/rozmowa-dnia-gawin  Rozmowa dnia.

The museum is a member organisation of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].&lt;ref name="Platform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2011/10/20/czech-prime-minister-petr-necas-the-years-of-totalitarianism-were-years-of-struggle-for-liberty/|title= Czech Prime minister Petr Nečas: The years of totalitarianism were years of struggle for liberty|date=14 October 2011|publisher=[[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]]|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
The museum covers all aspects of the Warsaw Uprising.

There are exhibits over several floors, containing photographs, audio and video, interactive displays, artifacts, written accounts, and other testimonies of how life was during the German occupation of Warsaw, the uprising, and its aftermath. There are displays dedicated to each district of Warsaw. There are many free informative leaflets and flyers (in Polish and English), including 63 calendar pages covering the dates from 1 August 1944 to 2 October 1944— each containing a summary of the most important events that took place on that particular day of the uprising.

Some of the many sections and exhibits include:
* The "little insurgent" room: dedicated to the youngest insurgents and children's experience of the uprising. The room includes a replica of the [[Mały Powstaniec|"little insurgent" monument]] and a colourised photograph of Róża Maria Goździewska, a girl who was known as "the little nurse".
* Kino palladium: a small cinema showing a continuous stream of original footage taken by insurgent filmographers in 1944, which was used to produce newsreels that were shown in Warsaw's Palladium cinema during the uprising. 
* Sewer replicas: one on the mezzanine floor and another in the basement — a chance to experience the practice of using the sewers to move through German-held territory (without the dirt). 
* Insurgent hospital: help for the wounded during the uprising.
* Hangar: a hall containing a full-size [[B-24 Liberator]].
* Large cinema: on the ground floor, it presents a film reconstructed of newsreels. It concludes with Chopin's Prelude in D Minor, Op. 28 no. 24. 
* Observation tower: panoramic views of Warsaw from the top of the building.
* Print shop: a room containing original typewriters and printing equipment used for producing underground newspapers during the German occupation.
* ''City of Ruins'': a short 3D movie of the ruins of Warsaw taken from the air in 1945.
* [[Nazism|Nazi]] section: the horrors of the German occupation and the atrocities committed by the Germans and their collaborators during the uprising.
* [[Communism|Communist]] section: the Soviet takeover of Poland, Stalin's puppet government, lack of help for the uprising, and the fate of the Polish resistance in post-war communist Poland.

== Other highlights ==
* A 1940s style [[cantina|cafe]]
* Freedom park: over 30 posters featuring colourised photographs taken during the uprising 
* Freedom park: a replica of the [[Kubuś]] armoured car, manufactured by the insurgents of the Powiśle district of Warsaw during the uprising 
* Freedom park: remnants of a [[Monument to Prince Józef Poniatowski in Warsaw|statue of Józef Poniatowski]] that was blown up by the Germans after the uprising 
* Freedom park: street art inspired by the Warsaw Uprising 
* A [[memorial]] wall with thousands of names of the fallen and the "Monter bell"
* A wall, known as the heart of the museum, with sounds of battle and heartbeats emanating from it
* Souvenir shops (one inside the museum and one in the ticket office).
* The [[Warsaw Fotoplastikon]], a 1905 stereoscopic theatre used by the Polish underground, now preserved and operated by the Warsaw Uprising Museum as an off-site branch at 51 [[Jerusalem Avenue]].
