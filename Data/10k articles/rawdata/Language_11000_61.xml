'''Ahmad Khani''', '''Ahmad-i Khani'''  ({{lang-ku|'''Ehmedê Xanî'''}}, (1650 [[Hakkari]] –1707 [[Doğubayazıt]]) was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[writer]], [[poet]], [[astronomer]] and [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/81&lt;/ref&gt; He was born amongst the Khani's tribe in [[Hakkari]] province in present-day [[Turkey]]. He moved to Bayezid in Ritkan province and settled there. Later he started with teaching [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] ([[Kurmanji]]) at basic level. Khani was fluent in Kurdish, [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. He wrote his Arabic-Kurdish dictionary "Nûbihara Biçûkan" (The Spring of Children) in 1683 to help children with their learning process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ehmedexani.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801100448/http://ehmedexani.org/ |date=1 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most important work is the Kurdish classic love story "[[Mem and Zin]]" (Mem û Zîn) (1692).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institutkurde.org/en/language www.institutkurde.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

His other work include a book called ''Eqîdeya Îmanê'' (The Path of Faith), which is part poem and part [[prose]]. The book explains the five pillars of Islamic faith. It was published in 2000 in Sweden.

'''Ancient Macedonian''', the language of the [[ancient Macedonians]], either a [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialect of Ancient Greek]] or a separate [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic language]], was spoken in the kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] during the 1st millennium BC and belongs to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]]. It gradually fell out of use during the 4th century BC, marginalized by the use of [[Attic Greek]] by the Macedonian aristocracy, the Ancient Greek dialect that became the basis of [[Koine Greek]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene N. Borza (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=614pd07OtfQC&amp;pg=PA94 ''In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon''], p. 94 (citing Hammond); G. Horrocks, ''Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers'' (1993), ch.4.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving public and private inscriptions found in Macedonia indicate that there was no other written language in ancient Macedonia but [[Ancient Greek]],&lt;ref name="RoismanWorthington2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Roisman|author2=Ian Worthington|title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&amp;pg=PA94|date=7 July 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5163-7|page=94|quote=Many surviving public and private inscriptions indicate that in the Macedonian kingdom there was no dominant written language but standard Attic and later on ''koine'' Greek.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CambridgeAncientHistory"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge ancient history, 3rd edition, Volume VI|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|page=730|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vx251bK988gC&amp;pg=RA7-PA831 | first1=D.

Pomeroy, Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, Jennifer Tolbert Roberts, ''A Brief History of Ancient Greece: Politics, Society, and Culture'', Oxford University Press, 2008, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguistic evidence suggests that although Ancient Greek was the language of literacy, the vernacular was a separate language, although closely related.&lt;ref name="georgiev"&gt;Vladimir Georgiev, "The Genesis of the Balkan Peoples", ''The Slavonic and East European Review'' '''44''':103:285-297 (July 1966)&lt;br/&gt;"Ancient Macedonian is closely related to Greek, and Macedonian and Greek are descended from a common Greek-Macedonian idiom that was spoken till about the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. From the 4th century BC on began the Hellenization of ancient Macedonian."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hamp &amp; Douglas Adams (2013) "The Expansion of the Indo-European Languages", ''Sino-Platonic Papers'', vol 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

*According to [[The Histories of Herodotus|Herodotus]] 7.73 (c. 440 BC), the Macedonians claimed that the ''[[Phrygia|Phryges]]'' were called ''Bryges'' before they migrated from [[Thrace]] to [[Anatolia]] (around 8th–7th century BC).
*According to [[Plutarch]], [[Moralia]]&lt;ref&gt;Greek Questions 292e – Question 9 – Why do Delphians call one of their months Bysios [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1212&amp;chapter=91574&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27].&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonians use 'b' instead of 'ph', while [[Delphi]]ans use 'b' in the place of 'p'.
*Macedonian '''{{lang|grc|μάγειρος}}''' ''mágeiros'' ('butcher') was a loan from Doric into [[Attic Greek|Attic]]. Vittore Pisani has suggested an ultimately Macedonian origin for the word, which could then be cognate to '''{{lang|grc|μάχαιρα}}''' ''[[makhaira|mákhaira]]'' ('knife', &lt; PIE ''*mag&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;-'', 'to fight')&lt;ref&gt;''Česko-jihoslovenská revue'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=igrvAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= Volume 4], 1934, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

If '''{{lang|grc|γοτάν}}''' ''gotán'' ('pig') is related to *''g&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;ou'' ('cattle'), this would indicate that the [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]] were either intact, or merged with the velars, unlike the usual Greek treatment (Attic '''{{lang|grc|βοῦς}}''' ''boûs''). Such deviations, however, are not unknown in Greek dialects; compare [[Doric Greek#Laconian|Laconian Doric]] (the dialect of Sparta) '''{{lang|grc|γλεπ-}}''' ''glep-'' for common Greek '''{{lang|grc|βλεπ-}}''' ''blep-'', as well as Doric '''{{lang|grc|γλάχων}}''' ''gláchōn'' and [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] '''{{lang|grc|γλήχων}}''' ''glēchōn'' for common Greek '''{{lang|grc|βλήχων}}''' ''[[Mentha pulegium|blēchōn]]''.&lt;ref name="Stuttgart-1930"&gt;Albrecht von Blumenthal, ''Hesychstudien'', Stuttgart, 1930, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of examples suggest that voiced [[Velar consonant|velar]] stops were devoiced, especially word-initially: '''{{lang|grc|κάναδοι}}''' ''kánadoi'', 'jaws'  (&lt; PIE ''*genu-''); '''{{lang|grc|κόμβους}}''' ''kómbous'', 'molars' (&lt; PIE ''*gombh-''); within words: '''{{lang|grc|ἀρκόν}}''' ''arkón'' (Attic '''{{lang|grc|ἀργός}}''' ''argós''); the Macedonian [[toponym]] ''Akesamenai'', from the [[Pierian Mountains|Pierian]] name ''Akesamenos'' (if ''Akesa-'' is cognate to Greek ''agassomai'', ''agamai'', "to astonish"; cf. the Thracian name ''Agassamenos'').

In [[Aristophanes]]' [[The Birds (play)|''The Birds'']], the form '''{{lang|grc|κεβλήπυρις}}''' ''keblēpyris'' ('red head', the name of a bird, perhaps the goldfinch or redpoll) is found,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3D%2317647 Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon, κεβλήπυρις]. Perseus.tufts.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt; showing a Macedonian-style voiced stop in place of a standard Greek unvoiced aspirate: '''{{lang|grc|κεβ(α)λή}}''' ''keb(a)lē'' versus '''{{lang|grc|κεφαλή}}''' ''kephalē'' ('head').

A number of the Macedonian words, particularly in Hesychius' lexicon, are disputed (i.e., some do not consider them actual Macedonian words) and some may have been corrupted in the transmission. Thus ''abroutes'',  may be read as abrouwes ({{lang|grc|αβρουϝες}}), with tau ({{lang|grc|Τ}})  replacing  a [[digamma]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Masson, "Sur la notation occasionnelle du digamma grec par d'autres consonnes et la glose  macédonienne abroutes", ''Bulletin de la Société de linguistique de Paris'', 90 (1995) 231–239. Also proposed by O. Hoffmann and J. Kalleris.&lt;/ref&gt; If so, this word would perhaps be encompassable  within a Greek dialect; however, others (e.g. [[Antoine Meillet|A. Meillet]]) see the dental as authentic and think that this specific word would perhaps belong to an Indo-European language different from Greek.

A. Panayotou summarizes some features generally identified through ancient texts and epigraphy:&lt;ref name="Greek 2007 p. 439-441"&gt;A history of ancient Greek: from the beginnings to late antiquity, Maria Chritē, Maria Arapopoulou, Cambridge University Press (2007), p. 439–441&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonology===
*Occasional development of voiced aspirates (*b&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;, *d&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;, *g&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;) into voiced stops (b, d, g) (e.g. Βερενίκα, Attic Φερενίκη)
*Retention of &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;/a:/ (e.g. Μαχάτας), also present in [[Doric Greek#Epirotic|Epirotic]]&lt;ref name="epigraphy.packhum.org"&gt;Packard Institute epigraphic database http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions//main {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121221117/http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/main |date=2007-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[a:] as result of contraction [a:] + [ɔ:]
*Apocope of short vowels in prepositions in synthesis (παρκαττίθεμαι, Attic παρακατατίθεμαι)
*Syncope (hyphairesis) and diphthongization are used to avoid hiatus (e.g. Θετίμα, Attic Θεοτίμη; compare with Epirotic Λαγέτα, Doric Λαογἐτα).&lt;ref name="epigraphy.packhum.org" /&gt;
*Occasional retention of the pronunciation [u] οf /u(:)/ in local cult epithets or nicknames (Κουναγίδας = Κυναγίδας)
*Raising of /ɔ:/ to /u:/ in proximity to nasal (e.g. Κάνουν, Attic Κανών)
*Simplification of the sequence /ign/ to /i:n/ (γίνομαι, Attic γίγνομαι)
*Loss of aspiration of the consonant cluster /st&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;/ (&gt; /st/) (γενέσται, Attic γενέσθαι)

=== Morphology ===
Ancient Macedonian morphology is shared with ancient Epirus, including some of the oldest inscriptions from Dodona.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lhote (2006) Les lamelles Oraculaires de Dodone. Droz, Geneve.&lt;/ref&gt; The morphology of the first declension nouns with an -ας ending is also shared with Thessalian (e.g. Epitaph for Pyrrhiadas, Kierion&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, E.S., An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy vol. 1 no. 237&lt;/ref&gt;).
*First-declension masculine and feminine in -ας and -α respectively (e.g. Πεύκεστας, Λαομάγα)
*First-declension masculine genitive singular in -α (e.g. Μαχάτα)
*First-declension genitive plural in -ᾶν
*First person personal pronoun dative singular ἐμίν
*Temporal conjunction ὁπόκα
*Possibly, a non-sigmatic nominative masculine singular in the first declension (ἱππότα, Attic ἱππότης)

== Onomastics ==

=== Anthroponymy ===

M. Hatzopoulos summarizes the Macedonian anthroponymy (that is names borne by people from Macedonia before the expansion beyond the [[Vardar|Axios]] or people undoubtedly hailing from this area after the expansion) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Greek Personal Names: Their Value as Evidence, [[Elaine Matthews]], Simon Hornblower, Peter Marshall Fraser, British Academy, Oxford University Press (2000), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

*Epichoric (local) Greek names that either differ from the phonology of the introduced Attic or that remained almost confined to Macedonians throughout antiquity
*Panhellenic (common) Greek names
*Identifiable non-Greek (Thracian and Illyrian) names
*Names without a ''clear'' Greek etymology that can't however be ascribed to any identifiable non-Greek linguistic group.

Common in the creation of ethnics is the use of -έστης, -εστός especially when derived from sigmatic nouns (ὄρος &gt; Ὀρέστης but also Δῖον &gt; Διασταί).&lt;ref name="Greek 2007 p. 439-441" /&gt;

=== Toponymy ===
The toponyms of Macedonia proper are generally Greek, though some of them show a particular phonology and a few others are non-Greek.

== Calendar ==
{{Main|Ancient Macedonian calendar}}
The Macedonian names of about half or more of the months of the [[ancient Macedonian calendar]] have a clear and generally accepted Greek etymology (e.g. Dios, Apellaios, Artemisios, Loos, Daisios), though some of the remaining ones have sometimes been considered to be Greek but showing a particular Macedonian phonology (e.g. Audunaios has been connected to "[[Hades|Haides]]" ''*A-wid'' and Gorpiaios/Garpiaios to "karpos" fruit).

== Epigraphy ==
Macedonian onomastics: the earliest epigraphical documents attesting substantial numbers of Macedonian proper names are the second [[Athenian]] alliance decree with [[Perdiccas II of Macedon|Perdiccas II]] (~417–413 BC), the decree of [[Kalindoia]] (~335–300 BC) and seven [[curse tablets]] of the 4th century BC bearing mostly names.&lt;ref&gt;Athens, bottom-[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=91&amp;bookid=4&amp;region=1&amp;subregion=71 IG I³ 89] – [[Kalindoia]]-[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=152454&amp;bookid=152411&amp;region=4&amp;subregion=11 Meletemata 11 K31] – [[Pydna]]-[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=313283&amp;bookid=172&amp;region=4&amp;subregion=11 SEG 52:617,I] (6) till SEG 52:617,VI – [[Mygdonia (Europe)|Mygdonia]]-[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=312708&amp;bookid=172&amp;region=4&amp;subregion=11 SEG 49:750]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greek Personal Names: Their Value as Evidence [https://books.google.com/books?id=SbVJvfu7EzsC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Eulandros&amp;sig=yd7IcAoFOzbna01VP8TBL4fYh0Y] by Simon Hornblower, Elaine Matthews&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hesychius Glossary ==
{{external links|date=April 2017}}

A body of idiomatic words has been assembled from ancient sources, mainly from coin inscriptions, and from the 5th century lexicon of [[Hesychius of Alexandria]], amounting to about 150 words and 200 proper names, though the number of considered words sometimes differs from scholar to scholar. The majority of these words can be confidently assigned to Greek albeit some words would appear to reflect a dialectal form of Greek. There are, however, a number of words that are not easily identifiable as Greek and reveal, for example, voiced stops where Greek shows voiceless aspirates.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory &amp; D.Q Adams – ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture'', Chicago-London: Fitzroy Dearborn. pp. 361. {{ISBN|1-884964-98-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific words and consonant shifts are, however, present in most dialects of most languages.

== Macedonian in Classical sources ==
{{further information|Greek historiography}}
Among the references that have been discussed as possibly bearing some witness to the linguistic situation in Macedonia, there is a sentence from a fragmentary dialogue, apparently between an Athenian and a Macedonian, in an extant fragment of the 5th century BC comedy 'Macedonians' by the Athenian poet [[Strattis]] (fr. 28), where a stranger is portrayed as speaking in a rural Greek dialect. His language contains expressions such as {{lang|grc|ὕμμες ὡττικοί}} for {{lang|grc|ὑμεὶς ἀττικοί}} "you Athenians", {{lang|grc|ὕμμες}} being also attested in [[Homer]], [[Sappho]] ([[Lesbian Greek|Lesbian]]) and [[Theocritus]] ([[Doric Greek|Doric]]), while {{lang|grc|ὡττικοί}} appears only in "funny country bumpkin" contexts of Attic comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Colvin, ''Dialect in Aristophanes and the politics of language in Ancient Greek,'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another text that has been quoted as evidence is a passage from [[Livy]] (lived 59 BC-14 AD) in his ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'' (31.29). Describing political negotiations between Macedonians and [[Aetolia]]ns in the late 3rd century BC, Livy has a Macedonian ambassador argue that Aetolians, [[Acarnania]]ns and Macedonians were "men of the same language".&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''The History of Rome'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Liv.+31+29&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0148 31.29.15], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted as referring to a shared North-West Greek speech (as opposed to Attic Koiné).&lt;ref&gt;A. Panayotou: The position of the Macedonian dialect. In: Maria Arapopoulou, Maria Chritē, Anastasios-Phoivos Christides (eds.), ''A History of Ancient Greek: From the Beginnings to Late Antiquity'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 433–458 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=WJbd0m6YaFkC&amp;pg=PA434&amp;lpg=PA435&amp;dq=Macedonians,+Aetolians,+and+Acarnanians+spoke+the+same+dialect+(context+dating+ca.&amp;hl=de&amp;sig=6co-S_dXeFu4YHWUvkQQPZ2I99w#PPA433,M1 Google Books]).&lt;/ref&gt; In another passage, Livy states that an announcement was translated from Latin to Greek for Macedonians to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''The History of Rome'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Liv.+45+29&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0168 45.29], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], [[Philotas]]'s trial&lt;ref&gt;E. Kapetanopoulos. "Alexander’s Patrius Sermo in the Philotas Affair", ''The Ancient World'' 30 (1999), pp. 117–128. ([http://www.history.ccsu.edu/elias/PhilotasPatriusSermo.pdf PDF] or [http://www.history.ccsu.edu/elias/AlexandrosPatrius.htm HTM])&lt;/ref&gt; and the statement that the Greek-speaking [[Didyma#The Branchidae|Branchidae]] had common language with the Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;Quintus Curtius Rufus, ''Historiae Alexandri Magni'', VII.5.33, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Curtius/7*.html (Loeb edition, Latin)], [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015024880851;view=1up;seq=185 (John C. Rolfe, English translation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, "Macedonian" (μακεδονικός), when referring to language (and related expressions such as ''μακεδονίζειν''; to speak in the Macedonian fashion) acquired the meaning of [[Koine Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Brixhe, A. Panayotou, 1994, «Le Macédonien» in ''Langues indo-européennes'', p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to the Koine ==
{{further information|Ancient Macedonians}}
As a consequence of the Macedonians' role in the formation of the Koine, Macedonian contributed considerable elements, unsurprisingly including some military terminology (διμοιρίτης, ταξίαρχος, ὑπασπισταί, etc.). Among the many contributions were the general use of the first declension grammar for male and female nouns with an -as ending, attested in the genitive of Macedonian coinage from the early 4th C BC of [[Amyntas III of Macedon|Amyntas III]] (ΑΜΥΝΤΑ in the genitive; the Attic form that fell into disuse would be ΑΜΥΝΤΟΥ). There were changes in verb conjugation such as in the Imperative δέξα attested in Macedonian sling stones found in Asiatic battlefields, that became adopted in place of the Attic forms. Koine Greek established a spirantisation of beta, gamma and delta, which has been attributed to the Macedonian influence.&lt;ref&gt;George Babiniotis (1992) The question of mediae in ancient Macedonian Greek reconsidered. In: Historical Philology: Greek, Latin, and Romance, Bela Brogyanyi, Reiner Lipp, 1992 John Benjamins Publishing)&lt;/ref&gt; Other adoptions from the ancient Macedonian include the simplification of the sequence /ign/ to /i:n/ (γίνομαι, Attic γίγνομαι) and the loss of aspiration of the consonant cluster /sth/ (&gt; /st/) (γενέσται, Attic γενέσθαι), for example as in a Koine inscription from [[Dura-Europos]] from the 2nd or 3rd century AD: "τον Χριστὀν μνἠσκεστε".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

{{Diacritical marks|´|caption=Apex}}In written [[Latin language|Latin]], the '''apex''' (plural "apices") is a mark with roughly the shape of an [[acute accent]] (&amp;nbsp;´&amp;nbsp;) which is placed over vowels to indicate that they are [[long vowel|long]].

The shape and length of the apex can vary, sometimes within a single inscription. While virtually all apices consist of a line sloping up to the right, the line can be more or less curved, and varies in length from less than half the height of a letter to more than the height of a letter. Sometimes, it is adorned at the top with a distinct hook, protruding to the left. Rather than being centered over the vowel it modifies, the apex is often considerably displaced to the right.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/292702 Apex and Sicilicus]'', Revilo P. Oliver, The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 87, No. 2. (Apr., 1966), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The apex later developed into the [[acute accent]], which is still used to mark vowel length in some languages, namely, [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], and for the historically long vowels of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. In the 17th century, it was adapted to mark final [[nasalization]] in the early [[Vietnamese alphabet]].

[[Image:Apices-collage.svg|left]]
{{cn span|Although hardly known by most modern Latinists, the use of the sign was actually quite widespread during classical and postclassical times. The reason why it so often passes unnoticed lies probably in its smallish size and usually thinner nature in comparison with the lines that compose the letter on which it stands. Yet the more careful observer will soon start to notice apices in the exhibits of any museum, not only in many of the more formal [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] inscriptions, but also in handwritten [[paleography|palaeographic]] documents. However, otherwise punctilious transcriptions of the material customarily overlook this diacritic.|date=August 2018}}

An apex is not used with the letter ''i''; rather, the letter is [[Long i|written taller]], as in {{sm|lv́ciꟾ·a·fꟾliꟾ}} (lūciī a fīliī) at left.

[[Image:Inscription displaying apices (from the shrine of the Augustales at Herculaneum).jpg|center|thumb|496px|Careful attention is needed to see the often extremely thin apices, as well as the sometimes minuscule difference in height of the longer I (as in {{sm|fꟾliꟾ}}): {{sm|avgvst'''ó'''·sacr· / a·a·l'''v́'''ci'''ꟾ'''·a·f'''ꟾ'''li'''ꟾ'''·men· / procvlvs·et·i'''v́'''li'''á'''nvs· / p · s · / d'''é'''dic'''á'''ti'''ó'''ne·decvri'''ó'''nibvs·et· / avgvst'''á'''libvs·c'''é'''nam·ded'''é'''rvnt}}. 1st century CE.]]

[[File:I littera in manuscripto.jpg|right|thumb|400px|In palæographic documents, mostly written in [[Roman cursive]], identifying the apices requires extra attention:&lt;br/&gt;''uobis · ujdetur · p · c · decern'''á'''m[us · ut · etiam]&lt;br/&gt;pr'''ó'''l'''á'''tis · rebus ijs · j'''ú'''dicibus · n[ecessitas · judicandi]&lt;br/&gt;impon'''á'''tur quj · jntr'''á''' rerum [· agendárum · dies]&lt;br/&gt;jncoh'''á'''ta · judicia · non · per[egerint · nec]&lt;br/&gt;defuturas · ignoro · fraudes · m[onstrósa · agentibus]&lt;br/&gt;multas · aduersus · quas · exc[ogitáuimus]...'']]

Other expedients, like a reduplication of the vowels, are attested in archaic epigraphy; but the apex is the standard vowel-length indication that was used in classical times and throughout the most flourishing period of the Roman education system. Its use is recommended by the best grammarians, like [[Quintilian]], who says that writing the apex is necessary when a difference of quantity in a vowel can produce a different meaning in a word, as in ''malus'' and ''málus'' or ''liber'' and ''líber'' or ''rosa'' and ''rosá''.&lt;ref&gt;Inst. 1,7,2s: ''adponere apicem ... interim necessarium, cum eadem littera alium atque alium intellectum, prout correpta vel producta est, facit: ut 'malus' arborem significet an hominem non bonum apice distinguitur, 'palus' aliud priore syllaba longa, aliud sequenti significat, et cum eadem littera nominativo casu brevis, ablativo longa est, utrum sequamur plerumque hac nota monendi sumus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Latin orthography, long vowels are sometimes marked by a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]], a sign that had always been used, and still is, to mark [[Meter (poetry)#Greek and Latin|metrically]] long ''syllables'' (more recently called [[Syllable weight#Classical poetry|''heavy'' syllables]]). To confuse matters further, the acute accent is sometimes used in Latin to mark stressed syllables, as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], when the macron is not used.

== Identification with the sicilicus ==

The apex is often contrasted with another ancient Latin diacritic, the [[sicilicus]], which is said to have been used above ''consonants'' to denote that they should be pronounced double. However, in his article ''Apex and Sicilicus'', [[Revilo P. Oliver]] argues that they are one and the same sign, a ''geminationis nota'', which was used over any letter to indicate that the letter should be read twice. The distinction between a sicilicus that was used above consonants and an apex that was applied to vowels is then completely artificial: “There is ''no'' example of this mark [the sicilicus] that can be distinguished from an apex by any criterion other than its presence above a letter that is not a long vowel.” “No ancient source says ''explicitly'' that there were two different signs; ...”. The presence of this sign, whatever its name, over a consonant is very scarcely attested.

If Revilo P. Oliver is right, the apex as a sign denoting vowel length would have its origin in the time when long vowels were written double. Then, when long vowels ceased to be regularly written twice, the usage of the sicilicus above vowels evidently remained, even after it fell out of use above consonants, and the apex, as it was now called, was redefined as a sign denoting the phonematic feature of vowel length, rather than as a purely orthographic shorthand.

However, Oliver's view that the two marks were identical has recently been challenged; see [[sicilicus]].

== Usage in Middle Vietnamese ==
[[File:Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum, breve acute apex.png|thumb|right|The entry for ''{{lang|vi|dĕóu᷄}}'' shows distinct breves (ĕ), acutes (ó), and apices (u᷄).]]
[[File:Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum, u-apex-acute.png|thumb|right|The entry for ''{{lang|vi|blu᷄́}}'' shows that a vowel with an apex can take on an additional tone mark, in this case an acute.]]
[[File:Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum, o-horn-apex.png|thumb|right|The entry for ''{{lang|vi|bao giơ᷄ đến}}'' illustrates the difference between a horn and an apex.]]

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the [[Vietnamese alphabet]] incorporated both acute and apex marks. The acute indicates [[Vietnamese language#Tones|rising tone]], while the apex marked final [[nasalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Portuguese Pioneers of Vietnamese Linguistics |first=Roland |last=Jacques |location=Bangkok |publisher=Orchid Press |year=2002 |page=91 |quote=The accent mark written by the amanuensis on the first word can be read as the ''apex'' (or ''tilde''), an abbreviation sign used in 17th and 18th century {{lang|vi|Quốc Ngữ}} to represent the rounded nasal finals: ‘{{lang|vi|-aõ}}’ (spelt today ‘{{lang|vi|-ong}}’); ‘{{lang|vi|-oũ}}’ (= ‘{{lang|vi|-ông}}’), and ‘{{lang|vi|-ũ}}’ (= ‘{{lang|vi|-ung}}’). Thus ‘{{lang|vi|chã}}’ would stand for the word presently spelt ‘{{lang|vi|chẳng}}.’}} Note that de Rhodes called the tilde a "[[circumflex]]".&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1651 ''{{lang|la|[[Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum]]}}'', [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] makes it clear that the apex is a distinct diacritic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ngữ Pháp Tiếng Việt của Đắc Lộ 1651|trans-title=De Rhodes's Vietnamese grammar of 1651 |author=Nguyễn Khắc Xuyên |location=[[Garden Grove, California]] |publisher=Thời điểm |year=1993 |oclc=32129692 |url=http://vantuyen.net/index.php?view=story&amp;subjectid=22131 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112002450/http://vantuyen.net/index.php?view=story&amp;subjectid=22131 |archivedate=November 12, 2011 |language=Vietnamese }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Về các dấu và dấu hiệu khác trên nguyên âm |title=Từ điển Annam-Lusitan-Latinh (Thường gọi Từ điển Việt-Bồ-La) |first=Alexandre |last=de Rhodes |editor1=Hồ Lê |editor2=Cao Xuân Hạo |editor3=Hồ Tuyết Mai |translator=Thanh Lãnh |translator2=Hoàng Xuân Việt |translator3=Đỗ Quang Chính |location=Ho Chi Minh City |publisher=[[Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences|Social Science Publishing House]] |year=1991 |origyear=1651 |page=11 |url=http://www.songhuong.com.vn/fullsize.php?id=53&amp;page=11.jpg |language=Vietnamese }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |title=Sự biến đổi các hình thức chữ quốc ngữ từ 1620 đến 1877|trans-title=Changes in the Vietnamese alphabet's form from 1629 to 1877 |type=&lt;abbr title="Phó tiến sĩ khoa học"&gt;PTSKH&lt;/abbr&gt; |author=Nguyễn Thị Bạch Nhạn |location=Hà Nội |publisher=[[Hanoi National University of Education]] |year=1994 |url=http://www.vns.edu.vn/vns/images/stories/Bai_NCKH/5_LeKhacCuong/7_lekhaccuong.pdf |format=PDF |language=Vietnamese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The third sign, finally, is the apex, which in this language is entirely necessary because of a difference in the ending [i.e. of a word], which the apex makes entirely distinct from the ending that ''m'' or ''n'' makes, with a meaning entirely diverse in words in which it is employed. However, this sign, namely the apex, only affects ''o᷄'' and ''u᷄'', at the end of a word, as ''{{lang|vi|ao᷄}}'' "bee", ''{{lang|vi|ou᷄}}'' "grandfather" or "lord". It is pronounced, however, such that neither the lips touch together nor the tongue touches the palate.|''{{lang|la|Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=De Accentibus &amp; aliis signis in vocalibus. |title=Dictionarium annamiticum lusitanicum, et latinum |first=Alexandre |last=de Rhodes |location=Rome |publisher=[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] |year=1651 |page=10 |url={{fullurl:File:Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum.pdf|page=500}} |language=Latin }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The apex appears atop {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}}, and less commonly {{angle bracket|ơ}}. As with other accent marks, a tone mark can appear atop the apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=cou᷄̀ la|work=Dictionarium annamiticum lusitanicum, et latinum |first=Alexandre |last=de Rhodes |location=Rome |publisher=[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] |year=1651 |page=135 |url={{fullurl:File:Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum.pdf|page=71}} |language=Latin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to canon law historian Roland Jacques, the apex indicated a final [[labial-velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ͡m/}}, an allophone of {{IPA|/ŋ/}} that is peculiar to the Hanoi dialect to the present day. The apex apparently fell out of use during the mid–18th century, being unified with {{angle bracket|-ng}} (representing {{IPA|/ŋ/}}), in a major simplification of the orthography, though the Vietnamese Jesuit {{lang|vi|[[Philipphê Bỉnh]]}} ({{lang|pt|Philiphê do Rosario}}) continued to use the old orthography into the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Le Portugal et la romanisation de la langue vietnamienne.

The Middle Vietnamese apex is known as ''{{lang|vi|dấu sóng}}'' or ''{{lang|vi|dấu lưỡi câu}}'' in modern Vietnamese. Though it has no official Unicode representation, one possible approximation is {{unichar|1dc4|Combining macron-acute|cwith=◌}}. The apex is often mistaken for a tilde in modern reproductions of early Vietnamese writing.

&lt;!-- "Brazilian German" is not a technical term but just a descriptive title. Therefore it need not appear in the first sentence and nothing needs to be bold. See first item of [[WP:LEADSENTENCE]]. Otherwise we would have a problem with original research. --&gt;
The '''[[German language|German]]-based varieties spoken by [[German Brazilians]]''' together form a significant [[minority language]] in [[Brazil]]. "Brazilian German" is strongly influenced by [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and to a lesser extent by [[Italian language|Italian]] dialects as well as indigenous languages. German dialects are particularly strong in Brazil's [[South Region, Brazil|South]] and [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] Regions. According to [[Ethnologue]], ca. 3 million people in Brazil speak [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]], 1.5 million [[Standard German]] and 8,000 [[Plautdietsch]].

German speakers from [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] make up the largest group of immigrants after [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] speakers. They tended to preserve their language longer than the speakers of Italian, which is closer to Portuguese. Consequently, German was the second most common family language in Brazil at the 1940 census. However, even in areas that are still dominated by German speakers, most are bilingual. Today, German is increasingly cultivated as a cultural heritage, and several municipalities have recently given co-official status with [[Brazilian Portuguese]] to one Brazilian variant or another of it.

[[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] is the most significant variant, and the term is sometimes used so as to include all forms of Brazilian German. It is particularly well represented in the two southernmost states, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. But especially in [[Espírito Santo]] there are significant pockets whose dialect is based on [[East Low German]] (East Pomeranian),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipol.org.br/ler.php?cod=224]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120132902/http://www.ipol.org.br/ler.php?cod=224|date=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="lerncafe.de"/&gt;  and some other dialects can be found locally due to 20th century immigration.

==Hunsrückisch==
{{main article|Riograndenser Hunsrückisch}}
Brazilian Hunsrückisch, a dialect of the [[High German languages|High German language]], is also referred to as ''Riograndenser Hunsrückisch'' (or ''Hunsrik'') after the country's southernmost state, [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. But it is also strongly represented in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], where the local variant is referred to as ''Katharinensisch'', and in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. Together, these three states form Brazil's [[South Region, Brazil|South Region]]. The area attracted significant immigration from German-speaking countries. Overall, it is particularly well developed in comparison to the rest of Brazil.

German immigration to Rio Grande do Sul started in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;Altenhofen, Cléo Vilson: Hunsrückisch in Rio Grande do Sul, Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart 1996, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The German workers and settlers came from many different regions, but especially from the poor regions [[Hunsrück]] and nearby [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]. The German dialects began to mix with each other, adopting elements of the languages spoken by other immigrants, to form varieties that differed from municipality to municipality, often from family to family, and which had no relation to the dialect lines in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Altenhofen, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in most places the Hunsrück dialect proved dominant.

Initially, the immigrants had to organize their own school system,&lt;ref&gt;Altenhofen, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; but this was to change.
Due to lack of exposure – from 1938 till 1961, German was not even taught at higher schools.&lt;ref&gt;Altenhofen, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; – Standard German became restricted to formal contexts such as church, whereas all daily interactions happened either in dialect or in Portuguese, from which the required words for innovations were also taken.&lt;ref&gt;Altenhofen, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers of Hunsrückisch are typically bilingual with Portuguese, but are not necessarily familiar with Standard German. The elementary school of [[Santa Maria do Herval]], a municipality in Rio Grande do Sul with a population of roughly 6,000, teaches Hunsrückisch and uses a new orthography for this which is closer to Portuguese than to Standard German conventions. However, linguists in Brazil criticize this detachment and demand a closer orthographic tie between Hunsrik and Standard German&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volksfreund.de/nachrichten/region/hochwald/aktuell/Heute-in-der-Hochwald-Zeitung-Brasilien-Hunsruecker-Platt-wird-zweite-Amtssprache;art804,3167479 |title=Brasilien: Hunsrücker Platt wird zweite Amtssprache |publisher=volksfreund.de |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6281">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''bǎ'' construction}}
The '''''bǎ'' construction''' is a [[Grammar|grammatical construction]] in the [[Chinese language]].  In a ''bǎ'' construction, the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a verb is placed after the [[function word]] {{zh|labels=no|c=把|hp=bă}} (or, in more formal writing, {{zh|labels=no|t=將|s=将|hp=jiāng}}), and the verb placed after the object, forming a [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) sentence.&lt;ref name="zheng2007"&gt;Zheng Ye, Weidong Zhan, Xiaolin Zhou (2007). "The semantic processing of syntactic structure in sentence comprehension: An ERP study." ''Brain Research'' 1142, pp. 135-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Linguistics|Linguists]] commonly analyze ''bǎ'' as a [[light verb]] construction,&lt;ref name="hornstein"&gt;[[Norbert Hornstein|Hornstein, Norbert]], Jairo Nunes, and Kleanthes K. Grohmann (2005).  ''Understanding Minimalism''. New York: Cambridge University Press. pp. 99&amp;ndash;100.&lt;/ref&gt; or as a [[preposition]].&lt;ref name="zheng2007"/&gt;

==Formation==
Charles Li and Sandra Thompson (1981) offer the following examples of the ''bǎ'' construction:&lt;ref&gt;Li &amp; Thompson (1981), pp. 463&amp;ndash;464.  The glosses have been modified to be legible to non-specialists.  "CRS" stands for Current Relevant State, a special discourse feature possibly marked by the [[sentence-final particle]] {{zh|labels=no|c=了|hp=le}} in Chinese; "CL" stands for "[[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifier]]," a kind of word used for counting in Chinese.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The ''bǎ'' construction may only be used in certain contexts, generally those in which the verb expresses "settlement" of, or action upon, the object.&lt;ref name="zheng2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="li468"&gt;Li &amp; Thompson (1981), p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zheng2006"&gt;Zheng Ye, Yue-jia Luo, Angela D. Friederici, and Xiaolin Zhou (2006). "Semantic and syntactic processing in Chinese sentence comprehension: Evidence from event-related potentials." ''Brain Research'' 1071, pp. 186-196.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Wang Li, "the disposal form states how a person is handled, manipulated, or dealt with; how something is disposed of; or how an affair is conducted,"&lt;ref&gt;Wang Li (1947). {{lang|zh|中国现代语法}} ''(Modern Chinese Grammar)''.  Shanghai: Zhonghua Shuju.  Translation by Charles Li (1974), "Historical Change of Word Order: A Case Study in Chinese and Its Implications." Quoted in Li &amp; Thompson (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; or, in other words, "what happens to" the object.&lt;ref name="li468"/&gt;  Therefore, it is generally used with verbs that are high in [[transitivity (grammatical category)|transitivity]],&lt;ref name="zheng2007"/&gt; a property that describes the effect a verb has on its object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/413757 | last=Hopper | first=Paul J. | authorlink=Paul Hopper |author2=Sandra A. Thompson |authorlink2=Sandra Thompson (linguist)  | title=Transitivity in Grammar and Discourse | journal=Language | volume=56 | issue=2 |date=June 1980 | pages=251–299 | jstor=413757}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''bǎ'' does not occur grammatically with verbs that express states or emotions, such as "love" and "miss," or with verbs that express activities that have no effect on the direct object, such as "sing" and "see."&lt;ref name="li467"&gt;Li &amp; Thompson (1981), p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct object of a ''bǎ'' construction must meet certain requirements as well.  It is usually definite, meaning that it is specific and unique (as in phrases beginning with the equivalent of ''this'', ''that'', ''these'', or ''those'').&lt;ref name="zheng2006"/&gt; It may sometimes also be generic, such as "salt" in the sentence "She sometimes eats salt thinking it's sugar."&lt;ref name="li465"&gt;Li &amp; Thompson (1981). p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a ''bǎ'' construction is nearly always something that both the speaker and hearer know about and are aware of.&lt;ref name="li465"/&gt;

==Research==
Because of the numerous constraints on the kinds of words that may be used in ''bǎ'' construction, this construction has often been used in studies on language processing and on grammaticality judgments of native speakers.  For example, sentences with ''bǎ'' construction that have [[Syntax|syntactic]] violations (such as ''bǎ'' being followed by a verb rather than a noun) and [[Semantics|semantic]] violations (such as ''bǎ'' being followed by a verb that doesn't express "disposal") have been used to study the interaction of syntactic and semantic processing in the brain using the [[neuroimaging]] technique of [[Event-related potential|ERP]],&lt;ref name="zheng2006"/&gt; and to evaluate [[construction grammar]]'s model of meaning-building.&lt;ref name="zheng2007"/&gt;

The term chaperome was first coined in a 2006 publication in Cell by Balch and co-workers on the finding that down-regulation of the Hsp90 co-chaperone Aha1 rescues misfolding of CFTR in cystic fibrosis to describe the overall chaperone folding environment, or the "chaperome".&lt;ref name =Wang&gt;{{cite journal | pmid= 17110338  |vauthors=Wang X, etal | title=Hsp90 cochaperone Aha1 down regulation rescues misfolding of CFTR in cystic fibrosis| journal=Cell| volume=127 |issue=4 | date=2006 |pages=803–15 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.09.043}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Brehme and co-workers systematically studied the expression dynamics of the full human chaperome comprising ~300 human chaperones and co-chaperones in human aging brains and in brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

Recently, a comprehensive literature survey reviewed the literature since the release of the human genome sequence in 2000 for systematic studies in small animal model systems and highlighted the power of model systems to unveil those key chaperone modifiers of proteotoxicity out of the large number represented in the wider human chaperome that could inform targets and strategies for therapeutic regulation of chaperone functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Brehme M, Voisine C | title=Model systems of protein-misfolding diseases reveal chaperone modifiers of proteotoxicity| journal=Dis Model Mech.| volume=9 | issue=8| pages=823–38| date=2016 | pmid= 27491084 | pmc = 5007983 | doi=10.1242/dmm.024703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circular definition of circular definition.png|thumb|Circular definition of "circular definition"]]

A '''circular definition''' is one that uses the [[terminology|term]](s) being defined as a part of the [[definition]] or assumes a prior understanding of the term being defined. There are several kinds of circular definition, and several ways of characterising the term: pragmatic, lexicographic and linguistic.

==Approaches to characterizing circular definitions==

===Pragmatic===

From a pragmatic point of view, circular definitions may be characterised in terms of new, useful or helpful information: A definition is deficient if the audience must either already know the meaning of the key term, or if the term to be defined is used in the definition itself. Such definitions lead to a need for additional information that motivated someone to look at the definition in the first place and, thus, violate the principle of providing new or useful information.&lt;ref&gt;Wierzbicka, A. ''Semantics: Primes and Universals''. Oxford University Press: 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some examples:

* Suppose we define "[[oak]]" as a [[tree]] which has [[catkin]]s and grows from an acorn, and then define "acorn" as the [[nut (fruit)|nut]] produced by an oak tree. To someone who does not know which trees are oaks, nor which nuts are acorns, the definition is inadequate.
* If someone wants to know what a [[cellular phone]] is, telling them that it is a "phone that is cellular" will not be especially illuminating. Much more helpful would be to explain the concept of a cell in the context of telecommunications, or at least to make some reference to portability.
* Similarly, defining [[dialectical materialism]] as "materialism that involves dialectic" is unhelpful.

Consequently, when constructing systems of definitions, authors should use good practices that avoid producing viciously circular definitions. In many learner's dictionaries, circular definitions are greatly reduced by writing definitions using only the words in a constrained [[defining vocabulary]].&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, D. 'NSM + LDOCE: A Non-Circular Dictionary of English', ''International Journal of Lexicography'', 24/2, 2011: 226-240&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lexicographic===

From a lexicographic point of view, the simplest form of circular definition in a dictionary is in terms of synonyms, and the number of steps for closing the definition chain into a circle is known as the ''depth'' of the circular definition: the circular definition "object: a thing" → "thing: an object" is a circular definition with a depth of two. The circular definition "object: a thing" → "thing: an entity" → "entity: an object" has a depth of three.

The classic "genus-difference" dictionary definition is in terms of nearest kind (''genus proximum'') and specific differences (''differentia specifica''). This genus-difference description may be involved in producing circular definitions of part and kind relationships, for example: "rake: an implement with three or more tines" → "tine: a part of a rake". However, if more specific differences are added, then the effect of circularity may disappear: "rake: a gardening implement with a long handle with three or more tines arranged on crossbar at 90° to the handle and the tines at 90° to both crossbar and handle"; in this case, "tine" is most usefully defined with reference to "rake", but with additional differences providing points of comparison, e.g.: "tine: a sharp spike at the end of a rake". In practice, a pragmatic approach is often taken in considering the effects of circularity in dictionary definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, B. and M. Rundell. ''The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography''. Oxford University Press: 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic===

From a linguistic point of view, some intuitively circular definitions in the [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] of words can easily be shown to be non-circular. For example, sometimes a definition like "musicality: the quality or state of being musical" is said to be circular. But strictly speaking, the condition "the [[terminology|term]](s) being defined as a part of the [[definition]] or assumes a prior understanding of the term being defined" is false in this case. The definition chain "musicality: the quality or state of being musical" → "musical: associated with music" → "music: an acoustic art form" is a two-step derivation of the word "musicality" from the root "music", where the chain ends. A definition chain which ends is not circular. It may be objected that the term to be defined and one of the difference terms in the definition share the same root; the answer is that the objection requires prior analysis of the terms in order to identify identical parts, yet the terms themselves cannot be reduced to these parts: the meaning of "musicality" is composed of the meaning of "musical" and the meaning of "ity", the meaning of "musical" is composed of the meaning of "music" and "al". In each case, the terms to be defined and the terms in the definition are different.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Mathematical===

Formal approaches to characterizing circular definitions are found in [[logic]], [[mathematics]] and in [[computer science]]. A branch of mathematics called [[non-well-founded set theory]] allows for the construction of circular sets. Circular sets are good for modelling cycles and, despite the field's name, this area of mathematics is well founded. (The sets ''themselves'', not the branch of mathematics that ''deals'' with them, are not well-founded.) [[Computer science]] allows for procedures to be defined by using [[recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. Such definitions are not circular as long as they terminate.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Circular lexicographic (dictionary) definitions==

{{+rs|date=March 2016}}

Dictionary entries are often given as examples of apparent circular definitions. Dictionary production, as a project in [[lexicography]], should not be confused with a [[mathematical]] or [[logical]] activity, where giving a definition for a word is similar to providing an [[explanans]] for an [[explanandum]] in a context where practitioners are expected to use a [[deductive system]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Silverstein (2006). "[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123327?journalCode=anthro Old Wine, New Ethnographic Lexicography]". ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 35:486-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seargeant/&gt; While, from a [[linguistic prescriptivist]] perspective, any [[dictionary]] might be believed to dictate correct usage, the [[linguistic descriptivist]] perspective recognizes that looking up words in dictionaries is not itself a rule-following practice independent of the give-and-take of using words in context.&lt;ref name=Seargeant&gt;Philip Seargeant, "Lexicography as a Philosophy of Language". ''Language Sciences'', 33:1-10 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the example of a definition of oak given above (something that has catkins and grows from acorns) is not completely useless, even if "acorn" and "catkin" are defined in terms of "oak", in that it supplies additional concepts (e.g., the concept of catkin) in the definition. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

While a dictionary might produce a "circle" among the terms, "oak", "catkin", and "acorn", each of these is used in different {{clarify|reason="definition"or "context"?|text=contexts|date=March 2016}} (e.g., those related to plants, trees, flowers, and seeds) that generate ever-branching networks of usages. In another case it might produce a true circle. Taken as a whole, dictionaries are circular because each and every word is defined in terms of words that are also contained within the dictionary.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} ({{clarify|text=A person could not pick up a (foreign) dictionary and make any sense of it unless they already know the meaning of a minimal subset of a number of words without having the need to refer to the dictionary for said meaning.|date=March 2016}})

{{clarify|reason=needs elaboration; the concept of "circularity" is not evident in this sentence|text=A circular definition crept into the classic definition of death that was once "the permanent cessation of the flow of vital bodily fluids", which raised the question "what makes a fluid vital?"&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch, Gail (2005). ''Euthanasia, Choice and Death'', p.8. Edinburgh University. {{ISBN|9780748618811}}.&lt;!--Quotes or paraphrases [[Peter Singer]].--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;|date=March 2016}}

Definitions in lexicography can be broadly or narrowly circular. Narrowly circular definitions simply define one word in terms of another. A broadly circular definition has a larger circle of words. For example, the definition of the primary word is defined using two other words, which are defined with two other words, etc., creating a definitional chain. This can continue until the primary word is used to define one of the words used in the chain, closing the wide circle of terms. If all definitions rely on the definitions of other words in a very large, but finite chain, then all text-based definitions are ultimately circular. [[Extension (semantics)]] to the actual things that referring terms like nouns stand for, provided that agreement on reference is accomplished, is one method of breaking this circularity, but this is outside the capacity of a text-based definition.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Examples of narrowly circular definitions in dictionaries==

&lt;!--This material needs SECONDARY sources, not primary ones!--&gt;

The 2007 Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a "hill" and a "mountain" this way:

: hill - "1: a usually rounded natural elevation of land '''lower than a mountain'''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hill "hill"]. [[Merriam-Webster]]. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
: mountain - "1a: a landmass that projects conspicuously above its surroundings and is '''higher than a hill'''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/mountain "mountain"]. Merriam-Webster. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merriam-Webster's online dictionary provides another example of a circular definition with the words "condescending" and "patronizing:"

: Main Entry: condescending&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condescending "condescending"]. Merriam-Webster. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
: Function: adjective
: 1 : showing or characterized by condescension : patronizing

This definition alone is close to suffering from circular definition, but following the definition train:

: Main Entry: condescension&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condescension "condescension"]. Merriam-Webster. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
: Function: noun
: 1 : voluntary descent from one's rank or dignity in relations with an inferior
: 2 : '''patronizing attitude''' or behavior

Looking up the word "patronizing" then gives us:

: Main Entry: patronize&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patronizing "patronizing"]. Merriam-Webster. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
: Function: transitive verb
: 1 : to act as patron of : provide aid or support for
: 2 : '''to adopt an air of condescension toward''' : treat haughtily or coolly

The following definition of the adjective "inspiring" appears to be a circular definition, but in the phrase "effect of inspiring someone", the word "inspiring" is actually the inflected verb "inspire", which is defined without using the adjective "inspiring":

: inspiring (adjective) - having the effect of inspiring someone&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/inspiring "inspiring"]. Oxford Dictionary. Retrieved August 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
: inspire (verb) - fill (someone) with the urge or ability to do or feel something, especially to do something creative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/inspire#inspire__2 "inspire"]. Oxford Dictionary. Retrieved August 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6987">'''"A dingo ate my baby"''' is a phrase attributed to [[Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton]] and also to [[Meryl Streep]]'s depiction of Chamberlain in the movie ''[[A Cry in the Dark]]'' (1988){{snd}}also known as ''Evil Angels''{{snd}}about the [[death of Azaria Chamberlain]], an Australian baby girl who died in 1980 at [[Uluru]] in the [[Northern Territory]].  The Chamberlain family had been holidaying at Uluru when their daughter was taken from their tent by a [[dingo]].  The authorities disbelieved the family's story about a dingo, and prosecuted and won convictions against Lindy Chamberlain for murder and against her then-husband [[Michael Chamberlain]] as an accessory after the fact. Ultimately, the courts found both parents innocent after being sent to court three different times, and the coroner found Azaria's death was "the result of being attacked and taken by a dingo".&lt;ref name=inq4&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquest into the death of Azaria Chantel Loren Chamberlain [2012] NTMC 020|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/justice/courtsupp/coroner/findings/other/chamberlain_findings.pdf|work=[[Coroners Court of the Northern Territory]]|publisher=Northern Territory Government of Australia|format=PDF|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "A dingo ate my baby" was not actually used by Chamberlain, nor is it used in the film. Chamberlain is reported to have called out to her husband, "A dingo took my baby!",&lt;ref name="exploreEvidence"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/schools/classroom_resources/chamberlain/full_colour/files/34252/NMA-Chamberlain.pdf |title=Using the Chamberlain Case to explore evidence in history |accessdate=2014-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611160243/http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/schools/classroom_resources/chamberlain/full_colour/files/34252/NMA-Chamberlain.pdf |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df= }}, National Museum of Australia, p. 7, 2001.

[[File:Domino theory.svg|thumb|350px|An illustration of the domino theory as it had been predicted]]

The '''domino theory''' was a theory prominent from the 1950s to the 1980s that posited that if one country in a region came under the influence of  [[communism]], then the surrounding countries would follow in a '''[[domino effect]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leeson|first1=Peter T.|last2=Dean|first2=Andrea|title=The Democratic Domino Theory|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=2009|volume=53|issue=3|pages=533–551|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domino theory was used by successive United States administrations during the [[Cold War]] to justify the need for [[Overseas interventions of the United States|American intervention]] around the world.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] described the theory during an April 7, 1954, news conference, when referring to communism in [[Indochina]]:

{{quote|Finally, you have broader considerations that might follow what you would call the "falling domino" principle.

In 1949, a Communist-backed government, led by [[Mao Zedong]], was instated in China (officially becoming the [[China|People's Republic of China]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mao-zedong-outlines-the-new-chinese-government | title =Mao Zedong outlines the new Chinese government | publisher =[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] | date =December 5, 2013 | access-date =2013-12-05 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131102093822/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mao-zedong-outlines-the-new-chinese-government# | archive-date =2013-11-02 | dead-url =no | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation of the new government was established after the [[People's Liberation Army]] defeated the [[Nationalist government|Nationalist Republican Government of China]] in the aftermath of the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927-1949).&lt;ref name="ChineseRev"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev | title =The Chinese Revolution of 1949 | publisher =[[United States Department of State]] [[Office of the Historian]], [[Bureau of Public Affairs]] | access-date =2017-06-14 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170519004017/https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev# | archive-date =2017-05-19 | dead-url =no | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Chinas were formed - mainland 'Communist China' (People's Republic of China) and 'Nationalist China' Taiwan ([[Taiwan|Republic of China]]). The takeover by Communists of the world's most populous nation was seen in the West as a great strategic loss, prompting the popular question at the time, "Who lost China?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n3oay_KTHwoC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zJEMhUw3FQ&amp;sig=Hv-UEoi7Otexk7nArwaotvulO9E&amp;hl=en#PPA230,M1 Rogue Regimes: Terrorism and Proliferation, pg. 230], Raymond Tanter, Macmillan, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The United States subsequently ended diplomatic relations with China in response to the communist takeover in 1949.&lt;ref name ="ChineseRev"/&gt;

[[Korea]] had also partially fallen under Soviet domination at the end of World War II, split from the south of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] where U.S. forces subsequently moved into. By 1948, as a result of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepting the border as permanent. In 1950 fighting broke out between Communists and Republicans that soon involved troops from China (on the Communists' side), and the United States and 15 allied countries (on the Republicans' side). Though the [[Korean War|war]] never officially ended, the fighting ended in 1953 with an [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] that left Korea divided into two nations, [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]].
Mao Zedong's decision to take on the U.S. in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War.

President Eisenhower was the first to refer to countries in danger of Communist takeover as dominoes, in response to a journalist's question about Indochina in an April 7, 1954 news conference, though he did not use the term "domino theory".&lt;ref&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower: "[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=10202 The President's News Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033903/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=10202# |date=2017-12-01 }}," April 7, 1954. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, ''The Presidency Project.'' Retrieved 28 Nov. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; If Communists succeeded in taking over the rest of Indochina, Eisenhower argued, local groups would then have the encouragement, material support and momentum to take over [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Indonesia]]; all of these countries had large popular Communist movements and insurgencies within their borders at the time.

In May 1954, the [[Viet Minh]], a Communist and nationalist army, defeated French troops in the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] and took control of what became [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/asiapacific-region/french-indochinavietnam-1941-1954/ | title =11.

This would give them a geographical and economic strategic advantage, and it would make Japan, [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], Australia, and New Zealand the front-line defensive states. The loss of regions traditionally within the vital regional trading area of countries like Japan would encourage the front-line countries to compromise politically with communism.

Eisenhower's domino theory of 1954 was a specific description of the situation and conditions within [[Southeast Asia]] at the time, and he did not suggest a generalized domino theory as others did afterward.

The [[John F. Kennedy]] administration intervened in Vietnam in the early 1960s to, among other reasons, keep the South Vietnamese "domino" from falling. When Kennedy came to power there was concern that the communist-led [[Pathet Lao]] in Laos would provide the [[Viet Cong]] with bases, and that eventually they could take over Laos.

==Arguments in favor of the domino theory==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}
The primary evidence for the domino theory is the spread of communist rule in three Southeast Asian countries in 1975, following the [[Vietnam War|communist takeover of Vietnam]]: South Vietnam (by the Viet Cong), Laos (by the Pathet Lao), and Cambodia (by the [[Khmer Rouge]]). It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia.  Note the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the [[Philippines]], and the increasing involvement with [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communists]] by [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967.  All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.

[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] and the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Kuan Yew |date=2000 |title=From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=467,573 |isbn=0-06-019776-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that "there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs. But we have to have the jobs if we are to stop Communism. We have done that, moving from simple to more complex skilled labor. If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia."&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975(Gerald Ford Library)(1553067).pdf|Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975 (Gerald Ford Library)]], pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McGeorge Bundy]] argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed]] via CIA-supported death squads in the Indonesian genocide.  However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e. Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.

Some supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the [[Viet Minh]], the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory.  The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia]], especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.

Linguist and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called "people's movements" in [[Chile]], Vietnam, [[Nicaragua]], Laos, [[Grenada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], etc. "The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'" Chomsky refers to this as the "threat of a good example".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm "The Threat of a Good Example"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724125605/http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm# |date=2015-07-24 }}, [[Noam Chomsky]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==
[[Michael Lind]] has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] regimes came to power in [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Cape Verde]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[Nicaragua]] during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the "prestige" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.

In this vein, Argentine revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] wrote an essay, the "Message to the Tricontinental", in 1967, calling for "two, three ... many Vietnams" across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm "Rough Draft of History: 'All Right, Let's Get the  @#!*%  Out of Here'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126071737/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}, Richard Gott, August 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Max Boot]] wrote, "In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua. American hostages were seized aboard the SS ''Mayaguez'' (off Cambodia) and in Tehran. The [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan]]. There is no obvious connection with the Vietnam War, but there is little doubt that the defeat of a superpower encouraged our enemies to undertake acts of aggression that they might otherwise have shied away from."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567 "Another Vietnam?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709153053/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567# |date=2017-07-09 }}, Max Boot, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', August 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, this theory can be further bolstered by the rise in terrorist incidents by left-wing terrorist groups in Western Europe, funded in part by Communist governments, between the 1960s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |title=KGB Active Measures |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629193045/https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |title=Red Army Faction |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629203451/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |title=Brigate Rosse |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629232055/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, this includes the kidnapping and assassination of former Italian Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]], and the kidnapping of former US Brigadier General [[James L. Dozier]], by the [[Red Brigades]].

In West Germany, this includes the terrorist actions of the [[Red Army Faction]]. In the far east the [[Japanese Red Army]] carried out similar acts. All four, as well as others worked with various Arab and Palestinian terrorists, which like the red brigades were backed by the Soviet Bloc.

In the 1977 [[The Nixon Interviews|Frost/Nixon interviews]], [[Richard Nixon]] defended America's destabilization of the [[Salvador Allende]] regime in Chile on domino theory grounds.  Borrowing a metaphor he had heard, he stated that a Communist Chile and [[Cuba]] would create a "red sandwich" that could entrap Latin America between them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5mUrNoWa7J0C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=Chile%2Bcuba%2Bred+sandwich&amp;source=web&amp;ots=495XIVdXHA&amp;sig=-Cxk0QCxL6Ab82RqdR_fJINZ2mg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result The Last Years of the Monroe Doctrine, 1945-1993, p. 133] Gaddis Smith&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, the domino theory was used again to justify the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]'s interventions in Central America and the [[Invasion of Grenada|Caribbean region]].

In his memoirs, former [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Rhodesian Prime Minister]] [[Ian Smith]] described the successive rise of authoritarian left-wing governments in Sub-Saharan Africa during [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonization]] as "the communists' domino tactic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith|Bitter Harvest: Zimbabwe and the Aftermath of Its Independence]] |last=Smith |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Smith |year=2008 |publisher=[[John Blake Publishing]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84358-548-0 |page=280 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of pro-communist governments in [[Tanzania]] (1961–64) and [[Zambia]] (1964) and explicitly Marxist–Leninist governments in Angola (1975), Mozambique (1975), and eventually [[Rhodesia]] itself (in 1980)&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2008: 147&lt;/ref&gt; are cited by Smith as evidence of "the insidious encroachment of Soviet imperialism down the continent".&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2008: 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Some foreign policy analysts in the United States have referred to the potential spread of both Islamic theocracy and liberal democracy in the Middle East as two different possibilities for a domino theory. During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] the United States and other western nations supported [[Ba'athist Iraq]], fearing the spread of Iran's radical theocracy throughout the region. In the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], some [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]]s argued that when a democratic government is implemented, it would then help spread democracy and [[liberalism]] across the Middle East. This has been referred to as a "reverse domino theory,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2080976/nav/navoa/ "The War and the Peace"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624135941/http://www.slate.com/id/2080976/nav/navoa/# |date=2007-06-24 }}, Robert Wright, ''Slate'', April 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; or a "democratic domino theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Paul|title=The 'democratic domino' theory|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2935969.stm|agency=BBC News|date=April 10, 2003|access-date=2016-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003074026/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2935969.stm#|archive-date=2016-10-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so called because its effects are considered positive, not negative, by Western democratic states.

[[File:Do not disturb.svg|right|thumb|150px|''Do not disturb'' door sign]]
A '''door hanger''' (also spelled '''''doorhanger''''' or '''''door-hanger''''') is a [[plastic]] or [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] sign, generally rectangular in shape, cut to hang from the handle or knob of a [[door]].   They are sometimes used to distribute print [[advertising]] to residences.  Door hangers are often seen in [[hotel]]s and other places of lodging as a means for guests to communicate with maintenance and housekeeping staff.

== Other meanings ==

In computer [[user interface]] design, a "doorhanger" notification is a sort of pop-up panel that "hangs" from another user interface element, typically an icon in the tool bar.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://bsdpower.com/modern-design-abominations-firefox-doorhanger-notifications/ here] for an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

One common place where do not disturb signs are used is in [[hotel|places of lodging]], where guests can place these signs on the door in order to inform staff, including [[Maid service|housekeeping]], to respect their [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/29/TRVA11DNES.DTL |title=As hotels squeeze cleaning staff, guests get caught in the middle. How to make sure your housekeeping needs get met |first=Christopher |last=Elliott |date=June 29, 2008 |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hotels also provide "make up room" signs giving the opposite instructions.

They are also used in schools to let other staff members and students at the school know that testing is in progress in the particular classroom.

Do not disturb signs can also be used by those who keep valuables in their rooms in order to deter possible thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoVKSXBTzwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22do+not+disturb+sign%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html |title=Importers manual USA. |volume=4 |author1=Edward G. Hinkelman |author2=Myron Manley |author3=James L. Nolan |author4=Karla C. Shippey |author5=Wendy Bidwell |author6=Alexandra Woznick |page=46 |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==
In multiple cases, a ''do not disturb'' sign on the door of a hotel room has been blamed for concealing a [[homicide]], suspicious death, or other [[criminal activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-06-26-3285533780_x.htm |title=Warrant: Body of pregnant soldier found in tub |first=Kevin |last=Maurer |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/104279/Hotel-do-not-disturb-sign-hid-murder |title=Hotel 'Do not Disturb' sign hid murder |publisher=Express.co.uk |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/18730289.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910134044/http://www.startribune.com/local/18730289.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 September 2012 |title=Hotel 'do not disturb' sign hid murder |date=30 May 2009 |first=Chris |last=Riches |publisher=[[Star Tribune]] |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a ''do not disturb'' sign was blamed for concealing the disappearance of an elderly couple on a cruise ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/17/national/main4730518.shtml |title=Elderly Couple Disappears On Cruise Ship |date=January 17, 2009 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, mass murderer [[Stephen Paddock]] kept a "do not disturb" sign on his hotel room door, concealing ten suitcases with a stockpile of rifles and ammunition he used to commit the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]].

== Alternatives  ==
[[File:Electronic Do Not Disturb Sign as seen at Loews Miami Beach Hotel.jpg|thumb|alt=A Electronic Do Not Disturb|An electronic "do not disturb" indicator (the illuminated red lamp is a signal to hotel staff).]]
Some hotels are using high-tech means to replace paper do not disturb signs that hang on the door. One example is a privacy button that one can press from within the room to light up an indicator outside the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/09/1210131215154.html |title=From hotel rooms to hi-tech havens |date=May 9, 23008 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising ==
More recently, hotels have used the do not disturb signs as a way to brand themselves and provide inexpensive advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_travel_story_skin/476263?format=html |title=Catching ZZZZZZZZs a sign of the times |date=26 February 2005 |publisher=tvnz.co.nz |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projo.com/travel/content/projo_20050227_shush27x.1de18b8.html |title=Genius works behind 'do not disturb' sign |date=27 February 2005 |first=Amanda |last=Kingsbury |publisher=projo.com |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Embassy Suites]] ran a contest allowing the public to design do not disturb signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap_travel/20070917/ap_tr_ge/travel_brief_do_not_disturb |title= Make your own 'Do Not Disturb' sign|publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was announced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotelchatter.com/story/2008/2/18/102222/497/hotels/The_Disturbing_Results_of_Embassy_Suites_Do_Not_Disturb_Sign_Contest |title=The disturbin results of Embassy Suites 'Do Not Disturb' sign |publisher=hotelchatter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Door Hangers are also used in competition with direct mail as an advertising vehicle. Most recently, companies providing this type of advertising have been using the term Direct to Door Advertising. This type of advertising offers a number of advantages over traditional direct mail in that the impression is "guaranteed". The home owner must handle the piece and typically on a door hanger there is just one advertising message giving the advertiser great exposure.&lt;ref&gt;http://marketing.allovermedia.com/door-hanger-infographic&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of advertising is used by national brands and local companies to help drive traffic into their stores, increase trial by offering a sample, and to increase their brand awareness. This method of delivery can often be more cost effective and with today's technology, the delivery of the pieces is completely trackable by integrating GPS and photos into the Proof of Performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aapsinc.org/members-only-section/doorhangers-are-simply-better/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220458/http://aapsinc.org/members-only-section/doorhangers-are-simply-better/ |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dura''' is a recently extinct language of [[Nepal]]. It has been classified in the [[Ladakhi language|West Bodish]] branch of [[Tibetan languages]], though more recent work separates it out as an independent branch of [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kraayenbrink et al., "Language and Genes of the Greater Himalayan Region", preprint, http://www.le.ac.uk/genetics/maj4/Himalayan_OMLLreport.pdf, retrieved September 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Dura have switched to speaking [[Nepali language|Nepali]], and the Dura language has sometimes been thought to be extinct. Some of the people who have switched to Nepali for their daily speech still use Dura for prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Van Driem, George. ''Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the Greater Himalayan Region'', Brill Academic Publishers 2002 ({{ISBN|978-9004103900}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Himalayan Languages Project]] is working on recording additional knowledge of Dura.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/himalaya/?q=description Programme Description | Himalayan Languages Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729025723/http://www.iias.nl/himalaya/?q=description |date=2007-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Around 1,500 words and 250 sentences in Dura have been recorded.  The last known speaker of the language was the 82-year-old Soma Devi Dura.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7189898.stm | title = The last of Nepal's Dura speakers | work = [[BBC News]] | date = January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Schorer (2016:293)&lt;ref name="Schorer"&gt;Schorer, Nicolas. 2016. ''The Dura Language: Grammar and Phylogeny''. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; classifies Dura as part of his newly proposed [[Greater Magaric]] branch.

==Distribution==
The ethnic Dura people mostly live in [[Lamjung District]], with some in neighboring [[Tanahu District]] of [[Gandaki Zone]] in central Nepal.&lt;ref name="nefin"&gt;[http://www.nefin.org.np/content/view/36/42 Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities (NEFIN) - Dura&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013406/http://www.nefin.org.np/content/view/36/42 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They mostly live on farms in the hilly countryside.&lt;ref name="nefin"/&gt; Different recent census counts have reported the number of Dura people anywhere from 3,397 to 5,676.&lt;ref name="nefin"/&gt;

Dura villages include:&lt;ref name="Schorer"/&gt;

{{div col end}}

Other ethnic groups in the Dura region include the Gurung, Brahmins, Chetrīs, Kāmī, and Damāi.&lt;ref name="Schorer"/&gt;

==Tandrange==
A closely related language variety called ''[[Tandrange language|Tandrange]]'' (Nepali: Tāndrāṅe; IPA: tandraŋe) is spoken in a few [[Gurung language|Gurung]] villages.&lt;ref name="Schorer"/&gt; Tandrange is spoken in the villages of [[Tandrang, Lamjung|Tāndrāṅ]] तान्द्राङ, Pokharī Thok पोखरी थोक, and Jītā जीता. However, Tandrange speakers adamantly consider themselves as not related to the stigmatized Dura people.&lt;ref name="Schorer"/&gt;

==Reconstruction==
Schorer (2016:286-287) reconstructs the following Proto-Dura words.
* *hāyu ‘blood’
* *cʰiũŋ ‘cold’
* *kim ‘house’
* *ti ‘water’
* *krut ‘hand’
* *kyu ‘stomach’
* *yāku ‘night’
* *mamī ‘sun’
* *lām- ‘path’
* *luŋ ‘stone’
* *daŋ- ‘to see’
* *rā- ‘to come’
* *khāC- ‘to go’
* *yʱā ‘to give’
* *cʰi- ‘to say’

==Vocabulary==
Schorer (2016:126-127) provides the following 125-word [[Swadesh list]] of Dura.

Rabbi '''Elazar ben Moshe Azikri''' ({{lang-he|אלעזר בן משה  אזכרי&amp;lrm;}}) (1533–1600) was a Jewish [[kabbalist]], [[poet]] and [[writer]], born in [[Safed]] to a [[Sephardic]] family who had settled in the [[Land of Israel]] after the expulsion from [[Spain]].

[[Rabbi]] Elazar studied [[Torah]] under [[Rabbi]] Yosef Sagis and Rabbi [[Jacob Berab]], and is counted with the greatest Rabbis and intellectuals of his time: [[Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz]], [[Yosef Karo]], [[Moshe Cordovero]], [[Isaac Luria]], [[Israel Najara]], etc.

In 1588 Rabbi Elazar founded the "Sukat Shalom" movement who acted to arouse in Jews the devotion to religion.

Rabbi Elazar died in 1600 and was buried in Safed.

==Works==
Rabbi Elazar's Book, the ''Sefer Haredim'' (ספר חרדים), printed after his death in 1600, is considered as one of the main books of Jewish [[deontology]].

He also wrote a commentary on ''Tractate Bezah''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/progs/tal/isfrancus/index.shtml |title=Dr. Israel Francus |accessdate=2007-08-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040413041508/http://www.jtsa.edu/progs/tal/isfrancus/index.shtml |archivedate=April 13, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Berachot&lt;ref&gt;Printed in the Vilna Yerushalmi Brachot.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].

The ''[[Piyyut]]'' (liturgical poem) ''[[Yedid Nefesh]]'' (ידיד נפש) is commonly attributed to Rabbi Elazar, who first published it in his Sefer Haredim. Recent findings, however, have raised the possibility that ''[[Yedid Nefesh]]'' actually predates Rabbi Elazar by about a century, leaving the true authorship a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reif |first1=Stefan C. |title=The Hebrew Manuscripts at Cambridge University Libraries |date=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521583398 |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hebrew_Manuscripts_at_Cambridge_Universi.html?id=MDuYkcahsq8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''executive agency''' is a part of a government department that is treated as managerially and budgetarily separate, to carry out some part of the executive functions of the [[United Kingdom government]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]] or [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. Executive agencies are "machinery of government" devices distinct both from [[non-ministerial government department]]s and [[Non-departmental public body|non-departmental public bodies]] (or "[[quango]]s"), each of which enjoy a real legal and constitutional separation from ministerial control.  The model was also applied in several other countries.

==Size and scope==
Agencies&lt;ref name="agencies"&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130128101412/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ministerial_responsibilities/executive_agencies.aspx Cabinet Office - UK Government executive agencies (Archived Page, retrieved 29 August 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; range from [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]] to the [[DVLA|Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]]. The annual budget for each agency, allocated by [[Her Majesty's Treasury]] ranges from a few million pounds for the smallest agencies to £700m for the [[Her Majesty's Courts Service|Court Service]]. Virtually all government departments have at least one agency.

==Issues and reports==
The initial success or otherwise of executive agencies was examined in the Sir Angus Fraser's Fraser Report of 1991. Its main goal was to identify what good practices had emerged from the new model and spread them to other agencies and departments. The report also recommended further powers be devolved from ministers to chief executives.

A series of reports and [[white paper]]s examining governmental delivery were published throughout the 1990s, under both [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] governments. During these the agency model became the standard model for delivering public services in the United Kingdom. By 1997 76% of civil servants were employed by an agency. The new Labour government in its first such report &amp;ndash; the ''1998 Next Steps Report'' endorsed the model introduced by its predecessor. The most recent review (in 2002, linked below) made two central conclusions (their emphasis):

:"'''The agency model has been a success'''. Since 1988 agencies have transformed the landscape of government and the responsive and effectiveness of services delivered by Government."
:"'''Some agencies have, however, become disconnected from their departments ...''' The gulf between policy and delivery is considered by most to have widened."

The latter point is usually made more forcefully by Government critics, describing agencies as "unaccountable [[quango]]s".

==Other countries==

Several other countries have an executive agency model.

In the United States, the Clinton administration imported the model, but with a modification of the name to "performance-based organizations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Roberts, Alasdair]].  [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1309151 ''Performance-Based Organizations: Assessing the Gore Plan'']. Public Administration Review, Vol. 57, No. 6, pp. 465-478, December 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, executive agencies were adopted on a limited basis under the name "special operating agencies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Roberts, Alasdair]].  [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1309016 ''Public Works and Government Services: Beautiful Theory Meets Ugly Reality]. HOW OTTAWA SPENDS, G. Swimmer, ed., pp. 171-203 Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive agencies were also established in Australia, Jamaica, Japan and [[Tanzania]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2577">The phrase '''expletive deleted''' refers to [[profanity]] which has been censored by the author or by a subsequent censor, usually appearing in place of the profanity.  The phrase became popular after the [[Watergate scandal]].

Compelled by a subpoena to provide the contents of the White House taping system to the House Judiciary Committee in April 1974, President [[Richard Nixon]] ordered transcripts of the tapes to be prepared.  After a cursory inspection of the transcripts, Nixon, shocked at viewing several profanity-laced discussions amongst the White House's inner-circle, ordered that every use of profanity be replaced by "[EXPLETIVE DELETED]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002277.html Language Log]: Discussion of Nixon's use of profanity&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcripts were published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and elicited shock in much of the country, given Nixon's generally staid public image and the fact that contemporary media coverage of politicians did not usually report candidates' profanity use. As Nixon biographer [[Jonathan Aitken]] noted, Nixon had a rather broad view on what constituted profanity, and had ordered comparatively minor outbursts like ''[[Christ]]'' and ''[[hell]]'' to be replaced as expletives. Seeing the jarring phrase repeatedly within the transcripts seemed to give the public the impression that the words used were far harsher than what actually appeared on the tapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, Johnathan:  "Nixon, A Life" Page 515&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase entered the public imagination to the point where protesters outside the White House held up picket signs reading, "IMPEACH THE (EXPLETIVE DELETED)!"

In later years, the phrase became commonplace as an [[irony|ironic]] expression which indicates that a profanity has been omitted and passed into general usage as a convenient [[Natural language|linguistic]] [[figleaf]].

The term ''expletive'' is commonly used outside linguistics to refer to any bad language (or profanity), used with or without meaning. ''Expletives'' in this wide sense may be [[adjective]]s,  [[adverb]]s, [[noun]]s or, most commonly, [[interjection]]s, or (rarely) [[verb]]s. Within linguistics, an expletive always refers to a word without meaning, namely a [[syntactic expletive]] or [[expletive attributive]]. In this technical sense an expletive need not be rude.

'''Friedrich Wagenfeld''' (January 3, 1810 &amp;ndash; August 26, 1846) was a German [[philologist]] and author born in [[Bremen]].

==Life==
Wegenfeld was born in Bremen in 1810.&lt;ref name=ws&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Wagenfeld,_Friedrich&amp;ei=wZqkSffEE4yPngew5PyXBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Bremer%2BVolkssagen%2522%2BWagenfeld%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG Wikisource] translated biography @ [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1829 to 1832 Wegenfeld studied [[philology]] in [[Göttingen]], and subsequently spent several years serving as a tutor in [[Brinkum]]. He lived and worked as a writer in Bremen, where he died on August 26, 1846 at the age of 36.&lt;ref name=ws/&gt;

Wagenfeld was the author a popular collection of Bremen [[Folklore|folk tales]] titled ''Bremer Volkssagen'' (1844–45). In 1837 he published what purportedly was the entire text of [[Philo of Byblos]]' ''[[Sanchoniathon]]'', allegedly found in the Portuguese convent of Santa Maria de Merinhão. This publication, however, was soon afterwards proven by several scholars to be a fabrication.&lt;ref name=farrer&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrer|first=James Anson|title=Literary Forgeries|date=1969|isbn=1435750985|page=191 on|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1435750985|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there is a street named Lazy Street and the [[House of the Seven Lazy Brothers]] in Bremen which celebrate Wagenfeld's work and in particular his story of the Seven Lazy brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bremen-tourism.de/bremen-legends Bremen legends], Bremen tourism, retrieved 5 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2820">'''Gabriel Pereira de Castro''' (1571-1632) was a Portuguese priest, lawyer and poet.

== Biography ==
Gabriel Pereira de Castro was born in [[Braga]] on 7 February 1571. He became a priest there. Then he studied law at the University of [[Coimbra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alfarrabio.di.uminho.pt/vercial/gcastro.htm Gabriel Pereira de Castro at Projecto Vercial]&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was a professor there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pl/books?id=0W881E496RcC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=gabriel+pereira+de+castro+poet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IPc0-GFgsr&amp;sig=a2kKUluhbDb7e-JA70NF_-0wJxc&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF2Nqb457QAhWF3SwKHYohA8w4ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gabriel%20pereira%20de%20castro%20poet&amp;f=false Malcolm Jack, Lisbon: City of the Sea: A History, p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 18 October 1632 in [[Lisbon]].

== Works ==
Gabriel Pereira de Castro wrote some books about law. He is however known chiefly for his epic poem ''Ulisseia ou Lisboa Edificada'' (''Ulisseia or Lisbon Built''). It consists of ten books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castroesilva.com/store/sku/1307JC005/ulyssea-ou-lisboa-edificada Pereira de Castro, Gabriel. Ulyssea, ou Lisboa Edificada.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in [[ottava rima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castroesilva.com/store/sku/1307JC005/ulyssea-ou-lisboa-edificada Pereira de Castro, Gabriel. Ulyssea, ou Lisboa Edificada.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its form is typical for Renaissance epic poems. The poem imitates ''The Lusiads'' by [[Luís de Camões|Luís Vaz de Camões]]. It is about the founding of the town of Lisbon by Ulysses (Odysseus).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.pl/research/collection-90100/kompilacja-opublikowanych-%C5%BArode%C5%82?itemId=34473181&amp;action=showRecord Encyclopædia Britannica 11 Ed. Vol. 22.]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published posthumously by poet's brother Luís Pereira de Castro in 1636.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alfarrabio.di.uminho.pt/vercial/gcastro.htm Gabriel Pereira de Castro at Projecto Vercial]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote poems in Latin and Spanish, too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alfarrabio.di.uminho.pt/vercial/gcastro.htm Gabriel Pereira de Castro at Projecto Vercial]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ulisseia'' is considered to be one of the most significant Portuguese epic after Camões.&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GT5WAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=pl&amp;pg=GBS.PP9 William Hayley, An essay on epic poetry : in five epistles to the Revd.

In [[linguistics]], '''grammar''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|γραμματική}}) is the set of [[structural]] rules governing the composition of [[clause (linguistics)|clauses]], [[phrase]]s, and [[words]] in any given [[natural language]]. The term refers also to the study of such rules, and this field includes [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and [[syntax]], often complemented by [[phonetics]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]].

Speakers of a language have a set of internalized rules&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally, the mental information used to produce and process linguistic utterances is referred to as "rules". However, other frameworks employ different terminology, with theoretical implications. [[Optimality theory]], for example, talks in terms of "constraints", while [[construction grammar]], [[cognitive grammar]], and other "usage-based" theories make reference to patterns, constructions, and "schemata"&lt;/ref&gt; for using that language and these rules constitute that language's grammar. The vast majority of the information in the grammar is – at least in the case of one's [[First language|native language]] – [[language acquisition|acquired]] not by conscious study or instruction, but by observing other speakers. Much of this work is done during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves a greater degree of explicit instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term "grammar" can also be used to describe the rules that govern the linguistic behaviour of a group of speakers. The term "English grammar", therefore, may have several meanings. It may refer to the whole of English grammar, that is, to the grammars of all the speakers of the language, in which case, the term encompasses a great deal of variation.&lt;ref&gt;

Or it may refer to the rules of a particular, relatively well-defined variety of English (such as [[standard English]] for a particular region).

A specific description, study or analysis of such rules may also be referred to as a grammar. A [[reference book]] describing the grammar of a language is called a "reference grammar" or simply "a grammar" (see [[History of English grammars]]). A fully explicit grammar that exhaustively describes the [[grammaticality|grammatical]] constructions of a language is called a descriptive grammar. This kind of [[linguistic description]] contrasts with [[linguistic prescription]], an attempt to discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions, while promoting others. For example, [[preposition stranding]] occurs widely in [[Germanic languages]] and has a long history in English. [[John Dryden]], however, objected to it (without explanation),&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum, 2002, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, p. 627f.&lt;/ref&gt; leading other English speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use.&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin| first=Leigh |title=The Power of Prepositions |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=216 |work=On Writing |publisher=Criminal Brief |location=Cairo |date=23 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside linguistics, the term ''grammar'' is often used in a rather different sense. In some respects, it may be used more broadly, including rules of [[orthography|spelling and punctuation]], which linguists would not typically consider to form part of grammar, but rather as a part of [[orthography]], the set of conventions used for writing a language. In other respects, it may be used more narrowly, to refer to [[prescriptive grammar]] only and excluding those aspects of a language's grammar that are not subject to variation or debate. Jeremy Butterfield&lt;!-- Not the physics professor. Do NOT link. --&gt; claimed that, for non-linguists, "Grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of English that people object to."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Butterfield, (2008). ''Damp Squid: The English Language Laid Bare'', Oxford University Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|978-0199574094}}. p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''grammar'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|γραμματικὴ τέχνη}} (''grammatikē technē''), which means "art of letters", from {{lang|grc|γράμμα}} (''gramma''), "letter", itself from {{lang|grc|γράφειν}} (''graphein''), "to draw, to write".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The [[Babylonia]]ns made some early attempts at language description,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistics: An Introduction|last=McGregor|first=William B.|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2015|isbn=978-0567583529|location=|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the first systematic grammars, of [[Sanskrit]], originated in [[Iron Age India]], with [[Yaska]] (6th century BC), [[Pāṇini]] (6-5th century BC&lt;ref name=britpanini&gt;{{cite book |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ashtadhyayi|title= Ashtadhyayi, Work by Panini |author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |year= 2013 | publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 October 2017}}, Quote: "Ashtadhyayi, Sanskrit Aṣṭādhyāyī (“Eight Chapters”), Sanskrit treatise on grammar written in the 6th to 5th century BCE by the Indian grammarian Panini."&lt;/ref&gt;) and his commentators [[Pingala]] (c. 200 BC), [[Katyayana]], and [[Patanjali]] (2nd century BC). [[Tolkāppiyam]], the earliest [[Tamil language|Tamil]] grammar, is mostly dated to before the 5th century AD.

In the West, grammar emerged as a discipline in [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]] from the 3rd century BC forward with authors like [[Rhyanus]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]]. The oldest known grammar handbook is the ''[[Art of Grammar]]'' ({{lang|grc|Τέχνη Γραμματική}}), a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively, written by the ancient Greek scholar [[Dionysius Thrax]] ({{circa}} 170–{{circa}} 90 BC), a student of Aristarchus of Samothrace who established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes.&lt;ref name="Casson2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casson|first=Lionel|authorlink=Lionel Casson|date=2001|title=Libraries in the Ancient World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECBkVPQkNSsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Lionel+Casson+Libraries+in+the+Ancient+World&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO-s6V2ZXeAhUow4MKHVxZDs8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Library%20of%20Alexandria&amp;f=false|location=New Haven, Connecticut|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-09721-2|page=45|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysius Thrax's grammar book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD.&lt;ref name="Casson2001"/&gt; The Romans based their grammatical writings on it and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.&lt;ref name="Casson2001"/&gt; [[Latin grammar]] developed by following Greek models from the 1st century BC, due to the work of authors such as [[Orbilius Pupillus]], [[Remmius Palaemon]], [[Marcus Valerius Probus]], [[Verrius Flaccus]], and [[Aemilius Asper]].

A grammar of [[Old Irish|Irish]] originated in the 7th century with the [[Auraicept na n-Éces]].
[[Arabic grammar]] emerged with [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]] in the 7th century.
The first treatises on [[Hebrew grammar]] appeared in the [[High Middle Ages]], in the context of [[Mishnah]] (exegesis of the [[Hebrew Bible]]). The [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] tradition originated in [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]]. The ''[[Diqduq]]'' (10th century) is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;G. Khan, J. B. Noah, ''The Early Karaite Tradition of Hebrew Grammatical Thought'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Barun]] in the 12th century compares the Hebrew language with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic grammatical tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinchas Wechter, Ibn Barūn's Arabic Works on Hebrew Grammar and Lexicography (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

Belonging to the ''[[trivium]]'' of the seven [[liberal arts]], grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the [[Middle Ages]], following the influence of authors from [[Late Antiquity]], such as [[Priscian]]. Treatment of vernaculars began gradually during the [[High Middle Ages]], with isolated works such as the [[First Grammatical Treatise]], but became influential only in the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods. In 1486, [[Antonio de Nebrija]] published ''Las introduciones Latinas contrapuesto el romance al Latin'', and the first [[Spanish grammar]], ''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana]]'', in 1492. During the 16th-century [[Italian Renaissance]], the ''Questione della lingua'' was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the [[Italian language]], initiated by [[Dante]]'s ''[[de vulgari eloquentia]]'' ([[Pietro Bembo]], ''Prose della volgar lingua'' Venice 1525). The first grammar of [[Slovene language]] was written in 1583 by [[Adam Bohorič]].

Grammars of non-European languages began to be compiled for the purposes of [[evangelization]] and [[Bible translation]] from the 16th century onward, such as ''Grammatica o Arte de la Lengua General de los Indios de los Reynos del Perú'' (1560), and a [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] grammar by [[Fray Domingo de Santo Tomás]].

From the latter part of the 18th century, grammar came to be understood as a subfield of the emerging discipline of modern linguistics. The ''Deutsche Grammatik'' of the [[Jacob Grimm]] was first published in the 1810s. The ''Comparative Grammar'' of [[Franz Bopp]], the starting point of modern [[comparative linguistics]], came out in 1833.

[[File:Parse_tree_1.jpg|thumb|Simple constituency grammar [[parse tree]], whereby the sentence is divided into a [[noun phrase]] and a [[verb phrase]].]]
Frameworks of grammar, which attempt to give a precise scientific theory of the syntax rules of grammar and their function, have been developed in [[theoretical linguistics]]. Most mainstream frameworks are based on the conception of an innate "[[universal grammar]]", an idea developed by [[Noam Chomsky]]. The most prominent theories are:
{{Expand list|date=March 2018}}
*[[Generative grammar]]: algorithmic constituency aka "[[phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]" relation (Noam Chomsky 1950)
**[[Transformational grammar]] (1960s)
**[[Generative semantics]] (1970s)
***[[Semantic Syntax]] (1990s)
**[[Generalised phrase structure grammar]] (late 1970s)
***[[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (1985)
***[[Principles and parameters]] grammar ([[Government and binding theory]]) (1980s)
**[[Lexical functional grammar]]
**[[Categorial grammar]] ([[lambda calculus]])
***[[Montague grammar]]
**[[Minimalist program]]-based grammar (1993)
*[[Dependency grammar]]: dependency relation ([[Lucien Tesnière]] 1959)
**[[Link grammar]]
*[[Cognitive grammar]] / [[Cognitive linguistics]]
**[[Construction grammar]]
***[[Fluid Construction Grammar]]
**[[Word grammar]]
*[[Stochastic grammar]]: probabilistic
**[[Operator Grammar]]
*[[Functional theories of grammar|Functional grammar]]: usage-oriented (behaviorist)
**[[Danish Functionalism]]
**[[Systemic functional grammar]]
**[[Role and reference grammar]]

[[Parse tree]]s are commonly (but not always) used by such frameworks to depict their rules. There are various additional notation schemes for some grammars:
*[[Constraint grammar]]
*[[Tree-adjoining grammar]]
*[[Affix grammar over a finite lattice]]
*[[Lambda calculus]]
*[[X-bar theory]]
*[[Backus–Naur form]]

==Development of grammars==
{{Main|Historical linguistics|History of English grammars}}
Grammars evolve through usage and also due to separations of the human population. With the advent of written [[Knowledge representation|representations]], formal rules about language usage tend to appear also. [[Formal grammar]]s are [[codification (linguistics)|codifications]] of usage that are developed by repeated documentation over time, and by [[observation]] as well. As the rules become established and developed, the prescriptive concept of [[grammatical correctness]] can arise. This often creates a discrepancy between contemporary usage and that which has been accepted, over time, as being correct. Linguists tend to view prescriptive grammars as having little justification beyond their authors' aesthetic tastes, although style guides may give useful advice about ''standard language employment'', based on descriptions of usage in contemporary writings of the same language. Linguistic prescriptions also form part of the explanation for variation in speech, particularly variation in the speech of an individual speaker (an explanation, for example, for why some people say "I didn't do nothing", some say "I didn't do anything", and some say one or the other depending on social context).

The formal study of grammar is an important part of education for children from a young age through advanced [[learning]], though the rules taught in schools are not a "grammar" in the sense most [[linguistics|linguists]] use the term, particularly as they are often [[prescriptive]] rather than [[descriptive]].

[[Constructed language]]s (also called ''planned languages'' or ''conlangs'') are more common in the modern day than they used to be, although still extremely uncommon compared to natural languages. Many have been designed to aid human communication (for example, naturalistic [[Interlingua]], schematic [[Esperanto]], and the highly logic-compatible [[artificial language]] [[Lojban]]). Each of these languages has its own grammar.

Syntax refers to the linguistic structure above the word level (e.g. how sentences are formed)—though without taking into account [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], which is the domain of phonology. Morphology, by contrast, refers to structure at and below the word level (e.g. how compound words are formed), but above the level of individual sounds, which, like intonation, are in the domain of phonology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; No clear line can be drawn, however, between syntax and morphology. [[Analytic languages]] use syntax to convey information that is encoded via [[inflection]] in [[synthetic language]]s. In other words, word order is not significant and morphology is highly significant in a purely synthetic language, whereas morphology is not significant and syntax is highly significant in an analytic language. Chinese and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], for example, are highly analytic, and meaning is therefore very context-dependent. (Both do have some inflections, and have had more in the past; thus, they are becoming even less synthetic and more "purely" analytic over time.) [[Latin]], which is highly [[synthetic language|synthetic]], uses [[affix]]es and [[inflection]]s to convey the same information that Chinese does with syntax. Because Latin words are quite (though not completely) self-contained, an intelligible Latin [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] can be made from elements that are placed in a largely arbitrary order. Latin has a complex affixation and simple syntax, while Chinese has the opposite.

==Education==
[[Prescriptive]] grammar is taught in primary and secondary school. The term "[[grammar school]]" historically refers to a school (attached to a cathedral or monastery) teaching Latin grammar to future priests and monks. In its earliest form, "grammar school" referred to a school that taught students to read, scan, interpret, and declaim Greek and Latin poets (including Homer, Virgil, Euripides, and others). These should not be confused with the related, albeit distinct, modern British grammar schools.

A [[standard language]] is a particular dialect of a language that is promoted above other dialects in writing, education, and broadly speaking in the public sphere; it contrasts with [[vernacular]] dialects, which may be the objects of study in [[descriptive grammar]] but which are rarely taught prescriptively. The standardized "[[first language]]" taught in primary education may be subject to [[language politics|political]] controversy, because it may sometimes establish a standard defining nationality or [[ethnicity]].

Recently, efforts have begun to update [[Linguistics in Education|grammar instruction]] in primary and secondary education. The primary focus has been to prevent the use of outdated prescriptive rules in favour of more accurate descriptive ones and to change perceptions about relative "correctness" of standard forms in comparison to non-standard dialects.

The pre-eminence of [[Parisian French]] has reigned largely unchallenged throughout the history of modern French literature. Standard Italian is not based on the speech of the capital, Rome, but on the speech of [[Florence]] because of the influence Florentines had on early [[Italian literature]]. Similarly, standard Spanish is not based on the speech of [[Madrid]], but on that of educated speakers from more northerly areas like [[Castile and León]] (e.g. see ''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana]]''). In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Montevideo]] ([[Rioplatense Spanish]]). [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] has, for now, two official standards, respectively [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]].

The [[Serbian language]] is divided in a similar way; [[Serbia]] and the [[Republika Srpska]] use their own separate standards. The existence of a third standard is a matter of controversy, some consider [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] as a separate language, and some think it is merely another variety of Serbian.

[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] has two standards, ''[[Bokmål]]'' and ''[[Nynorsk]]'', the choice between which is subject to [[Norwegian language struggle|controversy]]: Each Norwegian municipality can declare one of the two its official language, or it can remain "language neutral". Nynorsk is endorsed by a minority of 27 percent of the municipalities. The main language used in primary schools normally follows the official language of its municipality and is decided by referendum within the local school district. [[Standard German]] emerged from the standardized chancellery use of [[Early New High German language|High German]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Until about 1800, it was almost entirely a written language, but now it is so widely spoken that most of the former [[German dialect]]s are nearly extinct.

[[Standard Chinese]] has official status as the standard spoken form of the Chinese language in the People's Republic of China (PRC), the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) and the [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]]. Pronunciation of Standard Chinese is based on the local accent of [[Mandarin Chinese]] from Luanping, Chengde in Hebei Province near Beijing, while grammar and syntax are based on modern [[vernacular written Chinese]].
[[Modern Standard Arabic]] is directly based on [[Classical Arabic]], the language of the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Hindustani language]] has two standards, [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]].

In the United States, the Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar designated 4 March as [[National Grammar Day]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalgrammarday.com/|title=National Grammar Day: Brought to you by Grammar Girl and the Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High-definition television''' ('''HDTV''') is a television system providing an image [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is of substantially higher resolution than that of [[standard-definition television]]. This can be either analog or digital. HDTV is the current standard video format used in most broadcasts: [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcast television]], [[cable television]], [[satellite television]], [[Blu-ray]]s, and [[streaming video]].

HDTV may be transmitted in various formats:

* [[720p]] (HD ready): 1280×720p: 923,600 pixels (~0.92 MP) per frame
* [[1080i]] (full HD) : 1920×1080i: 1,036,800 pixels (~1.04 MP) per [[field (video)|field]] or 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 MP) per frame
* [[1080p]] (full HD): 1920×1080p: 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 [[megapixel]]s) per [[frame (video)|frame]]
** Some countries also use a non-standard CEA resolution, such as 1440×1080i: 777,600 pixels (~0.78 MP) per field or 1,555,200 pixels (~1.56 MP) per frame&lt;!-- Do not delete this, it is used for all free to air HDTV in the UK (and probably elsewhere) and is also used by various home recording equipment. See also the 1080i article. --&gt;

The letter "p" here stands for [[progressive scan]], while "i" indicates [[interlaced video|interlaced]].

When transmitted at two megapixels per frame, HDTV provides about five times as many pixels as SD (standard-definition television). The increased resolution provides for a clearer, more detailed picture. In addition, progressive scan and higher frame rates result in a picture with less flicker and better rendering of fast motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Graham A.|title=A Broadcast Engineering Tutorial for Non-Engineers|date=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136035210|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfOKIjFODrcC&amp;pg=PT34|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDTV as is known today first started official broadcasting in 1989 in [[Japan]], under the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]]/Hi-Vision analog system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p19.html|title=The Evolution of TV -A Brief History of TV Technology in Japan|website=www.nhk.or.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDTV was widely adopted worldwide in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/game-changing-tech-from-the-2000s-2012-8|title=10 Game-Changing Pieces of Tech From The 2000s|first=Kevin|last=Smith|date=3 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|Analog high-definition television system|history of television}}

The term ''high definition'' once described a series of television systems originating from August 1936; however, these systems were only high definition when compared to earlier systems that were based on mechanical systems with as few as 30&lt;!-- Baird's 1926 broadcasts consisted of 30 vertical (actually curved) lines. --&gt; lines of resolution. The ongoing competition between companies and nations to create true "HDTV" spanned the entire 20th century, as each new system became more HD than the last. In the 2010s, this race has continued with [[4K resolution|4K]], [[5K resolution|5K]] and [[8K resolution|8K]] systems.

The British high-definition TV service started trials in August 1936 and a regular service on 2 November 1936 using both the (mechanical) Baird 240 line sequential scan (later to be inaccurately rechristened 'progressive') and the (electronic) Marconi-EMI [[405 line]] interlaced systems. The Baird system was discontinued in February 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm |title=Teletronic – The Television History Site |publisher=Teletronic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 France followed with their own [[441 line|441-line]] system, variants of which were also used by a number of other countries. The US [[NTSC]] 555-line system joined in 1941. In 1949 France introduced an even higher-resolution standard at [[819 line]]s, a system that should have been high definition even by today's standards, but was monochrome only and the technical limitations of the time prevented it from achieving the definition of which it should have been capable. All of these systems used [[interlacing]] and a 4:3 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] except the 240-line system which was progressive (actually described at the time by the technically correct term "sequential") and the 405-line system which started as 5:4 and later changed to 4:3. The 405-line system adopted the (at that time) revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the 240-line with its 25&amp;nbsp;Hz frame rate. The 240-line system could have doubled its frame rate but this would have meant that the transmitted signal would have doubled in bandwidth, an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than 3&amp;nbsp;MHz.

Color broadcasts started at similarly higher resolutions, first with the US NTSC color system in 1953, which was compatible with the earlier monochrome systems and therefore had the same 525 lines of resolution. European standards did not follow until the 1960s, when the [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] color systems were added to the monochrome 625 line broadcasts.

The [[NHK|Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai]] (NHK, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation) began conducting research to "unlock the fundamental mechanism of video and sound interactions with the five human senses" in 1964, after the Tokyo Olympics. NHK set out to create an HDTV system that ended up scoring much higher in subjective tests than NTSC's previously dubbed "HDTV". This new system, NHK Color, created in 1972, included 1125 lines, a 5:3 aspect ratio and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), headed by Charles Ginsburg, became the testing and study authority for HDTV technology in the international theater. SMPTE would test HDTV systems from different companies from every conceivable perspective, but the problem of combining the different formats plagued the technology for many years.

There were four major HDTV systems tested by SMPTE in the late 1970s, and in 1979 an SMPTE study group released ''A Study of High Definition Television Systems'':

Since the formal adoption of [[digital video broadcasting]]'s (DVB) widescreen HDTV transmission modes in the mid to late 2000s; the 525-line [[NTSC]] (and [[PAL-M]]) systems, as well as the European 625-line [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems, are now regarded as ''standard definition'' television systems.

===Analog systems===
{{Main|Analog high-definition television system}}

Early HDTV broadcasting used [[Analog television|analog]] technology, but today it is transmitted [[Digital television|digitally]] and uses [[video compression]].

In 1949, France started its transmissions with an 819 lines system (with 737 active lines). The system was monochrome only, and was used only on VHF for the first French TV channel. It was discontinued in 1983.

In 1958, the [[Soviet Union]] developed ''Тransformator'' ({{lang-ru|Трансформатор}}, meaning ''Transformer''), the first high-resolution (definition) television system capable of producing an image composed of 1,125 lines of resolution aimed at providing teleconferencing for military command. It was a research project and the system was never deployed by either the military or consumer broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Валерий Хлебородов|url=http://rus.625-net.ru/625/2007/01/tvch.htm|title=HDTV in the Russian Federation: problems and prospects of implementation (in Russian)|publisher=Rus.625-net.ru|date=|accessdate=2013-03-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727143639/http://rus.625-net.ru/625/2007/01/tvch.htm|archivedate=2013-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the [[European Community]] proposed [[HD-MAC]], an analog HDTV system with 1,152 lines. A public demonstration took place for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona. However HD-MAC was scrapped in 1993 and the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) project was formed, which would foresee development of a digital HDTV standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xL_Rq6qUvT0C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=%22hd-mac%22+dvb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hxtQk3sMC9&amp;sig=VuoTszem5lFuT9HZWKo5OY2vueM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOnP3t5aPbAhUBbcAKHZYXBjwQ6AEIeDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hd-mac%22+dvb&amp;f=false|title=DVB: The Family of International Standards for Digital Video Broadcasting|first=Ulrich|last=Reimers|date=11 August 2018|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
In 1979, the Japanese public broadcaster [[NHK]] first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,132289-c,hdtv/article.html|title=Researchers Craft HDTV's Successor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its [[multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding]] (MUSE) for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1035i/1125 lines). In 1981, the MUSE system was demonstrated for the first time in the United States, using the same 5:3 aspect ratio as the Japanese system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tech-notes.tv/Archive/tech_notes_002.htm|title=Digital TV Tech Notes, Issue #2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon visiting a demonstration of MUSE in Washington, US President [[Ronald Reagan]] was impressed and officially declared it "a matter of national interest" to introduce HDTV to the US.&lt;ref&gt;James Sudalnik and Victoria Kuhl, "High definition television"&lt;/ref&gt; NHK taped the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] with a Hi-Vision camera, weighing 40&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhk.or.jp/digitalmuseum/nhk50years_en/history/p26/index.html|title=50 Years of NHK Television|first=50 Years of NHK|last=Television|website=www.nhk.or.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite test broadcasts started June 4, 1989, the first daily high-definition programs in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/world/japan-begins-broadcasts-of-high-definition-tv.html|title=Japan Begins Broadcasts of High-Definition TV|first=David E. Sanger and Special To the New York|last=Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with regular testing starting on November 25, 1991 or "Hi-Vision Day"{{snd}} dated exactly to refer to its 1,125-lines resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/26/business/few-see-japan-make-tv-history.html|title=Few See Japan Make TV History|first=David E.|last=Sanger|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular broadcasting of [[Broadcasting Satellite (Japanese)|BS]]-9ch commenced on November 25, 1994, which featured commercial and NHK programming.

Several systems were proposed as the new standard for the US, including the Japanese MUSE system, but all were rejected by the [[FCC]] because of their higher bandwidth requirements. At this time, the number of television channels was growing rapidly and bandwidth was already a problem. A new standard had to be more efficient, needing less bandwidth for HDTV than the existing NTSC.

===Demise of analog HD systems===
The limited standardization of analog HDTV in the 1990s did not lead to global HDTV adoption as technical and economic constraints at the time did not permit HDTV to use bandwidths greater than normal television. Early HDTV commercial experiments, such as NHK's MUSE, required over four times the bandwidth of a standard-definition broadcast. Despite efforts made to reduce analog HDTV to about twice the bandwidth of SDTV, these television formats were still distributable only by satellite. In Europe too, the HD-MAC standard was considered not technically viable.

In addition, recording and reproducing an HDTV signal was a significant technical challenge in the early years of HDTV ([[Sony HDVS]]). Japan remained the only country with successful [[public broadcasting]] of analog HDTV, with seven broadcasters sharing a single channel.

However the Hi-Vision/MUSE system also faced commercial issues when it launched on November 25, 1991. Only 2,000 HDTV sets were sold by that day, rather than the enthusiastic 1.32 million estimation. Hi-Vision sets were very expensive, up to US$30,000 each, which contributed to its low consumer adaption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14119153-000-technology-while-japan-admits-that-analogue-tv-is-a-dead-end/|title=Technology: . . . while Japan admits that analogue TV is a dead end|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Hi-Vision [[VCR]] from [[NEC]] released at Christmas time retailed for US$115,000. In addition, the United States saw Hi-Vision/MUSE as an outdated system and had already made it clear that it would develop an all-digital system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mbsfr38GTgC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=hi+vision+day+1991&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=usj14KFV5u&amp;sig=LjPFRejyM4Jz-wWh8kG-iftywVk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hi+vision+day+1991&amp;f=false|title=High Definition Television: The Creation, Development and Implementation of HDTV Technology|first=Philip J.|last=Cianci|date=10 January 2013|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts thought the commercial Hi-Vision system in 1992 was already eclipsed by digital technology developed in the U.S. since 1990. This was an American victory against the Japanese in terms of technological dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/04/business/technology-shift-blurs-future-of-japan-s-new-tv-system.html|title=Technology Shift Blurs Future of Japan's New TV System|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1993 prices of receivers were still as high as 1.5 million [[yen]] (US$15,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R4j_Pmj_l9MC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=%22hi-vision%22+receivers+japan+%22yen%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YXo59SdWf0&amp;sig=dakBX-orZcNiT1ayKaS-jv8nlNE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis5oXuw6TbAhXQN8AKHTqPCSIQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hi-vision%22+receivers+japan+%22yen%22&amp;f=false|title=Technology, Television, and Competition: The Politics of Digital TV|first=Jeffrey A.|last=Hart|date=5 February 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 1994, a top broadcasting administrator in Japan admitted failure of its analog-based HDTV system, saying the U.S. digital format would be more likely a worldwide standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-23/business/fi-26252_1_world-standard|title=Japan Gives Up on Analog-Based HDTV System : Technology: Government says U.S.-backed digital format is likely to become a world standard.|first=JUBE SHIVER|last=Jr|date=23 February 1994|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this announcement drew angry protests from broadcasters and electronic companies who invested heavily into the analog system. As a result, he took back his statement the next day saying that the government will continue to promote Hi-Vision/MUSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/news/japanese-revive-hdtv-system-118589/|title=Japanese revive HDTV system|first=Variety|last=Staff|date=24 February 1994|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year NHK started development of [[digital television]] in an attempt to catch back up to America and Europe. This resulted in the [[ISDB]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Jl6VPARb9MC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=japan+digital+hdtv&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vPHHjbMq11&amp;sig=kUBiNIA9H9Qwl89lED3r3Xa-SsM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIireW06PbAhXnL8AKHdhdB8U4ChDoAQhRMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=japan+digital+hdtv&amp;f=false|title=Digital Television Standardization and Strategies|first=Katharina|last=Grimme|date=11 August 2018|publisher=Artech House|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan started digital satellite and HDTV broadcasting in December 2000.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Rise of digital compression===
Since 1972, [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s radio telecommunications sector ([[ITU-R]]) had been working on creating a global recommendation for Analog HDTV. These recommendations, however, did not fit in the broadcasting bands which could reach home users. The standardization of [[MPEG-1]] in 1993 also led to the acceptance of recommendations [[Rec. 709|ITU-R BT.709]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=brweb |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/index.asp?category=information&amp;link=hdtv-25&amp;lang=en |title=High definition television comes of age thanks to ITU |publisher=Itu.int |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of these standards the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) organisation was formed, an alliance of broadcasters, consumer electronics manufacturers and regulatory bodies. The DVB develops and agrees upon specifications which are formally standardised by ETSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Webfactory www.webfactory.ie |url=http://www.dvb.org/about_dvb/history/ |title=History of the DVB Project |publisher=Dvb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DVB created first the standard for [[DVB-S]] digital satellite TV, [[DVB-C]] digital cable TV and [[DVB-T]] digital terrestrial TV. These broadcasting systems can be used for both SDTV and HDTV. In the US the Grand Alliance proposed [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] as the new standard for SDTV and HDTV. Both ATSC and DVB were based on the MPEG-2 standard, although DVB systems may also be used to transmit video using the newer and more efficient [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] compression standards. Common for all DVB standards is the use of highly efficient modulation techniques for further reducing bandwidth, and foremost for reducing receiver-hardware and antenna requirements.

In 1983, the International Telecommunication Union's radio telecommunications sector (ITU-R) set up a working party (IWP11/6) with the aim of setting a single international HDTV standard. One of the thornier issues concerned a suitable frame/field refresh rate, the world already having split into two camps, 25/50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 30/60&amp;nbsp;Hz, largely due to the differences in [[mains electricity|mains]] frequency. The IWP11/6 working party considered many views and throughout the 1980s served to encourage development in a number of video digital processing areas, not least conversion between the two main frame/field rates using [[motion vector]]s, which led to further developments in other areas. While a comprehensive HDTV standard was not in the end established, agreement on the aspect ratio was achieved.

Initially the existing 5:3 aspect ratio had been the main candidate but, due to the influence of widescreen cinema, the aspect ratio [[16:9]] (1.78) eventually emerged as being a reasonable compromise between 5:3 (1.67) and the common 1.85 widescreen cinema format. An aspect ratio of 16:9 was duly agreed upon at the first meeting of the IWP11/6 working party at [[BBC Research|the BBC's Research and Development]] establishment in Kingswood Warren. The resulting ITU-R Recommendation ITU-R BT.709-2 ("[[Rec. 709]]") includes the 16:9 aspect ratio, a specified [[colorimetry]], and the scan modes [[1080i]] (1,080 actively [[interlaced]] lines of resolution) and [[1080p]] (1,080 [[Progressive scan|progressively scanned]] lines). The British [[Freeview HD]] trials used [[MBAFF]], which contains both progressive and interlaced content in the same encoding.

It also includes the alternative 1440×1152 [[HDMAC]] scan format. (According to some reports, a mooted 750-line (720p) format (720 progressively scanned lines) was viewed by some at the ITU as an enhanced television format rather than a true HDTV format,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Mendrala |url=http://www.tech-notes.tv/Archive/tech_notes_041.htm |title=Digital TV Tech Notes, Issue #41 |publisher=Tech-notes.tv |date=1999-09-27 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so was not included, although 1920×1080i and 1280×720p systems for a range of frame and field rates were defined by several US [[SMPTE]] standards.)

==Inaugural HDTV broadcast in the United States==
HDTV technology was introduced in the United States in the late 1980s and made official in 1993 by the [[Grand Alliance (HDTV)|Digital HDTV Grand Alliance]], a group of television, electronic equipment, communications companies consisting of [[AT&amp;T (1885-2005)|AT&amp;T Bell Labs]], [[General Instrument]], [[Philips]], [[David Sarnoff Research Center|Sarnoff]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Field testing of HDTV at 199 sites in the United States was completed August 14, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/consumer-household-electronics-high/7686036-1.html |title=HDTV field testing wraps up |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public HDTV broadcast in the United States occurred on July 23, 1996 when the [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] television station [[WRAL-HD]] began broadcasting from the existing tower of [[WRAL-TV]] southeast of Raleigh, winning a race to be first with the HD Model Station in [[Washington, D.C.]], which began broadcasting July 31, 1996 with the callsign WHD-TV, based out of the facilities of [[NBC]] owned and operated station [[WRC-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/wral-tv/story/1069461/ |title=History of WRAL Digital |publisher=Wral.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/consumer-household-electronics-high/7691754-1.html |title=WRAL-HD begins broadcasting HDTV |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-electronics-manufacturing/7691367-1.html |title=Comark transmitter first in at Model Station |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] (ATSC) HDTV system had its public launch on October 29, 1998, during the live coverage of astronaut [[John Glenn]]'s return mission to space on board the [[Space Shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]''.&lt;ref name = "bnet1"&gt;{{cite news

==European HDTV broadcasts==
The first HDTV transmissions in Europe, albeit not direct-to-home, began in 1990, when the Italian broadcaster [[RAI]] used both [[HD-MAC]] and [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] HDTV technologies to broadcast the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. The matches were shown in 8 cinemas in [[Italy]], where the tournament was played, and 2 in Spain. The connection with Spain was made via the [[Olympus satellite]] link from [[Rome]] to [[Barcelona]] and then with a [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] connection from Barcelona to [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crit.rai.it/eletel/LeMiniSerie/MS3a.pdf|title=ItaLia ‘90{{snd}} il primo passo della HDTV digitale{{snd}} I parte |trans-title=Le Mini Serie{{snd}} Italia '90{{snd}} The First Step of Digital HDTV{{snd}} part I|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crit.rai.it/eletel/LeMiniSerie/MS3b.pdf|title=ItaLia ‘90{{snd}} il primo passo della HDTV digitale{{snd}} II parte |trans-title=Le Mini Serie{{snd}} Italia '90{{snd}} The First Step of Digital HDTV{{snd}} part II|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some HDTV transmissions in Europe the standard was abandoned in 1993, to be replaced by a digital format from [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]].

The first regular broadcasts started on January 1, 2004 when the Belgian company [[Euro1080]] launched the HD1 channel with the traditional [[Vienna New Year's Concert]]. Test transmissions had been active since the IBC exhibition in September 2003, but the New Year's Day broadcast marked the official launch of the HD1 channel, and the official start of direct-to-home HDTV in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA |date=October 23, 2003 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2003/4438389|title=SES ASTRA and Euro1080 to pioneer HDTV in Europe |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euro1080, a division of the former and now bankrupt Belgian TV services company Alfacam, broadcast HDTV channels to break the pan-European stalemate of "no HD broadcasts mean no HD TVs bought means no HD broadcasts ..." and kick-start HDTV interest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bains, Geoff. "Take The High Road" ''What Video &amp; Widescreen TV'' (April, 2004) 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; The HD1 channel was initially [[free-to-air]] and mainly comprised sporting, dramatic, musical and other cultural events broadcast with a multi-lingual soundtrack on a rolling schedule of 4 or 5 hours per day.

These first European HDTV broadcasts used the 1080i format with MPEG-2 compression on a DVB-S signal from [[SES S.A.|SES]]'s [[Astra 1H]] satellite. Euro1080 transmissions later changed to MPEG-4/AVC compression on a DVB-S2 signal in line with subsequent broadcast channels in Europe.

Despite delays in some countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.360950.de/diw_wr_2010-28.pdf |title=Weekly Report No.28/2010, Volume 6 |publisher=German Institute for Economic Research |date=2010-09-08 |accessdate=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of European HD channels and viewers has risen steadily since the first HDTV broadcasts, with SES's annual ''Satellite Monitor'' market survey for 2010 reporting more than 200 commercial channels broadcasting in HD from Astra satellites, 185 million HD capable TVs sold in Europe (£60 million in 2010 alone), and 20 million households (27% of all European digital satellite TV homes) watching HD satellite broadcasts (16 million via Astra satellites).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ses-astra.com/business/en/support/market-research/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809042534/http://www.ses-astra.com/business/en/support/market-research/index.php |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, the [[United Kingdom]] became the first European country to deploy high definition content using the new [[DVB-T2]] transmission standard, as specified in the [[Digital TV Group]] (DTG) [[D-book]], on digital terrestrial television.

The [[Freeview HD]] service currently contains 13 HD channels ({{As of|2016|April|lc=1}}) and was rolled out region by region across the UK in accordance with the [[digital switchover]] process, finally being completed in October 2012. However, Freeview HD is not the first HDTV service over digital terrestrial television in Europe; [[Italy]]'s [[RAI#Channels|Rai HD]] channel started broadcasting in 1080i on April 24, 2008 using the [[DVB-T]] transmission standard.

In October 2008 [[France]] deployed five high definition channels using [[DVB-T]] transmission standard on digital terrestrial distribution.

==Notation==
HDTV broadcast systems are identified with three major parameters:

* '''Frame size''' in pixels is defined as ''number of horizontal pixels × number of vertical pixels'', for example ''1280&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;720'' or ''1920&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1080''. Often the number of horizontal pixels is implied from context and is omitted, as in the case of ''720p'' and ''1080p''.
* '''Scanning system''' is identified with the letter '''''p''''' for [[progressive scan]]ning or '''''i''''' for [[Interlaced video|interlaced scanning]].
* '''Frame rate''' is identified as number of video frames per second. For interlaced systems, the number of frames per second should be specified, but it is not uncommon to see the field rate incorrectly used instead.

If all three parameters are used, they are specified in the following form: ''[frame size][scanning system][frame or field rate]'' or ''[frame size]/[frame or field rate][scanning system]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Buy a TV|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2016/05/how-to-buy-a-tv/|date=May 11, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, frame size or frame rate can be dropped if its value is implied from context. In this case, the remaining numeric parameter is specified first, followed by the scanning system.

For example, ''1920×1080p25'' identifies progressive scanning format with 25 frames per second, each frame being 1,920 [[pixel]]s wide and 1,080 pixels high. The ''1080i25'' or ''1080i50'' notation identifies interlaced scanning format with 25 frames (50 fields) per second, each frame being 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080 pixels high. The ''1080i30'' or ''1080i60'' notation identifies interlaced scanning format with 30 frames (60 fields) per second, each frame being 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080 pixels high. The ''720p60'' notation identifies progressive scanning format with 60 frames per second, each frame being 720 pixels high; 1,280 pixels horizontally are implied.

50&amp;nbsp;Hz systems support three scanning rates: 50i, 25p and 50p. 60&amp;nbsp;Hz systems support a much wider set of frame rates: 59.94i, 60i, 23.976p, 24p, 29.97p, 30p, 59.94p and 60p. In the days of standard definition television, the fractional rates were often rounded up to whole numbers, e.g. 23.976p was often called 24p, or 59.94i was often called 60i. 60&amp;nbsp;Hz high definition television supports both fractional and slightly different integer rates, therefore strict usage of notation is required to avoid ambiguity. Nevertheless, 29.97p/59.94i is almost universally called 60i, likewise 23.976p is called 24p.

For the commercial naming of a product, the frame rate is often dropped and is implied from context (e.g., a ''1080i television set''). A frame rate can also be specified without a resolution. For example, 24p means 24 progressive scan frames per second, and 50i means 25 interlaced frames per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arridigital.com/creative/camerabasics/7 |title=Scanning Methods (p, i, PsF) |publisher=ARRI Digital |date= |accessdate=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single standard for HDTV color support. Colors are typically broadcast using a (10-bits per channel) [[YUV]] color space but, depending on the underlying image generating technologies of the receiver, are then subsequently converted to a [[RGB]] color space using standardized algorithms. When transmitted directly through the Internet, the colors are typically pre-converted to 8-bit RGB channels for additional storage savings with the assumption that it will only be viewed only on a ([[sRGB]]) computer screen. As an added benefit to the original broadcasters, the losses of the pre-conversion essentially make these files unsuitable for professional TV re-broadcasting.

Most HDTV systems support resolutions and frame rates defined either in the ATSC table 3, or in EBU specification. The most common are noted below.

At a minimum, HDTV has twice the linear resolution of [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV), thus showing greater detail than either analog television or regular [[DVD]]. The technical standards for broadcasting HDTV also handle the 16:9 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] images without using [[letterbox]]ing or [[anamorphic]] stretching, thus increasing the effective image resolution.

A very high resolution source may require more bandwidth than available in order to be transmitted without loss of fidelity. The [[lossy compression]] that is used in all digital HDTV storage and transmission systems will distort the received picture, when compared to the uncompressed source.

===Standard frame or field rates===
[[ATSC]] and [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] define the following frame rates for use with the various broadcast standards:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/howto/articles/understandinghdformats.aspx |title=Understanding HD Formats |author=Ben Waggoner |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DVBFramerates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101100_101199/101154/01.11.01_60/ts_101154v011101p.pdf#page=19 |title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Specification for the use of Video and Audio Coding in Broadcasting Applications based on the MPEG-2 Transport Stream |publisher=ETSI |date=2012 |accessdate=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 23.976&amp;nbsp;Hz (film-looking frame rate compatible with [[NTSC]] clock speed standards)
* 24&amp;nbsp;Hz (international film and ATSC high-definition material)
* 25&amp;nbsp;Hz (PAL film, DVB standard-definition and high-definition material)
* 29.97&amp;nbsp;Hz (NTSC film and standard-definition material)
* 30&amp;nbsp;Hz (NTSC film, ATSC high-definition material)
* 50&amp;nbsp;Hz (DVB high-definition material)
* 59.94&amp;nbsp;Hz (ATSC high-definition material)
* 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (ATSC high-definition material)

The optimum format for a broadcast depends upon the type of videographic recording medium used and the image's characteristics. For best fidelity to the source the transmitted field ratio, lines, and frame rate should match those of the source.

PAL, SECAM and NTSC frame rates technically apply only to analogue standard definition television, not to digital or high definition broadcasts. However, with the roll out of digital broadcasting, and later HDTV broadcasting, countries retained their heritage systems. HDTV in former PAL and SECAM countries operates at a frame rate of 25/50&amp;nbsp;Hz, while HDTV in former NTSC countries operates at 30/60&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Why NTSC and PAL Still Matter With HDTV |url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/televisionbasics/qt/ntscpalframes.htm |author=Robert Silva |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of media===
Standard 35mm [[photographic film]] used for cinema projection has a much higher [[image resolution]] than HDTV systems, and is exposed and projected at a rate of 24 [[frames per second]] (frame/s). To be shown on standard television, in PAL-system countries, cinema film is scanned at the TV rate of 25 frame/s, causing a speedup of 4.1 percent, which is generally considered acceptable. In NTSC-system countries, the TV scan rate of 30 frame/s would cause a perceptible speedup if the same were attempted, and the necessary correction is performed by a technique called [[telecine#2:3 pulldown|3:2 Pulldown]]: Over each successive pair of film frames, one is held for three video fields (1/20 of a second) and the next is held for two video fields (1/30 of a second), giving a total time for the two frames of 1/12 of a second and thus achieving the correct average film frame rate. {{See also|Telecine}}

Non-cinematic HDTV video recordings intended for broadcast are typically recorded either in [[720p]] or 1080i format as determined by the broadcaster. 720p is commonly used for Internet distribution of high-definition video, because most computer monitors operate in progressive-scan mode. 720p also imposes less strenuous storage and decoding requirements compared to both 1080i and 1080p. 1080p/24, 1080i/30, 1080i/25, and 720p/30 is most often used on [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]].

==Modern systems==
{{Main|Large-screen television technology}}

In the US, residents in the line of sight of television station broadcast antennas can receive free, over the air programming with a television set with an [[ATSC tuner]] (most sets sold since 2009 have this). This is achieved with a [[TV aerial]], just as it has been since the 1940s except now the major network signals are broadcast in high definition (ABC, Fox, and Ion Television broadcast at 720p resolution; CBS, My Network TV, NBC, PBS at 1080i; and The CW at either resolution depending on the local affiliate). As their digital signals more efficiently use the broadcast channel, many broadcasters are adding multiple channels to their signals. Laws about antennas were updated before the change to digital terrestrial broadcasts. These new laws prohibit home owners' associations and city government from banning the installation of antennas.

Additionally, [[cable-ready]] TV sets can display HD content without using an external box. They have a [[QAM tuner]] built-in and/or a card slot for inserting a [[CableCARD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hidefster.com/HDTV_blog/?cat=9|title=HDTV information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-definition image sources include [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcast]], direct broadcast satellite, digital cable, [[IPTV]] (including GoogleTV, Roku boxes and AppleTV or built into "Smart Televisions"), [[Blu-ray]] video disc (BD), and internet downloads.

Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] has extensive HD compatibility because of its built in [[Blu-ray]] disc-based player, so does Microsoft's [[Xbox 360]] with the addition of [[Netflix]] and [[Windows Media Center]] [[HTPC]] streaming capabilities. On November 18, 2012, Nintendo released a next generation high definition gaming platform, The [[Wii U]], which includes TV remote control features in addition to IPTV streaming features like Netflix. The HD capabilities of the consoles has influenced some developers to port games from past consoles onto the PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U, often with remastered or upscaled graphics.

==Recording and compression==
{{Main|High-definition pre-recorded media and compression}}

HDTV can be recorded to [[D-VHS]] (Digital-VHS or Data-VHS), [[W-VHS]] (analog only), to an HDTV-capable [[digital video recorder]] (for example [[DirecTV]]'s high-definition [[Digital video recorder]], [[Sky+ HD|Sky HD]]'s set-top box, [[Dish Network]]'s VIP 622 or VIP 722 high-definition [[Digital video recorder]] receivers, or [[TiVo]]'s Series 3 or HD recorders), or an HDTV-ready [[HTPC]]. Some cable boxes are capable of receiving or recording two or more broadcasts at a time in HDTV format, and HDTV programming, some included in the monthly cable service subscription price, some for an additional fee, can be played back with the cable company's on-demand feature.

The massive amount of data storage required to archive uncompressed streams meant that inexpensive uncompressed storage options were not available to the consumer. In 2008, the Hauppauge 1212 Personal Video Recorder was introduced. This device accepts HD content through component video inputs and stores the content in MPEG-2 format in a .ts file or in a [[Blu-ray]] compatible format [[.m2ts]] file on the hard drive or DVD burner of a computer connected to the PVR through a USB 2.0 interface. More recent systems are able to record a broadcast high definition program in its 'as broadcast' format or transcode to a format more compatible with Blu-ray.

Analog tape recorders with bandwidth capable of recording analog HD signals, such as W-VHS recorders, are no longer produced for the consumer market and are both expensive and scarce in the secondary market.

In the United States, as part of the FCC's ''plug and play'' agreement, cable companies are required to provide customers who rent HD set-top boxes with a set-top box with "functional"&lt;!--quoted from agreement?--&gt; [[FireWire]] (IEEE 1394) on request. None of the [[direct broadcast satellite]] providers have offered this feature on any of their supported boxes, but some [[cable television|cable TV]] companies have. {{As of|2004|alt=As of July 2004}}, boxes are not included in the FCC mandate. This content is protected by encryption known as 5C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtcp.com/data/wp_spec.pdf|title=5C Digital Transmission Content Protection White Paper|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-06-20|date=1998-07-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060616075812/http://dtcp.com/data/wp_spec.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This encryption can prevent duplication of content or simply limit the number of copies permitted, thus effectively denying most if not all [[fair use]] of the content.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5518">'''Kavita Mahajan''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: कविता महाजन; 5 September 1967 – 27 September 2018) was an Indian author and translator who wrote in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. She is noted for her critically acclaimed novels ''Brr'' (2005), ''Bhinna'' (2007) and ''Kuhoo'' (2011), as well as a non-fiction work ''Graffiti Wall'' (2009). She was the winner of the 2011 translation award conferred by the [[Sahitya Akademi]], India's National Academy of Letters.&lt;ref name="Pune Mirror"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToPrint_MIRRORNEW&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=PMIR/2012/02/15&amp;ID=Ar00401|title=Sahitya Akademi award for Kavita Mahajan|publisher=''Pune Mirror'' |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Mahajan was born in the city of [[Nanded]] in [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news |title=Marathi litterateur Kavita Mahajan passes away in Pune |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/marathi-litterateur-kavita-mahajan-passes-away-in-pune/article25062776.ece |accessdate=28 September 2018 |work=The Hindu |date=28 September 2018 |language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of S.D. Mahajan, the ex-secretary of Marathi Vishwakosh and the grand daughter of the painter [[Tryambak Vasekar]].&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt;

==Literary career==
Mahajan wrote on themes of social emancipation and against discrimination.&lt;ref name=kon/&gt;  Mahajan's book '''Brr'' is a collection of stories about women [[sarpanch]] and their experience after the [[Panchayati raj (India)|Panchayati Raj]] system was implemented whilst she wrote ''Bhinna'' to describe the lives of those affected by [[HIV/AIDS]]. Both books bring out the politics of representation at three levels – one of the institutions like the Panchayats, the corruption in the non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and the intricacies of human relationships. Mahajan's work focuses on political, social, and economic matters rather than maternal or romantic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://footnotes.tiss.edu/the-fight-of-the-fiery-tongue-the-new-voices-of-marathi-women-writers-poets/|title=The Fight of the Fiery Tongue: New Women’s Voices in Marathi|publisher=''Footnotes'' |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahajan's 2011 novel, ''Kuhoo'' (कुहू) dealt with the relationship between human and nature, and was marketed as a 'multimedia novel'. It came with a DVD containing sights and sounds from nature, including a few animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maharashtratimes.indiatimes.com/-/articleshow/8324939.cms?null|title=कुहूचि अद्भुत दुनिया|publisher=''Maharashtra Times'' |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is also renowned for her poetry, including a collection entitled ''Dhulicha Awaz''.&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt;  In the same year she published ''Rajai'', a collection of 17 short stories by [[Ismat Chughtai]] which she translated from [[Urdu]] into Marathi. She was awarded that year's translation prize by the [[Sahitya Akademi]], India's National Academy of Letters, for this work.&lt;ref name="Pune Mirror"/&gt;

Mahajan also authored children's literature and published a collection of short stories ''Joyanache Ranga'' (Marathi: जोयानाचे रंग) in 2011. This collection won her the Shashikalatai Agashe Award for Children's Literature in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-VID-NAG-shashikal-aagashe-award-gose-to-author-kavita-mahajan-4144262-NOR.html|title=कविता महाजन, स्वाती काटे, पृथ्वीराज तौर यांना आगाशे पुरस्कार|publisher=''Divya Marathi'' |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in April 2016 at a programme organised by Dr. T.M.A. Pai Chair for Indian Literature at [[Manipal University]], she said: “I am a woman and before that I am a human being. If all are human beings, why is there discrimination? That is a question, which has haunted me from my childhood.”&lt;ref name=kon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://konkanconnect.com/home/udupi-marathi-novelist-kavita-mahajan-speaks-about-discrimination-in-society |title=Marathi novelist Kavita Mahajan speaks about discrimination in society|publisher=''KonkanConnect'' |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Mahajan died on 27 September 2018 of pneumonia at the [[Chellaram Diabetes Hospital]].&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt;  She was survived by her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Press Trust of India |title=Marathi writer Kavita Mahajan passes away |url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/marathi-writer-kavita-mahajan-passes-away-118092701284_1.html |work=Business Standard India |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only official language of the [[Falkland Islands]] is [[English language|English]], and this is spoken by almost everyone on a day-to-day basis. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is spoken by 10% of the population&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fig.gov.fk/policy/index.php/component/jdownloads/finish/5-statistics/4789-falkland-islands-census-2016-report-without-data-tables/0?Itemid=0#page=31|title=2016 Census Report|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=Policy and Economic Development Unit, Falkland Islands Government|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124213315/http://www.fig.gov.fk/policy/index.php/component/jdownloads/finish/5-statistics/4789-falkland-islands-census-2016-report-without-data-tables/0?Itemid=0|archive-date=2018-01-24|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a significant minority. Most of the Spanish speakers are immigrants, foreign workers, and expats, predominantly from [[Chilean people|Chile]] and [[Argentine people|Argentina]].

==Falkland English dialect==
{{main|Falkland Islands English}}
[[Falkland Islands]] [[English language|English]] is mainly [[British English|British]] in character.  However, as a result of the isolation of the islands, the small population has developed and retains its own accent/dialect, which persists despite a large number of immigrants from the [[United Kingdom]] in recent years. In rural areas (i.e. anywhere outside [[Port Stanley]]), known as  ‘[[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp]]’ (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''campo'' or ‘countryside’),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falklandislands.com/section.php/80/1/camping  Stay with us » Camping:  Falkland Islands Tourist Board]&lt;/ref&gt; the Falkland accent tends to be stronger. The dialect has resemblances to [[Australian English|Australian]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[West Country dialects|West Country]] and [[Norfolk dialect]]s of English, as well as [[Scots (language)|Lowland Scots]].

==Historic==
Several languages have been used historically in the Falkland Islands.

* [[French language|French]] – the French were the first to colonise the islands, and their settlement at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]] would have used French. The islands' French name, Iles Malouines, stems from [[Saint-Malo]].
* [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] – a missionary settlement on [[Keppel Island]] contained many [[Yaghan]]s from [[Tierra del Fuego]]. The [[Falkland Islands fox]] was previously hypothesized to represent a possible pre-European landing on the Falklands, but this has since been refuted.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwsciencedailycomreleaseshtm"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091102121449.htm | title = New Clues To Extinct Falklands Wolf Mystery | accessdate = 2011-09-03 | date = 2009-11-03 | work = EurekAlert | publisher = Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; This language has left no trace on the Falklands, and would not have been written at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Bridges, E L (1948) ''The Uttermost Part of the Earth'' Republished 2008, Overlook Press {{ISBN|978-1-58567-956-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scottish Gaelic]] – many early settlers were from the Gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland, including the [[Western Isles]] and the western [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. William Blain, a settler from [[Dumfries]], noted in 1878 that "the Scotch language was fairly well represented" and a majority of the population were "Scotch or of Scotch descendants".&lt;ref&gt;David Britain and Andrea Sudbury, "Falkland Islands English", in ''The Lesser-Known Varieties of English: An Introduction" (eds.

'''Linguistic landscape''' is the "visibility and salience of languages on public and commercial signs in a given territory or region" (Landry and Bourhis 1997:23). Linguistic landscape has been described as being "somewhere at the junction of sociolinguistics, sociology, social psychology, geography, and media studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sebba | first1 = Mark | year = 2010 | title = Review of ''Linguistic Landscapes: A Comparative Study of Urban Multilingualism in Tokyo.'' | url = | journal = Writing System Research | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 73–76 | doi=10.1093/wsr/wsp006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a concept used in [[sociolinguistics]] as scholars study how languages are visually used in [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] societies, from large metropolitan centers to Amazonia.&lt;ref&gt;Shulist, Sarah. 2018. Signs of status: language policy, revitalization, and visibility in urban Amazonia. ''Language Policy'' 17: 4, pp 523–543.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some public signs in Jerusalem are in Hebrew, English, and Arabic (Spolsky and Cooper 1991, Ben-Rafael, Shohamy, Amara, and Trumper-Hecht 2006).

==Development of the field of study==
Studies of the linguistic landscape have been published from research done around the world. The field of study is relatively recent; "the linguistic landscapes paradigm has evolved rapidly and while it has a number of key names associated with it, it currently has no clear orthodoxy or theoretical core" (Sebba 2010:73). A special issue of the ''[[International Journal of Multilingualism]]'' (3.1 in 2006) was devoted to the subject.  Also, the journal ''World Englishes'' published a themed issue of five papers as a "Symposium on [[World Englishes]] and Linguistic Landscapes: Five Perspectives" (2012, vol. 31.1). Similarly, an entire issue of the ''[[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]]'' (228 in 2014) was devoted to the subject, including looking at signs that show influences from one language on another language. In 2015 an academic journal devoted to this topic was launched, titled ''Linguistic Landscape: An International Journal'', from [[John Benjamins]].  There is also a series of academic conferences on the study of linguistic landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguisticlandscape7.berkeley.edu/|title=Linguistic Landscape 7 - 7-9 May 2015, UC Berkeley|author=|date=|work=berkeley.edu|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive, searchable Linguistic Landscape Bibliography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/linguistic_landscape_bibliography/items|title=Zotero - Groups &gt; Linguistic Landscape Bibliography &gt; Library|author=|date=|work=zotero.org|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Troyer|first1=Robert A. 2016|title=Linguistic Landscape Bibliography|url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/linguistic_landscape_bibliography/items|publisher=Zotero}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 special issue of Manusya (22, 2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manusya.journals.chula.ac.th/html/issue_detail.php?issue=70|title=Manusya :: Journal of Humanities|author=|date=|work=chula.ac.th|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; begins with a history and summary of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huebner|first1=Thom|title=Linguistic landscape: History, Trajectory and Pedagogy|journal=Manusya: Journal of the Humanities|date=2016|volume=2016|issue=22|pages=1–11|url=http://www.manusya.journals.chula.ac.th/files/essay/4.%20Linguistic%20Landscape%20History,%20Trajectory%20and%20Pedagogy_Thom_p.%201-11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because "the methodologies employed in the collection and categorisation of written signs is still controversial",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tufi | first1 = Stefania | last2 = Blackwood | first2 = Robert | year = 2010 | title = Trademarks in the linguistic landscape: methodological and theoretical challenges in qualifying brand names in the public space | url = | journal = International Journal of Multilingualism | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 197–210 | doi=10.1080/14790710903568417}}&lt;/ref&gt; basic research questions are still being discussed, such as: "do small, hand-made signs count as much as large, commercially made signs?". The original technical scope of "linguistic landscape" involved plural languages, and almost all writers use it in that sense, but Papen has applied the term to the way public writing is used in a monolingual way in a German city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papen | first1 = Uta | year = 2012 | title = Commercial discourses, gentrification and citizens' protest: the linguistic landscape of Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin | url = | journal = Journal of Sociolinguistics | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 56–80 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9841.2011.00518.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heyd has applied the term to the ways that English is written, and people's reactions to these ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyd | first1 = Theresa | year = 2014 | title = Folk-linguistic landscape | url = | journal = Language in Society | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 489–514 | doi=10.1017/s0047404514000530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The languages used in public signs indicate what languages are locally relevant, or give evidence of what languages are becoming locally relevant (Hult 2009; Kasanga 2012). In many multilingual countries, multilingual signs and packaging are taken for granted, especially as merchants try to attract as many customers as possible or people realize that they serve a multilingual community (Hult, 2014). In other places, it is a matter of law, as in Quebec, where signs cannot be in English only, but must include French (Bill 101, ''[[Charte de la langue française]]''). In Texas, some signs are required to be in English and Spanish, such as warning signs about consuming alcohol while pregnant.

[[File:Pseudo-French sign in American French restaurant.JPG|200px|left|Bathroom sign in French restaurant in USA, spelling "Toilets" to convey a French aura, but understood by unilingual English speakers.]]
In some cases, the signs themselves are [[Bilingual signs|multilingual signs]], reflecting an expected multilingual readership. In other cases, there are monolingual signs in different languages, written in relevant languages found within a multilingual community.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2009). Language ecology and linguistic landscape analysis. In E. Shohamy &amp; D. Gorter (Eds.), ''Linguistic landscape: Expanding the scenery'' (pp. 88-104). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2014). Drive-thru linguistic landscaping: Constructing a linguistically dominant place in a bilingual space. ''International Journal of Bilingualism, 18,'' 507-523.&lt;/ref&gt; Backhaus even points out that some signs are not meant to be understood so much as to appeal to readers via a more prestigious language (2007:58).
[[File:English-German tombstone in Texas.jpg|thumb|Information in English, Bible verse in German, Texas]]

Some signs are spelled to convey the aura of another language (sometimes genuinely spelled as in the other language, other times fictionally), but are still meant to be understood by monolinguals. For example, some signs in English are spelled in a way that conveys the aura of German or French, but are still meant to be understood by monolingual English speakers.

The study of linguistic landscape also examines such patterns as which languages are used for which types of institutions (e.g. country club, hospital, ethnic grocery store), which languages are used for more expensive/cheaper items (new cars or used cars), or which languages are used for more expensive/cheaper services (e.g. pool cleaning or washing machine repair). Also, linguistic landscape can be studied across an area, to see which neighborhoods have signs in which languages. For example, Carr (2017) examined the languages of three cities in Southeast Los Angeles in her dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Jhonni|date=2017|title=Signs of Our Times: Language Contact and Attitudes in the Linguistic Landscape of Southeast Los Angeles|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3k10h7g5|department=|journal=eScholarship|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic landscape can also be applied to the study of competing scripts for a single language. For example, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, some signs in Mongolia were erected in the traditional Mongolian script, not just Cyrillic (Grivelet 2001). Similarly, in some Cherokee speaking communities, street signs and other public signage is written with the [[Cherokee syllabary]] (Bender 2008). Also, license plates in Greek Cyprus have been printed with Greek or Roman letters in different eras.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitra Karoulla-Vrikki. 2013. Which alphabet on car number-plates in Cyprus? ''Language Problems and Language Planning 37.3: pp. 249–270&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carreg Fedd Ddwyieithog - Bilingual Gravestone - geograph.org.uk - 576196.jpg|thumb|left|Multilingual gravestone: Welsh, English, French]]

The study of the linguistic landscape can also show evidence of the presence and roles of different languages through history.&lt;ref&gt;Jam Blommaert. 2013. ''Ethnography, superdiversity, and linguistic landscapes: Chronicles of complexity.'' Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramamoorthy, L. (2002) Linguistic landscaping and reminiscences of French legacy: The case of Pondicherry. In N.H. Itagy and S.K. Singh (eds) ''Linguistic Landscaping in India'' (pp. 118–131). Mysore: Central Institute of Indian Languages/Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University.&lt;/ref&gt; Some early work on a specific form of linguistic landscape was done in cemeteries used by immigrant communities,&lt;ref&gt;Doris Francis, Georgina Neophytu, Leonie Kellaher. 2005. ''The Secret Cemetery.'' Oxford: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt; some languages being carved "long after the language ceased to be spoken" in the communities.&lt;ref&gt;p. 42. Kara VanDam. 2009. Dutch- American language shift: evidence from the grave. ''LACUS Forum XXXIV'' 33–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to larger public signage, some who study linguistic landscapes are now including the study of other public objects with multilingual texts, such as banknotes in India which are labeled in over a dozen languages.&lt;ref&gt;Larissa Aronin and Muiris Ó Laoire. 2012. The material culture of multilingualism. In Durk Gorter, Heiko F. Marten and Luk Van Mensel, eds., ''Minority Languages in the Linguistic Landscape'', pp. 229–318.

'''Model–test–model''' ('''MTM''') is a process that intends to use high-fidelity/high-resolution combat models to simulate and replicate field operational tests.&lt;ref&gt;Mansager, Bard K., "Model Test Model", NPS-MS-94-007, [[Naval Postgraduate School]], September 1994 [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA290429&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feigley, James, "Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle: Modeling &amp; Simulation in Acquisition", 9 September 1997 [http://acquisition.navy.mil/content/download/1499/7404/file/aaav.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menadue, Ion, Rees, Leanne, "Development and Operation of Virtual Helicopter Simulators as a Data Acquisition Tool for Operations Analysis", 3 May 2004 [http://www.siaa.asn.au/get/2395364967.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giadrosich, Donald L., "Operations research analysis in test and evaluation", 1995 [https://books.google.com/books?id=naYZwrI8fTIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=%22Model+Test+Model%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4cazJCJKky&amp;sig=pYH-U6KmBEBhSdIvKYbCL4oITCU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Zd9BSuu2LcSMtgeImMiTCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7]&lt;/ref&gt; The MTM Process is divided into 5 phases:

* '''Long-term planning''' – Identify the responsibility among interested organizations
* '''Pretest modeling''' – Modeler creates a model of a subject under test
* '''Field test''' – Modeler performs data gathering of subject under test
* '''Post-test modeling''' – Subject under test model input parameters are matched with subject under test–field–test output values
* '''Model validation/accreditation''' – Modeler provides sufficient evidence to a tester that a simulation adequately replicates field testing

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16728">In [[mathematics]],  the '''norm residue isomorphism theorem''' is a long-sought result relating [[Milnor K-theory|Milnor ''K''-theory]] and [[Galois cohomology]]. The result has a relatively elementary formulation and at the same time represents the key juncture in the proofs of many seemingly unrelated theorems from abstract algebra, theory of quadratic forms, algebraic K-theory and the theory of motives. The theorem asserts that a certain statement  holds true for any prime &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and any natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. [[John Milnor]]&lt;ref name="Milnor1970"&gt;Milnor (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; speculated that this theorem might be true for &lt;math&gt;\ell=2&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and this question became known as [[Milnor's conjecture]]. The general case was conjectured by [[Spencer Bloch]] and [[Kazuya Kato]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1986__63__107_0 Bloch, Spencer and Kato, Kazuya, "p-adic étale cohomology", Inst. Hautes Études Sci. Publ. Math. No. 63 (1986), p. 118]&lt;/ref&gt; and became known as the '''Bloch–Kato conjecture''' or  the '''motivic Bloch–Kato conjecture''' to distinguish it from the Bloch–Kato conjecture on [[special values of L-functions|values of ''L''-functions]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Spencer and Kato, Kazuya, "L-functions and Tamagawa numbers of motives", The Grothendieck Festschrift, Vol. I, 333–400, Progr. Math., 86, Birkhäuser Boston, Boston, MA, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  The norm residue isomorphism theorem was proved by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] using a number of highly innovative results of [[Markus Rost]].

==Statement==
For any integer ℓ invertible in a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; there is a map
&lt;math&gt;\partial : k^\times \rightarrow H^1(k, \mu_\ell) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu_\ell&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Galois module of ℓ-th roots of unity in some separable closure of ''k''.  It induces an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;k^\times/(k^\times)^\ell \cong H^1(k, \mu_\ell)&lt;/math&gt;.  The first hint that this is related to ''K''-theory is that &lt;math&gt;k^\times&lt;/math&gt; is the group ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'').  Taking the tensor products and applying the multiplicativity of étale cohomology yields an extension of the map &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; to maps:
:&lt;math&gt;\partial^n : k^\times \otimes \cdots \otimes k^\times \rightarrow H^n_{\rm\acute et}(k, \mu_\ell^{\otimes n}).&lt;/math&gt;
These maps have the property that, for every element ''a'' in &lt;math&gt;k \setminus \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\partial^n(\ldots,a,\ldots,1-a,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; vanishes.  This is the defining relation of Milnor ''K''-theory.  Specifically, Milnor ''K''-theory is defined to be the graded parts of the ring:
:&lt;math&gt;K^M_*(k) = T(k^\times)/(\{a \otimes (1-a) \colon a \in k \setminus \{0, 1\}\}),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T(k^\times)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[tensor algebra]] of the [[multiplicative group]] &lt;math&gt;k^\times&lt;/math&gt; and the quotient is by the [[two-sided ideal]] generated by all elements of the form &lt;math&gt;a \otimes (1 - a)&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore the map &lt;math&gt;\partial^n&lt;/math&gt; factors through a map:
:&lt;math&gt;\partial^n \colon K^M_n(k) \to H^n_{\rm\acute et}(k, \mu_\ell^{\otimes n}).&lt;/math&gt;
This map is called the '''Galois symbol''' or '''norm residue''' map.&lt;ref name=Sri146&gt;Srinivas (1996) p.146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GS108&gt;Gille &amp; Szamuely (2006) p.108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Efr221&gt;Efrat (2006) p.221&lt;/ref&gt;  Because étale cohomology with mod-ℓ coefficients is an ℓ-torsion group, this map additionally factors through &lt;math&gt;K^M_n(k) / \ell&lt;/math&gt;.

The norm residue isomorphism theorem (or Bloch–Kato conjecture) states that for a field ''k'' and an integer ℓ that is invertible in ''k'', the norm residue map
:&lt;math&gt;\partial^n : K_n^M(k)/\ell \to H^n_{\rm\acute et}(k, \mu_\ell^{\otimes n})&lt;/math&gt;
from [[Milnor K-theory]]  mod-ℓ to [[étale cohomology]] is an isomorphism.  The case {{nowrap|1=ℓ = 2}} is the [[Milnor conjecture]], and the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} is the Merkurjev–Suslin theorem.&lt;ref name=Efr221/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sri&gt;Srinivas (1996) pp.145-193&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The étale cohomology of a field is identical to [[Galois cohomology]], so the conjecture equates the ℓth cotorsion (the quotient by the subgroup of ℓ-divisible elements) of the Milnor ''K''-group of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' with the [[Galois cohomology]] of ''k'' with coefficients in the Galois module of ℓth roots of unity.  The point of the conjecture is that there are properties that are easily seen for Milnor ''K''-groups but not for Galois cohomology, and vice versa; the norm residue isomorphism theorem makes it possible to apply techniques applicable to the object on one side of the isomorphism to the object on the other side of the isomorphism.

The case when ''n'' is 0 is trivial, and the case when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}} follows easily from [[Hilbert's Theorem 90]].  The case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} and {{nowrap|1=ℓ = 2}} was proved by {{harv|Merkurjev|1981}}.  An important advance was the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} and ℓ arbitrary.  This case was proved by {{harv|Merkurjev|Suslin|1982}} and is known as the '''Merkurjev–Suslin theorem'''.  Later, Merkurjev and Suslin, and independently, Rost, proved the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} and {{nowrap|1=ℓ = 2}} {{harv|Merkurjev|Suslin|1991}} {{harv|Rost|1986}}.

The name "norm residue" originally referred to the [[Hilbert symbol]] &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2)&lt;/math&gt;, which takes values in the [[Brauer group]] of ''k'' (when the field contains all ℓ-th roots of unity).  Its usage here is in analogy with standard [[local class field theory]] and is expected to be part of an (as yet undeveloped) "higher" class field theory.

The norm residue isomorphism theorem implies the [[Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture]].  It is equivalent to a theorem whose statement was once referred to as the [[Norm residue isomorphism theorem#Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjecture|Beilinson–Lichtenbaum conjecture]].

===History of the proof===

Milnor's conjecture was proved by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]].&lt;ref name="Voev1995"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0076/|title=Voevodsky,Vladimir. "Bloch-Kato conjecture for Z/2-coefficients and algebraic Morava K-theories" (1995)|author=|date=|website=UIUC.edu|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voev1996"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0170/|title=Voevodsky, Vladimir, "The Milnor Conjecture" (1996)|author=|date=|website=UIUC.edu|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voev2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0502/|title=Voevodsky, Vladimir, "On 2-torsion in motivic cohomology" (2001)|author=|date=|website=UIUC.edu|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voev2003b"&gt;Voevodsky, Vladimir, "Motivic cohomology with Z/2-coefficients", ''Publ. Math. Inst. Hautes Études Sci.'' No. 98 (2003), 59–104.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Later Voevodsky proved the general Bloch–Kato conjecture.&lt;ref name="Voev2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0639/|title=Voevodsky, Vladimir, "On motivic cohomology with Z/l-coefficients" (2008)|author=|date=|website=UIUC.edu|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voev2010"&gt;Voevodsky (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point for the proof is a series of conjectures due to {{harvtxt|Lichtenbaum|1983}} and {{harvtxt|Beilinson|1987}}. They conjectured the existence of ''motivic complexes'', complexes of sheaves whose cohomology was related to [[motivic cohomology]].  Among the conjectural properties of these complexes were three properties: one connecting their Zariski cohomology to Milnor's K-theory, one connecting their etale cohomology to cohomology with coefficients in the sheaves of roots of unity and one connecting their Zariski cohomology to their etale cohomology. These three properties implied, as a very special case, that the norm residue map should be an isomorphism. The essential characteristic of the proof is that it uses the induction on the "weight" (which equals the dimension of the cohomology group in the conjecture) where the inductive step requires knowing not only the statement of Bloch-Kato conjecture but the much more general statement that contains a large part of the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjectures. It often occurs in proofs by induction that the statement being proved has to be strengthened in order to prove the inductive step. In this case the strengthening that was needed required the development of a very large amount of new mathematics.

The earliest proof of Milnor's conjecture is contained in a 1995 preprint of Voevodsky&lt;ref name="Voev1995"/&gt; and is inspired by the idea that there should be algebraic analogs of [[Morava K-theory|Morava ''K''-theory]] (these [[algebraic Morava K-theories]] were later constructed by [[Simone Borghesi]]&lt;ref name="Borghesi2000"&gt;Borghesi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;). In a 1996 preprint, Voevodsky was able to remove Morava ''K''-theory from the picture by introducing instead [[algebraic cobordism]]s  and using some of their properties that were not proved at that time (these properties were proved later). The constructions of 1995 and 1996 preprints are now known to be correct but the first completed proof of Milnor's conjecture used a somewhat different scheme.

It is also the scheme that the proof of the full Bloch–Kato conjecture follows. It was devised by Voevodsky a few months after the 1996 preprint appeared. Implementing this scheme required making substantial advances in the field of [[motivic homotopy theory]] as well as finding a way to build algebraic varieties with a specified list of properties.  From the motivic homotopy theory the proof required the following:
#A construction of the motivic analog of the basic ingredient of the [[Spanier–Whitehead duality]] in the form of the motivic fundamental class as a morphism from the motivic sphere to the [[Thom space]] of the motivic normal bundle over a smooth projective algebraic variety.
#A construction of the motivic analog of the [[Steenrod algebra]].
#A proof of the proposition stating that over a field of characteristic zero the [[motivic Steenrod algebra]] characterizes all bi-stable cohomology operations in the motivic cohomology.

The first two constructions were developed by Voevodsky by 2003. Combined with the results that had been known since late 1980s, they were sufficient to reprove the [[Milnor conjecture]].

Also in 2003, Voevodsky published on the web a preprint that nearly contained a proof of the general theorem.  It followed the original scheme but was missing the proofs of three statements.  Two of these statements were related to the properties of the motivic Steenrod operations and required the third fact above, while the third one required then-unknown facts about "norm varieties". The properties that these varieties were required to have had been formulated by Voevodsky in 1997, and the varieties themselves had been constructed by Markus Rost in 1998–2003.  The proof that they have the required properties was completed by [[Andrei Suslin]] and [[Seva Joukhovitski]] in 2006.

The third fact above required the development of new techniques in motivic homotopy theory.  The goal was to prove that a functor, which was not assumed to commute with limits or colimits, preserved weak equivalences between objects of a certain form. One of the main difficulties there was that the standard approach to the study of weak equivalences is based on Bousfield–Quillen factorization systems and [[model category]] structures, and these were inadequate.  Other methods had to be developed, and this work was completed by Voevodsky only in 2008.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In the course of developing these techniques, it became clear that the first statement used without proof in Voevodsky's 2003 preprint is false. The proof had to be modified slightly to accommodate the corrected form of that statement. While Voevodsky continued to work out the final details of the proofs of the main theorems about motivic [[Eilenberg–MacLane space]]s, [[Charles Weibel]] invented an approach to correct the place in the proof that had to modified. Weibel also published in 2009 a paper that contained a summary of the Voevodsky's constructions combined with the correction that he discovered.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Beilinson–Lichtenbaum conjecture==
{{see also|Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture}}
Let ''X'' be a smooth variety over a field containing &lt;math&gt;1/\ell&lt;/math&gt;.  Beilinson and Lichtenbaum conjectured that the [[motivic cohomology]] group &lt;math&gt;H^{p,q}(X, \mathbf{Z}/\ell)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the [[étale cohomology]] group &lt;math&gt;H^p_{\rm\acute et}(X, \mu^{\otimes q}_\ell)&lt;/math&gt; when ''p''&amp;le;''q''.  This conjecture has now been proven, and is equivalent to the norm residue isomorphism theorem.

'''''On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves''''' is an 1860 [[dissertation]] written by Dr. [[Albert Niemann (chemist)|Albert Niemann]]. Its title in German is ''Über eine neue organische Base in den Cocablättern''. The piece describes, in detail, how Niemann isolated [[cocaine]], a [[crystalline]] [[alkaloid]].  It also earned Niemann his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] and is now in the [[British Library]].  He wrote of the alkaloid's "colourless transparent prisms" and said that, "Its solutions have an alkaline reaction, a bitter taste, promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue." Niemann named the alkaloid "cocaine" — as with other alkaloids its name carried the "-ine" [[suffix]].

The '''Oral History Society''' promotes the collection, preservation and use of recorded memories of the past.

As well as offering practical advice and support, the Society aims to raise standards in [[oral history]] practices across a range of activities and disciplines.

Through an annual conference, other meetings, a web site and the ''Oral History'' journal the Society encourages individuals to share ideas, experience and good practice.

The Society also provides a voice for oral historians advising and collaborating with national organisations and research councils on oral history

==Origins and history==
The British-based organisation was founded in 1973, with its origins in an informal day conference at the British Institute of Recorded Sound (BIRS) in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;George Ewart Evans, Thea Thompson, Tony Green, Theo Barker and Patrick Saul, ‘The Leicester Conference on the problems of Oral History',  ''Oral History'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (1972), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years support for the Society was drawn from amongst labour and social historians as well as archivists, folklorists, ethnographers and researchers in oral tradition (including the [[School of Scottish Studies]]). By the second half of the 1970s the Society also included feminist historians and others interested in women's history. The ''Oral History'' journal, founded by [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)|Paul Thompson]], has echoed these interests and many more in the articles it has published. Often featuring oral histories of individuals or groups who have been under-represented in historical accounts, from the first edition ''Oral History'' has also provided a forum for oral historians to discuss the methods and challenges involved in the collection, interpretation and dissemination of oral testimonies.

The journal has long maintained a news section that includes reports from community projects as well as a reviews section. This reflects the Society's policy of representing oral historians no matter where they work whether it is in education, community organisations or the media.

==Current activities==
Current activities include providing more than 300 training places each year; supporting over 40 experienced oral historians as locally based Regional Networkers - a point of contact for anyone interested in oral history; offering technical, legal and ethical advice; providing information on the funding of oral history work; and publishing two editions of ''Oral History'' each year. Members also receive a free e-newsletter several times a year with briefings and news items.

==Governance and structures==
A Committee of Trustees meets four times a year. Trustees are responsible for the governance of the Society and are elected at the Society's Annual General Meeting which is held at the Society's annual conference. Officers' positions of the Society include a Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary and Treasurer who are also elected annually.

A key structure of the Society is the Regional Network consisting of oral historians who offer a first point of contact in localities throughout Britain and Northern Ireland. The Trustees' sub-committees reflect the priority areas and include a Nominations Committee, Higher Education Group, Trainers Group and an Archives Sub-Committee. The journal has its own Editorial Committee.

The '''revival of the Hebrew language''' took place in [[Europe]] and [[Israel (region)|Israel]] toward the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, through which the language's usage changed from the [[sacred language]] of [[Judaism]] to a [[spoken language|spoken]] and [[written language]] used for daily life in [[Israel]]. The process began as a [[Jewish ethnic divisions|diversity of Jews]] started arriving and establishing themselves alongside [[Old Yishuv|the pre-existing Jewish community]] of Palestine in the first half of the nineteenth century, when veteran [[Palestinian Jews|Jews in Palestine]] (largely Arabic-speaking by that time) and the linguistically diverse [[Olim|newly arrived Jews]] all switched to use [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] as a [[lingua franca]],&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, Tudor (1972) 'The Use of Hebrew in Palestine 1800–1822.' Journal of Semitic Studies, 17 (2). pp. 237-252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TUDOR PARFITT; THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE OLD YISHUV TO THE REVIVAL OF HEBREW, Journal of Semitic Studies, Volume XXIX, Issue 2, 1 October 1984, Pages 255–265, https://doi.org/10.1093/jss/XXIX.2.255&lt;/ref&gt; the historical linguistic common denominator of all the Jewish groups. At the same time, a parallel development in Europe changed Hebrew from primarily a sacred [[liturgical language]] into a [[literary language]]&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, Tudor (1983) 'Ahad Ha-Am's Role in the Revival and Development of Hebrew.' In: Kornberg, J., (ed.), At the crossroads: essays on Ahad Ha-am. New York: State University of New York Press, pp. 12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; which played a key role in the development of nationalist educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, Tudor (1995) 'Peretz Smolenskin, the Revival of Hebrew and Jewish Education.' In: Abramson, G. and Parfitt, T., (eds.), Jewish education and learning : published in honour of Dr. David Patterson on the occasion of his seventieth birthday. Chur, Switzerland: Harwood Academic Publishers, pp. 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modern Hebrew]] was one of three [[official language]]s of [[Mandatory Palestine]], and after the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] in 1948, one of two official languages of Israel, along with [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Arabic]]. In July 2018, a [[Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People|new law]] made Hebrew the sole official language of the state of Israel, with Arabic having "special status".&lt;ref name="NYT 2018"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-07-21|title=Israeli Law Declares the Country the ‘Nation-State of the Jewish People’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/middleeast/israel-law-jews-arabic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than purely a linguistic process, the revival of Hebrew was utilized by Jewish [[Haskalah|modernization]] and [[Jewish political movements|political movements]], and became a tenet of the ideology associated with settlement of the land, [[Zionism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], ''A History of the Jews'', p.442. " Yet in all [of young [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s] activity, three salient principles remained constant. First, Jews must make it their priority to return to the land; ‘the settlement of the land is the only true Zionism, all else being self-deception, empty verbiage and merely a pastime’. [Quoted in Encyclopaedia Judaica, iv 506.] Second, the structure of the new community must be designed to assist this process within a socialist framework. Third, the cultural binding of the Zionist society must be the Hebrew language.&lt;/ref&gt; and Israeli policy.

The process of Hebrew's return to regular usage is unique; there are no other examples of a [[natural language]] without any native speakers subsequently acquiring several million native speakers, and no other examples of a sacred language becoming a [[national language]] with millions of "first language" speakers.

The language's revival eventually brought linguistic additions with it. While the initial leaders of the process insisted they were only continuing "from the place where Hebrew's vitality was ended", what was created  represented a broader basis of language acceptance; it includes characteristics derived from all periods of Hebrew language, as well as from the [[Jewish languages|non-Hebrew languages]] used by the long-established European, North African, and Middle Eastern Jewish communities, with [[Yiddish]] (the European variant) being predominant.

[[File:1524 dictionary by Yuhanna al-Asad and Jacob Mantino Arabic-Hebrew-Latin p alif.jpg|thumb|[[Arabic]]–[[Hebrew]]–[[Latin]] [[dictionary]], 1524]]
[[File:MSKaufmannA77p1.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Mishneh Torah]], [[Hebrew alphabet|written in Hebrew]] by [[Maimonides]].]]

Historical records testify to the existence of Hebrew from the 10th century BCE&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hebrewbibleacademy.org/single-post/The-Origin-of-the-Hebrew-Language The Origin of the Hebrew Language]&lt;/ref&gt; to the late [[Second Temple period]] (lasting to c. 70 CE), after which the language developed into [[Mishnaic Hebrew]]. (From about the 6th century BCE until the [[Middle Ages]], many Jews spoke a related Semitic language, [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].) From the 2nd century CE until the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language ''[[circa]]'' 1880, Hebrew served as a [[Literary language|literary]] and official language and as the Judaic [[sacred language|language of prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Short History of the Hebrew Language,'' Chaim Rabin, Jewish Agency and Alpha Press, Jerusalem, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; After the spoken usage of Mishnaic Hebrew ended in the 2nd century CE, Hebrew had not been spoken as a [[mother tongue]].

Even so, during the Middle Ages, [[Jews]] used the language in a wide variety of disciplines. This usage kept alive a substantial portion of the traits characteristic of Hebrew. First and foremost, [[Classical Hebrew]] was preserved in full through well-recognized sources, chiefly the [[Tanakh]] (especially those portions used liturgically like the [[Torah]], [[Haftarah|Haftarot]], [[The Five Scrolls|Megilot]], and the [[Book of Psalms]]) and the [[Mishnah]]. Apart from these, Hebrew was known through [[hymns]], [[prayers]], [[midrashim]], and the like.

During the Middle Ages, Hebrew continued in use as a written language in Rabbinical literature, including in judgments of [[Halakha]], [[Responsa]], and books of meditation. In most cases, certainly in the base of Hebrew's revival, 18th- and 19th-century Europe, the use of Hebrew was not at all natural, but heavy in flowery language and quotations, non-grammatical forms, and mixing-in of other languages, especially Aramaic.

Hebrew was used not only in written form but also as an articulated language, in [[synagogues]] and in [[Beth midrash|batei midrash]]. Thus, [[Biblical Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]] and the pronunciation of [[vowels]] and [[consonants]] were preserved. Despite this, regional influences of other languages caused many changes, leading to the development of different forms of pronunciation:
* [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], used by Eastern and Western European Jews, maintained mostly the structure of vowels but may have moved the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and lost the [[gemination]], although this cannot be known for certain, as there are no recordings of how the language (or its respective dialects) sounded e.g. in Kana'an; Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation has a variation of vowels and consonants, which follows closely the variation of the vowel  and consonant signs written down by the masoretes around the 7th century CE, indicating that there is a strong link with the language heard by them. For example, where we see two different vowel signs, or a consonant with or without a dogeish ([[dagesh]]), a difference is also heard in the various Ashkenazic pronunciations.
* [[Sephardi Hebrew]], used by [[Sephardi Jews]], preserved a structure different from the recognized [[Tiberian Hebrew]] [[niqqud]] of only five vowels, but did preserve the consonants, the grammatical stress, the [[dagesh]], and the [[schwa]]; however, different ways of writing consonants are not always heard in all Sephardic pronunciations. For example, the Dutch Sephardic pronunciation does not distinguish between the beth with and without dagesh: both are pronounced as "b". The "taf" is always pronounced as "t", with or without dagesh. There are at least two possibilities to explain the merger: the difference disappeared over time in the Sephardic pronunciations, or it never was there in the first place: the pronunciation stems from a separate Hebrew dialect, which always was there, and which for example the Masoretes did not use as reference.
* [[Yemenite Hebrew]], thought by Aaron Bar-Adon&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise And Decline of a Dialect ---- A Study in the Revival of Modern Hebrew|last=Bar-Adon|first=Aaron|publisher=|year=1975|isbn=|location=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to preserve much of the Classical Hebrew pronunciation, was barely known when the revival took place.

Within each of these groups, there also existed different subsets of pronunciation. For example, differences existed between the Hebrew used by [[Polish Jewry]] and that of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewry]] and of [[German Jews|German Jewry]].

In the fifty years preceding the start of the revival process, a version of spoken Hebrew already existed in the markets of [[Jerusalem]]. The Sephardic Jews who spoke [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] or [[Arabic]] and the Ashkenazi Jews who spoke Yiddish needed a common language for commercial purposes. The most obvious choice was Hebrew. Although Hebrew was spoken in this case, it was not a native mother tongue, but more of a [[pidgin]].

The linguistic situation against which background the revival process occurred was one of [[diglossia]], when two languages—one of prestige and class and another of the masses—exist within one culture. In Europe, this phenomenon has waned, starting with [[English language|English]] in the 16th century, but there were still differences between spoken street language and written language. Among the Jews of Europe, the situation resembled that of the general population, but with:
* Yiddish as the spoken language
* the language of the broader culture (depending on the country), used for secular speech and writing
* Hebrew employed for liturgical purposes

In the Arab Middle East, [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] and Colloquial Arabic were the spoken languages most prevalent in Jewish communities (with Ladino more prevalent in the Mediterranean and Arabic, Aramaic, Kurdish, and Persian more widely spoken by Jews in the East), while [[Classical Arabic]] was used for secular writing, and Hebrew used for religious purposes (though some Jewish scholars from the Arab world, such as [[Maimonedes]] (1135-1204), wrote primarily in Arabic or in  [[Judeo-Arabic|Judeo-Arabic languages]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eretz Israel and Its Yishuv in the 19th Century, 1777-1917|last=Eliav|first=Mordechai|publisher=|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revival of literary Hebrew ==
The revival of the Hebrew language in practice advanced in two parallel strains: The revival of written-literary Hebrew and the revival of spoken Hebrew. In the first few decades, the two processes were not connected to one another and even occurred in different places: Literary Hebrew was renewed in Europe's cities, whereas spoken Hebrew developed mainly in Palestine. The two movements began to merge only in the beginning of the 1900s, and an important point in this process was the immigration of [[Haim Nahman Bialik]] to Palestine in 1924. But after the transfer of literary Hebrew to Palestine, a substantial difference between spoken and written Hebrew remained, and this difference persists today. The characteristics of spoken Hebrew only began to seep into literature in the 1940s, and only in the 1990s did spoken Hebrew start widely appearing in novels.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/~izreel/publications/Emergence_Hary2003(corr).pdf|title=The Emergence of Spoken Israeli Hebrew|last=Izre'el|first=Shlomo|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hebrew during the Haskalah ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
[[File:Shakspeare1816.png|thumb|200px|First known [[translation]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] to Hebrew by [[Solomon Löwisohn|Solomon Löwishn]], 1816. The "Are at this hour asleep!" [[monologue]] from [[Henry IV, Part 2]].]]
A preceding process to the revival of literary Hebrew took place during the [[Haskalah]], the Jewish movement paralleling the secular [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Members of this movement, called ''maskilim'' (משכילים), who sought to distance themselves from Rabbinic Judaism, decided that Hebrew, specifically [[Biblical Hebrew]], was deserving of fine literature. They considered Mishnaic Hebrew and other varieties of Hebrew to be defective and unfit for writing. The Haskalah-era literature written in Hebrew based itself upon two central principles: [[Purism (language)|Purism]] and flowery language. Purism was a principle which dictated that all words used should be of biblical origin (even if the meaning was not biblical). The principle of flowery language was based on bringing full verses and expressions as they were from the Tanakh, and the more flowery a verse was, the more quality it was said to possess. Another linguistic trait thought to increase a text's prestige was the use of [[hapax legomena]], words appearing only once in the text.

But while it was easy to write stories taking place in the biblical period and dealing with biblical topics, Haskalah-era writers began to find it more and more difficult to write about contemporary topics. This was due mostly to the lack of a broad and modern [[vocabulary]], meaning translating books about [[science]] and [[mathematics]] or [[European literature]] was difficult. Although an earlier, little known attempt at scientific writing was made when Israel Wolf Sperling translated [[Jules Verne|Jules Verne's]] [[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]] and [[Journey to the Center of the Earth]] in 1877 and 1878,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Books by Israel Wolf Sperling|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Sperling%2C%20Israel%20Wolf|accessdate=26 September 2016|website=onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; this barrier was breached with more lasting effect in the 1880s by a writer named [[Mendele Mocher Sfarim]].

Another difficulty faced by Haskalah Hebrew writers was that the audience was exclusively male with profound study background, which meant that women and the less educated men were pushed against reading Hebrew by reading Yiddish literature, which led a number of writers to write in Yiddish to find audiences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Marriage Made in Heaven---The Sexual Politics of Hebrew and Yiddish|last=Seidman|first=Naomi|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=0-520-20193-0|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hebrew writers ===

==== Mendele Mocher Sfarim ====
[[File:Mendele Mos.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Mendele Mocher Sfarim]]]]
Ya'akov Abramovitch (1846-1917), is often known by the name of his main character, "Mendele Mocher Sfarim" (מוכר ספרים), meaning "bookseller." He began writing in Hebrew as a Haskalah writer and wrote according to all the conventions of Haskalah-era literature. At a certain point, he decided to write in Yiddish and caused a linguistic revolution, which was expressed in the widespread usage of Yiddish in Hebrew literature. After a long break he returned in 1886 to writing in Hebrew, but decided to ignore the rules of biblical Hebrew, and proponents of that style, like [[Abraham Mapu]], and added into the vocabulary a host of words from the Rabbinic Age and the Middle Ages. His new fluid and varied style of Hebrew writing reflected the Yiddish spoken around him, while still retaining all the historical strata of Hebrew.

Mendele's language was considered a synthetic one, as it consisted of different echelons of Hebrew development and was not a direct continuation of a particular echelon. However, today, his language is often considered a continuation of Rabbinic Hebrew, especially grammatically. He was considered as the representative figure who provided great literatures to whichever language he was associated with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Devorah Baron ====
[[Devorah Baron]] (also spelled Dvora Baron and Deborah Baron) (December 4, 1887 - August 20, 1956), was a Hebrew writer who fascinated the readers by her uniqueness of the language in Eastern Europe, which was dominant by Yiddish speakers. Her early writings mostly involve the feminine Yiddish traditions, and she worked on more feminist topics in her later writings. The topics were mostly divided into two sort:(1) the marginalization of female in the religious and family life;(2) the tension between men and women, and between generation to generation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Other figures ====
See also [[Robert Alter]], and his book ''The Invention of Hebrew Prose'', who has done significant work on modern Hebrew literature and the context which enabled the language to revive itself via creative writing.  The book has a large section on Abramovitch.  [[Yael S. Feldman]] also gives a short overview of Mendele and his milieu in her book ''Modernism and Cultural Transfer''.  She notes the influence of Yiddish on his Hebrew, and traces this language interaction to [[Gabriel Preil]], the last Haskalah poet of America.

Eventually, writers like [[Yosef Haim Brenner]] would break from Mendele's style, and utilize more experimental techniques.

=== Continuation of the literary revival ===
Mendele's style was excitedly adopted by contemporary writers and spread quickly. It was also expanded into additional fields: [[Asher Ginsberg|Ahad Ha'am]] wrote an article in 1889 using the style entitled "This is not the Way," and [[Haim Nahman Bialik]] expanded it into [[poetry]] with his poem "To the Bird" of the same year. Additionally, great efforts were taken to write scientific books in Hebrew, for which the vocabulary of scientific and technical terms was greatly increased. At the same time, Europe saw the rise of Hebrew language newspapers and magazines, while even sessions and discussions of Zionist groups were conducted and transcribed in Hebrew. In addition, poets and writers such as David Frischmann and Sha'ul Tschernichovsky began avidly translating European works into Hebrew, from the Finnish epic the Kalevala to works by Molière, Goethe, Shakespeare, Homer, Byron, Lermontov, and Aeschylus. At the same time, writers like Micah Yosef Berdichevsky and Uri-Nissan Gnessin began to write complex works of short fiction and novels in Hebrew, using the language to express psychological realism and interiority for the first time. As Hebrew poets and writers began arriving in Palestine armed with the new literary language, they exerted a certain amount of influence on the development of spoken Hebrew as well.

== Revival of spoken Hebrew ==
[[File:BYwork.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], working]]
Jewish communities with different colloquial languages had used Hebrew to communicate with each other across Europe and the Near East since the Middle Ages. As Jews in Palestine spoke a variety of languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], and [[French language|French]], inter-communal affairs that required verbal communication were handled in a modified form of Medieval Hebrew. Hebrew was used by Jews from different linguistic backgrounds in marketplaces in Jerusalem since at least the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/This-week-in-history-Revival-of-the-Hebrew-language&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/eliezer-ben-yehuda/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] (1858–1922) (אליעזר בן יהודה), is often regarded as the "reviver of the Hebrew language" ("מחיה השפה העברית"),&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; yet his major contributions were ideological and symbolic;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=S.I. Agnon utchiyat halashon ha'ivrit|last=Bar-Adon|first=Aaron|publisher=|year=1977|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the first to raise the concept of reviving Hebrew, to publish articles in newspapers on the topic, and he took part in the project known as the [[Ben-Yehuda Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The first Hebrew schools were established in these settlements, Hebrew increasingly became a spoken language of daily affairs, and finally became a systematic and national language. Yet Ben-Yehuda's fame and notoriety stems from his initiation and symbolic leadership of the Hebrew revival.

Ben-Yehuda's main innovation in the revival of the Hebrew language lies in his having "invented" many new words to denote objects unknown in Jewish antiquity, or which had long been forgotten in their original Hebrew usage and context. He invented words such as ''ḥatzil'' (חציל) for an [[eggplant]] (aubergine) and ''ḥashmal'' (חשמל) for electricity.&lt;ref&gt;These words are marked as "New Words" in the [[Even-Shoshan Dictionary|Even-Shoshan Hebrew Dictionary]], s.v. חצילים; see: [[Nathan ben Abraham I#Modern Hebrew usages|Modern Hebrew usages]]. ''Ḥashmal'' is found only once in the Hebrew Bible, in Ezekiel's vision of the chariot (Ezek. 1:4; 1:27), but has been explained in a medieval Judeo-Arabic lexicon (reprinted in the book, ''Jewish Culture in Muslim Lands and Cairo Geniza Studies'', ed. Yosef Tobi, Tel-Aviv University: Tel-Aviv 2006, p. 61 [note 114]) as being some angelic entity which had "utmost strength". Others have explained it to mean an angel that changes hues.&lt;/ref&gt; As no Hebrew equivalent could be found for the names of certain produce endemic to the [[New World]], they devised new Hebrew words for [[maize]] and [[tomato]], calling them ''tiras'' (תירס) and ''ʿagbaniyyah'' (עגבניה), respectively. The latter word is derived from the shape of the vegetable, which resembled a buttocks (ʿagaḇīm).{{citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=עגבים means something like &amp;quot;flirting&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;making love&amp;quot; in modern Hebrew.}} Sometimes, old Hebrew words took on different meanings altogether. For example, the Hebrew word ''kǝvīš'' (כביש), which now denotes a "street" or a "road," is actually an [[Aramaic]] adjective meaning "trodden down; blazoned", rather than a common noun. It was originally used to describe "a ''blazoned'' trail."&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Rashi]]'s commentary on Exodus 9:17, where he says the word ''mesilah'' is translated in Aramaic ''oraḥ kevīsha'' (A blazoned trail); the word "kevīsh" being only an adjective or descriptive word, but not a common noun as it is used today. It is said that [[Ze'ev Yavetz]] (1847–1924) is he that coined this modern Hebrew word for “road.” See [http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/with-tu-bishvat-near-a-tree-grows-in-zichron-yaakov.premium-1.496141 Haaretz, Contributions made by Ze'ev Yavetz]; {{cite news | last =Maltz | first =Judy | coauthors = | title =With Tu Bishvat Near, a Tree Grows in Zichron Yaakov| work = | pages = | language = English|publisher =Haaretz | date =25 January 2013 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/with-tu-bishvat-near-a-tree-grows-in-zichron-yaakov.premium-1.496141?=&amp;ts=_1490626484939 | accessdate =27 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In what most rabbis view as an error, Ben-Yehuda is accredited with introducing the new Hebrew word ''ribah'' (ריבה) for "confiture; marmalade", believing it to be derived from the lexical root ''reḇaḇ'', and related to the Arabic word ''murabba'' (jam; fruit conserves; marmalade).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpress.nli.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=7rbZiRNBBORpwR15m80VYK4gT1Ndb8RkGXchrgpc%2Ff5euYFY4pa9VCQjKBuszzvpYw%3D%3D&amp;mode=image&amp;href=HZV%2F1888%2F03%2F09&amp;page=4&amp;rtl=true Eliezer Ben-Yehuda on the use of the word ''ribah'' for confiture (in Hebrew)]. ''[[HaZvi|Ha-Zvi]]'', 9 March 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; He also invented the word ''tapuz'' (תפוז) for the citrus fruit orange, which is a combination of ''tapuaḥ'' (apple) + ''zahav'' (golden), or "golden apple."

The revival of spoken Hebrew can be separated into three stages, which are concurrent with (1) the First Aliyah, (2) the Second Aliyah, and (3) the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]] period. In the first period, the activity centered on Hebrew schools in the Settlements and in the Pure Language Society;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; in the second period, Hebrew was used in assembly meetings and public activities; and in the third period, it became the language used by the [[Yishuv]], the Jewish population during the Mandate Period, for general purposes. At this stage, Hebrew possessed both spoken and written forms, and its importance was reflected in the official status of Hebrew during the British Mandate.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; All of the stages were characterized by the establishment of many organizations that took an active and ideological part in Hebrew activities. This resulted in the establishment of Hebrew high schools (גימנסיות), the [[Hebrew University]], the [[Jewish Legion]], the [[Histadrut]] labor organization, and in [[Tel Aviv]] – the first Hebrew city.

Throughout all periods, Hebrew signified for both its proponents and detractors the [[antithesis]] of Yiddish. Against the exilic Yiddish language stood revived Hebrew, the language of [[Zionism]], of grassroots pioneers, and above all, of the transformation of the Jews into a Hebrew nation with its own land. Yiddish was degradingly referred to as a [[jargon]], and its speakers encountered harsh opposition, which finally led to a Language War between Yiddish and Hebrew.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nonetheless, Ghil'ad Zuckermann believes that "Yiddish is a primary contributor to [[Israeli Hebrew]] because it was the [[mother tongue]] of the vast majority of language revivalists and first pioneers in [[Eretz Yisrael]] at the crucial period of the beginning of Israeli Hebrew".&lt;ref name="See p 2006 pp. 57-71"&gt;See p. 63 in Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2006), "A New Vision for 'Israeli Hebrew': Theoretical and Practical Implications of Analysing Israel's Main Language as a Semi-Engineered Semito-European Hybrid Language", ''Journal of Modern Jewish Studies'' 5 (1), pp. 57-71.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zuckermann, although the revivalists wished to speak Hebrew with [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[grammar]] and [[pronunciation]], they could not avoid the [[Ashkenazi]] [[mindset]] arising from their [[Europe]]an background. He argues that their attempt to deny their [[European ethnic groups|European]] roots, negate [[Diaspora|diasporism]] and avoid [[hybridity]] (as reflected in Yiddish) failed. "Had the language revivalists been [[Arabic]]-speaking [[Jews]] (e.g. from [[Morocco]]), Israeli Hebrew would have been a totally different language – both [[genetics|genetically]] and [[Linguistic typology|typologically]], much more [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]. The impact of the founder population on Israeli Hebrew is incomparable with that of later [[immigration|immigrants]]."&lt;ref name="See p 2006 pp. 57-71" /&gt;

=== First Aliyah (1882-1903) ===
{{Further|First Aliyah}}
{{Aliyah}}
[[File:HavivSchool03.jpg|thumb|left|First [[Hebrew school]] in [[Rishon LeZion]]]]
With the rise of [[Jewish nationalism]] in 19th-century Europe, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda was captivated by the innovative ideas of Zionism. At that time, it was believed that one of the criteria needed to define a [[nation]] worthy of national rights was its use of a common language spoken by both the society and the individual. On 13 October 1881, while in Paris, Ben-Yehuda began speaking Hebrew with friends in what is believed to be the first modern conversation using the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/InThespotlight/Article.aspx?id=241523|title=This Week in History: Hebrew goes conversational|last=Omer-Man|first=Michael|date=12 October 2011|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he made [[aliyah]] and came to live in Jerusalem.

In Jerusalem, Ben-Yehuda tried to garner support for the idea of speaking Hebrew. He determined that his family would only speak Hebrew, and raised his children to be native Hebrew speakers. His first child, a son named [[Itamar Ben-Avi]], who was born in Jerusalem on 31 July 1882, became the first native speaker of Modern Hebrew. Ben-Yehuda attempted to convince other families to do so as well, founded associations for speaking Hebrew, began publishing the Hebrew newspaper ''[[HaZvi]]'', and for a short while taught at Hebrew schools, for the first time making use of the method of "Hebrew in Hebrew." In 1889, there were plays in Hebrew and schools teaching children to speak Hebrew.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institutionalized Language Planning --- Documents and Analysis of the Revival of Hebrew|last=Saulson|first=Scott B.|publisher=Mouton Publishers|year=1979|isbn=90-279-7567-1|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Yehuda's efforts to persuade Jewish families to use only Hebrew in daily life at home met very limited success. According to Ben-Yehuda, ten years after his immigration to Palestine, there were only four families in Jerusalem that used Hebrew exclusively. According to the ''Hashkafa'' newspaper, there were ten such families in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Hagege, Claude: ''On the Death and Life of Languages''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, during the [[Ottoman Palestine|Ottoman era]], widespread activity began in the ''[[Moshava|moshavot]]'', or agricultural settlements, of the First Aliyah, which was concentrated in the Hebrew schools. A Hebrew boarding school was established by [[Aryeh Leib Frumkin]] in 1884, where religious studies were conducted in Hebrew and students spoke Hebrew with their teachers and among themselves. In 1886, a Hebrew school was established in the Jewish settlement of [[Rishon LeZion]], where a part of the classes were taught in Hebrew. From the 1880s onward, schools in the agricultural settlements gradually began teaching general subjects in Hebrew. In 1889, [[Israel Belkind]] opened a school in [[Jaffa]] which taught Hebrew and used it as the primary language of instruction. It survived for three years.&lt;ref name=segal&gt;Segal, Myriam: ''A New Sound in Hebrew Poetry: Poetics, Politics, Accent''&lt;/ref&gt; The Literature Council, which was based on the Pure Language Society, in 1890, to experiment in the municipal and rural schools, showed the possibility to make Hebrew the only language in the settlement.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; At this point, progress was slow, and it encountered many difficulties: parents were opposed to their children learning in an impractical language, useless in [[higher education]]; the four-year schools for farmers' children were not of a high caliber; and a great lack of linguistic means for teaching Hebrew plus the lack of words to describe day-to-day activities, not to mention the absence of Hebrew schoolbooks. Added to these, there was no agreement on which accent to use, as some teachers taught Ashkenazi Hebrew while others taught Sephardi Hebrew.

In 1889, Ben-Yehuda, together with rabbis [[Yaakov Meir]] and [[Chaim Hirschensohn]] and educator Chaim Kalmi, founded the Clear Language Society, with the goal of teaching Hebrew. The company taught Hebrew and encouraged Hebrew education in schools, [[heder]]s, and [[yeshiva]]s. Initially, it hired Hebrew-speaking women to teach Jewish women and girls spoken and written Hebrew. In 1890, the company established the Hebrew Language Committee, which coined new Hebrew words for everyday use and for a wide variety of modern uses and encouraged the use of grammatically correct Hebrew. Although the organization collapsed in 1891, the Hebrew Language Committee continued to function. It published books, dictionaries, bulletins, and periodicals, inventing thousands of new words.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=hZqpCrG3qw0C&amp;pg=PA504&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The New Jewish Encyclopedia] - Vaad Ha-Lashon Ha-Ivrit&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Language Committee continued to function until 1953, when it was succeeded by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]].

A Hebrew boys' school opened in Jaffa in 1893, followed by a Hebrew girls' school. Although some subjects were taught in [[French language|French]], Hebrew was the primary language of instruction. Over the next decade, the girls' school became a major center of Hebrew education and activism. In 1898, the first Hebrew kindergarten opened in Rishon LeZion.&lt;ref name=segal/&gt; It was followed by a second one in Jerusalem in 1903.

In 1903, the Union of Hebrew Teachers was founded, and sixty educators participated in its inaugural assembly. Though not extremely impressive from a quantitative viewpoint, the Hebrew school program did create a nucleus of a few hundred fluent Hebrew speakers and proved that Hebrew could be used in the day-to-day context.

=== Second Aliyah (1904-1914) ===
{{Further|Second Aliyah}}
As the Second Aliyah began, Hebrew usage began to break out of the family and school framework into the public venue. Motivated by an ideology of rejecting the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] and its Yiddish culture, the members of the Second Aliyah, established relatively closed-off social cells of young people with a common world view. In these social cells – mostly in the moshavot – Hebrew was used in all public assemblages. Though not spoken in all homes and private settings yet, Hebrew had secured its place as the exclusive language of assemblies, conferences, and discussions. Educated Second Aliyah members already were familiar with the literary Hebrew that had developed in Europe, and they identified with the notion that Hebrew could serve as an impetus for the national existence for the Jewish people in Israel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reshit hachinuch ha'ivri ba'arec utrumato lehachya'at halashon|last=Haramati|first=Sh|publisher=|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was joined by the aforementioned graduates of Hebrew schools, who had already begun to raise native-born speakers of Hebrew in their families. During this period, the [[World Zionist Congress]] also adopted Hebrew as its official language.

Hebrew education continued to expand, as more and more Hebrew educational institutions came about. The number of Hebrew kindergartens continued to grow.  In 1905, Yehuda Leib and Fania Matman-Cohen, a couple of educators, began teaching the first high school classes in Hebrew in their apartment in Jaffa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/1909-1st-hebrew-high-school-in-pre-state-israel-founded-1.5416785&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew teachers recreated the Hebrew Language Committee, which began to determine uniform linguistic rules, as opposed to the disjointed ones which had arisen previously.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; The Council declared as its mission "to prepare the Hebrew language for use as a spoken language in all affairs of life," formulated rules of pronunciation and grammar, and offered new words for use in schools and by the general public. The widespread production of Hebrew schoolbooks also began, and [[Mother Goose]]-style rhymes were written for children. During the first decade of 20th century, Epstein's and Wilkomitz's Hebrew education, which restricted the children from speaking Yiddish not only in school, but also at home and on the street, made progress toward wider use of Hebrew.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first native speakers of Hebrew, who had mainly learned it in the Hebrew schools of the First Aliyah period and came to speak it as their primary language, reached adulthood during this time. Aside from rare exceptions who had been born prior such as Itamar Ben-Avi, the first generation of children who acquired Modern Hebrew as native speakers at home from their parents rather than mainly learning it at school were born during this decade, to parents who had attended the Hebrew schools of the First Aliyah period.&lt;ref&gt;Lepschy, Giulio C.: ''Mother Tongues and Other Reflections on the Italian Language'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, many of the Jewish immigrants during this period had reasonable Hebrew reading proficiency acquired from their education prior to arriving in the country. Most still learned it as a second language. Due to the growth of the number of native speakers and proficiency among second language speakers, the Hebrew press was able to grow. During this period, it greatly increased in popularity and circulation. In 1912, it was observed that there was hardly a young Jew in the country who could not read a Hebrew newspaper.

In 1909, the first Hebrew city, [[Tel Aviv]], was established. In its streets and in cafes, Hebrew was already widely spoken. The entire administration of the city was carried out in Hebrew, and new ''olim'' or those not yet speaking Hebrew were forced to speak in Hebrew. Street signs and public announcements were written in Hebrew. A new building for the [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]], a continuation of the first Hebrew high school established by the Matman-Cohen's, was built in the city that same year. 

The pinnacle of Hebrew's development during this period came in 1913, in the so-called "[[War of the Languages]]:" The Company for Aiding German Jews, then planning the establishment of a school for [[engineering|engineers]] (first known as the Technikum and for which construction had begun in 1912),&lt;ref&gt;Technion Israel Institute of Technology. "Technion History: A story of how one stone changed the world [Web page]." (n.d.) http://www.technion.ac.il/en/about/history-of-the-technion/&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that [[German language|German]] should be its language of instruction, arguing among other things that German possessed an extensive scientific and technical vocabulary while a parallel vocabulary drawn from Hebrew would need to be created from scratch, often using [[calques]] or translations of terms anyway. Substantial unanimity of opinion in the Yishuv ran against this proposal, which was defeated, leading to the founding of Israel's foremost institute of [[technology]], the [[Technion]], with a curriculum taught in Hebrew. This incident is seen as a watershed marking the transformation of Hebrew into the official language of the Yishuv.

Researchers studying the [[Google Books]] database noted a fivefold increase in the rate of appearance of new words in printed Hebrew between books published in 1915 and 1920, which they credit to the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]] and the Second Aliyah.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander M. Petersen, Joel Tenenbaum, [[Shlomo Havlin]], and [[H. Eugene Stanley]]. "Statistical Laws Governing Fluctuations in Word Use from Word Birth to Word Death." ''Scientific Reports'' '''2''', Article number: 313 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a greater number of children passed through Hebrew language schools, the number of people who spoke Hebrew as their [[first language]] grew. As the number of people whose primary language was Hebrew increased, so did demand for Hebrew reading materials and entertainment such as books, newspapers, and plays. By 1916-1918, about 34,000 Jews in Palestine recorded Hebrew as their native language.&lt;ref&gt;Strazny, Philip: ''Encyclopedia of Linguistics'', p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mandate Period (1920-1948) ===
{{Further|Mandatory Palestine}}
After [[World War I]], it was legislated by the Mandate over Palestine that English, Hebrew, and Arabic would be the official spoken language of Palestine.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Mandate over Palestine, July 24, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; As the Jewish community in Palestine, or [[Yishuv]] grew, the immigrants arriving from the diaspora did not speak Hebrew as a mother tongue, and learned it as a [[second language]] either prior to their immigration or in Palestine, while their children picked up Hebrew as their native language. At this time, the use of Hebrew as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Yishuv was already a'' fait accompli'', and the revival process was no longer a process of creation, but a process of expansion. In Tel Aviv, the Legion of the Defenders of the Language was established, which worked to enforce Hebrew use. Jews who were overheard speaking other languages on the street were admonished: "Jew, speak Hebrew" (Yehudi, daber ivrit/יהודי, דבר עברית), or, more alliteratively, "Hebrew [man], speak Hebrew" (Ivri, daber ivrit/עברי, דבר עברית) was a campaign initiated by Ben-Yehuda's son, [[Itamar Ben-Avi]].

The Academy of Hebrew Language focused on the structure and the spelling of Hebrew, and prompted the issues about the further expansion of the use of Hebrew in Mandatory Palestine. The Academy worked with the Language College to publish the Ben-Sira in a scientific form.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

=== State of Israel ===
By the time [[Israel]] gained independence in 1948, 80.9% of Jews who had been born in Palestine spoke Hebrew as their only language in daily life, and another 14.2% of Palestine-born Jews used it as a first among two or more languages. The small minority Jews who had been born in Palestine but did not use Hebrew as their first language had mainly grown up before the development of the Hebrew school system.&lt;ref name=Helman&gt;Helman, Anat: ''Becoming Israeli: National Ideals and Everyday Life in the 1950s''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following Israeli independence, large waves of Jewish refugees came from Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and other parts of the world. The Israeli population increased significantly, doubling within a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-mass-migration-of-the-1950s/&lt;/ref&gt; These immigrants spoke a variety of languages, and had to be taught Hebrew. While immigrant children were expected to learn Hebrew through school, much effort was put into ensuring adults would learn the language. The institution of the [[ulpan]], or intensive Hebrew-language school, was established to teach immigrants basic Hebrew language skills, and an ulpan course became a major feature of the experience of immigrating to Israel. Young adult immigrants picked up much of their Hebrew through mandatory military service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], which aimed to teach soldiers Hebrew so they could function in the military and post-military civilian life. During the 1950s, Hebrew was taught in most military bases by recruited teachers and female soldiers. A 1952 order demanded that soldiers be taught Hebrew until they could converse freely on everyday matters, write a letter to their commander, understand a basic lecture, and read a vowelized newspaper. Soldiers also absorbed Hebrew through their regular service. Soldiers who were about to finish their service without a grasp of Hebrew deemed sufficient were sent to a special Hebrew school founded by the army for the last three months of their service. Immigrants from Arab countries tended to pick up Hebrew faster than European immigrants.

In daily life, immigrants largely limited their use of Hebrew to when they needed to, most often in their working lives, and to a somewhat lesser extent to satisfy cultural needs. They tended to use their native languages more when socializing and interacting with family. In 1954, about 60% of the population reported the use of more than one language. The children of these immigrants tended to pick up Hebrew as their first language, while their parents' native languages were either used as second languages or lost to them altogether. The [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arab]] minority also began learning Hebrew, as Hebrew lessons were introduced into Arab schools.&lt;ref name=Helman/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4520">'''Robèrt Lafont''' ({{IPA-oc|ruˈβɛɾt laˈfun|oc}}; March 16, 1923 in [[Nîmes]] &amp;ndash; June 24, 2009 in [[Florence]]) was an [[Occitan]] [[intellectual]] from [[Provence]]. He was a [[linguistics|linguist]], an author, an historian, an expert in literature and a political theoretician. His name in [[French language|French]] reads '''Robert Lafont'''.

==Biography==
Robèrt Lafont was professor [[emeritus]] at the [[Paul Valéry|Paul-Valéry]] University of [[Montpellier]]. A professional linguist, he was a [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]], novelist, poet, playwright, essayist and a [[Middle Ages|medievalist]]. A versatile writer, Lafont wrote nearly a hundred books in Occitan, French, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. The wide scope of themes he explores includes the history of literature and of society, linguistics and [[sociolinguistics]] and the social-economic imbalance in [[France]] and [[Europe]].

In the essays he wrote in French, Robèrt Lafont tackles the problems encountered not only by the people of Occitania but also the various minorities struggling for official recognition under French rule, such as [[Brittany|Bretons]], [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalans]], [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basques]], [[Corsica]]ns or [[Alsace|Alsatians]] among others. Lafont is a key figure in the analysis of ''[[internal colonialism]]'', as far as ''[[Occitania|lo País]]'' is concerned. On the other hand, the Occitan side of his works stands out as a revolutionary change in the literary production in ''[[Occitan|la lenga nòstra]]'', inasmuch as it completely breaks off with the more usual tradition of folklore and tales.

Robèrt Lafont founded the Occitan Committee for Study and Action (COEA) and ran a number of reviews, most notably ''L'Ase negre'' (''The Black Donkey'') in 1946 and ''Viure'' (''Live'') in 1962. He also produced and sponsored social theatre. He became the chairman of the [[Institut d'Estudis Occitans]] but left in 1981 following internal disagreements with [[Ives Roqueta]] in particular. In 1974, he claimed to be interested in running for French presidency but never managed to meet the legal prerequisites.

[[File:Seligman-Baer.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of '''Seligman Baer''', from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia.]]

'''Seligman (Isaac) Baer''' was a [[Masoretic text|masoretic]] scholar, and an editor of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and of the [[Siddur|Jewish liturgy]]. He was born in Mosbach, the northern district of Biebrich,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faber|first=Rolf|title=Seligmann Baer:  Neue Erkenntnisse zu Leben und Werk des jüdische Gelehrten aus Wiesbaden-Biebrich|date=2002|publisher=Verschönerungs- und Verkehrsverein Biebrich am Rhein e.V.|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sept. 18, 1825 and died at Biebrich-on-the-Rhine, March, 1897.

Baer commenced his Masoretic studies as early as 1844. He belonged to the school of [[Wolf Heidenheim]], and had in his possession some of Heidenheim's original manuscripts and personal copies of his published works with handwritten marginal notes. Few scholars in the nineteenth century had so intimate an acquaintance with all the details of the Masorah as had Baer, and it was largely due to him that the study of this branch of Hebrew philology was brought to the notice of Biblical critics. His friendship with [[Franz Delitzsch]], who stood sponsor for much of his work, aided him in making known to the world the results of his studies.

Baer's monumental edition of the Jewish prayerbook according to the Ashkenazic rite, ''Seder Avodat Yisrael'' (Rödelheim, 1868), accompanied by a critical commentary, became the authoritative model for numerous editions published subsequently in the 20th century. His editions of the Jewish liturgy also include [[Kinnot]] for the fast of the ninth of Av.

He never occupied an academic position, but was content with the office of Hebrew teacher to the Jewish community of Biebrich. In recognition of his services to the Commission for the History of the Jews in Germany, the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred upon him by the University of Leipsic. His edition of the Masoretic Bible was published in cooperation with Delitzsch.

==The Masoretic Bible of Baer and Delitzsch==

Baer's collaboration with [[Franz Delitzsch|Delitzsch]] began with an edition of the Psalms in 1861 (Leipsic, Doerfling und Franke). A second edition was published a few years later (Leipsic, Brockhaus).

In the meantime, Baer had conceived the plan of editing anew the books of the entire Hebrew Bible, strictly following the Masoretic tradition. The volumes, with a Latin preface by Delitzsch, appeared (Leipsic, Tauchnitz) in the following order: Genesis, 1869; Isaiah, 1872; Job, 1875; Minor Prophets, 1878; Psalms (together with a treatise "Elementa Accentuationis Metricæ"), 1880; Proverbs (together with "De Primorum Vocabulorum Dagessatione"), 1880; Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah (together with "Chaldaismi Biblici Adumbratio" and a treatise by Friedrich Delitzsch on the Babylonian proper names in these books), were published in 1882; Ezekiel (with "Specimen Glossarii Ezechielico-Babylonici" by Friedrich Delitzsch), appeared in 1884; followed by the five Megillot, 1886; the book of Chronicles, 1888; Jeremiah, 1890; Joshua and Judges, 1891; and finally Kings, 1895. The last two were edited by Baer alone, Delitzsch having died in 1890.

Death prevented Baer from finishing the series. Attached to each volume were a number of Masoretic notes taken from the best editions and manuscripts, variant readings between the Occidentals and Orientals, between Ben Asher and Ben Naphtali, and various other Masoretic lists and enumerations.

==Criticisms of the work==

In general, Baer's text has been accepted as representing the Masoretic tradition; even though exception may be taken to his view on individual points or to his too extensive generalization from insufficient manuscript evidence. [[Christian David Ginsburg]], in his introduction to his Masoretic Bible (London, 1897), has criticized a number of these faults with some severity. He points out, among other things, that Baer has indicated the open and closed sections in the Prophets and the Hagiographa, a thing not usually done in Masoretic manuscripts (pp.&amp;nbsp;10 et seq.); that he has introduced a number of anti-Masoretic pauses (p.&amp;nbsp;29); that his division of the Sedarim is faulty (p.&amp;nbsp;41); that he has introduced the dagesh into the first letter of words when the preceding word ends with the same letter (p.&amp;nbsp;117), as well as the dagesh which follows upon a guttural with silent shewa and a ḥatef-pataḥ under the first of two similar letters (pp.&amp;nbsp;466, 662), all of which are not warranted by the best manuscripts. The Masoretic notes at the end of Baer's edition are also criticized (p.&amp;nbsp;92), especially the lists of various readings. Further, the Aramaic paradigms attached to the edition of Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah have also been the subject of criticism on the part of Kautzsch ("Grammatik des Biblisch-Aramäischen," p.&amp;nbsp;23). Many of these faults were due to Baer's inability to consult manuscripts in the large European collections.

==Other masoretic works==

Of Baer's separate treatises dealing with the ''mesorah'' may be mentioned:
*''Torat Emet'' ("The True Law"; Rödelheim, 1852), on the accentuation of the three poetic books Psalms, Proverbs, and Job. An enlarged edition of this treatise in German, together with ''Masoretische Uebersichten'', was added as an appendix to the first edition of Delitzsch's Commentary on the Psalter (vol. ii., Leipsic, 1860);
*''Die Methegsetzung'', in Merx's ''Archiv für Wissensch. Erforschung des Alten Testaments'' (Halle, 1867, i. 55 et seq.; but compare Grätz, "Monatsschrift," 1887, p.&amp;nbsp;483);
*his edition (in conjunction with [[Hermann Strack|H. L. Strack]]) of the ''Diḳduḳe ha-Te'amim'' of [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]] (Leipsic, 1879);
*his lengthy criticism of Ginsburg's Masora in ''Z. D. M. G.'' 743 et seq.;
*and his contribution of the ''mesorah'' to the Rabbinic Bible, which was to have been published by the Romms in Wilna (1894), a work upon which he spent many years.

For his edition of [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]]'s ''Diḳduḳe ha-Te'amim'', Baer made a complete handwritten copy of the masoretic treatises and lists in the [[Aleppo codex]] in their entirety, as found in the pages that preceded and followed the biblical text. Some of the material from his copy was adapted and published within ''Diḳduḳe ha-Te'amim'', and the entire copy survived in Baer's personal archive (now found in the Ginsburg collection at the Russian National Library, Moscow). Since the masoretic treatises of the Aleppo codex are now missing, Baer's personal copy allows for a nearly complete reconstruction of the lost material.&lt;ref&gt;Baer copied from a direct copy of the Aleppo Codex, which had been commissioned by [[Abraham Firkovich]]. For information on Baer's copy and an evaluation of it, as well as for a critical edition of sections from the now-missing masoretic treatises of the Aleppo Codex, see two essays by Yosef Ofer, "A Masoretic Note in the Aleppo Codex Concerning the Composite Words," ''Textus'' 21 (2002), pp. 209-233; "The Masoretic Treatises of the Aleppo Codex according to the copy in the Archives of Isaac Seligman Baer" in ''Iyyunei Miqra u-Parshanut'', vol. 7 (2005), pp. 137-162 (Hebrew). By the same author also see "[[Umberto Cassuto|M. D. Cassuto]]'s Notes on the Aleppo Codex", ''Sefunot'' 19 (1989), pp. 277-344 ([http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/tohen.asp?id=277 online text (PDF) in Hebrew]), which contains a partial reconstruction of the masoretic material based on Cassuto's notes on the contents of these pages (before Baer's copy was re-discovered). According to Ofer, Baer's full copy and Cassuto's notes complement each other well.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgy and other works==
[[File:Avodat-Yisrael-Baer-1901-1.pdf|thumb|''Seder Avodat Yisrael'', 1901 reprint (full scan).|page=1]]
What Baer did for the [[Hebrew Bible]], he also tried to do for the [[Siddur|Jewish prayerbook]]. His ''Seder Avodat Yisrael'' ("Ritual of Israel's Service"; Rödelheim, 1868), is accompanied by a literary and philological commentary called ''Yakhin Lashon'' ("Preparatory Study of Language"), which has made the work a standard authority and a model for subsequent Ashkenazic prayerbooks throughout the 20th century and to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Important editions of the Ashkenazic prayerbook from the late 19th century to the present day, which used Baer's ''Avodat Yisrael'' as their model, include ''The Authorized Daily Prayer Book'' of [[Simeon Singer|Singer]] (1890 and since revised in numerous editions through 2009) and [[Philip Birnbaum]] (1949).&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to it is the text of the Psalms, accurately vocalized and accented.&lt;ref&gt;See Kobak's "Jeschurun," vi. 217; Berliner, in "Israelit," 1868, Nos. 24 and 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Baer's other works may be mentioned:
*''Lekeṭ Ẓebi'' ["Collation of Ẓebi"], Sammlung von Gebeten (Rödelheim, 1855, 1861);
*''Tiḳḳun ha-Sofer weha-Ḳore'' ("Correct Text for the Scribe and Reader"), the Masoretic text of the Pentateuch, together with the laws governing the writing of synagogue scrolls (Rödelheim, 1856);
*''Divrei ha-Berit'' ("The Words of the Covenant"), on the prayers and observances connected with circumcision (Rödelheim, 1871);
*''Toẓeot Ḥayyim'' ("Issue of Life"), prayers for mourners (ib. 1871);
*''Zibḥe Ẓedeḳ'' ("Sacrifices of Righteousness") on ritual slaughter (ib. 1876).

During the latter part of his life, Baer ventured into the field of history, and translated for the Commission for the History of the Jews in Germany the Hebrew accounts of the persecutions at the time of the Crusades ("Quellen zur Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland," ii., Berlin, 1892). The venture was not successful, as Brann has shown in "Monatsschrift," xxxvii. 196 et seq., 286 et seq.

The [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] standard languages ([[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]) have one of the more elaborate '''[[kinship terminology|kinship]]''' (''srodstvo'') systems among European languages. Terminology may differ from place to place. Most words are common to other [[Slavic languages]], though some derive from [[Turkish languages|Turkish]]. The standardized languages may recognize slightly different pronunciations or dialectical forms; all terms are considered standard in all four languages, unless otherwise marked: &lt;sup&gt;[B]&lt;/sup&gt; (Bosnian), &lt;sup&gt;[C]&lt;/sup&gt; (Croatian), &lt;sup&gt;[M]&lt;/sup&gt; (Montenegrin) and &lt;sup&gt;[S]&lt;/sup&gt; (Serbian) below.

There are four main types of kinship in the family: biological {{sc|aka}} blood kinship, kinship by law ([[in-laws]]), spiritual kinship (such as [[godparent]]s), and legal kinship through adoption and remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/15858091/Obitelj-brak-srodstvo Family, marriage and kinship]&lt;/ref&gt;

As is common in many rural family structures, three generations of a family will live together in a home in what anthropologists call a [[joint family]] structure, where parents, their son(s), and grandchildren would cohabit in a family home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CSIAkgk-qasC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kinship,+networks,+and+exchange&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Kinship, networks, and exchange; The Grapvine Forest: Kinship, Status, and Wealth in a Mediterranean Community (Selo, Croatia)'' by Bojka Milici, Thomas Schweizer, Douglas R. White]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct descendance and ancestry==
Words for relations up to five generations removed&amp;mdash;great-great-grandparents and great-great-grandchildren&amp;mdash;are in common use. The fourth-generation terms are also used as generics for ancestors and descendants. There is no distinction between the maternal and paternal line. In addition there are terms found in Serbian for ancestors past the 5th generation, but those are not in common use.{{Cref2|a}}

'''Shö''' is a [[Kuki-Chin languages|Kuki-Chin language]] [[dialect cluster]] of Burma and Bangladesh. There are perhaps four distinct dialects, Asho (Khyang), Bualkhaw, Chinbon, and Shendu.

'''Mayin''' and '''Longpaw''' are not mutually intelligible, but have been subsumed under the ISO code for Chinbon because Mayin-Longpaw speakers generally understand Chinbon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id=2014-063&amp;lang=cmw]&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Minkya''' is similarly included because most Minkya speakers understand Mayin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id=2014-062&amp;lang=cmy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical distribution==
'''Chinbon''' is spoken in the following townships of Myanmar (''[[Ethnologue]]'').
*[[Chin State]]: [[Kanpetlet]] and [[Paletwa]] townships
*[[Magway Region]]: [[Saw, Myanmar|Saw]] and [[Sidoktaya]] townships
*[[Rakhine State]]: [[Minbya]] township

==Morphology==
Similar to other Kukish languages, many Asho verbs have two distinct stems. This stem alternation is a Proto-Kukish feature, which has been retained to different degrees in different Kukish languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://ic.payap.ac.th/graduate/linguistics/theses/Kee_Shein_Mang_Thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in Singapore}}

'''Singaporean Hokkien'''  ({{zh|s=新加坡福建话|poj=''Sin-ka-pho Hok-kiàn-ōe''}}; [[Tai-lo|Tâi-lô]]: ''Sin-ka-pho Hok-kiàn-uē'') is a local variant of the [[Hokkien language]] spoken in [[Singapore]]. In Chinese academic circles, this dialect is known as '''Singaporean Ban-lam Gu''' (新加坡閩南語, ''Sin-ka-pho Bân-lâm-gu''). It is closely related to the [[Southern Malaysian Hokkien]] (南马福建话) spoken in Southern Malaysia, as well as to [[Riau Hokkien]] (廖内福建话) spoken in the Indonesian province of Riau. It also closely resembles [[Amoy dialect|Amoy]] (厦门话) spoken in [[Amoy]], China, and [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] (台灣閩南語/台語/台灣話) which is spoken in [[Taiwan]].

[[Hokkien]], is the [[Min Nan]] pronunciation for Fujian province, China, and is generally the term used by the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] in South-East Asia to refer to the [[Banlam]] dialect (闽南语). Singaporean Hokkien generally uses Amoy as its standard, and its accent is predominantly based on a mixture of [[Quanzhou]] (泉州话) and [[Zhangzhou]] (漳州话) speech, with a greater inclination towards the former.

Like many spoken languages in Singapore, Singaporean Hokkien is influenced by other languages or dialects spoken in Singapore. For instance, Singaporean Hokkien is influenced to a certain degree by [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], and is sometimes regarded as a combined '''Hokkien-Teochew speech''' (福潮话). In addition, it has many [[loanwords]] from [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Singaporean English|English]].

Nevertheless, the grammar and tones of Singaporean Hokkien are still largely based on Minnan. When compared to [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]'s prestige accent (台语优势腔) spoken in Tainan (台南) and Kaohsiung (高雄), Singaporean Hokkien pronunciation inclines toward the Quanzhou accent (泉州腔), is also close to the pronunciation of [[Taipei]] and Amoy, and is less close to that of [[Tainan]] which has a greater inclination towards the Zhangzhou accent (漳州腔).

A Singaporean would likely not have trouble conversing with Taiwanese speakers in Singaporean Hokkien, with the exception of some [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[Loanword|loanwords]]. Similarly, Singaporean Hokkien is understood by Taiwanese speakers, with the exception of some Malay and English [[Loanword|loanwords]].

==History==

From the 19th until the early half of the 20th century, there was a large influx of Chinese migrants from southern China into Singapore. This led to [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] constituting almost 75% of Singapore's population. Of these Chinese, many originated from the regions of [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]] in [[Fujian]] province. They brought [[Min Nan]] to Singapore, which was then propagated throughout Singapore and Malaysia. As there was no formal Chinese name for [[Min Nan]] in the early 20th century, these migrants began to use their place of origin as the name of their speech, and thus called the dialect "[[Hokkien]]" (福建) (which means "[[Fujian]]" province).

During the 19th century, many traditional private Chinese schools in Singapore (known as ''su-sio̍k-á'', 私塾仔) generally used Hokkien to teach [[Chinese classics]] and [[Classical Chinese]]. But by the early 20th century, Mandarin began to replace Hokkien as the medium of instructions in Chinese schools after the founding of many Mandarin-medium schools.

During the 1950s and 1960s, many political speeches in Singapore were in Hokkien, in order to reach out to the [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese community in Singapore]]. There was also a thriving Hokkien cultural scene that included Hokkien story-telling, opera, and media in Singapore. 

After 1979, the Singapore government began to push for the use of Mandarin in Singapore, spearheaded by the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]]. Following this, the Singapore government also began to employ a more stringent censorship, or ban, of Hokkien media in the Singaporean Chinese media. Consequently, all Hokkien-language media in Singapore had to be dubbed in Mandarin before being allowed to stream on national TV. In addition, the 1980s saw Chinese-medium education replaced by that in English, causing English to emerge as the most widely used language in Singapore. The emergence of the English language, coupled with heavy promotion of Mandarin, generally led Hokkien to decline in Singapore after 1979.

==Current status==

Today, the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese Community in Singapore]] is [[Singaporean Mandarin|Mandarin]]. Although Hokkien is still spoken in Singapore today, particularly by the elderly Chinese population, it is not as widespread as before. The most common places to hear or speak Hokkien in Singapore are the [[Hawker centre]] or [[Kopi tiam]].

Speaking ability varies amongst the different age groups of the Hokkien Singaporeans. The elderly are generally able to communicate effectively in Hokkien. On the other hand, the middle and younger generations have generally lost the ability to communicate as fluently. With the "Mandarin campaign" from the government, the Hokkien speaking population has declined greatly.

===Revival through social media===

There is, however, a minority group of Hokkien Singaporeans and Taiwanese living in Singapore working to help preserve, spread and revive the use of Hokkien Chinese in Singapore.

The ease of access to online Hokkien entertainment media and pop music from Taiwan helps to connect to the language and culture. Many Singaporeans are increasingly using online and social media platforms, such as Facebook and Meetup groups, to learn, discuss, meet, and interact with each other in Hokkien.

Some of the groups include:

[https://www.facebook.com/groups/sghokkien/ Facebook Singapore Hokkien Language and Culture Society]: Discussion forum on all aspects of Hokkien Chinese, with a primary focus on the Singaporean Hokkien dialect and its variations from other forms of Hokkien.

[https://www.facebook.com/sghokkienmeetup Facebook Singapore Hokkien Meetup]: Group that organizes regular meetups for language practice. It also organizes free language courses and sharing sessions for those who are interested.

[http://www.meetup.com/The-Singapore-Hokkien-Language-Meetup-Group/ Singapore Hokkien Language Meetup Group]: Same as the Facebook group, but organized over [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]].

===Regional accents and tones===

When Singaporeans are speaking Hokkien, they do so with various accents and tones largely from [[Tong'an]], [[Anxi County|Anxi]], [[Nan'an, Fujian|Nan'an]], [[Kinmen]] as well as [[Yongchun County|Yongchun]], [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]], [[Longhai City]] and [[Southern Zhangzhou]] accents. In practice, it is common for Singaporeans to mix English conjunctions such as "and" into a Hokkien sentence. Some would include ''hngo2'' (an exclamatory remark in [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jin'jiang]] /[[Nan'an, Fujian|Nan'an]]), in addition to the widely used ''lah'' and ''lor'' Hokkien exclamations.

===No differentiation between Literary and Vernacular Pronunciation===

In saying years or numbers, Singaporean Hokkien normally does not differentiate between literary (文讀音）or vernacular (白讀音) pronunciations. In Taiwan or Amoy, differentiation is usually made. For instance, the Year "1980" should be said with a literary pronunciation（一九八空年, ''it kiú pat khòng nî''); but in Singapore, no differentiation is made (literary and vernacular are mixed together) and it's pronounced as ''it káu pueh khòng nî''.

Taiwanese would speak telephone numbers using literary pronunciations, while Singaporeans would use vernacular pronunciations instead. For example, the telephone number "98444678" will be pronounced in Taiwan using a literary pronunciation, as ''kiú pat sù sù sù lio̍k tshit pat'', whereas in Singaporean Hokkien it would be pronounced using vernacular pronunciation, as ''káu pueh sì-sì sì la̍k tshit pueh''.

===Influence from Southern Zhangzhou and Teochew Phonology===

====A change of vowel from ''ing'' to ''eng''====

In Singaporean Hokkien—as compared to Quanzhou (whose accent Hokkien usually inclines toward), Zhangzhou, [[Amoy Hokkien|Amoy]] or [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] (all being standard Hokkien), which pronounce the vowel ''ing''—there is a vowel change from ''ing'' (/iəŋ/) to ''eng'' (/eŋ/ or /ɛŋ/). This change is similar to pronunciation in regions south of Zhangzhou—[[Dongshan County|Dongshan]], [[Yunxiao County|Yunxiao]], [[Zhangpu County|Zhangpu]], and [[Pinghe County|Pinghe]] counties (southern Zhangzhou accent, 漳南腔)—and in [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and Cantonese.

Below is a table illustrating the difference:

====Pronunciation of 我 ("I")====

In standard Hokkien pronunciation, 我 ("I" or "me") is pronounced as /gʊa&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;/; but in Singaporean Hokkien, it is pronounced as /wa&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;/, which is alleged by some to have been influenced by the Teochew pronunciation /ʊa&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;/ although dialects like [[Putian dialect|Putianese]] and some regional Hokkien dialects have a nearly identical pronunciation.

There are some differences between the sentence structure used by Singaporean Hokkien and by Standard Hokkien (Amoy/Taiwanese).

For instance, when asking a question for "do you want to...?", Singaporean Hokkien typically uses the sentence structure "愛 (''ai'')...莫 (''mài'')?", whereas Taiwanese Hokkien uses "欲 (''beh'')...無 (''bô'')". Singaporean Hokkien typically uses the word "愛 (''ai'')" to mean "want to", but in Taiwanese, the word "欲/卜 (''beh'')" (which means "want" in Hokkien) is used instead. "愛 (''ai'')" in Taiwanese typically means "love to" or "need to".

Also, unlike Taiwanese Hokkien—which typically uses the word "敢 (''kám'')" (meaning "whether or not", 是否 /是不是) when asking a question, which is more formal or polite—Singaporean Hokkien does not use the word "敢 (''kám'')". Instead, it simply adds the word "無 (''bô'')" at the end of the sentence to indicate that it's a question (similar to Mandarin's "嗎 (''ma'')" or adds a Cantonese intonation "咩 (''meh'')" at the end. Adding the word "無 (''bô'')" at the end of a sentence is also used in Taiwanese Hokkien, when one is asking a question in an informal way.

==Differences from  Standard Hokkien (Amoy/Taiwanese)==

There are minor differences between Singaporean Hokkien and [[Amoy Hokkien|Amoy]] or [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] in terms of vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar. [[Amoy Hokkien|Amoy]] and [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] bear close resemblance, and are usually considered the standard in Hokkien, differing only in terms of [[lexicon|vocabulary]].

===Unique vocabulary===

Although Singaporean Hokkien is similar to [[Amoy Hokkien|Amoy]] or [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], there exist certain uniquely Singaporean Hokkien words, which are different from the [[Amoy Hokkien|Amoy]] or [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]].

The word "lui 镭" was previously thought to have originated from Malay. However, research indicated that the word "lui 镭" is in fact a unique Hokkien word, originating from the unit of currency known as "{{lang|zh| 铜镭}}  tâng-lui" during the early [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Chinese Republican]] period. It actually means "bronze money". "{{lang|zh| 铜镭}}  tâng-lui"  was commonly used in [[Minnan region]] and [[Chaoshan]] region during that time, and the term spread to Singapore then and remains in common use until today.  

"lui 镭" used to be used in Taiwan, but due to [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]], "lui 镭"  fell out of use. It was replaced by "{{lang|zh|钱}} chîⁿ" which is the normal term for "money" in Taiwan today.

|{{lang|zh|咖啡}}
|Coffee
|ko-pi
|ka-pi
|ko-pi is a loan word from Malay word "kopi" which in turn is taken from the English word "coffee." The Mandarin word "Ka-fei" and the Taiwanese Hokkien "Ka-pi" are derived from the European continental version "Café" (French / Spanish / Portuguese) or "Kaffee" (German). As Hokkien does not have an f-sound, this turned into a p-sound. Filipino-Chinese Hokkien which is very close to the Taiwanese variety pronounces the word for "coffee" as "ka-peh" which derives from the Filipino pronunciation of the Spanish word "café" which is "kape."

==Influences from other local languages==

Because Singapore is a multilingual country, Singaporean Hokkien has been influenced by many other languages spoken in Singapore. As a result, there are many non-Hokkien words that have been imported into Singaporean Hokkien, such as those from Malay, Teochew, Cantonese, and English.

==Vocabulary from Old Chinese==
{{main|Old Chinese|Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters}}
Certain [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|colloquial]] pronunciations of Singaporean Hokkien words are directly inherited from the [[consonant]] system of [[Old Chinese]]. Hokkien did not experience a great phonological change throughout the transition period from [[Old Chinese]] to [[Middle Chinese]].

Singaporean Hokkien preserved a unique feature of [[Old Chinese]]: it does not have the consonant "f". For instance, the word "分" is not pronounced as ''fen'', but rather as ''pun''. This marks a major difference between [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]. Singaporean Hokkien also preserved the [[nasal vowel]] and the ''sai'' vowel of [[Old Chinese]].

Some of the Buddhist temples in Singapore continue to have Buddhist sutra being recited in Hokkien. The sutra contain Singapore-style Hokkien romanization to help in the recitation. Some of the Chinese Christian churches in Singapore also have services conducted in Singaporean Hokkien. Many of the Taoist services continue to be in Hokkien.

===Music===

There exist Singaporean Hokkien writings, folk adages, and ballads written by early Chinese immigrants to Singapore.

Amongst the folk ballads, a few outstanding writings tell of the history and hardship of early Chinese immigrants to Singapore.

There are 18 sections in the poetry ballad "行船歌" (''Hâng-chûn-koa'') ("Songs of traveling on a boat"), which talks about how early immigrants migrated to Singapore.

There is another ballad called "砰嘭水中流" (''Pin-pong-chúi-tiong-lâu'') ("Flow in the midst of water"):

{{quote|
乞涸木為舟，

kih kok bo̍k ūi tsiu

砰嘭水中流，

pin pong chúi tiong lâu

門雙劃槳，

mn̂g-siang u̍ih-hiúⁿ

噝刷到泉州。

si suit kàu chôan-chiu
}}

An example of a folk love ballad is "雪梅思君" (''Soat-m̂-su-kun'') ("Snow and plum thinking of a gentlemen"), on the loyalty and chastity of love.&lt;REF name="autosh-1"/&gt;

An example of love poetry is "針線情" (''Chiam-sòaⁿ-chiâⁿ''） ("The emotions of needle and thread"):

{{quote|
你是針，我是線，针线永远黏相倚。

lí sī chiam ， góa sī sòaⁿ ，chiam-sòaⁿ éng-óan liâm siòng óa

人講針補針針也著綫，為何放阮咧孤單。

lâng kóng chiam pó͘ chiam hiam tio̍h sòaⁿ， ūi-hô pàng gún leh ko͘-toaⁿ

啊！你我本是同被單，怎樣來拆散？

Ah, lí góa pún sī tâng phōe-toaⁿ, chóaⁿ-iūⁿ lâi thiah-sòaⁿ

有針無綫叫阮要按怎，思念心情無帶看。

ū chiam bô sòaⁿ kiò gún ài an-chóaⁿ， su-liām sim-chiâⁿ bô-tè khòaⁿ
}}

===Getai===
{{main|Getai}}
Singapore also held [[Getai]] during traditional Chinese festivals, for instance the [[Hungry Ghost Festival]]. During the [[Getai]] event, it is common to speak a number of Chinese dialects, including [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], and [[Cantonese]]. During the 1960s, Hokkien song was particularly popular. The Singapore Hokkien star Chen Jin Lang (陳金浪) was once the [[Master of ceremonies|compere]] and main singer during the Hungry Ghost Festival. His famous song "10 levels of Hades" ("十殿閻君") was especially popular.

===In opera===
{{main|Singapore Hokkien Opera}}
Early Singaporean Hokkien opera had its origins in [[Gaojia]] opera, which was brought from [[Quanzhou]] to Singapore during the late 19th century. In 1927, the Taiwanese [[Taiwanese opera|Gezai]] opera spread to Singapore. Because its lyrics and singing style were easier to understand, it made a great impact on Singapore. Consequently, by the mid 20th century, it had replaced [[Gaojia]] opera to become the mainstream Hokkien opera in Singapore.

Currently, Singapore Hokkien opera is performed by two older troupes—[[Sin Sai Hong Hokkien Opera Troupe]] (新賽風閩劇團) and [[Xiao Kee Lin Hokkien Opera Troupe]] (筱麒麟閩劇團)—and three newer troupes—[[Sio Gek Leng Hokkien Opera Troupe]] (筱玉隆閩劇團), [[Ai Xin Hokkien Opera Troupe]] (愛心歌仔戲團), and Do Opera [Hokkien] (延戏[福建歌仔戏]), which is the newest.

A Singapore Chinese opera school nurtures talents in opera, including Hokkien opera.

===In movies===

Singapore Hokkien movies began to appear in the late 1990s, notably by dubbing in Hokkien mainstream Chinese movies made in Singapore. Amongst these, movies directed by [[Jack Neo]], such as ''[[I not stupid]]'' and ''[[Money No Enough]]'' were popular. They reflected the social environment of local Singaporeans.

===In radio===

Although Singapore radios started to ban Hokkien in the 1980s, [[Rediffusion Singapore]] continued to broadcast in Hokkien and greatly contributed to the culture of Singapore. For instance, the Hokkien story-telling program ''Amoy folks story'' (''廈語民間故事''), by Xu Shumei (許淑梅), was very popular.

===Nanyin===
{{Main|Nanguan music}}

[[Nanguan music|Nanyin]] (Southern Music) first spread to Singapore in 1901.&lt;REF Name="autosh-2" /&gt; Many immigrants from Quanzhou began to establish various Nanyin organizations.

Those which survive include the [[Siong Leng Musical Association]], which was established in 1941. It was responsible for promoting Nanyin, as well as [[Liyuan opera]]. In 1977, the then chairman of the association, Ting Ma Cheng (丁馬成), advocated for the ASEAN Nanyin Performance (亞細安南樂大會奏), which helped to revive Nanyin. In addition, in order to educate young people about this performance art, he also published two books on Nanyin and [[Liyuan opera]].&lt;REF Name="autosh-3" /&gt;

Currently, the [[Siong Leng Musical Association]] is led by Ding Honghai (丁宏海), and it continues to promote Nanyin in Singapore.

==Places in Singapore==

Singapore's Chinese name "新加坡" (''sin-ka-pho'') originated from Hokkien's transliteration of "Singapore". In addition, there are many other place names in Singapore that originated from Hokkien: [[Ang Mo Kio]] and [[Toa Payoh]], for instance.

'''Sonology''' is a [[neologism]] used to describe the study of [[sound]] in a variety of disciplines.

In medicine, the term is used in the field of [imaging] to describe the practice of [[medical ultrasonography]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, R. (2003),The Science of Sonology:The Semantics of the Professional, ''Journal of Diagnostic Medical Sonography'' 2003; 19; 337&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, sonology may represent a more advanced application of clinical sonography, chiefly due to the requirement for the use of critical application of both cognitive and radiographic skills in making the diagnostic determination at the time of bedside application of focused ultrasound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stawicki|first=S. P.|last2=Bahner|first2=D. P.|date=2015-10-01|title=Modern sonology and the bedside practitioner: evolution of ultrasound from curious novelty to essential clinical tool|journal=European Journal of Trauma and Emergency Surgery|volume=41|issue=5|pages=457–460|doi=10.1007/s00068-014-0464-x|issn=1863-9941|pmid=26037996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used to describe interdisciplinary research in the field of [[electronic music]] and [[computer music]], drawing upon disciplines such as [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[musical composition|composition]] and [[psychoacoustics]]. This sense of the term is widely associated with the [[Institute of Sonology]], which was established by composer [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]] at the [[Utrecht university|University of Utrecht]] in 1967 and later moved to the [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Sonology (2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.koncon.nl/public_site/220/Sononieuw/UK/1964-1986.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720185250/http://www.koncon.nl/public_site/220/Sononieuw/UK/1964-1986.html |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }} Retrieved 2011-02-06&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been adopted to describe the study of electronic music at other institutions, including the Center for Computational Sonology (now "Sound and Music Computing")&lt;ref&gt;University of Padova (2010) http://www.dei.unipd.it/wdyn/?IDsezione=3314&amp;IDgruppo_pass=59&amp;preview= Retrieved 2011-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Padua]], [[Kunitachi College of Music]] in Tokyo, at the [[Catalonia College of Music]] in Barcelona and the [[Federal University of Minas Gerais]] in Brazil.

The term has been less commonly used to describe the use of sound for therapeutic and religious purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Church of Sonology (2005), http://www.sonology.net/learn.html Retrieved 2011-02-06&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tequistlatecan languages''', also called '''Chontal of Oaxaca''', are three close but distinct languages spoken or once spoken by the [[Oaxaca Chontal people|Chontal people]] of [[Oaxaca]] State, Mexico.

They were spoken by 4,400 people in 2010.{{#tag:ref|[[INALI]] (2012) [http://site.inali.gob.mx/pdf/libro_lenguas_indigenas_nacionales_en_riesgo_de_desaparicion.pdf ''México: Lenguas indígenas nacionales]''|name=INALI}}

*[[Huamelultec language|Huamelultec]] (Lowland Oaxaca Chontal),
*[[Tequistlatec language|Tequistlatec]] (extinct),
*[[Highland Oaxaca Chontal]].

==Name==
Although most authors use the form ''tequistlatec(an)'' today, this is based on an improper derivation in Nahuatl (the correct derivation from ''Tequisistlán'' would be ''Tequisistec(an)'', and both terms were used by [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]] interchangeably).

==Classification==
The Tequistlatecan languages are part the proposed [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] family, but are often considered to be distinct family. Campbell and Oltrogge (1980) proposed that the Tequistlatecan languages may be related to [[Jicaquean languages|Jicaquean]] (see [[Tolatecan languages|Tolatecan]]), but this hypothesis has not been generally accepted.

'''''The Klingon Hamlet''''' (full title: '''''The Tragedy of Khamlet, Son of the Emperor of [[Klingon#Homeworld|Qo'noS]]''''') is a translation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' into [[Klingon language|Klingon]], a [[constructed language]] first appearing in the television series ''[[Star Trek]]''.

The play was translated over several years by Nick Nicholas and Andrew Strader of the "Klingon Shakespeare Restoration Project", with feedback and editorial assistance from Mark Shoulson, d'Armond Speers, and Will Martin. The impetus for the project came from a line from the motion picture ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' in which the [[Gorkon|Klingon Chancellor Gorkon]] stated, "You have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon." According to a disclaimer, the project is written in a satirical style implied by Chancellor Gorkon's quote — that Shakespeare was actually a Klingon (named "Wil'yam Sheq'spir") writing about an attempted coup in the Klingon Empire.

==Impetus==
In a scene from the film ''Star Trek VI'' a dinner is held for the Klingon chancellor, Gorkon. He makes a toast to "the undiscovered country...the future". Spock, recognising the quotation, responds, "Hamlet, Act 3 Scene 1", to which Gorkon replies with his statement about the "original" Klingon text of Shakespeare. Though Gorkon does not quote from the "original" Klingon text, another character, [[Chang (Star Trek)|Chang]], quotes the Klingon words "&lt;tt&gt;taH pagh taHbe'&lt;/tt&gt;" (To be, or not to be). The film is filled with other quotations and references to Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Kay (2004). "Hamlet, Part Eight, The Revenge or Sampling Shakespeare in a Postmodern World". College Literature 31 (4): 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the undiscovered country" is part of Hamlet's famous ''"[[To be, or not to be]]"'' [[soliloquy]].

The film's director [[Nicholas Meyer]] said the idea for having the Klingons claim Shakespeare as their own was based on Nazi Germany's attempt to claim [[William Shakespeare]] as German before World War II.&lt;ref name="meyer"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Special Collectors Edition: Audio Commentary |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |author=Nicholas Meyer |author2=Denny Flinn |type=DVD; Disc 1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar scene appears in the wartime British film ''[["Pimpernel" Smith]]'' (1941) in which a German general quotes Shakespeare, saying “'To be or not to be', as our great German poet said."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hodgdon, W. B. Worthen, ''A Companion to Shakespeare and Performance'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p.443.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea had also already been used by [[Vladimir Nabokov]] in his novel ''[[Pnin]]'', the eponymous hero of which taught his American college class that Shakespeare was much more moving "in the original Russian."

==Style and format==
The English version of the play appears alongside its "original Klingon" text. The "original Klingon" version differs from the English version in ways that reflect the play's history as supposedly originating from Klingon culture. Reference sections in the book show how literal translations of the Klingon body text have had to be "adapted" to make it intelligible for human readers in the supposedly "translated" English version.

The introduction adopts a faux-academic style, explaining that Klingon origin of the play is evident from the fact that the plot is based on predominantly Klingon themes and motifs as opposed to human themes and motifs. Human culture was too primitive to have produced such a work during the time period in which it is set. A comparison of the "spontaneous, direct and vibrant verse" of the Klingon version with the "flaccid, ponderous convoluted meanderings" of the English version, make it obvious that the latter is a derivative work.&lt;ref name = "intro"&gt;Introduction, ''The Klingon Hamlet: Star Trek All Series'', Simon and Schuster, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction also claims that the notion that Shakespeare was a human poet living in the late 16th century was invented after the [[United Federation of Planets]] instigated a large propaganda campaign in order to rally the human population against Klingons, "hoping by this falsification of history to discredit the achievements of Klingon culture".&lt;ref name = "intro"/&gt;

==Publication==
The [[Klingon Language Institute]] (KLI) printed and published a hardback version, limited to 1000 numbered copies, in 1996, entitled ''Hamlet Prince of Denmark: The Restored Klingon Version'' ({{ISBN|0-9644345-1-2}})  This was a product of the Klingon Shakespeare Restoration Project, and was several years in the making.  The entire play is presented in facing pages of English and Klingon, along with an appendix of end-notes detailing particulars of the translation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kli.org/stuff/projects.html#KSRP KLI Projects&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507162823/http://www.kli.org/stuff/projects.html |date=2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Trek'' publisher [[Pocket Books]] published the work as a trade paperback ({{ISBN|0-671-03578-9}}) in 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7774">'''"The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man"''' is a phrase of uncertain origin and without a primary source that has been cited by scholars and in publications as a message delivered by a Jewish fact-finding mission to Palestine, usually in the 1890s,&lt;ref&gt;Shai Afsai, [http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/5148/features/the-married-to-another-man-story/ "The 'Married to another Man' Story,"] ''[[Jewish Ideas Daily]]'', October 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or less frequently, the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, ''Original Sins: Reflections on the History of Zionism and Israel'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1992), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Stories using the phrase generally convey an ignored warning that a Jewish homeland would not be reestablished in Palestine without interfering with the existing population.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Silver, "Decade of Disillusion," ''The Guardian'', June 4, 1977, p.7; [[Anthony Pagden]], ''Worlds at War'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cQ5Wp3Wps-UC&amp;pg=PA419 419].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'''s foreign correspondent and expert on Israel and the Middle East, Eric Silver,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/17/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast "Eric Silver"], ''The Guardian,'' July 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
reported a version of the story in 1977: "An ageing pioneer was interviewed once on Israeli television. He explained how the elders of his Russian Jewish village had sent an emissary to Palestine to spy out the land. The man reported back: 'The bride is beautiful, but she is already married.'"&lt;ref&gt;Eric Silver, "Decade of Disillusion," ''The Guardian'', June 4, 1977, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]] of the University of Haifa recounted a different version of the story in his ''Original Sins: Reflections on the History of Zionism and Israel'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Shai Afsai, [http://www.jewishlinkbc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6765:the-married-to-another-man-story-and-zionism&amp;catid=156:features&amp;Itemid=585 "The 'Married to Another Man' Story and Zionism"], ''Jewish Link'', February 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Beit-Hallahmi wrote: "There is a famous story, told during a meeting between Prime Minister Golda Meir and a group of Israeli writers in 1970. A Jew from Poland visited Palestine in the 1920s. On his return to Europe, he summarized his impressions by saying: 'The bride is beautiful, but she has got a bridegroom already.' Golda Meir responded by saying: 'And I thank God every night that the bridegroom was so weak, and the bride could be taken away from him.'"&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, ''Original Sins: Reflections on the History of Zionism and Israel'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1992), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; 

UCLA professor of political science and history [[Anthony Pagden]] told another version of the story in his ''Worlds at War: The 2,500-Year Struggle Between East and West'' (2008): "When in 1897 the rabbis of Vienna sent a fact-finding mission to Palestine, they famously reported back that the bride 'was beautiful but married to another man.' But the implication of this wry remark — that the Zionists should attempt to marry someone else — was disregarded."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, ''Worlds at War'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=cQ5Wp3Wps-UC&amp;pg=PA419 419].&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has also been cited as an 1890s fact-finding message in the 2008 [[BBC Two]] documentary ''The Birth of Israel'', produced by Middle East Editor [[Jeremy Bowen]],&lt;ref&gt;Hadar Sela, "[http://bbcwatch.org/2012/12/27/where-did-jeremy-bowen-learn-the-history-of-the-arab-israeli-conflict/ Where did Jeremy Bowen learn the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict?"] bbcwatch.org, December 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[P. J. O'Rourke]],&lt;ref&gt;P. J. O'Rourke, ''Peace Kills: America's Fun New Imperialism'', 2005, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam LeBor]],&lt;ref&gt;Adam LeBor, ''City of Oranges: An Intimate History of Arabs and Jews in Jaffa,'' 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mustapha Marrouchi.&lt;ref&gt;Mustapha Marrouchi, "Cry No More for Me, Palestine—Mahmoud Darwish," ''College Literature,'' Vol. 38, No. 4 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of the books ''Married to Another Man'' (2007) by [[Ghada Karmi]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin Woollacott, "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/15/politics1 Joined-up Solution,"] ''The Guardian'', Sept. 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and (in Swedish) ''Bruden är vacker men har redan en man'' by Ingmar Karlsson (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Abramowicz, "[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4270039,00.html Getting away with anti-Semitism,"] [[ynetnews]], August 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; are based on the story.

In 2012 an article by Shai Afsai was published in the academic journal ''[[Shofar (journal)|Shofar]]'' asserting that the stories in which the phrase appears are unsubstantiated.  Afsai contacted several scholars who repeated the stories but none were able to provide a primary source for them.&lt;ref&gt;Shai Afsai, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/shofar/v030/30.3.afsai.pdf “The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man”: Historical Fabrication and an Anti-Zionist Myth,"] ''Shofar'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (2012), pp. 35-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Afsai argued that "those who tell the story never provide a primary source for it and often provide no source at all" and that "there has been no basis for recounting the story as a historical event that occurred during the early years of the Zionist movement. In short, the story is unsubstantiated and writers should not treat it as historical fact." 

Afsai discussed [[Avi Shlaim]], Anthony Pagden, Ghada Karmi, Mustapha Marrouchi, [[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal]], Scott Hunt, Peter Rodgers, [[Karl Sabbagh]] and others as examples of those who treat the stories as verified historical events, and concluded: "The 'married to another man' story, in all of its various permutations, should not be considered authentic until a primary — or at least early — source is found that shows it to be so." He also noted that some of the same points made "by telling the 'married to another man' story can be made by referring to actual historical documents and occurrences" instead, and mentioned the writings and observations of Zionist travelers such as [[Leo Motzkin]], [[Israel Zangwill]] and [[Ahad Ha'am]], and the Zionist settler Yitzhak Epstein.&lt;ref&gt;Shai Afsai, “The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man”: Historical Fabrication and an Anti-Zionist Myth," ''Shofar'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (2012), pp. 35-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Alan Dowty]], American author and Professor of Political Science Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame: “Zionists of the [[First Aliyah]] (wave of immigration to Palestine, from 1882 to 1905), did—contrary to some claims—‘see’ the Arabs there, but they did not see an Arab problem. They also paid remarkably little attention to the Arab population, simply noting their presence as one facet of the new environment with which they contended. For their own sanity, the new settlers needed to minimize the difficulties they faced and, in the case of the Arabs, it was also ideologically crucial to avoid any suggestion that they were simply replicating the Diaspora pattern of a Jewish minority existing at the sufferance of a majority non-Jewish host population.” &lt;ref&gt;Alan Dowty, “‘A Question That Outweighs All Others’: Yitzhak Epstein and Zionist Recognition of the Arab Issue,” ''Israel Studies'', Vol. 6, No. 1, (2001), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''tie''' is a symbol in the shape of an [[arc (geometry)|arc]] similar to a large [[breve]], used in [[Greek language|Greek]], phonetic alphabets, and [[Z notation]]. It can be used between two characters with spacing as [[punctuation]], or non-spacing as a [[diacritic]]. It can be above or below, and reversed. Its forms are called '''tie''', '''double breve''', '''enotikon''' or '''papyrological hyphen''', '''ligature tie''', and '''undertie'''.

==Uses==
{{anchor|Papyrological hyphen|Enotikon|Ancient Greek|Modern Greek|Greek hyphen}}&lt;!--linked from Enotikon, Romanization of Greek, etc.--&gt;
===Greek===
The '''enotikon''' ({{lang|el|ενωτικόν}}, ''enōtikón'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"uniter"), '''papyrological hyphen''', or '''Greek hyphen''' was a low tie mark found in late [[Classical Greek|Classical]] and [[Byzantine Greek|Byzantine]] [[papyri]].&lt;ref name=nickyh&gt;Nicholas, Nick. "[http://www.opoudjis.net/unicode/unicode_aitch.html#usage Greek Unicode Issues: Greek /h/]". 2005. Accessed 7 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In an era when Greek texts were typically written ''[[scripta continua]]'', the enotikon served to show that a series of letters should be read as a single word rather than misunderstood as two separate words. (Its companion mark was the [[hypodiastole]], which showed that a series of letters should be understood as two separate words.&lt;ref name=nicky&gt;Nicolas, Nick. "[http://www.opoudjis.net/unicode/punctuation.html Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation]". 2005. Accessed 7 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although [[modern Greek]] now uses the [[Latin script|Latin]] [[hyphen]], the [[Hellenic Organization for Standardization]] included mention of the enotikon in its [[Romanization of Greek|romanization standard]]&lt;ref name=elot&gt;{{lang|el|Ελληνικός Οργανισμός Τυποποίησης}} [''Ellīnikós Organismós Typopoíīsīs'', "[[Hellenic Organization for Standardization]]"]. {{lang|el|ΕΛΟΤ 743, 2η Έκδοση}} [''ELOT 743, 2ī Ekdosī'', "ELOT 743, {{nowrap|2nd ed.}}"]. ELOT (Athens), 2001. {{el icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Unicode]] is able to reproduce the symbol with its characters {{unichar|203F|UNDERTIE|cwith=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}} and {{unichar|035C|COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW|cwith=&amp;nbsp;}}.&lt;ref name=nicky/&gt;&lt;ref name="litchfield"/&gt;

The enotikon was also used in [[Greek musical notation]], as a [[slur (music)|slur]] under two notes. When a syllable was sung with three notes, this slur was used in combination with a [[colon (punctuation)|double point]] and a [[overline|diseme overline]].&lt;ref name="litchfield"&gt;''Ancient Greek music'', Martin Litchfield West, 1994, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Phonetic Alphabet ===
The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses two type of ties: the ligature tie (IPA #433), above or below two symbols and the undertie (IPA #509) between two symbols.

==== Ligature tie ====
The ligature tie, also called double inverted breve, is used to represent [[Doubly articulated consonant|double articulation]] (e.g. {{IPA|[k͡p]}}), [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] (e.g. {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}}) or [[prenasalized consonant]] (e.g. {{IPA|[m͡b]}}) in the IPA. It is mostly found above but can also be found below when more suitable (e.g. {{IPA|[k͜p]}}).

On computers, it is encoded with characters {{unichar|0361|COMBINING DOUBLE INVERTED BREVE|cwith=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|use=IPA}} and, as an alternative when raisers might be interfering with the bow,  {{unichar|035C|COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW|cwith=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|use=IPA}}.

==== Undertie ====
The undertie is used to represent linking (absence of a break) in the IPA. For example it is used to indicate [[liaison (French)|liaison]] (e.g. {{IPA|/vuz‿ave/}}) but can also be used for other types of [[sandhi]].

On computers, the character used is {{unichar|203F|UNDERTIE|use=IPA}}. This is a [[spacing character]], not to be confused with the alternative (below-letter) form of the ligature tie (a&amp;#x035c;b {{unichar|035C|COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW|use=IPA}}), which is a [[combining character]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2594.pdf SC2/WG2 N2594 - Proposal to encode combining double breve below]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uralic Phonetic Alphabet ===
The [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]] uses several forms of the tie or double breve:&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/SC2/wg2/docs/n2419.pdf ''Uralic Phonetic Alphabet characters for the UCS''], 2002-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/WG2/docs/n3571.pdf ''Proposal to encode additional characters for the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet''], Klaas Ruppel, Tero Aalto, Michael Everson, 2009-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The triple inverted breve or triple breve below indicates a [[triphthong]]
* The double inverted breve, also known as the ligature tie, marks a [[diphthong]]
* The double inverted breve below indicates a syllable boundary between vowels
* The undertie is used for [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]
* The inverted undertie is used for prosody.

=== Other uses ===
[[File:Character tie.svg|thumb|left|300px|Various forms of the tie]]
The double breve is used in the phonetic notation of the [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]] in combination with a double o, o͝o, to represent the [[near-close near-back rounded vowel]] ({{IPA|ʊ}} in IPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/WG2/docs/n2457.pdf ''Proposal for 3 Additional Double Diacritics''], 2002-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The triple breve below is used in the phonetic writing [[Rheinische Dokumenta]] for three letter combinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pentzlin.com/DiacriticalMarkRheindok.pdf ''Proposal to encode a combining diacritical mark for Low German dialect writing''], Karl Pentzlin, 2008-10-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The character tie is used for sequence concatenation in [[Z notation]]. It is encoded with {{unichar|2040|CHARACTER TIE}} in Unicode. For example "s⁀t" represents the concatenation sequence of sequences called ''s'' and ''t''; and the notation "⁀/q" is the distributed concatenation of the sequence of sequences called ''q''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/mike/zrm/index.html ''The Z Notation: a reference manual''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110214746/http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/mike/zrm/index.html |date=2010-01-10 }}, J. M. Spivey.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ligature tie is used in the [[logotype]]s of [[mobilkom Austria]] and its A1 brand.

The diacritic signs triple inverted breve, triple breve, and double inverted breve have not yet been encoded for computers.

Unicode has characters similar to the tie:
* {{unichar|23DC|top parenthesis}} and {{unichar|23DD|bottom parenthesis}}
* {{unichar|2322|frown}} and {{unichar|2323|smile}}
* {{unichar|2050|close up}}, which is a [[proofreading mark]]

The '''Translate Toolkit''' is a localization and translation toolkit.  It provides a set of tools for working with [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] file formats and files that might need localization.  The toolkit also provides an API on which to develop other localization tools.

The toolkit is written in the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]].  It is [[free software]] originally developed and released by [[Translate.org.za]] in 2002 and is now maintained by Translate.org.za and community developers.

Translate Toolkit uses [[Enchant (software)|Enchant]] as spellchecker.

==History==

The toolkit was originally developed as the mozpotools by David Fraser for Translate.org.za.  Translate.org.za had focused on translating KDE which used [[Gettext]] PO files for localization.  With an internal change to focus on end-user, cross-platform, OSS software, the organisation decided to localize the [[Mozilla Suite]].  This required using new tools and new formats that were not as rich as Gettext PO.  Thus mozpotools was created to convert the Mozilla DTD and .properties files to Gettext PO.

Various tools were developed as needed, including &lt;tt&gt;pocount&lt;/tt&gt;, a tool to count source text words to allow correct estimations for work, &lt;tt&gt;pogrep&lt;/tt&gt;, to search through translations, and &lt;tt&gt;pofilter&lt;/tt&gt;, to check for various quality issues.

When Translate.org.za began translating OpenOffice.org it was only natural that the Translate Toolkit would be adapted to handle the OpenOffice.org internal file format.  Translating OpenOffice.org using PO files is now the default translation method.

As part of the WordForge project the work received a major boost and the toolkit was further extended to manage XLIFF files alongside PO files.  Further funded development has added other features including the ability to convert [[Open Document Format]] to XLIFF and the management of placeholders (Variables, acronyms, terminology, etc.).

==Design goals==

The main aim of the toolkit is to increase the quality of localisation and translation.  This is achieved by firstly, focusing on good localisation formats thus the toolkit makes use of the PO and XLIFF localisation formats.  This has the benefit that it stops the proliferation of localization formats and allows localizers to work with one good localization tool.  For the toolkit this means building converters that can transform files to be translated into these two basic formats.

Secondly, to build tools that allow localizers to increase the general quality of their localization.  These tools allow for the extraction of terminology and for checking for the consistent use of terminology.  The tools allow for checking for various technical errors such as the correct use of variables.

Lastly, the toolkit provides a powerful localisation API&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://translate.sourceforge.net/doc/api/ |title=Translate Toolkit API documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; that acts as a base on which to build other localization related tools.

==Users==

Many translators use the toolkit directly, to do quality checks and to transform files for translation.  Further there are and have been several indirect users of the Translate Toolkit API:

* [[Pootle]] - an online translation tool
* [http://open-tran.eu open-tran] - providing translation memory lookup (was shut down on January 31, 2014.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/open-tran/gO_c6ScjMUk | title = Closing open-tran.eu | author = Jacek Śliwerski | date = 2013-12-01 | publisher = Google Groups | accessdate = December 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tunni''' (also known as '''Af-Tunni''') is an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language spoken by the Tunni sub-group of the [[Rahanweyn]] [[Somalis|Somali]] clan, who reside in the [[Lower Shebelle]] and [[Middle Juba]] regions in southern [[Somalia]]. The language is typically classified among the Digil group of [[Cushitic languages]]. Tunni is distinct from [[Somali language|Somali]], with a different phonology and sentence structure.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.

'''Vittal Rāo K''' ({{lang-ta|விட்டால் ராவ் கி}}) (born 12 May 1942) is a  [[Tamil language|Tamil]] writer&lt;ref name="GoogleBooks"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;lpg=PA4595&amp;dq=Vittal%20Rao%2C%20K.&amp;pg=PA4595#v=onepage&amp;q=Vittal%20Rao,%20K.&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Five (Sasay To Zorgot), Volume 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was born at [[Hosur]], a small town in the [[Krishnagiri]] district of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. Although a Kannadiga by birth, Tamil was his medium of instruction since he did his schooling in [[Tamil Nadu]]. A man of varied talents, he took to writing in his early twenties, but he became a recognizable face in the local literary circles when his short stories started appearing in popular Tamil weekly magazines such as [[Ananda Vikatan]]  in 1967. In his literary career spanning over four decades, Vittal Rao has written&lt;ref name="JeeVee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeeveesblog.blogspot.in/2011/05/blog-post.html|title=வித்தியாசமான விட்டல் ராவ்}}&lt;/ref&gt; 9 novels, 5 collections of 140 short stories and 7 essays ranging from [[world cinema]] to [[fine art]], [[history]] and [[literature]].

==Biography==
===Personal life===
Vittal Rao was born in Hosur, a small town in the old [[Salem district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. He was the sixth of eight siblings born to Saraswathi and Krishna Rāo. He spent most of his childhood and adolescent days in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] before moving to [[Chennai]] in 1960 to work as a radiographer at Stanley Medical College and Hospital there. It was during this time that he developed an interest in fine arts and literature which encouraged him to enroll at the prestigious [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai]] (formerly known as the ''[[Madras School of Art]]'') in Chennai. He joined Madras Telephones later, in 1963, where he continued to work until his retirement in May, 2002. Working at Madras Telephones, allowed him to pursue his interest in fine arts and literature. One of his favorite pastimes included browsing the Moor Market, near the Madras Central Railway Station, which used to be a popular hangout of literary and art aficionados where used books from around the world could be bought at a bargain.

===Works===

His first short story appeared in the popular weekly, [[Ananda Vikatan]]  in 1967, and from there on his writings have appeared in all the popular as well as little literary magazines.

His novel, ''Pokkidam'' (Refuge, 1976), which won the best novel award instituted by ''Ilakkiya Chintanai'', brought him to serious literary attention. He has so far written 9 novels, long and short, and over a hundred short stories, of which only 4 collections have come out.

To talk about a few of his significant works, ''Nadhimoolam'' (Source of the river, 1981), unfolds the lives of three generations of a Madhava Brahmin family, dovetailing the narrative with the happenings and movements outside in society. It is a large and intricate tapestry of varied designs and colors, of interacting social forces in individual human lives. The happenings in society that he has woven into the story are authentic historical developments. It is a unique work in Tamil in that, while reading the lives of individuals one also reads the history of social changes, both bound up inextricably.

In ''Kaalaveli'' (Temporal expanse, 1988) the author presents a segment in lives of some students of an arts school with all their aspirations, frustrations, mutual jealousies and compromises in life. It is almost a documentary record of the milieu of artists and writers in Madras city in the seventies. In fact, all his works have a documentary dimension with authentic history as a background, intricately woven in to the narrative he chooses to unfold.

His novels have the dimension of being the chronicles of social history with a keen sense of observation and with an eye for detail. These qualities mark him out as one of the few significant novelists the twentieth century has given to contemporary Tamil literature.

{{About||a list of competitions|World Cup (disambiguation){{!}}World Cup|a more exhaustive list|List of world sports championships}}
[[File:Kitzbuehel slalom ganslernhang 2010.jpg|mini|thumb|200px|The [[Alpine Skiing World Cup]] consistis of a series of competitions where results are counted together.]]

A '''world cup''' is a global [[sport]]ing competition in which the participant entities – usually international teams or individuals representing their countries - compete for the title of world champion. A world cup is generally considered the premier competition in its sport, with the victor attaining the highest honour in that sport and able to lay claim to the title of their sport's best. However, in some sports the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] title carries at least as much prestige.

There are a number of notable world cups in popular sports like [[ICC Cricket World Cup]], but it is the [[FIFA World Cup]] (an [[association football]] tournament, first held in 1930) that is widely known as simply "the World Cup".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/61/W0226150.html The American Heritage  Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between world cup and world championships==
Some [[sports governing body|sports governing bodies]] prefer the title '''[[world championship]]''' or a related term; some even organize both a world cup and a world championship with different rules. Usually, such competitions take one of two forms, a short periodic competition or a year-long series of meetings, but more frequently many sports have both [[World Cup]] (usually competed with more races of a season), and [[world championship]] (usually a single event). Some examples in the following table.

A periodic world cup or world championship usually takes the form of a [[Tournament#Knockout tournaments|knockout tournament]] (possibly with an initial group stage). This is held over a number of days or weeks, with the entrants eventually being whittled down to two, and the tournament culminating in a '''world cup final'''. The winner(s) take the title of World Champion(s) and hold it until the next time the event is held (usually one, two, or four years later). This format is most common in [[team sport|team sports]], as with the FIFA World Cup or the [[Cricket World Cup|ICC Cricket World Cup]].

==Season-long format==
A contrasting concept, popular in individual sports, is a year-long competition with several meetings over its course. In this format, victory at an individual meeting  earns a number of points, and, usually, a number of positions below also score points inversely related to their position. Contestants accumulate a number of points over the course of the year (often "[[Season (sports)|season]]") and their cumulative total after all meetings have been concluded determines the World Champion or, simply, World Cup winner. The winner is then considered the champion until the next World Cup.
