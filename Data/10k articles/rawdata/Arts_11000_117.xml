'''Adela Nora Rogers St. Johns''' (May 20, 1894 – August 10, 1988) was an American journalist, novelist, and screenwriter. She wrote a number of screenplays for [[Silent film|silent movies]] but is best remembered for her groundbreaking exploits as "The World's Greatest Girl Reporter" during the 1920s and 1930s and her celebrity interviews for ''[[Photoplay]]'' magazine.

==Early life==
St. Johns was born in [[Los Angeles]], the only daughter of Los Angeles criminal lawyer [[Earl Rogers]] (who was a friend of publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]]) and his wife, Harriet Belle Greene.&lt;ref name=mclellan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-11/news/mn-388_1_adela-rogers-st-johns|title=Writer Adela Rogers St. Johns Dies at 94|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=August 11, 1988|publisher=latimes.com|page=1|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Hollywood High School]], graduating in 1910.&lt;ref name=pace&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/11/obituaries/adela-r-st-johns-94-journalist-novelist-teacher-and-scripwriter.html|title=Adela R. St. Johns, 94, Journalist, Novelist, Teacher and Scriptwriter|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=August 11, 1988|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She obtained her first job in 1912 working as a reporter for Hearst's ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''. She reported on crime, politics, society, and sports news before transferring to the ''[[Los Angeles Herald]]'' in 1913.&lt;ref name=mclellan/&gt;

After seeing her work for that newspaper, [[James R. Quirk]] offered her a job writing for his new fan magazine ''[[Photoplay]]''. St. Johns accepted the job so she could spend more time with her husband and children. Her celebrity interviews helped the magazine become a success through her numerous revealing interviews with Hollywood film stars.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-11/news/mn-388_1_adela-rogers-st-johns/2|title=Writer Adela Rogers St. Johns Dies at 94|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=August 11, 1988|publisher=latimes.com|page=2|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote short stories for ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', and other magazines and finished nine of her thirteen screenplays before returning to reporting for Hearst newspapers.

Writing in a distinctive, emotional style, St. Johns reported on, among other subjects, the controversial [[Jack Dempsey]]–[[Gene Tunney]] [[The Long Count Fight|"long-count" fight]] in 1927, the treatment of the poor during the [[Great Depression]], and the 1935 trial of [[Bruno Richard Hauptmann]] for kidnapping and murdering the son of [[Charles Lindbergh]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

In the mid-1930s, she moved to Washington, D.C., to report on national politics for the ''[[Washington Herald]]''. There she became prominent among a group of female reporters working for [[Cissy Patterson]]. Her coverage of the assassination of Senator [[Huey Long]] in 1935, the abdication of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] in 1936, the Democratic National Convention of 1940, and other major stories made her one of the best-known reporters of the day. St. Johns again left newspaper work in 1948 in order to write books, and to teach journalism at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

In 1962, she published ''Final Verdict'', a biography of her father [[Earl Rogers]]. The book was adapted for a [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] television film [[Final Verdict|of the same name]] in 1991; [[Olivia Burnette]] portrayed the young St. Johns.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Later years===
St. Johns was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] on April 22, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=2482 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.presidency.ucsb.edu%2Fws%2Findex.php%3Fpid%3D2482&amp;date=2011-12-25|archivedate=2011-12-25|first=Richard|last=Nixon|title=Remarks on Presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Eight Journalists|date=April 22, 1970|accessdate=2011-12-25|publisher=Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s and 1970s, St. Johns was a frequent guest on various talk shows including [[Jack Paar]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and The Merv Griffin Show. During one ''Tonight Show'' visit, Paar noted that St. Johns had known many of the legends of [[Classical Hollywood cinema#The golden age|Hollywood's Golden Age]] and was once rumored to have had [[Clark Gable]]'s child.&lt;ref name=fleming&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fixers: Eddie Mannix, Howard Strickling and the MGM Publicity Machine|last=Fleming|first=E.J.|year=1994|publisher=McFarland|pages=98|isbn=0-7864-5495-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Johns replied, "Well who wouldn't have wanted to have Clark Gable's baby?"&lt;ref name=fleming/&gt; Paar noted that St. Johns had enjoyed a rather incredible life and asked if there was anything she wanted to do that she had not yet done. St. Johns replied, "I just want to live long enough to see how it all turns out."{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1976, at the age of 82, she returned to reporting for the ''Examiner'' to cover the bank robbery and conspiracy trial of [[Patty Hearst]], granddaughter of her former employer. In the late 1970s, St. Johns hosted a miniseries chronicling Gable's films, which appeared on Iowa Public Television. Around the same time she was interviewed for the television documentary series ''[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Brownlow, Kevin; Gill, David|title=Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film|url=https://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-1-James-Mason/dp/6301931556|medium=video|publisher=Thames Video Production|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, St. Johns appeared with other early 20th-century figures as one of the 'witnesses' in [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981). St. Johns spent her remaining years living in [[Arroyo Grande, California]].&lt;ref name=pace/&gt;

== Personal life ==
St. Johns was married three times and had four children. Her first marriage was to ''Los Angeles Herald'' chief copy editor William Ivan St. Johns, whom she married in 1914. They had two children, Elaine and William Ivan, Jr. before divorcing in 1927.&lt;ref name=pace /&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes /&gt; The following year, she married one-time [[Stanford University]] football star [[Richard Hyland (rugby)|Richard Hyland]]. They had one son, Richard, and divorced in 1934.&lt;ref name=latimes /&gt; St. Johns' third marriage was to F. Patrick O'Toole, an airline executive. They married in 1936 and divorced in October 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19421028&amp;id=xbwhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r5wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4709,5805244|title=Film Writer Granted Divorce In West|date=October 28, 1942|work=Reading Eagle|page=12|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her third divorce, St. Johns adopted a son as a single parent.&lt;ref name=latimes /&gt;

== Death ==
On August 10, 1988, St. Johns died at the South County Convalescent Hospital in [[Arroyo Grande, California]] at the age of 94.&lt;ref name=pace /&gt; She is buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]].

The '''Amato Opera''' was an [[opera]] company located in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhood of the [[Manhattan]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]]. The company was produced by the husband and wife team of Anthony and Sally Amato and presented opera on a small scale with a reduced orchestra at low prices. Over its 61 years in existence, it encouraged and trained many young singers.

==Early years==
The company was founded in 1948 by husband and wife team Anthony (July 21, 1920 &amp;ndash; December 13, 2011) and Sally Bell Amato (September 27, 1917 &amp;ndash; August 16, 2000). Tony Amato acted as artistic director, choosing the repertoire, rehearsing and conducting the operas. In the early productions, he often cast students from his opera classes at The America Theatre Wing, where he was the Director of the Opera Workshop. There was no admission charge for the company's early performances, because union rules prohibited it. Instead, during the intermission the Amatos would "pass the hat around" for contributions. Sally acted as costumier, ran lights and box office and managed publicity and business matters. Under the alias Serafina Bellantoni, she sang in productions for over fifty years.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, Sondra Zuckerman. [http://www.amato.org// "From Dreams to Reality: Fifty Years of the Amato Opera"], originally published in the Opera Circle newsletter in 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first production, [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini's]] ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'', was mounted in the auditorium of [[Our Lady of Pompeii Church (Manhattan)|Our Lady of Pompeii Church]] at [[Bleecker Street|Bleecker]] and Carmine Streets.&lt;ref name=Wakin /&gt; The following week, the company produced ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and ''[[Pagliacci]]''. The company used many other locations in its early years, including the Kaufman Auditorium of the [[92nd Street Y]], the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]], and [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]] auditorium.

In 1951, the company moved into its first permanent home at 159 Bleecker Street. In its new 299-seat theatre, the company gave four performances during nearly every weekend of the year. The company's repertory soon spanned 21 different operas, and it gave over 1,296 performances at the theatre. Productions were occasionally presented in nearby cities, such as [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut]], and abridged children's performances were also given at [[The Town Hall]]. The Bleecker Street theatre closed in 1959, but the company continued to perform at other venues, including The Town Hall and 126 West [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]].&lt;ref name=Diaz /&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Tony Amato.jpg|thumb|upright|Anthony Amato]]
Amato found a new permanent home in 1964 in a four-story building, next to a gas station and near the famous rock club [[CBGB]], at 319 [[Bowery]] near Second Street, a former Mission House and restaurant supply store, which was converted into a theatre with rehearsal and storage space, 107-seats, a 20-foot stage and a tiny orchestra pit.&lt;ref name=Diaz /&gt;

Each season included five or six different operas, typically a mix of comedies and tragedies, and the repertory eventually expanded to over 60 operas.&lt;ref name=Wakin /&gt; Each opera ran over five weekends, and the company used multiple rotating casts. Amato also mounted Saturday morning Opera-In-Brief performances. Aimed at children, the Opera-In-Brief performances are full-length short operas or abridged versions of longer operas interspersed with narration. Throughout its life, Amato Opera maintained a policy of keeping prices low, charging only $1.80 a seat in 1964. By 1975 ticket prices were $3–4 and in 1998, they were $23. In 2008, tickets were $35 ($30 for students, children, and seniors), still modest compared to those at larger opera houses.&lt;ref name=Wakin&gt;Wakin, Daniel J. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/arts/music/13amat.html "Shock Greets Move to Close Amato Opera in May",] ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 12, 2009 (website requires registration)&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]] made a documentary film about Amato in 2001 called ''Amato: A Love Affair With Opera''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/amato/index.html PBS documentary: "Amato: A Love Affair with Opera"], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; PBS wrote, "The Amato Opera has grown famous as a testing ground for young singers; many of its performers have gone on to sing, direct, and conduct in opera companies around the world ... The orchestra is phenomenal. The sets, designed by Richard Cerullo for the past twenty years, are wonderfully designed to make the most of the Amato's small stage. And what the theater lacks in seating capacity it makes up for in intimacy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/amato/about.html "About the Amato Opera"], PBS website for "Amato: A Love Affair with Opera", 2001, accessed October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Amato Opera received commendations and awards from Mayors [[Abraham Beame|Abe Beame]], [[Ed Koch]] and [[Rudy Giuliani]], and the Amatos were inducted into [[City Lore]]'s Peoples' Hall of Fame, honored by the American Cultural Roundtable, and the Italian Heritage and Cultural Committee, in recognition for their contribution to the artistic life of New York City.

==Closure==
Amato Opera closed after its last performance of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' on May 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steve.

[[Image:Star Wars in Tunisia.jpg|thumb|200px|''Star Wars'' filming location in Tunisia]]
'''Architecture in ''Star Wars''''' includes the cities, buildings, ships, and other structures of the fictional ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] as described and depicted in books, movies, comics, and cartoons. ''[[Architects Journal]]'' ranked the top 10, including the [[Death Star]] and the [[Jedi Temple]].&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;James Pallister [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=5203477 Top 10: The Architecture of Star Wars (pt II)]
15 June 2009 Architects Journal (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the urban and natural environments pictured in ''Star Wars'', Mark Lamster wrote that the cities are places of danger and corruption, while the forces of good find sanctuary in the natural world.&lt;ref name="ambivalent"&gt;Mark Lamster "Evil foes build ever-more-elaborate urban monstrosities- machines not for living but killing, and killing on a grand scale" [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC&amp;pg=PA234 Architecture and film] Star Wars and the City page 6&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes the "retro-[[futurist]]" cities in the series as being in between those extremes and places  of "great beauty but dubious moral character." He attributes the ambivalence towards urbanity to series creator [[George Lucas]]' own feelings about cities and urban environments.&lt;ref name="ambivalent"/&gt;
 
The settings of the movie have generally been praised, but one author took exception to the "anachronistic period architecture and statuary" of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'', saying it improperly associated [[third world]] buildings with conceptions of innocence and the primitive in a way that was discriminatory and demeaning.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;

==Planet settings==
[[Luke Skywalker]] is first seen in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' living with his adoptive parents in a "complex of caves and domed structures" on [[Tatooine]], filmed in the [[Tunisia]]n desert town of [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]].&lt;ref name="hives"&gt;Mark Lamster [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=star+wars+architecture#v=onepage&amp;q=star%20wars%20architecture&amp;f=false Architecture and film] Wretched Hives: George Lucas and the Ambivalent Architecture of Star Wars page 234&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the first movie was shot in the [[Guatemala]]n [[rain forest]] where a celebration with rebel allies takes place in a caved area (a scene said to be borrowed from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s 1935 [[Nazi]] [[propaganda film]] ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;). The exotic locales provide scenery that is unfamiliar to "all but a few experts in non-western architecture", providing the films with fantastic settings that could still be believable.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;

==Urban planning==
Three architecture and planning students noted that the "latest" (1999) ''Star Wars'' movie ''(The Phantom Menace)'' offered "a variety of urban development options" in a ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' story headlined "How would you like to live on a Star Wars' world?"&lt;ref name="cosmic"&gt;Roger M. Showley "The latest "Star Wars" movie offers a variety of urban development options according to three architecture and planning students who previewed the film; from left, [Tim Belzman], San Diego State University; Bruce Fallown, Newschool of Architecture; and [David Sin], Woodbury University School of Architecture." [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/74622433.html?dids=74622433:74622433&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+30%2C+1999&amp;author=Roger+M.+Showley&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=Cosmic+communities+%7C+How+would+you+like+to+live+on+a+%60Star+Wars'+world%3F&amp;pqatl=google Cosmic communities]; How would you like to live on a `Star Wars' world? May 30, 1999 page H.1 San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; The article included illustrations of [[Coruscant]] ("completely covered by development" and "surrounded by mile-high skyscrapers"), including views from the [[Jedi]] Council building, and the city of ''Theed'' (inspired by [[Palace of Caserta|an 18th-century palace]] near [[Naples|Naples, Italy]]).&lt;ref name="cosmic"/&gt; On Coruscant, "development extends miles below the surface of the city and up into the clouds."&lt;ref name="cosmic"/&gt;

The "urban future" has also been depicted in ''[[Blade Runner]]'' where "the setting is a grimy, crime-ridden [[Los Angeles]] in the 21st century".&lt;ref name="cosmic"/&gt; The architecture of ''Star Wars'' may also have been influenced by [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt; The designs continued Lucas' work from his first feature film, ''[[THX 1138]]'', which featured a [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], [[George Orwell|Orwellian]] "subteranean world of black-and-white spaces" where the population is subdued with drugs and kept under constant surveillance.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;

===Jedi Temple===
''[[Architects' Journal]]'' rated the '''Jedi Temple''' (located in the capital planet of ''[[Coruscant]]'') third on its top-ten architecture of ''Star Wars'' list behind the second [[Death Star]] and [[Jabba the Hutt’s palace]] on [[Tatooine]], and ahead of Coruscant, capital city of the Old Republic.&lt;ref name="architecture" /&gt; The temple is described in the article as adapting "the robust typology of Mayan temples, with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength" and said to be a [[ziggurat]] that "is built above a Force-nexus and has ample room for training facilities, accommodation and the Jedi Archive."&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; The temple has five towers, the tallest is Tranquillity Spire, that are stylistically similar to the [[minaret]]s surrounding the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'' listed it as the one hundredth greatest thing about ''Star Wars'' in its one hundredth issue special.

==Ships==
The [[battle cruiser]]s featured in ''Star Wars'' have been described as examples of "[[Suprematist]] architecture".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ings [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17022875.500-falling-star.html Falling star] 21 April 2001 ''New Scientist''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real world buildings that mirror ''Star Wars''==
The [[San Francisco Federal Building]] designed by [[Thom Mayne]] has been compared to the [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawa]] [[Sandcrawler]] featured in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Glenn [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2007/04/architecture_im.html Architecture imitates art?] April 25, 2007 Boston Globe&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ING House|ING headquarters]] building (in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]) has been described as looking like something out of ''Star Wars'' that could "move forward on its legs".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jodidio [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5V7tVWdJsC&amp;pg=RA1-PT341&amp;dq=star+wars+architecture#v=onepage&amp;q=star%20wars%20architecture&amp;f=false Architecture now! ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, the [[Trinity College, Dublin]], [[Trinity College Library|Long Room]] Library is thought to be the basis for the [[Jedi]] Academy Library in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/ten/2002/1111/starwars.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231081314/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2002/1111/starwars.html |date=December 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiseek.com/ireland/news/2002/000238.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102090635/http://www.archiseek.com/ireland/news/2002/000238.htm |date=January 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Braun GmbH''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-brown.ogg|b|r|aʊ|n}} "brown"; {{IPA-de|bʁaʊn|lang|Braun.ogg}}), formerly '''Braun AG''', is a German consumer products company based in [[Kronberg]]. From 1984 until 2007, Braun was a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] of [[Gillette (brand)|The Gillette Company]], which had purchased a controlling interest in the company in 1967. Braun is now a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], which acquired Gillette in 2005. On 16 April 2012, [[De'Longhi]] bought perpetual rights to manufacture Braun branded products from [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] in the small appliance segment. Procter &amp; Gamble will continue to own the Braun brand.&lt;ref name="Delonghi 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release|url=http://investors.delonghi.com/pdf/pressreleases/delonghi-spa:-press-release-16-april-2012--2012-04-16.pdf|publisher=investors.delonghi.com|date=2012-04-16|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Max Braun (engineer)|Max Braun]], a mechanical engineer, established a small engineering shop in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1921. In 1923, he began producing components for radio sets. In 1928, the company had grown to such an extent, partly due to the use of certain [[plastic]] materials, that it moved to new premises on ''Idsteiner Strasse''.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.britishdesigninnovation.org/index.php?page=newsservice/view&amp;news_id=4257 British Design Innovation History of Braun]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, eight years after he started his shop, Max Braun began to manufacture entire radio sets. Soon after, Braun became one of Germany's leading radio manufacturers. This development continued with the launch of one of the first combined radio and [[record player]]s in 1932.

In 1935,&lt;ref&gt;Key dates - http://www.company-histories.com/Braun-GmbH-Company-History.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Braun [[brand]] was introduced, and the original incarnation of the [[logotype]] with the raised "[[A]]"&lt;ref&gt;“Around the world in 90 years”: The history of the Braun brand from 1921 to today, http://www.braun.com/-/media/medialib/downloads/global/newsroom/90-years-of-braun/braun-90-years-of-braun-brand-history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was born. At the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 World's Fair in Paris]], Max Braun received the award ''For special achievements in [[phonograph]]y''. During World War II, Braun was compelled to more or less abandon products for the civilian sector.  In 1944, the Frankfurt factories were almost entirely destroyed and Max Braun began to rebuild his company with 150 employees.

After the war, Braun continued to produce state-of-the art radios and [[audio equipment]], and soon became well known for its "[[high-fidelity]]" audio and record players, including the famous SK line. In 1954, the company also began producing film [[slide projector]]s, a mainstay of its business for the next forty years. By 1956, Braun was marketing the first fully automatic tray film slide projector, the PA 1. Braun AG slide projectors all utilized a linear or [[straight-tray slide projector|straight tray]] as opposed to a [[round-tray slide projector|round-tray]] design, which allowed the projector to remain small and compact.&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Braun_Camera"/&gt;

The 1950s also marked the beginning of the product that Braun is most known for today: the [[Razor#Electric razors|electric shaver]]. The S 50 was the first electric shaver from Braun. The shaver was designed in 1938, but [[World War II]] delayed its introduction until 1951.&lt;ref name="shaver"&gt;[http://menshair.guide/history-electric-shavers.html Shaver Companies Histories] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831114256/http://iavbbs.com/gflinn/shaver1.htm |date=August 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured an [[oscillation|oscillating]] cutter block with a very thin, yet very stable steel-foil mounted above it. This principle is still used in Braun's shavers of today. 

The 1950s also saw the start of kitchen appliances, like the mixer MX 3 and the kitchen machine (Küchenmaschine or kitchen machine) [[Braun KM 3]]. The KM 3 is a family of food processors which started with the model KM 3/31 in 1957. Designed by Gerd Alfred Müller, these machines were built in nearly unchanged form for 36 years, until 1993. 

In 1962, Braun became Braun AG, a publicly traded company. In 1963, the company started distributing microphones by U.S. manufacturer Shure in Germany. Also during the 1960s, Braun created the [[Dieter Rams|Rams]]-designed T3 pocket radio. By this time, Braun's film slide projectors were featuring high-quality optics and all-metal construction combined with sleek [[:wikt:functionalism|functionalist]] styling, and competed with higher-end Eastman Kodak and Leitz products in the global market. Braun also started distributing in Germany high-end medium-format [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] system-cameras produced by Japanese camera manufacturer [[Bronica|Zenza Bronica]], as well as Braun-Nizo brand [[camera]]s and [[Super 8 film camera]]s (formerly of Niezoldi &amp; Krämer GmbH; purchased by Braun in 1962). In 1967, a majority share of the company was acquired by the Boston, Massachusetts-based conglomerate Gillette Group.

Erwin Braun, one of Max Braun's sons, took on the sales agency of the LECTRON system product line in 1967.  He was very interested in making the teaching of electronics approachable to students all over the world.  The LECTRON system was a simple but ingenious product which fit the bill perfectly. The LECTRON System was introduced to the German marketplace in 1966 by Egger-Bahn (a company primarily focused on the 9mm toy train sector). An electronic component such as a resistor was placed inside a transparent flat cube with a white cover on the top of which had the electronic symbol and its value.  The blocks containing different components and types of connections could be put together to form a working circuit with the schematic diagram of the circuit illustrated by the symbols on the top of the block.  The blocks were held together with the use of magnets behind the conductive plates on the sides and bottom of the block.  In 1972, due to pressure from Gillette, the LECTRON assets were sold off to Manfred Walter, the manager of the LECTRON product line at Braun.  Mr. Walter formed Lectron, GmbH in 1972 to continue selling and developing the LECTRON product line. Mr. Walter retired and gifted the LECTRON assets to the Reha-Werkstatt Oberrad in 2001. The RWO continues to manufacture and sell the LECTRON system to this day.&lt;ref&gt;http://lectron.info&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, Braun had begun to focus on home consumer appliances, including shavers, coffee makers, razors, clocks, and radios.  The company's line of film slide projectors and hi-fi products was discontinued.  In 1998, Braun AG was transformed into a privately held company.

In 1981, the company's audio and hi-fidelity division, which grew out of Braun's former core business of radios, turntables, and hi-fidelity audio products, was spun off into Braun Electronic GmbH, a legally independent Gillette subsidiary.  Braun Electronic GmbH put out its last audio-fi set in 1990 before the business was discontinued. Also in the early 1980s, Braun sold its photographic and slide projector division to [[Robert Bosch GmbH]].

In 1982, Gillette Group moved to integrate Braun with the parent company by taking full control over its operations. In 1984, Braun ceased the production of cigarette lighters.  That same year, Braun became a wholly owned subsidiary of Gillette.

By the mid-1990s, Braun held a leading position among the world's home appliance manufacturers, but profitability concerns began to surface. Many of Braun's competitors closely imitated Braun designs and had them produced in low-cost labor countries at lower costs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Braun Sieht Bei Kopien Rot", ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', March 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The litigation commenced by the company to reverse the sales losses and damage to its product image cost Braun substantial amounts of money.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1998, Gillette decided to transform Braun AG into a private company before it bought back a 19.9 percent share in its subsidiary The Gillette Company Inc., which Braun had acquired in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;"Die Braun AG firmiert zur GmbH um", ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', September 24, 1998, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gillette-Ertrag leidet unter Schwierigkeiten bei Braun", ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', July 17, 1999, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, Braun's sales organization was merged with those of Gillette's other business divisions to cut costs. At the end of the 1990s, Braun and Gillette suffered losses in several areas. Looking for ways to return to profitability, Gillette considering the disposal of some of Braun's less profitable divisions, such as kitchen appliances and thermometers, but abandoned the idea a few months later when no buyers were found.&lt;ref&gt;£"Gillette sucht Käufer für Teile von Braun", ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', February 24, 2000, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Braun's sales in those areas began to recover in 2000.

Gillette was acquired by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] ("P&amp;G") in 2005, making Braun a wholly owned subsidiary of P&amp;G.  In early 2008, P&amp;G discontinued sales of Braun appliances, except shavers and electric toothbrushes, in the North American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodandwine.com/blogs/mouthing-off/2008/1/30/bye-bye-braun-some-shocking-news |title=Bye, Bye Braun |publisher=foodandwine.com |date=January 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206043314/http://www.foodandwine.com/blogs/mouthing-off/2008/1/30/Bye-Bye-Braun-Some-Shocking-News |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, however, Braun kept selling all its core categories until 2012, when the Braun brand relating to kitchen appliances was purchased by [[De'Longhi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://investors.delonghi.com/pdf/pressreleases/finalization-of-the-braun-transaction-2012-08-31.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
[[File:Braun Shaver - Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|A Braun Shaver]]
Braun's products include the following categories:

* Shaving and grooming (electric shaving, hair trimming, beard trimming)
* Oral care (now under the [[Oral-B]] brand)
* Beauty care (hair care and epilation)
* Health and wellness (ear thermometers, blood pressure monitors) (out-licensed)
* Food and drink preparation (coffee makers, coffee grinders, toasters, blenders, juicers) (out-licensed)
* Irons (out-licensed)
* Clocks, watches and calculators (out-licensed)

The company was formerly a manufacturer of food processors, radios, slide projectors, Super 8 film cameras and accessories, and high-fidelity sound systems.

Today, Braun focuses on its core categories (shaving and grooming, beauty and hair care). Household Small Appliances, Health and wellness category as well as clocks and watches are now run by other companies (De'Longhi, Zeon, [[Kaz Incorporated|Kaz]]) under licence.

==Design department==
From the mid-1950s, the Braun brand was closely linked with the concept of German modern industrial design and its combination of functionality and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/69982458|title=Braun : 50 Jahre Produktinnovationen|last=1952-|first=Polster, Bernd,|date=2005|publisher=DuMont Literatuar und Kunst Verlag|isbn=3832173641|location=Köln|oclc=69982458}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1956, Braun created its first design department, headed by [[Eichler|Dr. Fritz Eichler]], who instituted a collaboration with the [[Ulm School of Design]] to develop a new product line.&lt;ref&gt;Bürdek, B. E., ''Design: History, Theory And Practice Of Product Design'', Basel: Birkhäuser Publishing (2005), {{ISBN|3-7643-7029-7}}, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1956 the company introduced its famous ''SK4'' record player ("Snow White's Coffin"), designed by a youthful [[Dieter Rams]] together with the pioneer of system design, Hans Gugelot, then lecturer of design at the Ulm School of Design.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, H., ''Systemdesign Bahnbrecher: Hans Gugelot 1920-1965'', Basel: Birkhäuser Publishing (1987), {{ISBN|3-7643-1911-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rams soon became the most influential designer at Braun.&lt;ref name="AboutDieter"&gt;[http://www.designmuseum.org/design/dieter-rams Design Museum Biography of Dieter Rams]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rams&lt;ref name="Furniture"&gt;[http://www.vitsoe.com/en/gb/about/dieterrams Furniture of Dieter Rams]&lt;/ref&gt; was a key figure in the German design renaissance of the late 1950s and 1960s.  Eventually becoming head of Braun's design staff, Rams' influence was soon evidenced in many products.  Braun's famous SK 4 record player and the high-quality "D"-series (D25–D47) of 35mm slide projectors are some of the better examples of [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalist]] design.

Another 'icon' of modern design, but less well known, is the electrostatic loudspeaker unit [[BRAUN LE1]], the electronics were licensed from [[QUAD]]. Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs are also responsible for the classic range of Braun alarm clocks, collaborating first on the AB 20 in 1987. These designs were discontinued by Braun in 2005. For nearly 30 years Dieter Rams served as head of design for Braun A.G. until his retirement in 1995 when he was succeeded by Peter Schneider. Many of his designs—sleek coffee makers, calculators, radios and razors—have found a permanent home at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

In the 1970s, a design approach influenced by pop-art began to inspire Braun products, which by this time included many common household appliances and products. Contemporary Braun design of the period incorporated this new approach in bright colors and a lightness of touch, while still clean-lined in keeping with Functionalist philosophy.

'''Cartilage baroque''' denotes a stylistic period centering around the middle of the 17th century in Northern Europe, particularly in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Germany]]. Primarily a style of [[ornament (art)|ornament]], it is known as ''bruskbarokk'' in Norwegian, ''bruskbarok'' in Danish and ''Knorpelbarock'' in German (all these use the local words for [[cartilage]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/bruskbarokk|title = bruskbarokk|publisher =   Store norske leksikon|author=   Håvard Hagen |accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''style cartilage'' may be encountered in French. However, the various terms can be applied to a bewildering range of styles of [[Northern Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] ornament. In English these terms are mainly found in translated texts from European languages. 

There is much use of [[strapwork]] in which, instead of leather or paper forms being imitated, the shapes may give the impression of imitating flayed skin or [[cartilage]], including the cartilage giving the ear its shape, whether or not this was actually the intention, hence the origin of the name.&lt;ref&gt;Frederiks, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  The style has some relation to the [[auricular style]] of the same period, which is seen in its purest and most famous form in Dutch silverwork.&lt;ref&gt;Frederiks, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  This does take its name from resembling somewhat the shape of the ear, as does the German term ''Ohrmuschelstil''.

Dealing mainly with interior architecture, it marked the transition from [[High Renaissance|High-Renaissance]] and [[Manierism]] to established [[Baroque]], placing it during the years 1620-1660. Cartilage baroque draws heavily on established [[Renaissance art]] forms, but gets its distinctive style from added ornamental elements, such as leaves and garlands, and a suppressed curvature. 

The Scottish craftsman, woodcutter and painter  [[Andrew Lawrenceson Smith]] is seen as one of the leading examples in the use of  cartilage baroque, especially for his work  in [[Stavanger Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://nbl.snl.no/Anders_Smith|title = Anders Smith, Billedskjærer, Maler|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=   Kjartan Fløgstad|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Village2.JPG|thumb|250px|A [[Department 56]] ''New England Series'' village display.]]
A '''Christmas village''' (or '''putz''') is a decorative, miniature-scale [[village]] often set up during the [[Christmas]] season. These villages are rooted in the elaborate Christmas traditions of the [[Moravian church]], a Protestant denomination. Mass-produced cardboard Christmas villages became popular in the [[United States]] during the early and mid-20th century, while porcelain versions became popular in the later part of the century.

==Origins==
[[File:Decorative Christmas village 2.JPG|thumb|200px|A Christmas village set atop a table]]
The tradition of decorative Christmas villages is rooted in the holiday traditions of the [[Moravian church]], a Protestant denomination with early settlements in [[Salem, North Carolina]] and [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].  In American [[Moravian church|Moravian]] homes, the construction of a [[nativity scene]], or putz, at the base of a [[Christmas tree]] was a very common holiday activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://lancasteronline.com/features/faith_values/the-putz-at-lititz-moravian-church-is-much-more-than/article_8f7124b2-a505-11e5-abca-d3bba1f6c3f1.html |title=The putz at Lititz Moravian Church is much more than a Nativity scene |newspaper=LancasterOnline |publisher=[[LNP Media Group]] |date=December 15, 2015 |first=Laura |last=Knowles |access-date=November 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was derived from the German verb ''[[wikt:putzen|putzen]]'', which means "to clean" or "to decorate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/putz |title=Definition of Putz |website=Merriam-Webster |access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nativity scenes soon became very elaborate, and often included sawdust or fine dirt spread to represent roads leading to the manger; stones and fresh moss to represent grottos or caves; and sticks and branches to represent miniature trees. These details were in addition to the carved wooden figures that represented the [[Holy Family]], animals, shepherds, and other traditional nativity figures. 

Although initially placed beneath the Christmas tree, by the early 19th century a family's "putz" might have also been found on the fireplace mantel, side tables, and other prominent places within the home. These expanded scenes might include other stories from the [[Bible]]. The story of [[Noah's Ark]], an especially popular subject for a putz, could result in the arranging of several hundred carved animals wending their way towards the ark.

By the mid-19th century, more secular figures and scene elements were being added to the putz. In many homes, the putz took more time and energy than the decoration of the family Christmas tree. Separate areas were developed with different themes; spreading outward from the Nativity scene were other farms or village scenes, which had a way of growing larger and more elaborate every year. Eventually, toy trains were added to these miniature worlds.

==Mass ==

After [[World War II]], several Japanese companies started mass-producing cardboard or paper houses, churches, and other buildings. These small buildings usually had holes in the back or the bottom through which Christmas lights were placed to provide illumination. The buildings had tiny colored cellophane windows and were decorated with mica-dusted roofs to give the appearance of snow. Since these buildings were made of inexpensive material and were widely available throughout the [[United States]], they became a very popular Christmas decoration.

==Modern villages==
[[Image:ChristmasVillage2008.jpg|thumb|left|A modern Christmas Village]]
In the 1970s, [[ceramic]] or [[porcelain]] Christmas villages were introduced and started to gain popularity. [[Department 56]] was one of the first companies to make these buildings and remain amongst the most well-known. Other companies, such as [[Lemax]], have also produced similar villages, and there are numerous other brands sold. In Europe, [[Luville]] and [[Dickensville]] are established brands. Drugstores and dollar stores now often carry much smaller buildings, which are typically not as well-painted. Unpainted buildings are also sometimes available at craft stores.

Christmas village buildings are not usually made to consistent relative scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christmasvillages.co.uk/choosing-a-train-set-for-your-christmas-village/ |title=Choosing A Train Set For Your Christmas Village |author=HRBuzz |date=September 20, 2015 |website=Christmas Villages |access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A church building might well be ten times the height of an ordinary house in reality but this would make very cumbersome models and look odd within a Christmas village display. It is only necessary for the church building to be noticeably taller than the house, to give it an imposing stature.

Like many other Christmas traditions, the notion of a village to celebrate a holiday has spread to other holidays, with a few companies making [[Halloween]] and [[Easter]] villages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3158">A '''colour cast''' is a tint of a particular colour, usually unwanted, which affects the whole, or portion, of a photographic image evenly.

Certain types of light can cause film and digital cameras to have a colour cast. Illuminating a subject with light sources of different colour temperatures will usually cause colour cast problems in the shadows.   In general, the human eye does not notice the unnatural colour, because our eyes and brains adjust and compensate for different types of light in ways that cameras cannot.

In film, colour casts can also be caused by problems in development. Improper timing or imbalanced chemical mixtures can cause unwanted casts.

Colour casts can also occur in old photographs due to fading of dyes, particularly under the action of ultra violet light.  These may be correctable on a scanned version of the photograph with image editing techniques.

==Solutions==
[[File:Siganus vulpinus 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Example of a photo with a uniformly green colour cast due to differential absorption of light before reaching certain depths at sea.]]
[[File:Siganus vulpinus 1 edit.jpg|thumb|200px|The same photo with the colour cast corrected]]
Most digital cameras try to automatically detect and compensate colour cast and usually have a selection of manually set [[Color balance|white balance]] settings to choose from. Otherwise, photo editing programs, such as [[Photoshop]], often have built in colour correction facilities. For film, blue [[filter (photography)|filters]] and amber [[filter (photography)|filters]] are used to counter casts. Amber filters are used to reduce the blueish tint caused by daylight. Blue filters reduce the orange colour caused by incandescent light.

A variety of coloured filters in varying degrees of intensity are available. [[Kodak]]'s amber filters, for example, vary from palest yellow ("81C") to deepest amber ("85B"). A photographer chooses which filter to use based on the quality of the ambient light. [[Color temperature|Colour temperature]] meters can read the [[color temperature|temperature]] of the existing lighting conditions and guide the selection of the filter. Clouded sky, for example, requires a paler amber than clear blue sky. If a filter is unavailable, [[flash (photography)|flash]] is an alternative solution which usually provides enough neutral white light to counter the cast.

In the case of film, if photographs all contain the same cast, it is usually indicative of improper chemical development. If the film itself does not contain any cast, it can be reused to create another set of photographs in proper chemical conditions. If the film contains a cast, filters can be used during photo processing to correct it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2318">'''Copenhagen Free University''' ('''CFU''', {{lang-da|Det Fri Universitet i København}}) is an artist-run [[Council communism|communist collective]] established in May 2001 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], although it is not an accredited institution of higher learning. It considers itself as part of the international [[Situationist International|Situationist]] movement in collaboration with other like-minded organizations.

The CFU committee comprises artists Henrietta Heise and Jakob Jakobsen, its founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=We are All Normal (and We Want Our Freedom)|pages=357|author=Katya Sander and Simon Sheikh|year=2001|publisher=Black Dog Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AK&gt;{{cite book|title=Realizing the Impossible: Art Against Authority|pages=150|author=Josh MacPhee and Erik Reuland|year=2007|publisher=AK Press|isbn=1-904859-32-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFU has a guide called ''The ABZ of the Copenhagen Free University'' with entries ranging from "self-institution" through "uneconomical behaviour" to "mass intellectuality".  It publishes small books and brochures, as well as hosting discussions, conferences, and screenings.  One of its publications is a research paper called ''The Rise and Fall of the Situationists'', documenting the influence of the [[Situationist International]] in Denmark.&lt;ref name=AK /&gt;

The CFU also helps to run an artist-run television service named '''TV-TV''', broadcast from a squat in Copenhagen (named ''Folkets Hus'' &amp;mdash; People's House) three nights per week in airtime slots that used to be occupied by TV STop, using TV Stop's equipment.  TV-TV's content is usually experimental, and its stated aim is to not be like mainstream television.&lt;ref name=AK /&gt;

The '''''Dead Christ Held by Two Angels''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Marco Palmezzano]], finished in 1510. It is housed in the [[Musée du Louvre]] of Paris, France.

The centre of the scene is occupied by the dead figure of Christ, portrayed with great attention to anatomical details, but also with evident religious piety; the brightness of his body is further enhanced by the dark stone, resembling a black cave, depicted in the background. This contrast can also have the allegorical meaning of Jesus leaving sin and death behind his shoulders. Jesus assumes in this way the evangelic role of proclamation of the end of the dark era of humanity, as also remembered by the presence of the two angels.

The work is influenced by those of [[Giovanni Bellini]], which Palmezzano saw in his sojourn in [[Venice]] in 1489–1495.

'''Dhokra''' ({{lang-or|ଡୋକରା}}, {{lang-bn|ডোকরা}}) (also spelt Dokra) is non&amp;ndash;ferrous metal casting using the [[lost-wax casting]] technique. This sort of metal casting has been used in [[India]] for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of [[Mohenjo-daro]].&lt;ref name=missouri&gt;{{cite web|url =http://anthromuseum.missouri.edu/minigalleries/lostwax/intro.shtml |title = Metal Working in India - Lost Wax Casting |accessdate = 2009-02-08|last = Della Cava  |first = Chiara |work = |publisher = Museum of Anthropology, University of Missouri-Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.infobanc.com/dokra.htm|title =Dokra|accessdate =2009-02-08|last =|first =|work =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090130100223/http://infobanc.com/dokra.htm|archivedate =2009-01-30|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lost wax technique for casting of copper based alloys has also been found in [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Malaysia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Central America]], and other places.

==The process==
There are two main processes of lost wax casting: solid casting and hollow casting. While the former is predominant in the [[South India|south of India]] the latter is more common in Central and [[East India|Eastern India]]. Solid casting does not use a clay [[core (manufacturing)|core]] but instead a solid piece of wax to create the mould; hollow casting is the more traditional method and uses the clay core.&lt;ref name=missouri/&gt;

The first task in the lost wax hollow casting process consists of developing a clay core which is roughly the shape of the final cast image. Next, the clay core is covered by a layer of wax composed of pure [[beeswax]], [[resin]] from the tree ''Damara orientalis'', and [[List of vegetable oils#Nut oils|nut oil]]. The wax is then shaped and carved in all its finer details of design and decorations. It is then covered with layers of clay, which takes the negative form of the wax on the inside, thus becoming a mould for the metal that will be poured inside it. Drain ducts are left for the wax, which melts away when the clay is cooked. The wax is then replaced by the molten metal, often using brass scrap as basic raw material. The liquid metal poured in hardens between the core and the inner surface of the mould. The metal fills the mould and takes the same shape as the wax. The outer layer of clay is then chipped off and the metal icon is polished and finished as desired.&lt;ref name=missouri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.india9.com/i9show/Dhokra-Craft-52343.htm |title = Dhokra craft |accessdate = 2009-03-12|last =   |first =    |work = |publisher =india9.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The name==
Dhokra Damar tribes are the traditional [[metalsmith]]s of [[West Bengal]] and [[Odisha]]. Their technique of lost wax casting is named after their tribe, hence Dhokra metal casting. The tribe extends from [[Jharkhand]] to West Bengal and [[Odisha|Orissa]]; members are distant cousins of the [[Chhattisgarh]] Dhokras. A few hundred years ago, the Dhokras of Central and Eastern India traveled south as far as [[Kerala]] and north as far as [[Rajasthan]] and hence are now found [[List of regions of India|all over India]]. Dhokra, or Dokra, craft from around [[Santiniketan]], West Bengal, is popular. Recently [[Adilabad]] [[Dokra]] from [[Telangana]] got Geographical Indicator tag in 2018.

==Dhokra,The Art &amp; Jewellery==
When mixed in the right proportion, this art form gives an antique look and augments well with various contemporary styles. A little different from its distant cousins of the east, it embodies a more primitive simplicity.

Some &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tribesindia.com/dhokra-art/ Dokra ornaments]&lt;/ref&gt; are crafted by Bhottada section of the famous Gond tribes of Orissa, well known for their costumes and embellishment styles. Originally, seeds of different wild fruits in the forest were used as beads with cotton thread in their necklace and earrings which over the years have been substituted by beads made from brass by the heating and beating process. By and large, Bhottada women of affluent families having a special status in their community used this jewellery. In recent times, it symbolises a more utilitarian approach in a traditional framework.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="707">The '''eavesdrop''' or '''eavesdrip''' is the width of ground around a house or building which receives the [[rain]] water dropping from the [[eaves]]. By an ancient [[Anglo-Saxon law]], a landowner was forbidden to erect any building at less than two feet from the boundary of his land, and was thus prevented from injuring his neighbour's house or property by the dripping of water from his eaves. The law of Eavesdrip had its equivalent in the Roman [[stillicidium]], which prohibited building up to the very edge of an estate.

'''Gruppo Bertone''', commonly known simply as '''Bertone''', was an [[Automotive industry in Italy|Italian automobile]] company, which specialized in [[Automotive design|car styling]], [[coachbuilder|coachbuilding]] and [[Contract manufacturer|manufacturing]]. Bertone styling is distinctive, with most cars having a strong "family resemblance" even if they are badged by different manufacturers. Bertone has styled cars for [[Abarth]], [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Aston Martin]], [[Citroën]], [[Ferrari]], [[Fiat Automobiles|FIAT]], [[Iso (automobile)|Iso]], [[Lancia]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Mercedes Benz]], [[Opel]] and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]], among others. In addition, the Bertone studio was responsible for two of the later designs of the [[Lambretta]] motorscooter. In the late 1980s, Bertone styled the K20 motorcycle helmet for Swiss bicycle and motorcycle helmet manufacturer Kiwi.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The company was based in [[Grugliasco]] in northern Italy. Gruppo Bertone was founded as ''Carrozzeria Bertone'' in 1912 by [[Giovanni Bertone]]. Designer [[Nuccio Bertone]] took charge of the company after [[World War II]] and the company was divided into two units: ''Carrozzeria'' for manufacturing and ''Stile Bertone'' for styling. Until its bankruptcy in 2014, the company was headed by the widow of [[Nuccio Bertone]], Lilli Bertone.

After its bankruptcy, the Bertone name was retained by some of its former employees who continued as a [[Milan]]-based design company, '''Bertone Design'''.

==History==
[[Giovanni Bertone]] started a carriage manufacturing business in [[Turin]], at the age of 28. Along with three workers, he built [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s.

In the first decades of the 20th century, cars were not common. The road traffic was dominated by horse-drawn carriages and the coaches built by the young Bertone were particularly regarded{{by whom|date=April 2012}} for their accuracy, quality and solidity. In 1914, [[Giuseppe Bertone]], nicknamed "Nuccio", the second son of Giovanni Bertone, was born. This nickname later became known{{by whom|date=April 2012}} as the signature to Nuccio, one of the greatest Italian style masters in the world. The outbreak of the first world war triggered a major crisis of the young Italian industrial sector and heavily affected [[Giovanni Bertone]], who was forced to close his company.

===1920s===
At the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], Bertone's business restarted and expanded its activities, and began focusing on the automotive sector. In 1920, a new plant was opened near the [[Col de Montgenèvre|Monginevro]] 119 in Turin.
Twenty people were on the payroll. One year later, the first important contract was signed to the company. This was a [[torpedo]] styled body based on the SPA 23S chassis. Then, the [[fiat|FIAT]] "501 Sport Siluro Corsa," the first of a family of models that would characterize the brand in the years to come, was designed. With that, the high performance sport car was born.

During the 1920s, Turin was represented as one of the worldwide centers of excellence of the car industry. Bertone was sitting on the hub of it and formed partnerships with almost all the manufacturers of the day. Giovanni Bertone began doing bodywork on the Fast, Chiribiri, Aurea, SCAT and Diatto chassis. The most important and long lasting relationships were those with the two biggest Turin manufacturers: FIAT and Lancia.

[[Vincenzo Lancia]] realised straight away that Giovanni Bertone was an outstanding skilled craftsman with a great future ahead of him. Affectionately nicknaming him "Bertunot", he commissioned Bertone to create complete car bodies, above all for the limited series that the companies of the day were not always equipped to manufacture. This was Bertone's first opportunity to carry out limited production of special cars on standard mechanical bases, and was the beginning of a great industrial experience.

These are very exciting years for Bertone himself, and also for the evolution of industrial style and design. The car body shapes are slowly but continuously changing, angular shapes begin to fade, wings start to be joined together.
Giovanni Bertone produced torpedo and saloon bodies for [[FIAT]] and [[Lancia]], and also for [[Itala]], [[Diatto]] and [[SPA (automobile)|SPA]]. He also worked on commissions for private customers eager for exclusivity. Alongside sports models like the 1928 Ansaldo 6BS, Giovanni Bertone also designed luxury cars like the [[Fiat 505 limousine]] and the [[Itala 51S]], both in 1924. He later designed the [[Lancia Lambda VIII Series]] in 1928.

===1930s===
Despite the fact that the depression of 1929 had brought many Turin carmakers to their knees, Giovanni Bertone's shrewd management allowed the company to carry on creating cars with great appeal. In 1932, Giovanni designed the imposingly elegant [[Lancia Artena]], which was produced until 1936. In 1933; the following year, a corner stone event for the Carrozzeria Bertone occurred. This was that Nuccio Bertone, who was nineteen at the time, officially began working in his father's company. In the same period, Bertone began working on commercial vehicles, and as the business grew, new premises were needed. The company moved to Corso Peschiera 225. Gruppo Bertone now had fifty members of staff.

In 1934, Bertone created the [[Fiat 527S Ardita 2500]], a turning point in car design, with some incredible new details such as the stunning front headlights with fairing along the bonnet. With the Ardita a new kind of style was created, destined to take off towards the end of the decade, with FIAT and Lancia models astounding for their day. Examples were the 'six window' [[FIAT 1500 Aerodinamica]], the opulent [[Lancia Aprilia Cabriolet]] and the novel [[Fiat 1500 Torpedo]], with structural features that had never been seen before, such as the fold-away hood which stowed away entirely inside the car. With Giovanni's bold innovations and elegant creations, he was highly appreciated by car experts and fans.

===1940s===
With the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the car market experienced a sudden, drastic downturn. Almost all the bodywork manufacturers, including Bertone, reacted to the crisis by turning to military vehicles of various kinds. The company created vehicles such as the Bertone ambulance on a Lancia Artena base. It was a hard time. The demand was scarce. Raw materials and labour was lacking. Military orders where difficult to fulfill. But production did not stop in the Corso Peschiera plant, some luxurious Lancia Aprilia are manufactured as well as the extremely elegant long chassis [[Fiat 2800 cabriolet]], the only one of its kind, built on commission for race driver and motoring journalist [[Giovanni Lurani Cernuschi]].

After the war, as the long slow process of reconstruction began in Europe, the big industrial companies gradually scaled up their production levels, and the bodyworks got back to work. During these difficult years Nuccio Bertone created cars like the [[Lancia Aprilia Cabriolet]] and the [[Fiat 1100 Stanguellini]] racing car, which were precursors to some of the design trends in the following decade.

At the end of the 1940s, Nuccio Bertone turned to racing, at the wheel of a number of different cars, including a [[Fiat 500 Barchetta]], which Nuccio built for himself. At the end of the decade the meeting with Vittorio Stanguellini led to the creation of a coupé with a Fiat 1100 chassis which got a high public appreciation..

===1950s===
The 1950s brought in the first orders from countries other than Italy, in particular from [[MG Cars|MG]] and [[Bristol Cars|Bristol Cars Limited]] in 1952. The following year, [[Nuccio Bertone]] designed the prototype for the [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (750/101)|Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint]], which was presented at the 1954 Turin Motor Show. A production of 1000 was originally planned, but in the end nearly 40,000 vehicles were made between 1954 and 1965. The car ceased production in 1965.

The relationship between Bertone and Alfa Romeo reached its creative peak with the [[Berlinetta Aerodinamica Tecnica]] (BAT) concept cars which pushed back the boundaries of car design and aerodynamics: the [[BAT 5]] in 1953, the [[BAT 7]] in 1954 and the [[BAT 9]] of 1955. Research into aerodynamics culminated in the production of the [[Abarth 750|Abarth 750 Record]] in 1956, built on a Fiat 600 chassis and tested on the high speed track at Monza. This Abarth set an impressive ten world records, including doing {{convert|4000|km}} at an average of 156.36&amp;nbsp;km/h and covering 10,125.26&amp;nbsp;km in 72 hours.

In 1957, the company expanded to start the production of the [[NSU Sport Prinz]]. The factory in Corso Peschiera could not cope with the forecasted production volumes. Construction work began in [[Grugliasco]] on the outskirts of Turin, for a new plant which became operative in 1959, with a workforce of 550. At the end of the 1950s, Bertone came up with some sports berlinetta which were to make history, such as the [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint Speciale|Giulietta Sprint Speciale]], the [[Aston Martin DB2/4]] and the [[Maserati 3500 GT]].

===1960s===
The 1960s were the years of the Italian-style GT. [[Nuccio Bertone]] came up with five variations on the theme which would always be dear to his heart, in the shape of five extremely racy GT models: the [[Alfa Romeo 2600|Alfa Romeo 2600 Sprint]], in coupé and cabriolet versions, two [[Ferrari 250 GT]]s, one named 'Wax' after the commissioning client, and the other for his personal use, the [[Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato|Aston Martin DB4 GT 'Jet']] and the [[Maserati 5000 GT]]. At the same time, two new industrial partnerships were getting under way, with the work on the [[Simca 1000 Coupé]] and the [[BMW 3200 CS]] limited series, as was the important, but unfortunate [[ASA 1000]], better known as the "Ferrarina", or "little Ferrari" (as the project originated with [[Enzo Ferrari]]), which, despite the high expectations of the public, never made it to the automobilemarket.

The [[Iso Rivolta GT 300]], the [[Iso Rivolta GT 340]] and the [[Iso Grifo]] were also created in the 1960s. [[Nuccio Bertone]] designed a prototype cabriolet of the latter and a racing version known as the A3C. The Grifo years were also the years of the [[Corvair Testudo]], driven personally by Nuccio Bertone to the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in 1963. The following year saw the [[Alfa Romeo Canguro]], followed in 1965 by the [[Alfa Romeo Giulia GT Veloce|Alfa Romeo Giulia GT]], the rightful heir of the [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint]].

In 1965, Carrozzeria Bertone experienced a major turning-point, with the launch of the [[Fiat 850|Fiat 850 Spider]]. The commercial success of this model led Nuccio Bertone to increase the company's production capacity to 120 units per day (between 1965 and 1972 nearly 140,000 were produced, the great majority of which were sold in the United States). With the Fiat 850, the company took a giant leap forward in terms of production volumes, from the 13,000 bodies produced in 1966 to nearly 30,000 in 1968, an increase of 40 percent.

The end of the 1960s saw the beginning of the partnership with [[Ferruccio Lamborghini]] that was destined to make history in the car world. The first vehicle to come out of this was the [[Lamborghini Miura]], which presented at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show, which reinvented the high performance coupé design concept. The Miura was followed by the [[Marzal]] in 1967 and the [[Lamborghini Espada|Espada]] in 1968. In the same period, two other coupés appeared: the Alfa Romeo Montreal and the [[Fiat Dino|Fiat Dino Coupé]], both out in 1967.
Astounding, ground-breaking cars, inventing their own language for the design of the future: these were Nuccio Bertone's trademarks.
At the Paris Motor Show of 1968, he presented the [[Alfa Romeo Carabo|Carabo]] concept car, based on an Alfa 33 chassis.

===1970s===
By 1970, Bertone had a workforce of 1,500 staff, and the Grugliasco factory covered an area of {{convert|267000|sqm}}. The partnership with Lamborghini led to the development of the [[Lamborghini Espada]], by 1973 known as the world's fastest four-seater. The design was inspired by an earlier concept, the [[Jaguar Pirana]]. After his initial success with the Espada he went on to design the [[Lamborghini Jarama]] and the [[Lamborghini Urraco]]. With the [[Lancia Stratos#Stratos Zero|Stratos Zero]] prototype, which built on a Lancia Fulvia 1.6 HF base, Bertone came to represent a new point of reference in modern art, as well as on the international car design scene. The Stratos Zero, which was presented at the 1970 Turin Motor Show, evoked a timeless blend of architecture, sculpture and industrial design.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
The following year, with some of the Zero's styling cues as a starting point, Bertone created the Lancia Stratos Stradale, a compact coupé destined mainly for the racing circuit, and which went on to win numerous victories in world rally championships.

In 1972, at the age of 88, Giovanni Bertone died.
In that year, as a tacit tribute to the company's founder, the [[Maserati Khamsin]] and the [[Fiat X1/9]] were released. The latter, foreshadowed by the Runabout concept car, was the heir of the [[Fiat 850|850 Spider]], and went on to enjoy the same runaway commercial success. Based on the [[Fiat 128]] chassis but with a mid-rear-engine layout, the X1/9 was in production from 1972 to 1988, with 160,000 units manufactured.

Meanwhile, Nuccio Bertone's prolific drawing board saw a succession of supercars, runabouts and provocative style concepts. These included the 1973 Series 3 version of the [[Lamborghini Espada]], which redesigned the dashboard configuration, the [[Lamborghini Countach]] and the [[Ferrari GT4|Ferrari 308 GT4]] of 1973, the Audi 50 and Innocenti Mini 90 of 1974, the [[Fiat 131 Abarth#The Fiat 131 as a rally car|Fiat 131 Abarth Rally]] in 1975, and the prototype [[Alfa Romeo Navajo]] in 1976.

In the same year, the company began working for [[Volvo]] on the [[264 TE]]. The [[Volvo 262C]], which was presented at the 1977 Geneva Motor Show, was entirely manufactured by Bertone, from the assembly of the basic body to the fitting of the mechanical components and the road trials.
This procedural turning point had a big role in transforming the company, which was now set to become a car manufacturer in its own right.

===1980s===
From the start of the 1980s, the [[Fiat Ritmo|Fiat Ritmo Cabrio]] and the [[Fiat X1/9]] were produced and sold directly under the Bertone brand, meaning that the company was now responsible not only for production but also for the sales network and after-sales assistance for the two models.

In 1982, Nuccio Bertone turned out another important design, the [[Citroën BX]]. After entering into a joint-venture with Volvo in 1985 the company began production of the [[Volvo 780]], a two-door saloon entirely created by Nuccio Bertone, from the formal design of the model to the full production cycle.

A new commercial agreement drawn up with [[General Motors Europe]] in 1986 saw production of the [[Kadett Cabrio]] handed over to Bertone. The new Pontiac Fiero GT body design was also due to this relationship with the stile Bertone department of the company.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=July 2014}}  The partnership with Opel continued with the first generation of the [[Vauxhall Astra|Vauxhall Astra Cabrio]], and with the [[Astra Coupé]] and [[AstraCabriolet]].
The end of the 1980s saw the [[Citroën XM]], and the [[Bertone Freeclimber#Bertone Freeclimber|Freeclimber]] off-roader with mechanical components by [[Daihatsu]] and [[BMW]] engines.

===1990s===
Without abandoning its commitment to exploring the new languages of car design, Bertone entered the 1990s with its focus on technological innovations.
Capturing the attention of public and experts alike at the 1992 Turin Motor Show was the aggressively futuristic [[Blitz barchetta]], a showcar which featured an electric engine and avant-garde construction solutions. The barchetta had a tubular chassis in special steel integrated with sandwich-structuredfiber glass panels, bodywork in composite materials and carbon interiors.

In 1993 the [[Opel Astra|Opel Astra Cabrio]] and the [[Fiat Punto Cabrio]] began production, with the entire production cycle for both cars at the Grugliasco factory; assembly of the bodywork, mechanical components integration, paintwork and fittings. A complete production cycle, ending with the final testing process, which is carried out according to the procedures and standards of the commissioning companies.

In 1994, continuing the company's research into low environmental-impact vehicles, Bertone presented the [[Zero Emission Record]] (ZER), a futuristic reinterpretation of the Abarth 750 Record. Expressly conceived and created to yield the highest performance levels in the electric car sector, the ZER (which has a Cx of 0.11) set the world one-hour-long distance record (199.822&amp;nbsp;km), and broke the 300&amp;nbsp;km/h barrier, setting the new world speed record for electric cars (with a top speed of 303.977&amp;nbsp;km/h).

In 1994, Gruppo Bertone became the first manufacturer in Italy to be awarded the [[ISO 9001 quality certification]]. Meanwhile, Nuccio Bertone did not turn his back on a past dedicated to bodywork and continued to design working prototypes; the [[Karisma]] in 1994, a four-seater berlinetta on a Porsche base, the Kayak in 1995, a coupé on a Lancia K base, the [[Slalom 'coupé de chasse]]' on an Opel Astra Coupe/Cabrio base, and the [[Enduro 4x4|Fiat Enduro 4x4]], a SUV based on a [[Fiat Brava]] floorpan.

===Bertone after Bertone===
On 26 February 1997, on the evening of the Geneva Motor Show, Nuccio Bertone died, "one of the greatest coachbuilders of the century, and international Maestro of Italian style" in the words of [[Fulvio Cinti]], motoring journalist and car historian. His widow, Lilli Bertone, took over management of the company.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===2000s=== 
While in the past car manufacturers had paid more attention to the engineering of a car than to its design, by the 1990s they had realized the importance of design to their brand's success and were increasingly bringing more of the creative work in house.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} This even applied to supercar manufacturers, who in the past had been a major client of the Italian design consultancies (carrozzeria). While Chinese and Indian manufacturers provided some work, this too decreased as once they gained confidence they too established their own in-house design studios. Despite these difficulties Bertone obtained some specialist manufacturing projects and continued with design consulting.

However, by 2009, the worsening financial situation caused Bertone to sell its Grugliasco plant, along with its manufacturing activities to FIAT.&lt;ref name=gibbs&gt;{{cite web|date=18 March 2014|last=Gibbs|first=Nick|title=Bertone enters bankruptcy proceedings|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/10705046/Bertone-enters-bankruptcy-proceedings.html|work=www.telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited 2014|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertone underwent a major restructuring and became a fully integrated service company in the automotive, transportation and industrial design sectors. By then, Bertone workforce had reduced to roughly 300, mainly engineers and designers, with a capacity of 300,000 engineering hours per year, which allowed it to manage up to four prototype projects per year, from first style drafts to the effective manufacturing of the prototype.

===2010s===

The financial turmoil however continued, leading it to sell off some of its treasured collection of concept cars in 2011.&lt;ref name=gibbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=sutcliffe&gt;{{cite web|last=Sutcliffe|first=Steve|title=Bertone: end of an era - picture special|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motoring/bertone-end-era-picture-special|work=www.autocar.co.uk|publisher=Haymarket Consumer Media|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jay|first=Ramey|title=Italian design house Bertone nearing bankruptcy|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20140317/carnews/140319810|work=www.autoweek.com|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bertone enters bankruptcy proceedings===
After having ceased trading because of financial difficulties, Bertone on 18 March 2014&lt;ref name=sutcliffe/&gt; confirmed that it will be declared bankrupt if a suitable buyer was not found by the end of April.&lt;ref name=gibbs/&gt;

===Creation of Bertone Design===
In May 2013 the license rights of the brand were granted by Bertone Cento to Bertone Design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stevens|first=Mike|title= Bertone Bankrupt: Search For Saviour Ends, But Name To Live On In Milan|url=http://www.themotorreport.com.au/59357/bertone-bankrupt-search-for-saviour-ends-but-name-to-live-on-in-milan|work=www.themotorreport.com.au|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a company established in Milan, led by architect Aldo Cingolani&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Bertone Design|url=http://milanice.com/bertone-design/8030/|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of a reviving the brand in various fields, such as architecture, industrial design and fashion. Bertone Design also operates in the railway sector.

''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=post97&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1997/03/09/women-of-historic-note/259adb97-9eaf-41ef-94e7-d92b7ca54f04/ "Women of Historic Note"]. ''Washington Post'', By Gayle Worl March 9, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered to be the founder of scientific [[natural history]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jöckle|first=Clemens|title=Encyclopedia of Saints|year=2003|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildegard was elected ''[[:wiktionary:magistra|magistra]]'' by her fellow nuns in 1136; she founded the monasteries of [[Rupertsberg]] in 1150 and [[Eibingen Abbey|Eibingen]] in 1165. One of her works as a composer, the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'', is an early example of liturgical drama and arguably the oldest surviving [[morality play]].&lt;ref&gt;Some writers have speculated a distant origin for opera in this piece, though without any evidence. See: [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary]; alt Opera, see Florentine Camerata in the province of Milan, Italy. [http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/opera.html] and [http://www.kitbraz.com/gen/rev/1998nytmirapaulHild.html]&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote theological, botanical, and medicinal texts, as well as letters, [[liturgical]] songs,&lt;ref name=post97 /&gt; and poems, while supervising miniature [[illumination (manuscript)|illuminations]] in the Rupertsberg manuscript of her first work, ''[[Scivias]]''.&lt;ref name="Rupertsberg MS images"&gt;Caviness, Madeline. "Artist: 'To See, Hear, and Know All at Once'", in ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed. Barbara Newman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 110–24; Nathaniel M. Campbell, "''Imago expandit splendorem suum:'' Hildegard of Bingen's Visio-Theological Designs in the Rupertsberg Scivias Manuscript," ''Eikón / Imago'' 4 (2013, Vol. 2, No. 2), pp. 1–68, accessible online [http://capire.es/eikonimago/index.php/eikonimago/article/view/88/pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt; She is also noted for the invention of a [[constructed language]] known as ''[[Lingua Ignota]]''.

Although the history of her formal consideration is complicated, she has been recognized as a saint by branches of the Roman Catholic Church for centuries. On 7 October 2012, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] named her a [[Doctor of the Church]].&lt;!-- no need for citations here, save that for the detail section below --&gt;

==Biography==

Hildegard was born around the year 1098, although the exact date is uncertain. Her parents were Mechtild of Merxheim-Nahet and Hildebert of Bermersheim, a family of the free lower nobility in the service of the Count Meginhard of [[County of Sponheim|Sponheim]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), 40; Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Sickly from birth, Hildegard is traditionally considered their youngest and tenth child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gies |first1=Frances |last2=Gies |first2=Joseph |title=Women in the Middle Ages |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-06-464037-4 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are records of only seven older siblings.&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 278–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Bowie, Oliver Davies. ''Hildegard of Bingen: An Anthology''. SPCK 1990. Some sources note younger siblings, specifically Bruno.&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''Vita'', Hildegard states that from a very young age she had experienced [[vision (religion)|visions]].&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 2002"&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p. 138; Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monastic life===
Perhaps because of Hildegard's visions, or as a method of political positioning (or both), Hildegard's parents offered her as an [[oblate]] to the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery at the [[Disibodenberg]], which had been recently reformed in the [[Palatinate Forest]]. The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her ''[[Hagiography|Vita]]'' says she was professed with an older woman, [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], the daughter of Count Stephan II of Sponheim, at the age of eight.&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jutta's date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 52–55, 69; and John Van Engen, "Abbess: 'Mother and Teacher', in Barbara Newman, ed., ''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 30–51, at pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vows were received by Bishop Otto Bamberg on All Saints' Day, 1112. Some scholars speculate that Hildegard was placed in the care of Jutta at the age of eight, and the two women were then enclosed together six years later.&lt;ref&gt;Michael McGrade, "Hildegard von Bingen", in ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart: allgemeine Enzyklopaldie der Musik,'' 2nd edition, T.2, Vol. 8, ed. Ludwig Fischer (Kassel and New York: Bahrenreiter, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, Hildegard and Jutta were enclosed together at the Disibodenberg, and formed the core of a growing community of women attached to the male monastery. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The written record of the ''Life of Jutta'' indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick.&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 70-73; Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed [[psaltery]]. [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]], a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.&lt;ref&gt;Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Jutta's death in 1136, Hildegard was unanimously elected as ''magistra'' of the community by her fellow nuns.&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be [[Prioress]], which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence for herself and her nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to [[Rupertsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of [[Archbishop Henry I of Mainz]]. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to a new location in Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery.&lt;ref&gt;McGrade, "Hildegard", ''MGG.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at [[Eibingen Abbey|Eibingen]].

Before Hildegard's death, a problem arose with the clergy of Mainz. A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground. Hildegard did not accept this idea, replying that it was a sin and that the man had been reconciled to the church at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098–1179: a visionary life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visions===

Hildegard said that she first saw "The Shade of the Living Light" at the age of three, and by the age of five she began to understand that she was experiencing visions.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Evelyn. ''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; She used the term 'visio' (the Latin for "vision") to describe this feature of her experience, and recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others. Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.&lt;ref&gt;Schipperges, Heinrich. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Healing and the Nature of the Cosmos'' (New Jersey: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1997), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to "write down that which you see and hear."&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill. The illustrations recorded in the book of Scivias were visions that Hildegard experienced, causing her great suffering and tribulations.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Evelyn. ''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In her first theological text, ''[[Scivias]]'' ("Know the Ways"), Hildegard describes her struggle within:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But I, though I saw and heard these things, refused to write for a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the diversity of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [the nun Richardis von Stade] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close – though just barely – in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!'&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard von Bingen, ''Scivias,'' trans. by Columba Hart and Jane Bishop with an Introduction by Barbara J.

It was between November 1147 and February 1148 at the synod in Trier that [[Pope Eugene III|Pope Eugenius]] heard about Hildegard's writings. It was from this that she received Papal approval to document her visions as revelations from the Holy Spirit giving her instant credence.

On 17 September 1179, when Hildegard died, her sisters claimed they saw two streams of light appear in the skies and cross over the room where she was dying.&lt;ref name="Madigan, Shawn 1998"/&gt;

At the end of her life, and probably under her initial guidance, all of her works were edited and gathered into the single [http://www.hs-rm.de/hlb/suchen-finden/sondersammlungen/handschriften-inkunabeln-alte-drucke/der-riesencodex-hildegard-von-bingen/index.html Riesenkodex manuscript].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Derolez, "The Manuscript Transmission of Hildegard of Bingen's Writings," in ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Context of her Thought and Art'', ed.

===Visionary theology===
Hildegard's most significant works were her three volumes of visionary theology: ''[[Scivias]]'' ("Know the Ways", composed 1142–1151), ''Liber Vitae Meritorum'' ("Book of Life's Merits" or "Book of the Rewards of Life", composed 1158–1163); and ''Liber Divinorum Operum'' ("Book of Divine Works", also known as ''De operatione Dei'', "On God's Activity", composed 1163/4–1172 or 1174). In these volumes, the last of which was completed when she was well into her seventies, Hildegard first describes each vision, whose details are often strange and enigmatic, and then interprets their theological contents in the words of the "voice of the Living Light."

====''Scivias''====
[[File:Meister des Hildegardis-Codex 004.jpg|thumb|left|The Church, the Bride of Christ and Mother of the Faithful in Baptism. Illustration to ''Scivias'' II.3, fol. 51r from the 20th-century facsimile of the Rupertsberg manuscript, c. 1165–1180]]
The composition of the first work, ''[[Scivias]]'', was triggered by the insistence of her visionary experiences in about 1142, when she was already forty-three years old. Perceiving a divine command to "write down what you see and hear",&lt;ref&gt;"Protestificatio" ("Declaration") to Hildegard of Bingen, ''Scivias'', trans. Mother Columba Hart and Jane Bishop (Paulist Press, 1990), pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard began to record her visionary experiences. ''[[Scivias]]'' is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as the shape of an "egg"), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the [[Trinity]], the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]], the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the [[Eucharist]], and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard's musical compositions.

Portions of the uncompleted work were read aloud to [[Pope Eugenius III]] at the Synod of Trier in 1148, after which he sent Hildegard a letter with his blessing.&lt;ref&gt;Letter 4 in ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen'', trans. Joseph L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman (Oxford University Press, 1994), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; This blessing was later construed as papal approval for all of Hildegard's wide-ranging theological activities.&lt;ref&gt;Van Engen, John. "Letters and the Public Persona of Hildegard," in ''Hildegard von Bingen in ihrem historischen Umfeld'', ed. Alfred Haverkamp (Mainz: Trierer Historische Forschungen, 2000), pp. 375–418; and Kathryn Kerby-Fulton, "Hildegard of Bingen", in ''Medieval Holy Women in the Christian Tradition'', c. 1100–c. 1500, ed. Alastair Minnis and Rosalynn Voaden (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), pp. 343–69, at pp. 350–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of her life, Hildegard commissioned a richly decorated manuscript of ''[[Scivias]]'' (the Rupertsberg Codex); although the original has been lost since its evacuation to Dresden for safekeeping in 1945, its images are preserved in a hand-painted facsimile from the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Rupertsberg MS images" /&gt;

====''Liber Vitae Meritorum''====
In her second volume of visionary theology, composed between 1158 and 1163, after she had moved her community of nuns into independence at the Rupertsberg in Bingen, Hildegard tackled the moral life in the form of dramatic confrontations between the virtues and the vices. She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, ''Ordo Virtutum'', and the "Book of the Rewards of Life" takes up that play's characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches. Standing in our defense, however, are the sober voices of the Virtues, powerfully confronting every vicious deception.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard of Bingen. ''The Book of the Rewards of Life''. Trans. Bruce W. Hozeski (Oxford University Press), 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the work's innovations is one of the earliest descriptions of purgatory as the place where each soul would have to work off its debts after death before entering heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Barbara. "Hildegard of Bingen and the 'Birth of Purgatory'," ''Mystics Quarterly'' 19 (1993): 90–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard's descriptions of the possible punishments there are often gruesome and grotesque, which emphasize the work's moral and pastoral purpose as a practical guide to the life of true penance and proper virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Barbara. "'Sibyl of the Rhine': Hildegard's Life and Times," in ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed. Barbara Newman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 1–29, at pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Liber Divinorum Operum''====
&lt;!--[[Liber Divinorum Operum]] redirects here--&gt;
[[File:Hildegard von Bingen Liber Divinorum Operum.jpg|thumb|right|"Universal Man" illumination from Hildegard's ''Liber Divinorum Operum'', I.2. Lucca, MS 1942, early 13th-century copy.]]
Hildegard's last and grandest visionary work had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received "an extraordinary mystical vision" in which was revealed the "sprinkling drops of sweet rain" that [[John the Evangelist]] experienced when he wrote, "In the beginning was the Word..." (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the "Work of God", of which humankind is the pinnacle. The ''Book of Divine Works'', therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;"The Life of Hildegard", II.16, in ''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), 179; Dronke, Peter. ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten visions of this work's three parts are cosmic in scale, to illustrate various ways of understanding the relationship between God and his creation. Often, that relationship is established by grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love (''Caritas'') or Wisdom (''Sapientia''). The first vision opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize God's dynamic activity within the scope of his work within the history of salvation. The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the famous image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe, and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm. This culminates in the final chapter of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard's commentary on the Prologue to John's Gospel (John 1:1-14), a direct rumination on the meaning of "In the beginning was the Word..." The single vision that comprises the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended commentary on the seven days of the creation of the world told in Genesis 1-2:3. This commentary interprets each day of creation in three ways: literal or cosmological; allegorical or ecclesiological (i.e. related to the Church's history); and moral or tropological (i.e. related to the soul's growth in virtue). Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of ''Scivias'' to describe the course of salvation history. The final vision (3.5) contains Hildegard's longest and most detailed prophetic program of the life of the Church from her own days of "womanish weakness" through to the coming and ultimate downfall of the Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;St. Hildegard of Bingen, [https://www.hfsbooks.com/catalog/title/?isbn=9780813231297 ''The Book of Divine Works''], trans.

===Music===
Attention in recent decades to women of the medieval [[Catholic Church|Church]] has led to a great deal of popular interest in Hildegard's music. In addition to the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]],'' sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard of Bingen. ''Symphonia'', ed. Barbara Newman (2nd Ed.; Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers.

{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|format=[[Ogg]]}}
One of her better known works, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (''Play of the Virtues''), is a [[morality play]]. It is uncertain when some of Hildegard's compositions were composed, though the ''Ordo Virtutum'' is thought to have been composed as early as 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098–1179: A Visionary Life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The morality play consists of [[monophony|monophonic]] melodies for the Anima (human soul) and 16 [[Virtues]]. There is also one speaking part for the Devil. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard's nuns would have played the parts of Anima and the Virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Ekdahl Davidson. "Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen's Ordo Virtutum." ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies'', (Kalamazoo, MI: Western Michigan University, 1992), pp. 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ''Ordo Virtutum'', Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum''. The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Her music is described as [[monophony|monophonic]], that is, consisting of exactly one melodic line.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Barbara. ''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Its style is characterized by soaring melodies that can push the boundaries of the more staid ranges of traditional Gregorian chant. Though Hildegard's music is often thought to stand outside the normal practices of monophonic monastic chant,&lt;ref name="holsinger"/&gt; current researchers are also exploring ways in which it may be viewed in comparison with her contemporaries, such as [[Hermannus Contractus]].&lt;ref&gt;See Jennifer Bain, "Hildegard, Hermannus and Late Chant Style," ''Journal of Music Theory'', 2008, vol. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature of Hildegard's music that both reflects twelfth-century evolutions of chant and pushes those evolutions further is that it is highly [[melismatic]], often with recurrent melodic units. Scholars such as [[Margot Fassler]], Marianne Richert Pfau, and Beverly Lomer also note the intimate relationship between music and text in Hildegard's compositions, whose rhetorical features are often more distinct than is common in twelfth-century chant.&lt;ref&gt;Margot Fassler. "Composer and Dramatist: 'Melodious Singing and the Freshness of Remorse,'" ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed. Barbara Newman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), 149–75; Marianna Richert-Pfau, "Mode and Melody Types in Hildegard von Bingen's Symphonia," ''Sonus'' 11 (1990): 53–71; Beverly Lomer, ''Music, Rhetoric and the Sacred Feminine'' (Saarbrücken, Germany: Verlag Dr. Müller, 2009) and eadem, "Hildegard of Bingen: Music, Rhetoric and the Divine Feminine," in ''Journal of the International Alliance of Women and Music'', vol. 18, No. 2, 2012. See also Lomer's discussion of "The Theory and Rhetoric of Hildegard's Music," in the International Society for Hildegard von Bingen Studies' [http://www.hildegard-society.org/p/music.html#Theory_and_Rhetoric online edition of Hildegard's ''Symphonia''].&lt;/ref&gt; As with all medieval chant notation, Hildegard's music lacks any indication of tempo or rhythm; the surviving manuscripts employ late German style notation, which uses very ornamental [[neumes]].&lt;ref&gt;See the facsimile of her music now freely available on [http://imslp.org/wiki/Symphonia_et_Ordo_virtutum_%28Hildegard%29 IMSLP].&lt;/ref&gt; The reverence for the Virgin Mary reflected in music shows how deeply influenced and inspired Hildegard of Bingen and her community were by the Virgin Mary and the saints.&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, Carmen Acevedo. ''Hildegard of Bingen: A Spiritual Reader'' (Massachusetts: Paraclete Press, 2007), p. 27; see also Beverly Lomer, "Hildegard of Bingen: Music, Rhetoric and the Divine Feminine," in ''Journal of the International Alliance of Women and Music'', vol. 18, No. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of [[viriditas]] or "greenness" is an earthly expression of the heavenly in an integrity that overcomes dualisms. This greenness or power of life appears frequently in Hildegard's works.&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, Shawn. ''Mystics, Visionaries and Prophets: A Historical Anthology of Women's Spiritual Writings'' (Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, 1998), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Hildegard's self-professed view that her compositions have as object the praise of God, one scholar has asserted that Hildegard made a close association between music and the female body in her musical compositions.&lt;ref name="holsinger"&gt;Holsinger, Bruce. "The Flesh of the Voice: Embodiment and the Homoerotics of Devotion in the Music of Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179),"Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 19 (Autumn, 1993): pp. 92–125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the poetry and music of Hildegard's Symphonia would therefore be concerned with the anatomy of female desire thus described as Sapphonic, or pertaining to [[Sappho]], connecting her to a history of female rhetoricians.&lt;ref&gt;Holsinger, Bruce W. Music, Body, and Desire in Medieval Culture. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. pp. 123–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific and medicinal writings===
[[File:Hildegard of bingen and nuns.jpg|thumb|Hildegard of Bingen and her nuns]]
Hildegard's medicinal and scientific writings, though thematically complementary to her ideas about nature expressed in her visionary works, are different in focus and scope. Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority. Rather, they spring from her experience helping in and then leading the monastery's herbal garden and infirmary, as well as the theoretical information she likely gained through her wide-ranging reading in the monastery's library.&lt;ref name=Glaze&gt;Florence Eliza Glaze, "Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'" in ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed. Barbara Newman (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 125–48.&lt;/ref&gt; As she gained practical skills in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, she combined physical treatment of physical diseases with holistic methods centered on "spiritual healing."&lt;ref name=Sweet&gt;Sweet, V. (1999). "Hildegard of Bingen and the greening of medieval medicine." ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'', 73(3), pp. 381–403. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/bhm.1999.0140&lt;/ref&gt; She became well known for her healing powers involving practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; She combined these elements with a theological notion ultimately derived from Genesis: all things put on earth are for the use of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Hozeski, Bruce W. ''Hildegard's Healing Plants: From Her Medieval Classic Physica'' (Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 2001), pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts.&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt;

Hildegard catalogued both her theory and practice in two works. The first, ''Physica,'' contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals. The second, ''Causae et Curae'', is an exploration of the human body, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases.&lt;ref name="medical"&gt;Hildegard von Bingen, ''Causae et Curae (Holistic Healing)'', trans. by Manfred Pawlik and Patrick Madigan, ed. by Mary Palmquist and John Kulas (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, Inc., 1994); Hildegard von Bingen, ''Physica'', trans. Priscilla Throop (Rochester, Vermont: Healing Arts Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments. She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts.&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt; Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery. These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners (mainly women) rarely wrote in Latin. Her writings were commentated on by [[Mélanie Lipinska]], a Polish scientist&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Old Time Makers of Medicine|last=Walsh|first=James|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=1911|isbn=|location=New York|pages=194–201|via=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its wealth of practical evidence, ''Causae et Curae'' is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach.&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the "green" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. ''Viriditas'', or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person.&lt;ref name="Sweet" /&gt; Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt;

Thus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of ''Causae et Curae'' "explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology."&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; In this section, she give specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ of body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like "the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp"). She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy. In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient's blood, pulse, urine and stool.&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt; Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception).&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt; Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;"Hildegard of Bingen." Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: "the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds."&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; Although she inherited the basic framework of [[humorism|humoral theory]] from ancient medicine, Hildegard's conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to "superior" and "inferior" elements—blood and phlegm corresponding to the "celestial" elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the "terrestrial" elements of water and earth. Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors. This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind.&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; As she writes in ''Causae et Curae'' c. 42:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses. This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them. For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the ''flegmata'' within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would have been whole and without dark humor [''livor'']. However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures. From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten. And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]. These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the ''flegmata'' arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body. All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Glaze, "Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'" p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Lingua Ignota'' and invented alphabet===
[[File:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|Alphabet by Hildegard von Bingen, Litterae ignotae, which she used for her language [[Lingua Ignota]]]]

Hildegard also invented an [[constructed script|alternative alphabet]]. The text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard's use of this form of modified medieval [[Latin]], encompassing many invented, conflated and abridged words.&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 2002"/&gt; Because of her inventions of words for her lyrics and use of a constructed script, many [[conlang]]ers look upon her as a medieval precursor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkuK53bU4_UC ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language: An Edition, Translation, and Discussion''], ed. Sarah Higley (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars believe that Hildegard used her ''[[Lingua Ignota]]'' to increase solidarity among her nuns.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara J. Newman, "Introduction" to Hildegard, ''Scivias,'' p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

===During her lifetime===
Maddocks claims that it is likely Hildegard learned simple Latin and the tenets of the Christian faith but was not instructed in the Seven [[Liberal Arts]], which formed the basis of all education for the learned classes in the Middle Ages: the ''[[Trivium (education)|Trivium]]'' of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric plus the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age. New York: Doubleday, 2001. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence she kept with the outside world, both spiritual and social, transcended the cloister as a space of spiritual confinement and served to document Hildegard's grand style and strict formatting of medieval letter writing.&lt;ref name="Dietrich, Julia 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For cloister as confinement see [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04060a.htm "Female" section of "Cloister"] in ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributing to Christian European rhetorical traditions, Hildegard "authorized herself as a theologian" through alternative rhetorical arts.&lt;ref name="Dietrich, Julia 1997"&gt;Dietrich, Julia. "The Visionary Rhetoric of Hildegard of Bingen." ''Listening to their Voices: The Rhetorical Activities of Historic Women'', Molly Meijer Wertheimer, ed. (University of South Carolina Press, 1997), pp. 202–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard was creative in her interpretation of theology. She believed that her monastery should exclude novices who were not from the nobility because she did not want her community to be divided on the basis of social status.&lt;ref&gt;See Hildegard's correspondence with Tengswich of Andernach, in Letters 52 and 52r, in ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen, Vol. 1'', trans.Baird and Ehrman (Oxford University Press, 1994), 127–30; and discussion in Alfred Haverkamp, "Tenxwind von Andernach und Hildegard von Bingen: Zwei »Weltanschauungen« in der Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts," in ''Institutionen, Kultur und Gesellschaft im Mittelalter: Feschrift für Josef Fleckenstein'', ed. Lutz Fenske, Werner Rösener, and Thomas Zotz (Jan Thorbecke Verlag: Sigmaringen, 1984), 515–48; and Peter Dronke, ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 165–67.&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that "woman may be made from man, but no man can be made without a woman."&lt;ref name="Madigan, Shawn 1998"&gt;Madigan, Shawn. Mystics, Visionaries and Prophets: A Historical Anthology of Women's Spiritual Writings (Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, 1998), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hildegard map.jpg|thumb|200px|Hildegard's preaching tours]]
Because of church limitation on public, discursive rhetoric, the medieval rhetorical arts included preaching, letter writing, poetry, and the encyclopedic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[James A. Herrick|Herrick, James A.]], ''The History of Rhetoric: An Introduction'', 4th ed. (Boston: Allyn Bacon, 2005), pp. ??.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard's participation in these arts speaks to her significance as a female rhetorician, transcending bans on women's social participation and interpretation of scripture. The acceptance of public preaching by a woman, even a well-connected abbess and acknowledged prophet, does not fit the stereotype of this time. Her preaching was not limited to the monasteries; she preached publicly in 1160 in Germany. (New York: Routledge, 2001, 9). She conducted four preaching tours throughout Germany, speaking to both clergy and laity in chapter houses and in public, mainly denouncing clerical corruption and calling for reform.&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Visionary Women. Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2002. pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many abbots and abbesses asked her for prayers and opinions on various matters.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Judith M 2001"/&gt; She traveled widely during her four preaching tours.&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; She had several devoted followers, including Guibert of Gembloux, who wrote to her frequently and became her secretary after Volmar's death in 1173. Hildegard also influenced several monastic women, exchanging letters with [[Elizabeth of Schönau|Elisabeth of Schönau]], a nearby visionary.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard von Bingen, ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen'', trans. by Joseph L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman (NY: Oxford University Press, 1994/1998), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildegard corresponded with popes such as [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]] and [[Anastasius IV]], statesmen such as [[Abbot Suger]], German emperors such as [[Frederick I Barbarossa]], and other notable figures such as Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who advanced her work, at the behest of her abbot, Kuno, at the [[Synod of Trier]] in 1147 and 1148. Hildegard of Bingen's correspondence is an important component of her literary output.&lt;ref&gt;Schipperges, Heinrich. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Healing and the Nature of the Cosmos'' (New Jersey: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1997), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beatification, canonization and recognition as a Doctor of the Church===
Hildegard was one of the first persons for whom the Roman [[canonization]] process was officially applied, but the process took so long that four attempts at canonization were not completed and she remained at the level of her [[beatification]]. Her name was nonetheless taken up in the [[Roman Martyrology]] at the end of the 16th century. Her [[feast day]] is 17 September. Numerous popes have referred to Hildegard as a saint, including [[Pope John Paul II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1979/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19790908_800-ildegarda_it.html |title=Lettera per l'800° anniversario della morte di Santa Ildegarda |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2006/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060302_roman-clergy.html |title=Meeting with the members of the Roman Clergy |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2012, Pope Benedict XVI extended the liturgical cult of St. Hildegard to the entire Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/news/2012/05/pope-recognizes-hildegard-saint-advances-causes-us-bishop-nun|title=News - USCatholic.org|website=www.uscatholic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a process known as "equivalent canonization,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=14287|title=Vatican newspaper explains 'equivalent canonization' of St. Hildegard of Bingen : News Headlines|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus laying the groundwork for naming her a [[Doctor of the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/otc.cfm?id=1015|title=New Doctors of the Church: St. Hildegard, St. John of Avila|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2012, the [[feast of the Holy Rosary]], the pope named her a [[Doctor of the Church]], the fourth woman of 35 saints given that title by the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope Benedict creates two new doctors of the church|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-benedict-creates-two-new-doctors-of-the-church/|newspaper=Catholic News Agency|date=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called her "perennially relevant" and "an authentic teacher of theology and a profound scholar of natural science and music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope Benedict's Regina Caeli Address for the Soleminity of Pentecost, 27 May 2012|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/angelus/2012/documents/hf_ben-xvi_reg_20120527_pentecoste.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildegard of Bingen also appears in the [[calendar of saints]] of various [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] churches, such as that of the [[Church of England]], in which she is commemorated on 17 September.

Hildegard's parish and pilgrimage church in Eibingen near [[Rüdesheim am Rhein|Rüdesheim]] houses her [[relic]]s.

===Modern interest===
[[File:Hildegard VS.JPG|thumb|left|150px|alt=German 10 DM commemorative coin issued by the Federal Republic of Germany (1998): Hildegard of Bingen writing the book (Liber), 'Sci vias Domini', inspired by the hand of the Lord|German 10 DM commemorative coin issued by the Federal Republic of Germany (1998) designed by [[Carl Vezerfi-Clemm]] on the 900th anniversary of Hildegard of Bingen's birth]]

In recent years, Hildegard has become of particular interest to [[feminist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Marilyn R. Mumford, "A Feminist Prolegomenon for the Study of Hildegard of Bingen," in ''Gender, Culture, and the Arts: Women, Culture, and Society'', eds. R. Dotterer and S. Bowers (Selinsgrove: Susquehanna University Press, 1993), pp. 44–53.&lt;/ref&gt; They note her reference to herself as a member of the weaker sex and her rather constant belittling of women. Hildegard frequently referred to herself as an unlearned woman, completely incapable of Biblical exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Visionary Women (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a statement on her part, however, worked to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Newman, "Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation," ''Church History'' 54 (1985): pp. 163–75; Barbara Newman, ''Sister of Wisdom: St. Hildegard's Theology of the Feminine'', (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard used her voice to amplify the Church's condemnation of institutional corruption, in particular [[simony]].

Hildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary [[New Age movement]], mostly because of her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic. Though her medical writings were long neglected, and then studied without reference to their context,&lt;ref name=Sweet4&gt;Sweet, V. (1999). "Hildegard of Bingen and the greening of medieval medicine." ''Bulletin of the history of Medicine'', 73(3), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; she was the inspiration for Dr. Gottfried Hertzka's "Hildegard-Medicine", and is the namesake for June Boyce-Tillman's Hildegard Network, a healing center that focuses on a holistic approach to wellness and brings together people interested in exploring the links between spirituality, the arts, and healing.&lt;ref&gt;June Boyce-Tillman, "Hildegard of Bingen at 900: The Eye of a Woman," ''The Musical Times'' 139, no. 1865 (Winter, 1998): p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Her reputation as a medicinal writer and healer was also used by early feminists to argue for women's rights to attend medical schools.&lt;ref name=Sweet4/&gt; Hildegard's reincarnation has been debated since 1924 when Austrian mystic [[Rudolf Steiner]] lectured that a nun of her description was the past life of Russian poet philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]],&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Rudolf. Karmic Relationships, Vol. 4 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophianic]] visions are often compared to Hildegard's.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. The Sophia Teachings: The Emergence of the Divine Feminine in Our Time (Lindisfarne Books, 2007), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Sophiologist Robert Powell writes that hermetic astrology proves the match,&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. Hermetic Astrology (Sophia Foundation Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; while mystical communities in Hildegard's lineage include that of artist Carl Schroeder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.returnofhildegard.com |title=Return of Hildegard |publisher=Return of Hildegard |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as studied by Columbia sociologist Courtney Bender&lt;ref&gt;Bender, Courtney. The New Metaphysicals: Spirituality and the American Religious Imagination (University Of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and supported by reincarnation researchers Walter Semkiw and Kevin Ryerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iisis.net/index.php?page=vladimir-soloviev-carl-schroeder&amp;hl=en_US |title=The Reincarnation Case of Carl Schroeder |publisher=Water Semkiw IISIS |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ibero-American Exposition of 1929''' (Spanish: '''''Exposición iberoamericana de 1929''''') was a [[world's fair]] held in [[Seville]], [[Spain]], from 9 May 1929 until 21 June 1930. Countries in attendance of the exposition included: Portugal, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Chile, the Republic of Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. Each [[Spanish region]] and each of the [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] of [[Andalusia]] were also represented. Spain’s Dictator General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] gave the opening address. Primo de Rivera allowed the Spanish King [[Alfonso XIII]] to give the final words and officially open the exposition. The purpose of the exposition was to improve relations between Spain and the countries in attendance, all of which have historical ties with Spain through [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization]] (parts of [[Spanish America]] and the United States) or [[Iberian Union|political union]] (Portugal and its former colony Brazil). Other countries were represented at the ''[[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|International section]]'' in Barcelona.
 
The exposition was smaller in scale than the International Exposition held in Barcelona during that same year, but it was not lacking in style. The city of Seville had prepared for the Exposition over the course of 19 years.  The exhibition buildings were constructed in [[María Luisa Park]] along the [[Guadalquivir River]]. A majority of the buildings were built to remain permanent after the closing of the exposition.  Many of the foreign buildings, including the United States exhibition building, were to be used as consulates after the closing of the exhibits. By the opening of the exposition all of the buildings were complete, although many were no longer new. Not long before the opening of the Exposition, the Spanish government also began a modernization of the city in order to prepare for the expected crowds by erecting new hotels and widening the medieval streets to allow for the movement of automobiles.

== Spanish pavilions and exhibits ==

[[File:Estatua Aníbal González 2.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Aníbal González]]
Spain spent a large amount of money in developing its exhibits for the fair and constructed elaborate buildings to hold them. The exhibits were designed to show the social and economic progress of Spain as well as expressing its culture. Spanish architect [[Aníbal González Álvarez-Ossorio|Aníbal González]] designed the largest and most famous of the buildings, which surrounded the [[Plaza de España (Seville)|Plaza de España]]. The largest of the exhibits housed in this building was located in the “Salón del Descubrimento de América.” The ''Salón'' contained documents, maps, and other objects related to the discovery of the [[Americas]], including a set of 120 letters and manuscript that had belonged to [[Christopher Columbus]], the last testament of [[Hernán Cortés]], and detailed dioramas of historic moments. An exact replica of Columbus's ship the "[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]," complete with a costumed crew, floated on the Guadalquivir River. The cities of Spain contributed structures designed to reflect their unique cultures to be placed in the "Pabellones de las regiones españolas" ("Pavilions of the Spanish regions").  Spain’s exhibits also included a large collection of art located in the Palacio Mudéjar ("[[Mudéjar art]] palace"), Palacio Renacimiento ("[[Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance]] palace"), and the Palacio de la Casa Real ("Palace of the Royal House"). The Institute of Art from the [[University of Seville]] was moved to the Palacio Mudéjar for the duration of the exposition on the permission gained from the exposition committee by [[Count Columbi]]. The committee also set aside funds from their budget to purchase materials for the Institute.

== United States Exhibits ==
[[File:Pabellon de estados unidos 2.JPG|thumb|United States Pavilion (2013)]]
The United States' contribution to the exposition consisted of three buildings and marked the end to a several year period in which the United States did not construct buildings for foreign expositions. The main building was to serve as the U.S. consulate office after the closing of the Ibero-American exposition, and housed a menagerie of electrical appliances including oil furnaces, electric refrigerators, airplane models, and miniature wind tunnels. The other two structures housed a movie theatre and government exhibits, including contributions from the Departments of Agriculture, Treasury, and Labor, the Commission of Fine Arts, the Navy, and the Library of Congress.

== Ibero-American Exhibits ==
Of the Ibero-American nations in attendance of the exposition, 10 constructed pavilions to display their exhibits. Other nations, including Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador displayed their native products in the "Galerías comerciales americanas" ("Commercial galleries of the Americas").

[[File:Pabellón de Perú.jpg|thumb|Peruvian pavilion (2009)]]
The largest of the ten pavilions was the '''Peruvian pavilion''', which was designed by the architect Don [[Manuel Piqueras Cotolí]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Piqueras Cotolí (1885-1937): Arquitecto, escultor y urbanista entre España y el Perú. Luis Eduardo Wuffarden, Editor. Museo de Arte de Lima, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The pavilion contained a large archeology collection consisting of three halls filled with pre-Columbian era artifacts, which were to be kept on permanent display. The pavilion also contained an agricultural exhibit filled with stuffed [[vicuña]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[llama]]s, and [[guanaco]]s.  The exhibit was complemented by a pack of live llamas grazing on the pavilion grounds.

The '''Republic of Colombia''' constructed a pavilion designed by Seville architect [[José Granados]]. The pavilion included a collection of sculpture and artwork by Colombian artist [[Rómulo Rozo]], and of Colombian emeralds, and a coffee café that demonstrated all of the steps in coffee cultivation.

The '''Brazilian pavilion''' also contained a coffee cultivation exhibit complete with panoramas and models illustrating the different phases of cultivation. Architect [[Pedro Paulo Bernardes Bastos]] designed the pavilion, which also included a coffee bar.

'''Chilean''' architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Juan Martínez Gutiérrez|es|3=Juan Martínez Gutiérrez|lt=Juan Martínez}} designed the three-story building that served as home to Chile's exhibits. The exhibits included displays of Chilean industries, including detailed replicas of a nitrate mine and a copper plant, [[Araucanian]] arts and crafts, and galleries displaying Chilean art and history.

The [[Mexican Pavilion from Ibero-American Exposition of 1929|'''Mexican pavilion''']], designed by [[Manuel Amabilis]], included exhibits on archeology, education, and the history of Spanish accomplishments in Mexico. Students in Mexican schools prepared some of the education exhibits.

Architect [[Martin Noel]] designed '''Argentina's pavilion''', which included a movie theatre and displays focusing on Argentinean industries and products.

'''Uruguay's pavilion''' included displays of its industrial schools, including the Institute of Agronomy and an art gallery filled with paintings and bronze sculptures.

'''Cuba''' contributed demonstrations of the sugar and tobacco industries to the exposition in their pavilion.

The '''Dominican Republic''' pavilion included a reproduction of the [[Columbus's Alcázar]].

'''Guatemala''' signed up late for the exhibition and as a result rather than resembling a huge palace its pavilion looks more like a school portable building with blue and white tiles on the front. The building contained exhibits relating to the resources found in Guatemala.

'''Venezuela''' also erected a pavilion containing displays of its resources.

[[File:Plaza España 2.jpg|thumb|Ceramic provincial alcoves and benches at Plaza de España]]
Today, many of the pavilions from the exposition remain, notably the famous [[Plaza de España (Seville)|Plaza de España]], which chronicles each of the regions of Spain in ceramic provincial alcoves and benches, as well as some of the national pavilions, which have now been converted to Consulate-Generals. Many of the buildings have been converted into museums and the pavilion of Argentina is now a flamenco school. They have also been featured in a number of films, including ''[[Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'', among others.

For Sevillans, the exposition marked the acceptance by the upper class of the ''[[traje de flamenca]]'', an outfit worn by lower-class women.&lt;ref name="Abril"&gt;[http://www.altur.com/esp/psevilla/sevilla/trajegi.php3 Traje de flamenca en la feria de Abril] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501001724/http://www.altur.com/esp/psevilla/sevilla/trajegi.php3 |date=2010-05-01 }}, altur.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iconoclasm'''&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Literally, "image-breaking", from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:εἰκών|εἰκών]] and [[wikt:κλάω|κλάω]]}}. ''Iconoclasm'' may be also considered as a [[back-formation]] from iconoclast (from Greek εἰκοκλάστης). The corresponding Greek word for iconoclasm is εἰκονοκλασία – ''eikonoklasia''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the social belief in the importance of the destruction of [[icon]]s and other images or monuments, most frequently for religious or political reasons. People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called ''iconoclasts'', a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any individual who challenges "cherished beliefs or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or pernicious".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Iconoclast, 2", see also "Iconoclasm" and "Iconoclastic".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conversely, one who reveres or venerates religious images is called (by iconoclasts) an ''iconolater''; in a [[Byzantine]] context, such a person is called an ''[[iconodule]]'' or ''iconophile''.

The term does not generally encompass the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (''[[damnatio memoriae]]'').

Iconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. Within Christianity, iconoclasm has generally been motivated by those who adopt a literal interpretation of the [[Ten Commandments]], which forbid the making and worshipping of "graven images or any likeness of anything".&lt;ref&gt;"You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them&amp;nbsp;..." (Exodus 20:4–5a, ESV.)&lt;/ref&gt; The later [[Church Fathers]] identified [[Jews]], fundamental iconoclasts, with [[heresy]] and saw deviations from orthodox Christianity and opposition to the veneration of images as heresies that were essentially "Jewish in spirit".&lt;ref name=RobertM1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=Robert|title=A history of Catholic antisemitism : the dark side of the church|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-11131-8|pages=28–30|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZnFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=anti-semitism+jews+jewish+heretics+heresy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wc7_FQaTAj&amp;sig=CzUEubnkVNbs8SedIKEa3US63yg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7_YVMjmKYX5yQO_m4LIBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=heretic&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of iconoclasm among Christian branches greatly varies. [[Islam]], in general, tends to be more iconoclastic than Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hs.ias.edu/files/Crone_Articles/Crone_Islam_Judeo-Christianity_and_Byzantine_Iconoclasm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sunni Islam]] being more iconoclastic than [[Shia Islam]].

==Religious iconoclasm==

===Ancient era===
{{Main|Akhenaten}}
[[File:Amun.JPG|thumb|[[Amun]]]]

In the [[Bronze Age]], the most significant episode of iconoclasm occurred in Egypt during the [[Amarna Period]], when [[Akhenaten]], based in his new capital of [[Akhetaten]], instituted a significant shift in Egyptian artistic styles alongside a campaign of intolerance towards the traditional gods and a new emphasis on a state [[monolatry|monolatristic]] tradition [[Atenism|focused on the god]] [[Aten]], the Sun disk— many temples and monuments were destroyed as a result:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In rebellion against [[Egyptian polytheism|the old religion]] and [[High Priest of Amun|the powerful priests]] of [[Amun]], Akhenaten ordered the eradication of all of Egypt's traditional gods. He sent royal officials to chisel out and destroy every reference to Amun and the names of other deities on tombs, temple walls, and cartouches to instill in the people that the [[Aten]] was the one true god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Akhenaten.aspx |title=Akhenaten |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public references to Akhenaten were destroyed soon after his death.

Comparing the [[ancient Egypt]]ians with the [[Israelites]], Jan Assmann writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For Egypt, the greatest horror was the destruction or abduction of the cult images.  In the eyes of the [[Israelites]], the erection of images meant the destruction of [[divine presence]]; in the eyes of the Egyptians, this same effect was attained by the destruction of images.  In Egypt, iconoclasm was the most terrible religious crime; in Israel, the most terrible religious crime was [[idolatry]].  In this respect Osarseph alias Akhenaten, the iconoclast, and the [[Golden Calf]], the paragon of idolatry, correspond to each other inversely, and it is strange that [[Aaron]] could so easily avoid the role of the religious criminal.  It is more than probable that these traditions evolved under mutual influence.  In this respect, [[Moses]] and Akhenaten became, after all, closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann, ''From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change'', pg. 76, 2014, [[The American University in Cairo Press]], {{ISBN|977-416-631-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Byzantine era===
{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}
[[File:Clasm Chludov detail 9th century.jpg|thumb|[[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], [[Chludov Psalter]], 9th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320Hist&amp;Civ/slides/14islam/iconoclasm.JPG |title=Byzantine iconoclasm |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although [[Christian art|widespread use of Christian iconography]] only began as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles after the legalization of Christianity by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] (c. 312 AD), scattered expressions of opposition to the use of images were reported (e.g. Spanish [[Synod of Elvira]]). The period after the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] (527–565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.

In the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]], government-led iconoclasm began with [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo&amp;nbsp;III]], following what seems to have been a long period of rising [[Aniconism in Christianity|opposition to the use or misuse of images]].  The religious conflict created political and economic divisions in Byzantine society.  It was generally supported by the Eastern, poorer, non-Greek peoples of the Empire&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Mango, ''The Oxford History of Byzantium,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; who had to deal frequently with raids from the new Muslim Empire.  On the other hand, the wealthier Greeks of [[Constantinople]], and also the peoples of the Balkan and Italian provinces, strongly opposed iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Byzantine Empire the government had probably been adopting Christian images more frequently. One notable change came in 695, when [[Justinian II]]'s government added a full-face image of Christ on the [[obverse]] of imperial gold coins. The change caused the [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] to stop his earlier adoption of Byzantine coin types. He started a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only.&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter by the Patriarch Germanus written before 726 to two Iconoclast bishops says that "now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter" but there is little written evidence of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;C Mango, "Historical Introduction", in Bryer &amp; Herrin, eds., ''Iconoclasm'', pp. 2–3., 1977, Centre for Byzantine Studies, [[University of Birmingham]], {{ISBN|0-7044-0226-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- this should come out since there is a main article on the subject - it just needs to be introduced here
===The first iconoclastic period: 730–787===
Sometime between 726 and 730, the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] began the iconoclast campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ordered the removal of an image of [[Jesus]] prominently placed over the [[Chalke]] gate, the ceremonial entrance to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]], and its replacement with a cross.  Some of those assigned to the task were killed by a band of [[iconodules]].&lt;ref name="theoph1"&gt;see Theophanes, ''Chronographia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years conflict developed between those who wanted to use the images, claiming that they were "icons" to be "venerated", and the iconoclasts who claimed they were simply idols. [[Pope Gregory&amp;nbsp;III]] "convoked a synod in 730 and formally condemned iconoclasm as heretical and excommunicated its promoters.  The papal letter never reached Constantinople as the messengers were intercepted and arrested in Sicily by the Byzantines".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine&amp;nbsp;V]] convened the [[Council of Hieria]] in 754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinstitute.org/index.php/chm/eighth-century/icons/ |title=Issue 54: Eastern Orthodoxy &amp;#124; Christian History Magazine |publisher=Chinstitute.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 338 bishops assembled concluded, "the unlawful art of painting living creatures blasphemed the fundamental doctrine of our salvation—namely, the Incarnation of Christ, and contradicted the six holy synods&amp;nbsp;... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, etc&amp;nbsp;... let him be anathema". This Council claimed to be the legitimate "Seventh Ecumenical Council".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Council of Nicaea 787===
[[File:Seventh ecumenical council (Icon).jpg|thumb|An [[icon]] of the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] (17th century, [[Novodevichy Convent]], Moscow).]]
{{Main|Second Council of Nicaea}}
In 780, Constantine&amp;nbsp;VI ascended the throne in Constantinople, but being a minor, was managed by his mother Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]].  She decided that an ecumenical council needed to be held to address the issue of iconoclasm and directed this request to [[Pope Adrian I]] (772–795) in Rome.  He announced his agreement and called the convention on 1 August 786 in the presence of the Emperor and Empress.  The initial proceedings were interrupted by the violent entry of iconoclast soldiers faithful to the memory of the prior Emperor Constantine&amp;nbsp;V.  This caused the council to be adjourned until a reliable army could be assembled to protect any proceedings. The council was reassembled at [[Nicaea]] 24 September 787.  During those proceedings the following was adopted:

{{quote|... we declare that we defend free from any innovations all the written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions that have been entrusted to us. One of these is the production of representational art; this is quite in harmony with the history of the spread of the gospel, as it provides confirmation that the becoming man of the Word of God was real and not just imaginary, and as it brings us a similar benefit.  For, things that mutually illustrate one another undoubtedly possess one another's message.

 ... we decree with full precision and care that, like the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, the revered and holy images, whether painted or made of mosaic or of other suitable material, are to be exposed in the holy churches of God, on sacred instruments and vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by public ways; these are the images of our Lord, God and saviour, Jesus Christ, and of our Lady without blemish, the holy God-bearer, and of the revered angels and of any of the saintly holy men.  The more frequently they are seen in representational art, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these images the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred cult objects.&lt;ref name="Tanner, Norman P. p. 132–136"&gt;Tanner, Norman P., Alberigo, G., Dossetti, J. A., Joannou, P.

(Note:see&lt;ref name="Tanner, Norman P. p. 132–136"/&gt; also for the original pretranslation text of this council in Greek and Latin)

===Views in Byzantine iconoclasm===
Accounts of iconoclast arguments are largely found in iconodule writings.  To understand iconoclastic arguments, one must note the main points:
# Iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;painting or statue) that was intended to represent Jesus or one of the saints. The "Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum" ([[Synod of Hiereia]]) held in 754 declared:&lt;ref name="hieria1"/&gt; 

{{quote|Supported by [[the Holy Scriptures]] and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the [[Christian Church]] every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters&amp;nbsp;... If anyone ventures to represent the divine image (χαρακτήρ, ''charaktēr'') of the Word after the Incarnation with material colours, let him be anathema!&amp;nbsp;... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, let him be anathema!}}

#  For iconoclasts, the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype—of the same substance—which they considered impossible, seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life.  Thus for iconoclasts the only true (and permitted) "icon" of Jesus was the [[Eucharist]], which was believed to be his body and blood.
#  Any true image of Jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature (which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed) as well his human nature.  But by making an icon of Jesus, one is separating his human and divine natures, since only the human can be depicted (separating the natures was considered [[nestorianism]]), or else confusing the human and divine natures, considering them one (union of the human and divine natures was considered [[monophysitism]]).
#  Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an innovation in the Church, a Satanic misleading of Christians to return to pagan practice. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this ruin.&amp;nbsp;... But the previously mentioned demiurge of evil&amp;nbsp;... gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.&lt;ref name="hieria1"&gt;{{citation |title=Epitome of the Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 AD |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.html |publisher=[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.html Internet Medieval Sourcebook] |postscript=,}} also available from [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xvi.x.html Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition, of which there was a written record opposing religious images.
[[File:Triumph of Orthodoxy.jpg|thumb|288px|Triumph of Orthodoxy]]
The chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks Mansur ([[John of Damascus]]), who, living in Muslim territory as advisor to the Caliph of Damascus, was far enough away from the Byzantine emperor to evade retribution, and [[Theodore the Studite]], abbot of the [[Stoudios]] monastery in Constantinople.  John declared that he did not venerate matter, "but rather the creator of matter".  However he also declared, "But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace". He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the Body and Blood of Jesus.

The iconodule response to iconoclasm included:
#  Assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God had been superseded by the incarnation of Jesus, who, being the Second Person of the Trinity, is God incarnate in visible matter. Therefore, they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh. This became an attempt to shift the issue of the incarnation in their favor, whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them.
#  Further, in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons. Essentially the argument was "all religious images not of our faith are idols; all images of our faith are icons to be venerated". This was considered comparable to [[Old Testament|the Old Testament]] practice of offering burnt sacrifices only to God, and not to any other gods.
#  Moses had been instructed by God according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18–22|NKJV}} to make golden statues of [[cherubim]] angels on the lid of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:31|NKJV}} God instructed Moses to embroider the curtain which separated the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] with cherubim. Moses had also been told by God to embroider the tent walls of the Tabernacle with cherubim angels according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:1|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|36:8|NKJV}}.
#  Regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images, they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition (''parádosis'', sanctioned in Christianity as authoritative in doctrine by reference to {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:15|NKJV}}, [[Basil the Great]], etc.).
#  Arguments were drawn from the miraculous [[Acheiropoieta]], the supposed icon of the Virgin painted with her approval by St.&amp;nbsp;Luke, and other miraculous occurrences around icons, that demonstrated divine approval of Iconodule practices.
#  Iconodules further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor.

The first iconoclastic wave happened in [[Wittenberg]] in the early 1520s under reformers [[Thomas Müntzer]] and [[Andreas Karlstadt]]. It prompted [[Martin Luther]], then concealing as ''Junker Jörg'', to intervene.

In contrast to the [[Lutheran]]s who favoured sacred art in their churches and homes,&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58).

However, in most cases, civil authorities removed images in an orderly manner in the newly Reformed Protestant cities and territories of Europe. 

Significant iconoclastic riots took place in [[Basel]] (in 1529), [[Zurich]] (1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[Münster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), [[Augsburg]] (1537), [[Scotland]] (1559), [[Rouen]] (1560) and [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] and [[La Rochelle]] (1562).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekSkZXXjVWUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA148 |title=Neil Kamil, ''Fortress of the soul: violence, metaphysics, and material life'', p. 148 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voracious Idols and Violent Hands|last=Wandel|first=Lee Palmer|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1995|isbn=0-521-47222-9|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvinist iconoclasm in Europe "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (now the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of Northern France) were disrupted by widespread Calvinist iconoclasm in the summer of 1566.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' and began with the destruction of the statuary of the Monastery of [[Saint Lawrence]] in [[Steenvoorde]] after a ''"Hagenpreek"'', or field sermon, by Sebastiaan Matte. Hundreds of other attacks included the sacking of the Monastery of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] after a sermon by Jacob de Buysere. The ''Beeldenstorm'' marked the start of the [[Eighty Years' War|revolution]] against the Spanish forces and [[Roman Catholic Church|the Catholic Church]].

The iconoclastic belief caused havoc throughout [[Europe]]. In 1523, specifically due to the Swiss reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]], a vast number of his followers viewed themselves as being involved in a spiritual community that in matters of faith should obey neither the visible Church nor lay authorities. According to Peter George Wallace:

{{quote|"Zwingli's attack on images, at the first debate, triggered iconoclastic incidents in [[Zurich]] and the villages under civic jurisdiction that the reformer was unwilling to condone."  And due to this action of protest against authority, "Zwingli responded with a carefully reasoned treatise that men could not live in society without laws and constraint."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Peter George.

During the [[Reformation in England]] started during the reign of Anglican monarch [[Henry VIII]], and urged on by reformers such as [[Hugh Latimer]] and [[Thomas Cranmer]], limited official action was taken against religious images in churches in the late 1530s. Henry's young son, [[Edward VI]], came to the throne in 1547 and, under Cranmer's guidance, issued Injunctions for Religious Reforms in the same year and in 1550, an [[Act of Parliament]] "for the abolition and putting away of divers books and images".&lt;ref&gt;Heal, Felicity (2005), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtGoSCVhRFIC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=1550+statute+for+abolishing+images&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=19oOGbcpPr&amp;sig=r7TeKMsCL2HThPLGZaWl1p-pUIU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2wq0VIHpG5PA7Abw9IDIDw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1550%20statute%20for%20abolishing%20images&amp;f=false ''Reformation in Britain and Ireland''], Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-928015-5}} (pp. 263–4)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[English Civil War]], Bishop [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] of [[Norwich]] described the events of 1643 when troops and citizens, encouraged by a Parliamentary ordinance against superstition and [[idolatry]], behaved thus:

===Muslim iconoclasm===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Umayyad]] --&gt;
{{further|Aniconism in Islam}}
&lt;!-- destruction of another religion's images is not iconoclasm
[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|The taller of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction]] --&gt;
Within [[Muslim history]], the act of removing idols from the [[Ka'ba]] in Mecca is considered by all believers to be of great symbolic and historical importance.

In general, Muslim societies have [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided the depiction]] of living beings (animals and humans) within such sacred spaces as [[mosque]]s and [[madrasah]]s. This opposition to figural representation is based not on the [[Qur'an]], but on traditions contained within the [[Hadith]]. The prohibition of figuration has not always extended to the secular sphere, and a robust tradition of figural representation exists within [[Islamic art|Muslim art]].&lt;ref name="flood2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flood |first=Finbarr Barry |title=Between cult and culture: Bamiyan, Islamic iconoclasm, and the museum |journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=84 |year=2002 |pages=641–659 |doi=10.2307/3177288}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Western authors have tended to perceive "a long, culturally determined, and unchanging tradition of violent iconoclastic acts" within [[Islamic culture|Islamic society]].&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt;

===Early Islam in Arabia===
The first act of Muslim iconoclasm dates to the beginning of Islam, in 630, when the various statues of [[Arabian mythology|Arabian deities]] housed in the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] were destroyed. There is a tradition that Muhammad spared a fresco of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.  A translation of Ishaq's "Sirat Rasul Allah".|publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Guillaume | first=Alfred | authorlink=Alfred Guillaume | year=1955 | page=552 | isbn=978-0-19-636033-1 | quote=Quraysh had put pictures in the Ka'ba including two of Jesus son of Mary and Mary (on both of whom be peace!).&amp;nbsp;... The apostle ordered that the pictures should be erased except those of Jesus and Mary. | url=https://archive.org/details/IbnIshaq-SiratRasulAllah-translatorA.Guillaume | accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was intended to bring an end to the [[idolatry]] which, in the Muslim view, characterized [[Jahiliyya]].

The destruction of the idols of Mecca did not, however, determine the treatment of other religious communities living under Muslim rule after the expansion of the [[caliphate]]. Most Christians under Muslim rule, for example, continued to produce icons and to decorate their churches as they wished. A major exception to this pattern of tolerance in early Islamic history was the "Edict of Yazīd", issued by the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Yazid&amp;nbsp;II]] in 722–723.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grabar, ''L'iconoclasme byzantin: le dossier archéologique'' (Paris, 1984), 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt;
This edict ordered the destruction of crosses and Christian images within the territory of the caliphate. Researchers have discovered evidence that the order was followed, particularly in present-day [[Jordan]], where [[archaeological]] evidence shows the removal of images from the mosaic floors of some, although not all, of the churches that stood at this time. But, Yazīd's iconoclastic policies were not continued by his successors, and Christian communities of the Levant continued to make icons without significant interruption from the sixth century to the ninth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = G.

===Egypt===
[[File:Sphinx of Giza 9059.jpg|thumb|The Sphinx profile in 2010, sans nose]]The [[Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr|missing nose]] on the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is attributed to iconoclasm by a Sufi Muslim fanatic in the mid-1300s.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[al-Maqrīzī]], writing in the 15th century, attributes the damage to [[Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr]], a Sufi Muslim fanatic from the khanqah of Sa'id al-Su'ada, in 1378.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic conquests===
Certain conquering Muslim armies have used local temples or houses of worship as mosques. An example is [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]), which was converted into a mosque in 1453. Most icons were desecrated and the rest were covered with plaster. In the 1920s, Hagia Sophia was converted to a museum, and the restoration of the mosaics was undertaken by the American Byzantine Institute beginning in 1932.

More dramatic cases of iconoclasm by Muslims are found in parts of India where [[Hindu]] and Buddhist temples were razed and mosques erected in their place. Aurangzeb destroyed the famous Hindu temples at [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauwels|first=Heidi|last2=Bachrach|first2=Emilia|date=2018|title=Aurangzeb as Iconoclast?

A recent act of iconoclasm was the 2001 destruction of the giant [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] by the then [[Taliban]] government of [[Afghanistan]]. The act generated world-wide protests and was not supported by other Muslim governments and organizations. It was widely perceived in the Western media as a result of the Muslim prohibition against figural decoration. Such an account overlooks "the coexistence between the Buddhas and the Muslim population that marveled at them for over a millennium" before their destruction.&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt; The Buddhas had twice in the past been attacked by [[Nadir Shah]] and [[Aurengzeb]]. According to the art historian F.B. Flood, analysis of the Taliban's statements regarding the Buddhas suggest that their destruction was motivated more by political than by theological concerns.&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt; Taliban spokespeople have given many different [[Buddhas of Bamyan#Destruction|explanations of the motives]] for the destruction.

==Political and revolutionary iconoclasm==
[[File:Johannes Adam Simon Oertel Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, N.Y.C. ca. 1859.jpg|thumb|The [[Sons of Liberty]] pulling down the statue of [[George&amp;nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)]], 1776]]

===''Damnatio memoriae''===
{{main|damnatio memoriae}}
Revolutions and changes of regime, whether through uprising of the local population, foreign invasion, or a combination of both, are often accompanied by the public destruction of statues and monuments identified with the previous regime. This may also be known as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', the ancient Roman practice of official obliteration of the memory of a specific individual. Stricter definitions of "iconoclasm" exclude both types of action, reserving the term for religious or more widely cultural destruction. In many cases, such as [[Revolutionary Russia]] or [[Ancient Egypt]], this distinction can be hard to make.

Among Roman emperors and other political figures subject to decrees of ''damnatio memoriae'' were [[Sejanus]], [[Publius Septimius Geta]], and [[Domitian]]. Several Emperors, such as [[Domitian]] and [[Commodus]] had during their reigns erected numerous statues of themselves, which were pulled down and destroyed when they were overthrown.

===Iconoclasm in the French Revolution===
&lt;!-- this should be broken out into a separate article --&gt;
Throughout the radical phase of the [[French Revolution]], iconoclasm was supported by members of the government as well as the citizenry.  Numerous monuments, religious works, and other historically significant pieces were destroyed in an attempt to eradicate any memory of the [[Old Regime]].  At the same time, the republican government felt responsible to preserve these works for their historical, aesthetic, and cultural value.  One way the republican government succeeded in their paradoxical mission of preserving and destroying symbols of the Old Regime was through the development of museums.

During the Revolution, a statue of [[King Louis XV]] in the Paris square which until then bore his name, was pulled down and destroyed. This was a prelude to the [[guillotine|guillotining]] of his successor [[Louis XVI]] in the same site, renamed "Place de la Révolution" (at present [[Place de la Concorde]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Idzerda|first=Stanley J.|year=1954|title="Iconoclasm during the French Revolution"|url=|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=60/1|pages=13–26|via=|doi=10.2307/1842743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] on the column at [[Place Vendôme]], Paris was also the target of iconoclasm several times: destroyed after the [[Bourbon Restoration]], restored by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], destroyed during the [[Paris Commune]] and restored by [[Adolphe Thiers]].

===Roland and the Monuments Commission===
The Monuments Commission had a responsibility of preserving art despite its problematic political symbolism. Jean Roland was installed as the Minister of Interior in 1792 and was faced with pressure from the National Convention to destroy symbols of the Old Regime. Roland, given the responsibility of simultaneously preserving and destroying art, found his solution in the form of public museums. The museum served as a representation of France's rich artistic heritage. Roland had an idealistic vision for the opening of the Louvre as a means of showcasing the glory and power of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Bette W. Oliver. From Royal to National: The Louvre Museum and the Bibliotheque Nationale (Lantham: Lexington Book, 2007), p. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public museums===
The Louvre was first opened to the public on August 10, 1793. Its collection was almost entirely composed of art from the monarchy's collection in Versailles. Although the radical government's official purpose of installing this art was to "avoid favoritism among artists," the paintings were "secretly held in high regard."&lt;ref&gt;Emmet, Kennedy. A Cultural History of the French Revolution. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1989): pp. 221, 223&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics believed that the art from the royalist era was superior to the work of contemporary artists and therefore believed that the works served a greater historical and aesthetic purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet 1989, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; These artistic symbols of "royalty, feudalism, and superstition" lost their significance in the passive and detached environment of the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Idzerda, "Iconoclasm during the French Revolution." In The American Historical Review, Vol. 60, No. 1 (Oct., 1954), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Louvre, along with other French museums, was a compromise between the political push to preserve and destroy art. Consequently, the museum represented one form of iconoclasm, as it destroyed the essence and meaning of artistic images while preserving its physical form. French museums stripped art of its culturally specific meaning, separating the great artworks from their potentially counterrevolutionary context. Subsequently, politically controversial works were allowed to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Of Other Spaces." Diacritics. (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the museum freed images from their intended symbolic meaning and allowed French citizens to appreciate the art merely for its aesthetic and technical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari. A Thousand Plateaus. (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1987): 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum houses, defends, preserves, and abstracts by its very nature, and as such, was one of the most significant architectural and conceptual structures to have been conceived in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;de Certeau, Michel. The Practice of Everyday Life. (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1984): 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Premier Musée des Monuments opened to the public in the year 1795, having been commissioned in October of 1790 to hold artworks collected by the revolutionary government. It eventually became one of the most popular museums in Europe. Its curator, Alexandre Lenoir, preserved religious sculptures and tombs for his museum. He was able to preserve relics of the feudal system by convincing revolutionary leaders of their stylistic merit, and minimizing reverence toward the societies the works portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Christopher M., "Alexandre Lenoir and the Musée des monuments français during the French Revolution," French Historical Studies 12, no. 2 (1981): p. 200–222.&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolutionary museums did not so much eliminate meanings as provide new ones." &lt;ref&gt;Greene 1981, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records compiled by Muslim historian Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai attest to the iconoclasm of [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]]. The first mosque built in Delhi, the "[[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat al-Islam]]" was built after the demolition of the Hindu temple built previously by Prithvi Raj and certain parts of the temple were left outside the mosque proper.&lt;ref name="Hai"&gt;Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai "Hindustan Islami Ahad Mein" (Hindustan under Islamic rule), Eng Trans by Maulana Abdul Hasan Nadwi.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of iconoclasm was common during his reign, although an argument goes that such iconoclasm was motivated more by politics than by religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routes/1200_1299/index_1200_1299.html Index_1200-1299],''Columbia.edu''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ruler of the sultanate, Shams-ud-din [[Iltutmish]], conquered and subjugated the Hindu pilgrimage site [[Varanasi]] in the 11th century and he continued the destruction of Hindu temples and idols that had begun during the first attack in 1194.&lt;ref&gt;

No aspect of Aurangzeb's reign is more cited—or more controversial—than the numerous desecrations and even the destruction of Hindu temples.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"&gt;[http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Aurangzeb.htm The South Asian] ''Aurangzeb profile''.&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, tens of thousands of temples were desecrated: their facades and interiors were defaced and their murtis (divine images) looted.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"/&gt; In many cases, temples were destroyed entirely; in numerous instances mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones. Among the temples Aurangzeb destroyed were two that are most sacred to Hindus, in [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"&gt;[http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/modern/temple_aurangzeb.html Rajiv Varma] ''Destruction of Hindu Temples by Aurangzeb.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, he had large mosques built on the sites.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"/&gt;

[[File:Benares well.jpg|thumb|The original holy well – Gyanvapi in between temple and mosque.]]
The [[Kesava Deo]] temple in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], marked the place that Hindus believe was the birthplace of Shri [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt; In 1661 Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the temple, and constructed the Katra Masjid mosque. Traces of the ancient Hindu temple can be seen from the back of the mosque. Aurangzeb also destroyed what was the most famous temple in [[Varanasi]] – the [[Vishwanath Temple]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt;

The temple had changed its location over the years, and in 1585 [[Akbar]] had authorized its location at Gyan Vapi. Aurangzeb ordered its demolition in 1669 and constructed a mosque on the site, whose minarets stand 71&amp;nbsp;metres above the Ganges. Traces of the old temple can be seen behind the mosque. Centuries later, emotional debate about these wanton acts of cultural desecration continues. [[Aurangzeb]] also destroyed the [[Somnath]] temple in 1706.&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt;

[[Hindu nationalists]] claim that Mughals destroyed the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Mandir]] in [[Ayodhya]], located at the birthplace of [[Rama]], and built the [[Babri Masjid]] on the holy site, which has since been a source of tension between the Hindu and Muslim communities.

Writer Fernand Braudel wrote in ''A History of Civilizations'' (Penguin 1988/1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–236), Islamic rule in India as a "colonial experiment" was "extremely violent", and "the Muslims could not rule the country except by systematic terror. Cruelty was the norm – burnings, summary executions, crucifixions or impalements, inventive tortures. Hindu temples were destroyed to make way for mosques. On occasion there were forced conversions. If ever there were an uprising, it was instantly and savagely repressed: houses were burned, the countryside was laid waste, men were slaughtered and women were taken as slaves."

===During Goa inquisitions===
Diago de Boarda, a priest, and his advisor Vicar General, Miguel Vaz, had made a 41-point plan for torturing Hindus. Under this plan Viceroy Antano de Noronha issued in 1566, an order applicable to the entire area under Portuguese rule:&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgweb.org/unethicalconversion/GoaInquisition.htm |title=The Goa Inquisition by Christian Historian Dr. T. R. de Souza |publisher=Vgweb.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the king, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1567 the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with success. At the end of it 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. In 1583 Hindu temples at [[Assolna]] and [[Cuncolim]] were destroyed through army action.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers&lt;/blockquote&gt;,

wrote [[Filippo Sassetti]], who was in India from 1578 to 1588.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

An order was issued in June 1684 eliminating the [[Konkani language]] and making it compulsory to speak [[Portuguese language]].  Following that law all the symbols of non-Christian sects were destroyed and the books written in local languages were burnt.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

===In Pakistan===
{{Further|Decline of Hinduism in Pakistan}}
Several Hindu temples have been destroyed in Pakistan. A notable incident was the destruction of the [[Ramna Kali Mandir]] in former [[East Pakistan]]. The temple was bulldozed by the Pakistani Army on March 27, 1971. The [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] was severely damaged during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and over half of the temple's buildings were destroyed. In a major disrespect of the religion, the main worship hall was taken over by the [[Pakistan]] Army and used as an ammunitions storage area. Several of the temple custodians were tortured and killed by the Army though most, including the Head Priest, fled first to their ancestral villages and then to India and therefore escaped death.

In 2006 the last Hindu temple in [[Lahore]] was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-story commercial building. The temple was demolished after officials of the Evacuee Property Trust Board concealed facts from the board chairman about the nature of the building. When reporters from Pakistan-based newspaper ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' tried to cover the incident, they were accosted by the henchmen of the property developer, who denied that a Hindu temple existed at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/05/28/nat23.htm Another temple is no more], ''Dawn''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several political parties in Pakistan have objected to this move, such as the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistani Muslim League-N.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.rediff.com/news/2006/jun/13temple.htm Hindu temple in Lahore demolished],''Rediff.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-06-13/pakistan/27788614_1_hindu-temple-hindus-and-sikhs-eptb Only Hindu Temple in Lahore demolished],''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; The move has also evoked strong condemnation in India from minority bodies and political parties, including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], as well as Muslim advocacy political parties such as the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1651762.cms India protests demolition of Hindu temple in Pak], ''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm of lawyers representing the Hindu minority has approached the Lahore High Court seeking a directive to the builders to stop the construction of the commercial plaza and reconstruct the temple at the site. The petitioners maintain that the demolition violates section 295 of the Pakistan Penal Code prohibiting the demolition of places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/06/16/10047337.html Order for temple's reconstruction sought],''Gulf News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2005, following the arrest of an illiterate Christian janitor on allegations of allegedly burning Qur'an pages, a mob of between 300 and 500 Muslims destroyed a Hindu temple and houses belonging to Christian and Hindu families in [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]]. Under the terms of a deal negotiated between Islamic religious leaders and the Hindu/Christian communities, Pakistani police later released all previously arrested perpetrators without charge.&lt;ref name="usdep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71443.htm |title=US Department of State International Religious Freedom Report 2006 |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Malaysia===
Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row – a dab of sensibility please], ''malaysiakini.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html Muslims Destroy Century-Old Hindu Temple,''gatago.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built "illegally". However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests "temple cleansing" in Malaysia], ''Financial Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus.&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt;

===In Saudi Arabia===
On March 24, 2005, [[Government of Saudi Arabia|Saudi authorities]] destroyed religious items found in a raid on a makeshift Hindu shrine found in an apartment in [[Riyadh]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Paul. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060522223359/http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/news/bn2005/bn-2005-00-16.htm Saudi Arabia's Religious Police Crack Down]''. Freedom House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Fiji===
In Fiji according to official reports, attacks on Hindu institutions increased by 14% compared to 2004. This intolerance of Hindus has found expression in anti-Hindu speeches and destruction of temples, the two most common forms of immediate and direct violence against Hindus. Between 2001 and April 2005, one hundred cases of temple attacks have been registered with the police. The alarming increase of temple destruction has spread fear and intimidation among the Hindu minorities and has hastened immigration to neighboring Australia and New Zealand. Organized religious institutions, such as the Methodist Church of Fiji, have repeatedly called for the creation of a theocratic Christian State and have propagated anti-Hindu sentiment.&lt;ref name="Hindusin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hafsite.org/pdf/hhr_2005_html/fijiislands.htm |title=Hindus in South Asia and the Diaspora: A Survey of Human Rights 2005 |publisher=Hafsite.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; State favoritism of Christianity, and systematic attacks on temples, are some of the greatest threats faced by Fijian Hindus. Despite the creation of a human rights commission, the plight of Hindus in Fiji continues to be precarious.&lt;ref name="Hindusin" /&gt;
 --&gt;

===Chinese iconoclasm===
{{further|Anti-Western sentiment in China}}
There have been [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|a number of anti-Buddhist campaigns]] in [[Chinese history]] that led to the destruction of [[Buddhist temple]]s and images. One of the most notable of these campaigns was the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]] of the [[Tang dynasty]].

During and after the [[Xinhai Revolution]], there was widespread destruction of religious and secular images in [[China]].

During the [[Northern Expedition]] in [[Guangxi]] in 1926, [[Kuomintang]] General [[Bai Chongxi]] led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing Buddhist images, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai%20smashing%20idols%20decapitating%20statues&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=98|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that almost all of the [[vihara]]s in Guangxi were destroyed and the [[bhikkhu|monks]] were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxDUeWdMubkC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=bai+chongxi+buddhist+temples#v=onepage&amp;q=bai%20chongxi%20buddhist%20temples&amp;f=false|title=Toward a modern Chinese Buddhism: Taixu's reforms|author=Don Alvin Pittman|year=2001|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=|page=146|isbn=0-8248-2231-5|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bai also led a wave of anti-foreignism in Guangxi, attacking Americans, Europeans, and other foreigners, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners and [[missionaries]]. Westerners fled from the province and some [[Chinese Christians]] were also attacked as imperialist agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=snippet&amp;q=missionary%20crowd&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three goals of the movement were anti-foreignism, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[anti-religion]]. Bai led the anti-religious movement against [[superstition]]. [[Huang Shaohong]], also a Kuomintang member of the [[New Guangxi clique]], supported Bai's campaign. The anti-religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai's%20as%20a%20moslem%20other%20religions&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was extensive destruction of religious and secular imagery in [[Tibet]] after it was [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1910)|invaded]] and [[occupation of Tibet|occupied]] by China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9376-6_23|title=The Changing World Religion Map|last=Karan|first=P. P.|date=2015|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789401793759|pages=461–476|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-9376-6_23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious and secular images were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966-1976, ostensibly because they were a holdover from China's traditional and capitalist past (which the Communist regime led by [[Mao Zedong]] reviled). The Cultural Revolution included widespread destruction of historic artworks in public places and private collections, whether religious or secular. Objects in state museums were mostly left intact.

===Iconoclasm in Eastern Europe===
[[File:Christ saviour explosion.jpg|thumb|Demolition of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Moscow]], 5 December 1931]]
During and after the [[October Revolution]], widespread destruction of religious and secular imagery took place, as well as the destruction of imagery related to [[House of Romanov|the Imperial family]]. The Revolution was accompanied by destruction of monuments of past [[tsar]]s, as well as the destruction of [[Coat of arms of Russia|imperial eagles]] at various locations throughout [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. According to Christopher Wharton, "In front of a Moscow cathedral, crowds cheered as the enormous statue of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;III]] was bound with ropes and gradually beaten to the ground. After a considerable amount of time, the statue was decapitated and its remaining parts were broken into rubble".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wharton, [http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797 "The Hammer and Sickle: The Role of Symbolism and Rituals in the Russian Revolution"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528035402/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797 |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] actively destroyed religious sites, including [[Russian Orthodox]] churches and [[Jewish cemeteries]], in order to discourage religious practice and curb the activities of religious groups.
 
During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and during the [[Revolutions of 1989]], protesters often attacked and took down sculptures and images of [[Joseph Stalin]], such as the [[Stalin Monument (Budapest)|Stalin Monument]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Auyezov|first=Olzhas|title=Ukraine says blowing up Stalin statue was terrorism|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/05/us-ukraine-stalin-idUSTRE7043D920110105|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of communism in 1989 was also followed by the destruction or removal of statues of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other Communist leaders in the [[former Soviet Union]] and in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Particularly well-known was the destruction of "[[Felix Dzerzhinsky#Iron Felix|Iron Felix]]", the statue of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] outside the [[KGB]]'s headquarters. Another statue of Dzerzhinsky was destroyed in a [[Warsaw]] square that was named after him during [[communist Poland|communist rule]], but which is now called [[Bank Square, Warsaw|Bank Square]].

Other examples of political destruction of images include:
* During the [[American Revolution]], the [[Sons of Liberty]] pulled down and destroyed the [[gilding|gilded]] lead statue of [[George&amp;nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)]], melting it down to be recast as [[Musket#Ammunition|ammunition]]. Similar acts have accompanied the independence of most ex-colonial territories.  Sometimes relatively intact monuments are moved to a collected display in a less prominent place, as in India and also post-Communist countries.
* From the 16th through the 19th centuries, many of the polytheistic religious deities and texts of pre-colonial Americas, Oceania and Africa were destroyed by Christian missionaries and their converts, such as during the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] and the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]].
* In 1942 the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy Government of France]] took down and melted Clothilde Roch's statue of the 16th-century dissident  intellectual [[Michael Servetus]], who had been burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] at the instigation of [[John Calvin|Calvin]]. The Vichy authorities disliked the statue, as it was a celebration of freedom of conscience. In 1960, having found the original molds, the municipality of Annemasse had it recast and returned the statue to its previous place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Goldstone, Nancy Bazelon |author2=Goldstone, Lawrence |title=Out of the Flames: The Remarkable Story of a Fearless Scholar, a Fatal Heresy, and One of the Rarest Books in the World |publisher=Broadway |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7679-0837-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}pp. 313-316&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux''' (11 May 1827 – 12 October 1875) was a French sculptor and painter during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] under [[Napoleon III]].

== Life ==
Born in [[Valenciennes]], [[Nord (French department)|Nord]], son of a mason, his early studies were under [[François Rude]].&lt;ref name=Kjellberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Pierre|title=Bronzes of the 19th Century|date=1994|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-88740-629-7|pages=174|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpeaux entered the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1844 and won the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1854, and moving to Rome to find inspiration, he there studied the works of [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]], [[Donatello]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio|Verrocchio]]. Staying in Rome from 1854 to 1861, he obtained a taste for movement and spontaneity, which he joined with the great principles of [[baroque]] art.  Carpeaux sought real life subjects in the streets and broke with the classical tradition.

Carpeaux debuted at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1853 exhibiting ''La Soumission d'Abd-el-Kader al'Empereur'', a [[bas-relief]] in plaster that did not attract much attention. Carpeaux was an admirer of [[Napoleon III|Napoléon III]] and followed him from city to city during Napoléon's official trip through the north of France. After initially not making any contact with the emperor, he finally succeeded in arranging a face-to-face encounter at [[Amiens]] where he managed to convince Napoléon to commission a marble statue that was to be carried out by a practitioner, Charles Romain Capellaro.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;  

Carpeaux soon grew tired of academicism and became a wanderer on the streets of Rome. He spent free time admiring the [[Fresco|frescoes]] of [[Michelangelo]] at the [[Sistine Chapel]]. Carpeaux said, "When an artist feels pale and cold, he runs to Michelangelo in order to warm himself, as with the rays of the sun".&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

While a student in Rome, Carpeaux submitted a plaster version of ''Pêcheur napolitain à la coquille'', the ''Neapolitan Fisherboy'', to the [[French Academy]].  He carved the marble version several years later, showing it in the Salon exhibition of 1863. It was purchased for [[Napoleon III]]'s empress, [[Eugénie de Montijo|Eugénie]]. The statue of the young smiling boy was very popular, and Carpeaux created a number of reproductions and variations in marble and bronze. There is a copy, for instance, in the Samuel H. Kress Collection in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Some years later, he carved the ''Girl with a Shell'', a similar study.

In 1861, he made a bust of [[Mathilde Bonaparte|Princess Mathilde]], and this later brought him several commissions from [[Napoleon III]]. Then in 1866, he established his own atelier in order to reproduce and make work on a grander scale.
In 1866, he was awarded the chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carpeaux, Jean Baptiste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He employed his brother as the sales manager and made a calculated effort to produce work that would appeal to a larger audience.&lt;ref&gt;Frusco, Peter, Janson, H.W., ''The Romantics to Rodin'', George Braziller, Inc., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;
On 12 October 1875, he died at [[George Barbu Știrbei]]'s ''[[château]]'' in [[Bécon-les-Bruyères]], outside [[Courbevoie]].&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt;

Among his students were [[Jules Dalou]], [[Jean-Louis Forain]] and the American sculptor [[Olin Levi Warner]].

New York: Congress for Jewish Culture. vol. 6, columns 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Polish-Jewish art historian and critic, an art dealer and collector, and an advocate on behalf of Jewish artists in postwar [[Poland]].

==Biography==
Sandel was born in Kolomea ([[Kolomyia]], Ukraine), then in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The son of a cap maker, he attended the [[Maurice de Hirsch|Baron Hirsch]] school and then [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]].&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

Around 1920, he moved to [[Dresden]], Germany, where, in 1925, he co-published a short-lived German-language literary and art magazine, ''Mob: Zeitschrift der Jungen'' (Mob: Journal of youths).&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietzel, Thomas, and Hans-Otto Hügel (1988). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=3_-Qc8E4FysC&amp;pg=PA807 Mob]." ''Deutsche literarische Zeitschriften, 1880-1945: Ein Repertorium.'' Munich: Saur. vol. 3, p. 807.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently lived in France, Switzerland, and Austria, before returning to Dresden.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

From 1929 to 1933, he operated an art gallery in [[Dresden]], called ''Galerie junge Kunst'' (Gallery of young art).&lt;ref name="Piatkowska78-79"&gt;Piątkowska, Renata (2008). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1TSi_QnJOIC&amp;pg=PA78 Jewish Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts / Di yidishe gezelshaft tsu farshpreytn kunst: An Attempt at the Continuation of Jewish Artistic Life in Postwar Poland, 1946-1949]." In: Elvira Grözinger and Magdalena Ruta (Eds.), ''Under the Red Banner: Yiddish Culture in the Communist Countries in the Postwar Era''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag. p. 77-96; here p. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; After the rise of the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] regime in Germany, he moved to [[Belgrade]] (then in [[Yugoslavia]]), where he opened another gallery and mounted exhibitions, in 1933-1934.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

In 1935, he moved to Poland; he spent time in [[Vilnius|Vilna]] (Vilnius) and Warsaw, and published articles on art in [[Yiddish | Yiddish-language]] periodicals, including ''Literarishe bleter''.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the Second World War he fled to the Soviet Union, and survived the war in [[Kazakhstan]], where he taught German in a middle school.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

After the war, he returned to Poland and settled in [[Warsaw]], in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; There he became the leader of the Jewish Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts (Polish: Żydowskie Towarzystwo Krzewienia Sztuk Pięknych; Yiddish: Yidishe gezelshaft tsu farshpreytn kunst), or ZTKSP, a revival of an organization that had been active in Poland before the war.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society provided material assistance to Jewish artists, helped to promote their work, and fostered art education for Jewish youth.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 79-83.&lt;/ref&gt; It mounted some 98 exhibitions in Warsaw, and four exhibitions that were presented throughout Poland&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; two devoted to the work of individual artists, [[Rafael Mandelzweig]], in 1946, and [[Lea Grundig]], in 1949; and two, in 1948, in honor of the fifth anniversary of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], featuring works of Jewish artists who were killed in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 77, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the ZTKSP, in September 1949, the art works that Sandel and his colleagues had assembled were integrated into the collections of the [[Jewish Historical Institute]], Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1950 to 1953 the institute operated a Gallery of Jewish Art, with Sandel serving as director.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandel subsequently devoted himself to the writing of several art historical works concerning Jewish artists in Poland. Among his works, all written in Yiddish, is a two-volume biographical reference work on Jewish artists who perished in the Holocaust, ''Umgekumene yidishe kinstler in Poylen'' (Jewish artists in Poland who perished; Warsaw, 1957).&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Sandel married Ernestyna Podhorizer (1903-1984), who was also originally from Galicia and worked for a time as the secretary of the ZTKSP. Sandel-Podhorizer was born in Dembits ([[Dębica]]), and before the war had been a biology teacher in Lemberg ([[Lviv]]); she was later a curator at the museum of the Jewish Historical Institute, and also worked at the Biology Institute in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Elis, Binyamin (1965).

'''Kearny Street Workshop''' (KSW) in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], is the oldest multidisciplinary arts [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] addressing [[Asian Pacific American]] issues. The organization's mission is to produce and present art that enriches and empowers Asian Pacific American communities. Notable participants include author and Asian American studies scholar [[Russell Leong]], playwright and author [[Jessica Hagedorn]], author [[Janice Mirikitani]], poet and historian [[Al Robles]], and actor and filmmaker [[Lane Nishikawa]]. 

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Kearny Street Workshop was founded as an artists' collective in 1972 in the [[International Hotel (San Francisco)|International Hotel]] (I-Hotel) on San Francisco's [[Kearny Street]]. The founders Jim Dong, Lora Joh Foo, and Mike Chin and other early leaders were involved in the [[Asian American movement]], a [[Civil Rights Movement]]-inspired period of organizational and community building in the 1970s. The [[National Endowment for the Arts]] provided some initial funding through the Neighborhood Arts Program (NAP), an initiative of the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]]. Though the founders were initially distrustful of government funds, NAP liaison Bernice Bing and founder Jim Dong eventually agreed to use a $2,000 NAP grant to fund a graphics workshop for KSW participants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3935054|title=The art museum as educator : a collection of studies as guides to practice and policy|last=Arts.|first=Council on Museums and Education in the Visual|date=1978|publisher=University of California Press|others=Newsom, Barbara Y., Silver, Adele Z.|year=|isbn=9780520032484|location=Berkeley|pages=207|oclc=3935054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days, KSW shared space with a dry goods store on the ground floor of the I-Hotel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mica.edu/About_MICA/Departments_and_Services/The_Center_for_Art_Education/Community_Arts_Journal/Visions_and_Voices_of_the_I-Hotel.html|title=Visions and Voices of the I-Hotel: Urban Struggles, Community Mythologies and Creativity {{!}} MICA|last=Art|first=Maryland Institute College of|website=www.mica.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization originally focused on cultivating [[Chinese Americans|Chinese American]] arts and activism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the organization quickly expanded to cater to a multiethnic constituency, holding classes for Asian American activists and artists to practice [[photography]], [[creative writing]], and [[silkscreen printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeda|first=Daryl Joji|date=2016-06-09|title=The Asian American Movement|url=http://americanhistory.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-21|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first few years, hundreds of Bay-area students were attending classes, [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], workshops, and [[Exhibition|exhibitions]] each day.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Kearny Street Collective: Pioneering Workshop Turns 25|last=Hsuan|first=Bryan|date=September 11, 1997|work=Asianweek|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; KSW also opened Jackson Street Gallery in an adjacent I-Hotel storefront space in 1974, where Workshop members held exhibitions, poetry readings, and musical performances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Community activism ===
KSW played a key role in developing Asian American activist iconography during the I-Hotel anti-eviction movement. Students and other KSW members painted a block-long mural on the Jackson Street side of the I-Hotel in support of its tenants. Screenprinted posters advocating for the I-Hotel tenants' rights appeared throughout San Francisco's [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], [[Little Manila|Manilatown]], and [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]] during the decade-long fight for the I-Hotel. Artists from KSW also aided in the anti-eviction protests by organizing [[Demonstration (protest)|rallies]], attending court hearings, hosting exhibitions on [[affordable housing]], and publishing [[poetry]] and pamphlets that depicted life in the I-Hotel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

KSW also provided summer youth programming that was intended to provide a diversion from gang violence in Chinatown. Workshop members also spearheaded the development of the annual Hop Jok Fair, which not only promoted Asian American artwork, but introduced many low-income Chinatown residents to available social and health services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Eviction and relocation ===
In 1977, both residential and business tenants were evicted from the I-Hotel. The workshop's headquarters relocated to a small storefront in [[North Beach, San Francisco]]. However, this relocation separated the organization from its key communities and constituents in Chinatown and Manilatown.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

KSW was able to return to Chinatown by 1981, leasing a basement space in a hotel on Clay Street. During its time in this space, members organized the Asian American Jazz Festival as well as the Kearny Street Workshop Press.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1995, KSW was incorporated as a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization and relocated to [[South Park, San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

KSW finally relocated to a gallery and performance space in San Francisco's [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]] in 2006.

== Programs and exhibitions ==
KSW's past and present programs include a small poetry press, writers' workshops, visual arts, [[martial arts]], readings, music, gallery exhibitions, performances, and film screenings, as well as the Asian American Jazz Festival and the annual artists festival APAture.

=== Kearny Street Workshop Press ===
KSW's press published poetry by Bay-area Asian American authors such as Virginia Cerenio, Bob Hsiang, Jaime Jacinto, [[Genny Lim]], Lenny Limjoco, and Jeff Tagami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/publishers/Kearny_Street_Workshop_Press|title=Publisher: Kearny Street Workshop Press {{!}} Open Library|last=OpenLibrary.org|website=openlibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

=== Asian American Jazz Festival ===
KSW founded the Asian American Jazz Festival (AAJF) in 1981, with the help of organizers and KSW members George Leong and Paul Yamazaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstvoice.org/asian-american-jazz-festival/|title=Asian American Jazz Festival|website=Brenda Wong Aoki &amp; Mark Izu – Official Website|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until it ceased production in 2006, the AAJF was the longest continuously-running jazz festival in the San Francisco area. Notable participants include [[Mark Izu]], [[Fred Ho]], [[Vijay Iyer]], and [[Kim Jin-hi|Jin Hi Kim]]. 

=== APAture ===
APAture is an annual multidisciplinary arts festival founded in 2001. Its mission is to promote emerging artists of Asian and/or Pacific Islander descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kearnystreet.org/apature-faq/|title=APAture FAQ|website=Kearny Street Workshop|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable participants include [[Gene Luen Yang]], [[Ali Wong]], [[Hasan Minhaj]], and [[Jane Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kmir.com/story/36320233/kearny-street-workshop-presents-over-60-emerging-asian-pacific-american-artists-in-the-16th-annual-apature-festival|title=Kearny Street Workshop Presents Over 60 Emerging Asian Pacific American Artists in the 16th Annual APAture Festival|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AAC Kulturanova''' (Association for Alternative Creation) is a [[Non-governmental organization|non-government]], [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] organization aimed at popularization and affirmation of art and cultural spirit. It was founded in May 2001. in [[Novi Sad]] (the capital of [[Vojvodina]], major region in [[Serbia]]). Organization was founded as an [[umbrella organization]] for various non-formal independent art groups, individuals and young artists from Novi Sad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charity-charities.org/SerbiaMontenegro-charities/NoviSad-1464388.html&lt;/ref&gt; Kulturanova organization focuses its development on urban youth culture and raising awareness on relevant social issues, with the vision of building creative platforms for youth of [[Novi Sad]] and region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gradjanske.org/page/youthProgram/sr/infoCenter/directory/vojvodina.html?view=organization&amp;organizacijaId=32&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Association kulturanova formed in 1999. but it was 2001. when the organization officially registered. Basic idea behind the organization was to create an [[umbrella organization]] for all young people that were exhausted by the ongoing situation in Serbia [[Serbia#Dissolution of Socialist Yugoslavia and Kosovo War .281991.E2.80.931999.29|during the 1990s]].&lt;ref name="rhiz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhiz.eu/institution-3079-en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720172324/http://www.rhiz.eu/institution-3079-en.html |archive-date=2011-07-20 |dead-url=yes|title=Rhiz.eu - Association kulturanova, Novi Sad|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harsh period of [[International sanctions|sanctions]] imposed by the [[United Nations]] during the 1990s left most young artists without opportunities to show their work in cultural institutions of the time. To this day Kulturanova worked on projects in the field of arts, theatre, design, graffiti, street culture and cultural politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://idealist.org/if/cac/en/av/Org/122243-298&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===
According to Montgomery, "I was definitely influenced by the Disney films. Those were the drawings I was tracing and sketching during my early years. I would study each and every one of the princesses and draw them until I had them all down by heart. My facial features are still influenced somewhat by Disney characters. As I got older, I was definitely influenced by Bruce's style in Batman (referring to [[Bruce Timm]] and ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''), and I started getting into anime, and some of the more subtle styles in anime drawing. The clothing is a little more detailed than the typical American animation – it's more believable, yet still simplified. It's the way they draw bodies and cloth that I kind of incorporate into my drawings, as well as certain aspects of how they would draw hair. So I'd say I have a few different influences in my art style."&lt;ref name="superherotimes"/&gt;

==History==

===First decade===

With sculptor [[Attilio Piccirilli]], Ruotolo founded the school to provide low-cost, often free art instruction to the working poor, mostly in the evening.  The school was first located at [[St. Nicholas of Myra Church (Manhattan)|St. Nicholas of Myra, Christian Orthodox Church]], 288 East 10th Street, off Avenue A and near Tompkins Square Park. Tuition was six dollars ($6) per month—or free.&lt;ref name= Sciorra-Vellon /&gt;  Students in the 1920s included Noguchi and [[Esther Shemitz]].&lt;ref name=Herrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lumpkin&gt;
{{cite book

| pages = ix
| date =  1932
| accessdate = 5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

To foster Noguchi's decision to study sculpture, Ruotolo offered him a job that paid as much as other work he had.  Later, Noguchi recalled, "How could I resist?  I became a sculpture even against my will."  After only three months at the "Leonardoo" (as the school was known), Noguchi held a solo exhibition.  Ruotolo also helped Noguchi get commissions for outside sculpture work.&lt;ref name=Herrera /&gt;

===Second decade===

In 1934, the school reorganized and reopened at 149 East 34th Street, graced by "The New Deal" mural of [[Conrad Albrizio]].&lt;ref&gt;

No employees received payment for their services.  For the school's rededication, Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] unveiled a fresco symbolic of the New Deal.&lt;ref name= Sciorra-Vellon /&gt;

===Closure===

Contributions diminished significantly during [[World War II]], leading to the Leonardo's closture at its third and final location at 130 East 16th Street on April 28, 1942.&lt;ref name= Sciorra-Vellon /&gt;

==Legacy==

In addition to starting the career of Noguchi, the Leonardo also was the only school in its time to teach the art of fresco painting.&lt;ref name= Sciorra-Vellon /&gt;

Bolen was appointed Vice President of Daytime Programming at NBC in 1972.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-NBC-Daytime-1972 /&gt; In September 1975, she was the first female Vice President of Programming at a TV network and took NBC to #1 in the national [[Nielsen ratings]].&lt;ref name=Variety-NBCDaytimeLead-1975&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Takes Daytime Lead|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=22 September 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed an expanded format for ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' and ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'', changing both to an hour-long running time. The expanded shows attracted new viewers and  became hits with young women.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-HourLongDramas-1974&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Les|title=NBC‐TV Trying an Hour‐Long Daytime Soap Opera|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/19/archives/nbctv-trying-an-hourlong-daytime-proliferation-is-noted.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 October 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-AnotherWorld-Days-1975&gt;{{cite news|title=‘As World Turns’ on CBS Will Expand to Hour Dec. 1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/10/archives/as-world-turns-on-cbs-will-expand-to-hour-dec1.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 September 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although NBC was airing the successful game shows ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]],'' and ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' at the time, Bolen's mandate was to increase ratings of young women ages 18–34. Daytime and late-night were seen as NBC's profit center at that time, and advertisers wanted programs that attracted young women. In late 1972, Bolen ended ''Concentration'' 's fifteen-year run and replaced it with the [[Heatter-Quigley Productions]] game show ''[[Baffle (game show)|Baffle]]''. ''Baffle'' failed to compete with [[CBS]]'s new game show, ''[[The $10,000 Pyramid]]'', and was canceled on March 29, 1974.

Bolen also decided to end the eleven-year run of ''Jeopardy!'', feeling that its demographics were old.  The show's creator and producer [[Merv Griffin]] did not wish to change the show's format, so Bolen commissioned a new game show from Griffin called ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.&lt;ref name=Merv-MakingGoodLifeLast-2003&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Mer|last2=Bender|first2=David (with)|title=Merv: Making the Good Life Last|date=2003|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0-743-23682-9|pages=98–99|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/merv/oclc/893133089/viewport|oclc=51059113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two pilots were produced before the network was satisfied that young women would love the show, although Bolen risked being fired if the show failed. ''Wheel of Fortune'' debuted on January 6, 1975, and was an immediate ratings hit.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-TVNotes-1975&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Les|title=TV Notes: All‐Star Game Throws Democrats a Curve; "Lucky Lady"|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/21/archives/tv-notes-allstar-game-throws-democrats-a-curve.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 December 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1976, while NBC was still the #1 network in daytime, Bolen left the network to become an independent TV producer. She formed her own production company called Lin Bolen Productions. The new company created and developed game shows, movies of the week, and theatrical films for networks and studios.&lt;ref name=LATimes-LoveOnTrial-1985&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharbutt|first1=Jay|title=New Soap Bubbles From ABC|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-25/entertainment/ca-10662_1_soap-operas|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=25 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolen created the game show ''[[Stumpers!]]'' hosted by [[Allen Ludden]], which was produced exclusively by Bolen's production company. The show was a word game with game elements similar to ''[[Password]]'', which had also been hosted by Ludden. The show lasted 13 weeks before being canceled by new NBC president [[Fred Silverman]].

One series Bolen's company produced for NBC was loosely based on her own career, taking a serious look at the men who ran network television. ''[[W.E.B.]]'' was scheduled against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s hit series ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' and did not perform well. It was canceled after 13 weeks.

In 1982, Bolen was hired as head of creative affairs at InterMedia Entertainment, which was owned by [[Fred Silverman]].

Bolen's company produced the television movie ''The Christmas Coal Mine Miracle'', starring [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Melissa Gilbert]], which became the highest rated movie of the year for NBC. Other films followed, including ''Good Against Evil'' starring [[Kim Cattrall]] and [[Dan O'Herlihy]] for ABC; ''Golden Gate'' starring [[Perry King]], [[Melanie Griffith]], and [[John Saxon]]; A two-hour [[television pilot|pilot]] for ABC called ''Farrell for the People'' starring [[Valerie Harper]] and [[Ed O'Neill]]; a comedy pilot for NBC called ''The [[Ann Jillian]] Show'', and an NBC summer variety pilot called ''Live From the South Seas'' starring [[John Rowles]].

==''Network''==
Bolen's career as a network executive provided an inspiration in the creation of [[Faye Dunaway]]'s role as network executive Diana Christiansen in the 1976 satirical film about television, ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]''.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost-Network-1978&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shales|first1=Tom|title='Network': The Prophetic Conniption|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1978/10/04/network-the-prophetic-conniption/c549faf9-a1f9-4b35-b403-0f50b349ba86/|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=4 October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LookingForGatsby-Dunaway-1998&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunaway|first1=Faye|last2=Sharkey|first2=Betsy (with)|title=Looking for Gatsby: My Life|date=1998|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-671-67526-4|pages=303–304|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/looking-for-gatsby-my-life/oclc/38540422/viewport|oclc=38540422}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview with [[United Press International|UPI]] in 1978, Bolen had said that the ''Network'' character was nothing like her.&lt;ref name=MilwaukeeSentinel-Network-NotFayeDunaway-1978&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Vernon|title=Producer Lin Bolen Denies She's 'Network' Character|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19780731&amp;id=_HBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7xEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6979,6011319|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]|agency=[[United Press International|United Press International (UPI)]]|date=31 July 1978|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TVWriter-LinBolen-Obit-Network-2018&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brody|first1=Larry|title=LB: Saying Goodbye to Lin Bolen, A Real TV Pioneer|url=https://tvwriter.net/lb-saying-goodbye-to-lin-bolen/|work=TVWriter.Com|date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
After leaving NBC, Bolen married director [[Paul Wendkos]] in 1984. They remained married until his death on November 12, 2009.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-PaulWendkos-Obit-2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hevesi|first1=Dennis|title=Paul Wendkos, Director of ‘Gidget,’ Dies at 84|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/arts/television/22wendkos.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolen died on January 19, 2018 at a hospital in the [[San Fernando Valley]], and was survived by her son, Jordan Wendkos.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-LinBolen-Obit-2018 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Deadline-LinBolen-Obit-2018&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haring|first1=Bruce|title=Lin Bolen Dies: First Female VP Of Programming At A Network Was 76|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/lin-bolen-dies-first-female-vp-of-programming-at-a-network-was-76-1202272021/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lone Scherfig''' (born 2 May 1959) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]] who has been involved with the [[Dogme 95]] film movement and who has been widely critically acclaimed for several of her movies, including the Oscar-nominated film ''[[An Education]]'' (2009). Scherfig's movies are generally [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]], including her film ''[[One Day (2011 film)|One Day]]'' (2011), based on the [[David Nicholls (writer)|David Nicholls]] novel. Through both experimenting with creative constraints and her astute attention to detail, she has come to be recognized as a blossoming talent in the film industry.&lt;ref name="suntimes1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040430/REVIEWS/404300309/1023 |title=Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself |newspaper=Chicago Sun Times |date=30 April 2004 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Trq5MTxm0IC&amp;lpg=PA219 |title=The Danish Directors 2: Dialogues on the New Danish Fiction Cinema |first1=Mette |last1=Hjort, |last2=Jorholt |first2=Eva |last3=Redvall |first3=Eva Novrup |year=2010 |location=Bristol |publisher=Intellect Books |isbn=978-1-84150-271-7 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== 1980s – 1990s: Early beginnings ===
Scherfig graduated from the [[National Film School of Denmark]] in 1984,&lt;ref name="Kosmorama 2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=Kosmorama |publisher=Danske Filmmuseum |issue=v. 246 |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9rOpv7noMcC |access-date=February 26, 2018 |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began her career as a director with the television film ''Margrethes elsker'' in 1985. Previously, she had been involved in the advertising business and had won awards (including the Lion d'Argent) at the Cannes International Advertising Film Festival. Her directorial debut in film came with ''Kaj's fodselsdag''. The film was critically successful and garnered her the Grand Jury prize and the Club Espace Award at the [[Rouen Nordic Film Festival|Rouen Nordic FIlm Festival]]. For a period of time following such success, Scherfig wrote and directed a few short films and worked with both radio shows and the stage. In 1998, she directed the film ''Nar mor kommer hjem'', which was the recipient of the Grand Prix at the [[Montreal World Film Festival|Montreal Film Festival]] and the Cinekid Award in [[Amsterdam]].

=== 2000s: International breakthrough, ''Italian for Beginners'' ===
Scherfig found her international breakthrough with the film ''[[Italian for Beginners]]'' (2000), which was critically acclaimed and won several awards, including the Jury Grand Prix [[Silver Berlin Bear|Silver Bear]] award at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tributemovies.com/people/Lone+Scherfig/8495/ |title=Lone Scherfig Biography |work=Tributemovies.com |date=1959-05-02 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hailed as a feel-good movie, the film is consistently preoccupied with themes of hope, happiness, and choice. It is credited as the most profitable Scandinavian film to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/blog/lucy-farmer/qa-lone-scherfig-filmmaker |last=Farmer |first=Lucy |title=The Q&amp;A: Lone Scherfig, Filmmaker |work=MoreIntelligentLife.com |accessdate=15 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102154337/http://moreintelligentlife.com/blog/lucy-farmer/qa-lone-scherfig-filmmaker |archivedate=2 January 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film, following the creative constraints of the [[Dogme 95]] movement, is set almost entirely on location within a small space, uses sound only found at the source, and it's shot on video. The film involves several characters and their various romantic or otherwise interactions that unfold across this limited setting. As opposed to many other ''[[Dogme 95]]'' films, Scherfig's is rather upbeat and comedic, and has been noted for its rather amusing tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020201/REVIEWS/202010303/1023 |title=Italian For Beginners |newspaper=Chicago Sun Times |date=1 February 2001 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Italian for Beginners'', Scherfig made the deadpan comedy ''[[Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself]]'', released in 2002. This film, not considered a part of the ''Dogme 95'' canon, is a touching movie centered on a suicidal man who is constantly saved and cared for by his brother. Noted by critics to be a surprisingly lighthearted affair, the movie was praised for Scherfig's ability to craft deep and interesting characters.&lt;ref name="suntimes1" /&gt; A.O. Scott mused that the film's tone "ranges from stoic to diffident to quizzical, at least on the surface. But there is an undercurrent of deep and complicated feeling beneath the Scottish reserve; it is signalled by the music, and by Ms. Scherfig's exquisite sense of nuance." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=A. O. |last=Scott |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9404E0DC133EF931A25750C0A9629C8B63 |title=Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself |newspaper=The New York Times |date=12 March 2004 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film found Scherfig working closely with the prolific writer [[Anders Thomas Jensen]] in developing a screenplay. It also allowed her to align her work with the production companies Sigma Films and Zentropa. Although well received, ''Wilbur'' was not as commercially successful as ''Italian for Beginners'', although it did act as a catalyst for a ''Dogme 95'' related project called the "Advance Party," in which both Scherfig and Jensen helped write characters for [[Lars Von Trier]].&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt;

As with ''Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself'', Scherfig wrote and directed another character focused film: ''[[Just like Home (2007 film)|Just Like Home]]'', released in 2007. In this comedic endeavour, set in a little town, several characters unite to discover who could be causing commotion in the streets at night. The movie concerns itself primarily with the various citizens of the town and their interactions with each other. In the style of constraints learned by being involved in the ''Dogme 95'', Scherfig claims that the film was written piece by piece every day it was shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/2008/justlikehome.shtml |title=Just Like Home (2008), Lone Scherfig, Lars Kaalund, Bodil Jorgensen, DVD review |work=Combustible Celluloid |date=26 April 2008 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further proving Scherfig's fascination with lighthearted and sweet affairs, she has claimed the story is "about trust...the fundamental belief that people you hardly know will want the best for you." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fest08.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=46 |title=Just Like Home |work=San Francisco International Film Festival |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received very little commercial or critical spotlight, instead acting as a bridge between Scherfig's earlier experiments and her more American successes.

=== 2010s: Further success, ''An Education'' ===
In 2009, ''[[An Education]]'', Scherfig's most critically lauded film, was released. Written by esteemed fiction author [[Nick Hornby]], the movie was based on journalist Lynn Barber's experiences as a teenager in post-war Britain. The film's story follows 16-year-old Jenny (played by [[Carey Mulligan]]) as she is picked up one rainy night by David (played by [[Peter Sarsgaard]]), and brought into the bustling and exciting London society. Centered on this tender and somewhat morally ambiguous romantic relationship between David and Jenny, the movie was hailed as being subtle and deliberate in its pacing and tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091021/REVIEWS/910219994 |title=An Education |work=Rogerebert.com |accessdate=18 May 2012 |date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many reviewers noted the exceptional performance of Carey Mulligan as the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/an-education/4498 |title=An Education: Film Review |work=Slant Magazine |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to gain a nomination from the Academy Awards, as did the film itself (for Best Picture) and Nick Hornby (for his Adapted Screenplay).&lt;ref name="imdb-awards"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1174732/awards |title=An Education: Awards |date=5 February 2010 |work=IMDb |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On making the film, Scherfig has talked about her focus on the theme of being an American teenager examined throughout the story, saying, "my guess is about America is that it’s this combination of innocence and freedom that attracts you. Here in Denmark, as well, it was more liberated than it is now, and was definitely more innocent and less dangerous. I mean, when I was a teenager, the world was a lot safer than it is now for my daughter as a teenager, which meant that I could have a lot more fun. It wasn’t risky the way it is now." She has also discussed the pleasures of working in a more collaborative spirit for this movie, commenting that the movie was "the same piece that we [were] all working on, and that was really important to me as a director that everyone was making the same film, that everyone contributed to the package and tried to strengthen it and get as many facets as possible but not be over-inventive, [to] just tell the story as well as we possibly could." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.hulu.com/2009/11/17/an-education/ |title=Exclusive Interview: Director Lone Scherfig, "An Education" |first=Rebecca |last=Harper |work=Hulu.com |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming off the success of ''An Education'', Scherfig had many opportunities to develop a more expansive American career in filmmaking.

Scherfig's next film titled ''[[One Day (2011 film)|One Day]]'', released in 2011, follows the lives of two romantically engaged individuals as they intersect one day each year. Based on a novel and then adapted by [[David Nicholls (writer)|David Nicholls]], the movie marks a more obvious turning point for Scherfig's career in reaching a mildly larger audience than any of her previous films. The plot and story of the movie has been commented on being somewhat simple and predictable, but critics were also aware of Scherfig's ability to give the dialogue and tone of the film a distinct freshness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110817/REVIEWS/110819983 |title=One Day |first=Roger |last=Ebert |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=18 May 2012 |date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading actors [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Jim Sturgess]] both lent the film access to a wider audience. Scherfig herself had stated expressly her interest in working with Hathaway on this project. She has also commented on the difficulties of working with someone else's screenplay, saying in an interview that:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s so much easier to work with something you’ve written, because you can cut things or add things on the spot. You can be much more at home and at ease with what you do. You don’t feel unfaithful to the writer because there is no writer. Most of the other films I’ve done I’ve co-written, and I prefer it. But having said that, when you work with someone else’s characters, you get a lot of gifts. You get an entire world, you get to portray people that you couldn’t have made up, and entire worlds that are fascinating because they are not yours. It’s much harder, I really think it’s much harder &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thescorecardreview.com/articles/interviews/2011/08/26/one-day-interview-with-director-lone-scherfig/23868 |title='One Day' interview with director Lone Scherfig |date=26 August 2011 |work=The Scorecard Review |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Lone Scherfig, Director.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Scherfig at the 2017 [[Miami International Film Festival]]]]
Ultimately, the film was a moderate success commercially, grossing over $56 million worldwide on a $15 million budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1563738/ |title=One Day |date=19 August 2011 |work=IMDb |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also furthered Scherfig's career and her capacity to reach a broader audience.

Scherfig worked as a consultant writer for the Danish film ''Alting'', and has worked on other projects (such as ''[[Red Road (film)|Red Road]]'' and ''Donkeys'') in helping write and develop characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0771054/ |title=Lone Scherfig |work=IMDb.com |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her most recent work is ''[[The Riot Club]]'', based on the stage play ''[[Posh (play)|Posh]]'' by [[Laura Wade]], released in 2014. The film follows two first-year students amongst the privileged elite of Oxford University, determined to join the infamous Riot Club, where reputations can be made or destroyed over the course of a single evening. Universal Pictures distributed the film in the UK and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/cannes/upi-gets-posh-as-cast-gathers/5056447.article |title=Universal takes UK, Irish rights to Lone Scherfig's Posh |work=[[Screendaily]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and nominations ==
''Kaj's fodselsdag'' won both the Club Espace Award and the Grand Jury Prize at the Rouen Nordic Film Festival in 1991. ''Nar mor kommer hjem'' won the Cinekid Film Award in 1998.

At the Berlin International Film Festival, ''Italian for Beginners'' won the FIPRESCI Prize, the Prize of Ecumenical Jury, the Reader Jury of the "Berliner Morgenpost," and the Silver Berlin Bear, and was nominated for the Golden Berlin Bear. It was also nominated for a Bodil (as was ''Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself'' and ''An Education''). ''Italian for Beginners'' was nominated at the Chicago International Film Festival, the European Film Awards, the Goya Awards, and picked up awards at Bordeaux International Festival of Women in Cinema, the Festróia-Tróia International Film Festival, the Flaiano Film Festival, the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Paris Film Festival, the Robert Festival, the Valladolid Film Festival, and the Warsaw International Film Festival.

''Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself'' garnered nominations from the British Independent Film Awards, the Chlotudis Awards, the Robert Festival, the Valladolid Film Festival, and came in second place at the Emden International Film Festival. It took home awards at the Festróia-Tróia International Film Festival, the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Skip City International D-Cinema Festival, the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, and the Victoria Independent Film &amp; Video Festival in Canada.

Although ''Just Like Home'' was shunned by critics, Scherfig's fourth film was offered the most recognition. ''An Education'' was nominated at the BAFTA Awards, the British Independent Film Awards, the European Film Awards, the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards, the Satellite Awards, and the Academy Awards. It won various awards at the Chicago International Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Awards, the Mill Valley Film Festival, the Robert Festival, and the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0771054/awards |title=Lone Scherfig: Awards |work=IMDb.com |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sona''' (sing. Lusona) drawing is an [[Ideogram|ideographic]] tradition known across eastern [[Angola]], northwestern [[Zambia]] and adjacent areas of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and is mainly practiced by the [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] and [[Luchazi language|Luchazi]] people.{{sfn|Gerhard Kubik|2006|p=1}} These ideographs function as [[Mnemonic|mnemonic devices]] to record proverbs, fables, games, riddles and animals, and to transmit knowledge.&lt;ref name="Elsevier BV 1991 pp. 198–198"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On mathematical elements in the Tchokwe "Sona" tradition Gerdes, Paulus. 1990. For the Learning of Mathematics10(1), 31–34 | journal=Historia Mathematica | volume=18 | issue=2 | year=1991 | issn=0315-0860 | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(91)90542-6 | url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4273355/FID840/eqtyres/erg/111361/1361.htm | pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

According to ethnologist [[Gerhard Kubik]], this tradition must be ancient and certainly pre-colonial, as observers independently collected the same ideographs among peoples separated for generations. Additionally, early [[petroglyphs]] from the [[Zambezi|Upper Zambezi]] area in Angola and Citundu-Hulu in the [[Moçâmedes Desert]] exhibit structural similarities with lusona ideographs.{{sfn|Gerhard Kubik|2006|p=229}} Those petroglyphs date from a period between the 6th century BC and the 1st-century BC.{{sfn|José Redinha|1948}}

== Usage ==

Sona ideographs are sometimes used as murals, and most of the time executed in the sand. To make them, drawing experts — after cleaning and smoothing the ground — would impress equidistant dots and draw a continuous line between them. The dots can represent trees, persons or animals, while the lines can represent paths, rivers, fences, walls, contours of a body, etc.&lt;ref name="Hodder2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=I. Hodder|title=The Meanings of Things: Material Culture and Symbolic Expression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0cVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213|date=12 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-76232-4|page=210–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical properties ==

The mathematical ideas exhibited by those ideographs are [[Transformation geometry|transformational geometry]], [[abstract algebra]] and linear algebra. 80% are symmetric and 60% are mono-linear.&lt;ref name="NessFarenga2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Ness|author2=Stephen J. Farenga|author3=Salvatore G. Garofalo|title=Spatial Intelligence: Why It Matters from Birth through the Lifespan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HC8lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=12 May 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-53118-0|page=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an example of the use of a coordinate system and geometric algorithms.&lt;ref name="Elsevier BV 1991 pp. 198–198"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On mathematical elements in the Tchokwe "Sona" tradition Gerdes, Paulus. 1990. For the Learning of Mathematics10(1), 31–34 | journal=Historia Mathematica | volume=18 | issue=2 | year=1991 | issn=0315-0860 | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(91)90542-6 | url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4273355/FID840/eqtyres/erg/111361/1361.htm | pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geometric algorithms ===

Sona drawings can be classified by the algorithms used for their construction. Paulus Gerdes identified six algorithms, most commonly the "plaited-mat" algorithm, which seems to have been inspired by mat weaving.{{sfn|Paulus Gerdes|1999|p=163-167}}

=== Chaining rules and theorems ===

Various studies suggest that the drawing experts knew specific rules of "chaining" and "elimination" relating to the systematic construction of monolinear figures. Studies suggest that the "drawing experts" who invented these rules knew why they were valid, and could prove in one way or another the validity of the theorems that these rules express.&lt;ref name="Gerdes 1994 pp. 345–376"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerdes | first=Paulus | title=On mathematics in the history of Sub-Saharan Africa | journal=Historia Mathematica | volume=21 | issue=3 | year=1994 | issn=0315-0860 | doi=10.1006/hmat.1994.1029 | page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to find accounts of theorems developed by the drawing experts to generalize specific patterns relating to dimension and monolinearity/polylinearity,&lt;ref name="NessFarenga2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Ness|author2=Stephen J. Farenga|author3=Salvatore G. Garofalo|title=Spatial Intelligence: Why It Matters from Birth through the Lifespan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HC8lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=12 May 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-53118-0|page=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this tradition was secret and in extinction when it started to be recorded.

However, the drawing experts possibly knew that rectangles with relatively prime dimensions give one-line drawings. This idea is supported by the fact that of the 30 smallest relatively prime rectangular shapes, 75% appears among the documented drawings. It is further possible that they knew that if a square of a dot is added to a one-line lusona, the lusona would still be mono-linear. It seems clear that they had experimentally discovered this fact for 2 X 2 squares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.beloit.edu/computerscience/faculty/chavey/sona/ |title=Sona Geometry |last=Chavey |first=Darrah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maud Kathleen Lewis''' ([[née]] '''Dowley'''; March 7, 1903 – July 30, 1970) was a Canadian [[folk artist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metronews.ca/news/ottawa/2015/09/14/antiques-roadshow-style-open-house-comes-to-ottawa.htmlAntiques Roadshow-style drop-in comes to Ottawa Art Gallery"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Ottawa Metro''. Haley Ritchie, Sep 14 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/the-snow-queen-takes-on-canadian-twist-1.2860425 "'The Snow Queen' takes on Canadian twist"]. ''CBC News'' Dec 04, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Nova Scotia]]. Living in poverty with her husband in a small house in [[Marshalltown, Nova Scotia]], most of her life, she achieved national recognition in 1964 and 1965. Several books, plays and films have since been produced about her. Lewis remains one of Canada's best-known folk artists. Her works and the restored Maud Lewis House are displayed in the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]].

==Early life==
Lewis was born Maud Kathleen Dowley on March 7, 1903 in [[South Ohio, Nova Scotia|South Ohio]], Nova Scotia, the daughter of John and Agnes (Germain) Dowley.&lt;ref name="AGN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maud Lewis|url=http://www.artgalleryofnovascotia.ca/maud-lewis|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.novascotiagenealogy.com/ItemView.aspx?ImageFile=88-857&amp;Event=marriage&amp;ID=232219 Nova Scotia Historical Vital Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; She had one brother. Dowley suffered from juvenile [[rheumatoid arthritis]], which reduced her mobility, especially in her hands. Dowley was introduced to art by her mother, who instructed her in the making of watercolour Christmas cards to sell.&lt;ref name="Maud Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digby County: A Journey Through Time|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?id=story_line&amp;lg=English&amp;fl=0&amp;ex=00000443&amp;sl=8547&amp;pos=1|website=www.virtualmuseum.ca|publisher=Virtual Museum Canada|accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her artistic career by selling hand-drawn and painted Christmas cards. 

Maud became involved with Emery Allen, also of Digby, who has been described as the love of her life. She gave birth to their daughter, Catherine Dowley, in 1928 out of wedlock. Allen abandoned Dowley and their daughter. Maud continued to live at home with her parents. It was arranged by the court for her daughter Catherine to be adopted, as Dowley had no way to support her. Later in life Catherine married Paul Muise and had her own family; they lived in Nova Scotia and Ontario. She apparently tried to contact her mother, but was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Woolaver, ''Maud Lewis: The Heart on the Door'' (Spencer Publishing, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, her father John died and in 1937, her mother Agnes died.&lt;ref name="AGN" /&gt; As was typical of the time, her brother inherited the family home. After living with her brother for a short while, Dowley moved to [[Digby, Nova Scotia]] to live with her aunt.&lt;ref name="AGN" /&gt;

==Marriage==
When Dowley was 34, she married Everett Lewis, a fish peddler from [[Marshalltown, Nova Scotia|Marshalltown]], on January 16, 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digbycourier.ca/Living/2014-06-07/article-3755305/Yarmouth-promoting-its-Maud-Lewis/1 "Yarmouth promoting its Maud Lewis"]. John DeMings, ''Digby Courier'', on June 07, 2014 &lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as the watchman at the county Poor Farm. According to Everett, Maud Dowley showed up at his door step in response to an advertisement he had posted in the local stores for a "live-in or keep house" for a forty-year-old bachelor. Several weeks later, they married.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

They lived in Everett's one-room house with a sleeping loft in Marshalltown, a few miles west of Digby. Maud used this house as her studio. Everett took care of the housework.&lt;ref name="The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolaver|first1=Lance|title=The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis|date=1995|publisher=Nimbus Publishing Limited|location=Halifax|isbn=1-55109-176-3|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and her husband lived mostly in poverty in the one-room house. After their deaths, the house was purchased by a local group. It was acquired by the province and transferred to the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]. They had the tiny house restored and it is now part of a permanent display on Maud Lewis and her works.

Maud Lewis accompanied her husband on his daily rounds peddling fish door-to-door, bringing along Christmas cards that she had drawn. She would sell the cards for twenty-five cents each. These cards proved popular with her husband's customers, and she began painting. Everett encouraged Lewis to paint, and he bought her her first set of oils.&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;

She expanded her range, using other surfaces for painting, such as pulp boards ([[beaverboard]]s), cookie sheets, and [[Masonite]]. Lewis was a prolific artist and also painted on more or less every available surface in their tiny home: walls, doors, breadboxes, and even the stove.

Maud Lewis used bright colours in her paintings, and subjects were often flowers or animals, including oxen teams, horses, birds, deer, or cats. Many of her paintings are of outdoor scenes, including Cape Island boats bobbing on the water, horses pulling a sleigh, skaters, and portraits of dogs, cats, deer, birds, and cows. Her paintings were inspired by childhood memories of the landscape and people around [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] and South Ohio, as well as Digby locations, such as [[Point Prim Lighthouse|Point Prim]] and Bayview. Commercial Christmas cards and calendars also influenced her. 

Most of her paintings are quite small - often no larger than eight by ten inches, although she is known to have done at least five paintings 24&amp;nbsp;inches by 36&amp;nbsp;inches. The size was limited by the extent she could move her arms, which had been affected by arthritis. She used mostly wallboard and tubes of Tinsol, an oil-based paint. Lewis' technique consisted of first coating the board with white, then drawing an outline, and applying paint directly out of the tube. She never blended or mixed colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women's work : a selection of work by 4 significant Nova Scotia artists : Maria Morris, Alice Hagen, Maud Lewis, Suzanne Swannie.|journal=Mount Saint Vincent University. Art Gallery.|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Maud Lewis paintings from the 1940s are quite rare. A large collection of Lewis' work can be found in the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] (AGNS). The AGNS occasionally displays the Chaplin/Wennerstrom shutters (now part of the Clearwater Fine Foods Inc. collection). This collection comprises twenty-two exterior house shutters that Lewis painted in the early 1940s. The work was done for some Americans who owned a cottage on the [[Southern Nova Scotia|South Shore]]. Most of the shutters are quite large, at 5&amp;nbsp;ft x 1&amp;nbsp;ft.6&amp;nbsp;inches. Lewis was paid 70 cents a shutter.

Between 1945 and 1950, people began to stop at Lewis' Marshalltown home on [[Nova Scotia Trunk 1|Highway No. 1]], the main highway and tourist route in western Nova Scotia. They bought her paintings for two or three dollars each. Only in the last three or four years of Lewis' life did her paintings begin to sell for seven to ten dollars. She achieved national attention as a folk artist following an article in the Toronto-based ''[[Star Weekly]]'' in 1964. In 1965, she was featured on CBC-TV's ''[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube | id=ryqC0Tz5N4Q | title= '''CBC ''Telescope''''' (1965).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Lewis' paintings were ordered by the [[White House]] in the 1970s during [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolaver|first1=Lance|title=The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis|date=1995|publisher=Nimbus Publishing/Art Gallery of Nova Scotia|isbn=1-55109-176-3|page=XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, her arthritis limited her ability to complete many of the orders that had come from her national recognition. 

In the early 21st century, her paintings have sold at auction for ever increasing prices. Two of her paintings have sold for more than $16,000. The highest auction price so far is $22,200.00 for lot 196 ''A Family Outing''. The painting was sold at a Bonham's auction in Toronto on November 30, 2009. Another painting, ''A View of Sandy Cove'', sold in 2012 for $20,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnard|first1=Elissa|title=Maud Lewis work fetches $20,000|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/201208-maud-lewis-work-fetches-20000|work=Halifax Chronicle-Herald|date=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painting found in 2016 at an Ontario thrift store, ''Portrait of Eddie Barnes and Ed Murphy, Lobster Fishermen'', sold at auction for almost three times its estimated price.

==Later life and death==
In the last year of her life, Maud Lewis stayed in one corner of her house, painting as often as she could while traveling back and forth to the hospital for treatment of health issues. She died in Digby on July 30, 1970 from pneumonia.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevanguard.ca/Living/2015-08-04/article-4235517/Ferry-carried-21,000-passengers-between-Yarmouth-and-Portland-in-July-1970/1 "45 Years ago"]. ''The Vanguard''. Eric Bourque, 04 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband Everett was killed in 1979 by a burglar during an attempted robbery at the small house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolaver|first1=Lance|title=The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis|date=1995|publisher=Nimbus Publishing/Art Gallery of Nova Scotia|isbn=1-55109-176-3|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honours==
*After Everett Lewis died, the painted house began to deteriorate. A group of concerned citizens from the Digby area started the Maud Lewis Painted House Society; their goal was to save this landmark. In 1984, the house was sold to the [[Province of Nova Scotia]] and transferred to the care of [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] (AGNS) in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].&lt;ref name="AGN" /&gt; The AGNS restored the house and installed it as the Maud Lewis House in the gallery, as part of a permanent Lewis exhibit.&lt;ref name="AGN" /&gt; 

*A steel memorial sculpture based on her house has been erected at the original homesite in Marshalltown. It was designed by architect [[Brian MacKay-Lyons]].&lt;ref name="replica"/&gt; 
*A replica of the Maud Lewis House was built in 1999 by retired fisherman Murray Ross, complete with finished interior. It is located a few kilometres north of Marshalltown on the road to [[Digby Neck]] in Seabrook.&lt;ref name="replica"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitehead|first1=Jeanne|title=Renewed appreciation for Maud Lewis replica|url=http://www.digbycourier.ca/Living/2008-12-03/article-610631/Renewed-appreciation-for-Maud-Lewis-replica/1|accessdate=5 March 2016|work=The Digby Courier|date=Dec 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further reading and other media==
Maud Lewis is the subject of a book by [[Lance Woolaver]], ''The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis'', and three [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentaries: ''Maud Lewis - A World Without Shadows'' (1976),&lt;ref name=withoutshadows&gt;{{cite web|title=Maud Lewis: A World Without Shadows|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/maud_lewis_a_world_without_shadows/|work=Online documentary|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=18 March 2011|format=Requires [[Adobe Flash]]|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis'' (1998), and ''I Can Make Art ... Like Maud Lewis'' (2005). The latter is a short film in which a group of Grade 6 students are inspired by Lewis' work to create their own folk art painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/i_can_make_art_like_maud_lewis|title=I Can Make Art ...

*In 2009, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, in conjunction with Greg Thompson Productions, produced a new play about Lewis on stage at the AGNS. ''A Happy Heart: The Maud Lewis Story'' was written and produced by Greg Thompson, who had produced ''Marilyn: Forever Blonde'' at the AGNS in January 2008. Thompson wrote the one-woman play about Lewis while in Nova Scotia in 2008. The play ran until October 25, 2009.

*Screenwriter [[Sherry White]] wrote a script for a feature dramatic film about Lewis, entitled ''[[Maudie (film)|Maudie]]'' (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maudie explores folk artist’s love for another N.S. outsider|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/1271535-maudie-explores-folk-artist%E2%80%99s-love-for-another-n.s.-outsider|work=Halifax Chronicle-Herald|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maudie'' made its Canadian debut at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]].

'''Morellato Group''' is an Italian [[corporate group]] that designs and manufactures [[design]] [[jewellery]] and [[watches]]. The group's parent company was founded by [[Giulio Morellato]] initially in [[Bologna]] and later was moved to near [[Padova]]. Morellato is Italy's largest Italian-jewelers-only group, its products are all 100% made in Italy (2013).&lt;ref name="reuters idUSBRE98703K20130908"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-morellato-idUSBRE98703K20130908 |title=Italy's Morellato not for sale, eyes other domestic brands: CEO |website=Reuters.com |date=8 September 2013 |author=Agnieszka Flak |access-date=28 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Morellato started operations in the 1930s as a maker of maker of watch straps.&lt;ref name="reuters idUSBRE98703K20130908"/&gt;

In 1990, Massimo Carraro  bought the small family watchmaking business from his father and two partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond2.ca/transformation-morellato-group-sector-watches/ |title=The Transformation of Morellato Group and Sector Watches |website=Diamond2.ca |date=9 June 2014 |access-date=28 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Morellato signed an alliance with Spanish watchmaker [[Geresa]], making the new joint-venture Spain's second biggest watchmaker, after [[Rolex]]. The two companies invested $70 million in the new venture. Through that deal, Morellato gots Geresa's distribution networks, but 50% of Morellato Group's holding company (Morellato &amp;Sector S.A) became the property of Geresa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.es/catalunya/economia/20140409/abci-morellato-group-geresa-alian-201404092017.html |title=Morellato Group y Geresa se alían en el mercado español de relojería y joyas |website=Abc.es |date=9 April 2014 |language=es |access-date=28 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Morellato Group and [[Pepe Jeans]] London signed an agreement for the production and worldwide distribution of watches Pepe Jeans London branded that started during the fall of 2014.

In 2015, Morellato partnered with [[Trussardi]] to create the ''T01 collection''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150712/fashion-beauty/timeless-style-artisan-details.576460 |title=Timeless style, artisan details |website=Timesofmalta.com |date=12 July 2015 |access-date=28 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nerikomi''''' (練り込み , lit. "kneading") is an artistic technique for creating [[Japanese pottery]] [[agateware]].  The name derives from the traditional technique of creating patterns with colored [[clay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://the-empty-vessel.blogspot.com/2007/01/nerikomi.html&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is also called '''''neriage''''' (練上げ).&lt;ref&gt;http://galleryjapan.com/locale/en_US/technique/ceramics/10108/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ceramicartsdaily.org/pottery-making-techniques/wheel-throwing-techniques/you-say-neriage-i-say-nerikomino-matter-what-you-call-it-mixing-colored-clays-makes-for-gorgeous-pottery-surfaces/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Nerikomi'' is a contemporary Japanese term. Marbling ceramic techniques were used in Egypt and China and through the Romans to the West. Early ceramics in the [[Stoke-on-Trent]] use more than one colour of clay for decorative effect. In England this was referred to as [[agateware]]. In Japan there are a few pieces from the [[Momoyama period]], and [[Edo period]], as well as ''[[Mingei]]'' and there was an explosion of it from about 1978–1995 due probably to Aida Yusuke's advertising and to Matsui Kousei who refers to his work as ''neriage''. 

The term started being used in the 1970s to describe related kanji ''neriage''. [[Yusuke Aida]] was on a television commercial for [[Nescafé]] and it seems to have entered the vocabulary at about that time when his nerikomi coffee cups were available to the first people contacting the advertisers.

It was used in the [[Tang Dynasty]] in 7th century [[China]] there are at least two Chinese characters to describe variations of this technique (one surface, one structural).&lt;ref&gt;http://gingerbreadsquaregallery.com/ArtGlass/Thivo/Thivo-bio/thivo-bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://iweb.tntech.edu/wpitelka/gallery/techniques/techniques.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Slabs of different clays or clays colored with stains or oxides, are stacked, folded, pressed into logs, sliced, and arranged to form a vessel.  In this way, the numerous stacked layers appear as fine undulating lines embedded in a surrounding color in the finished vessel.&lt;ref&gt;http://ceramicartsdaily.org/ceramic-supplies/ceramic-colorants-ceramic-supplies-2/creating-neriage-blocks-decorating-with-colored-clay-patterns/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orthographic projection''' (sometimes '''orthogonal projection'''), is a means of representing [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] objects in [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensions]]. It is a form of [[parallel projection]], in which all the projection lines are [[orthogonal]] to the [[projection plane]],&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Maynard | first = Patric | title = Drawing distinctions: the varieties of graphic expression | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 22 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y_YqOlXoxMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic | isbn = 0-8014-7280-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in every plane of the scene appearing in [[affine transformation]] on the viewing surface. The obverse of an orthographic projection is an [[oblique projection]], which is a parallel projection in which the projection lines are ''not'' orthogonal to the projection plane.

The term ''orthographic'' is sometimes reserved specifically for depictions of objects where the principal axes or planes of the object are also parallel with the projection plane,&lt;ref name="maynard"/&gt; but these are better known as ''[[multiview projection]]s''. Furthermore, when the principal planes or axes of an object in an orthographic projection are ''not'' parallel with the projection plane, but are rather tilted to reveal multiple sides of the object, the projection is called an ''[[axonometric projection]]''. Sub-types of ''multiview projection'' include ''plans'', ''elevations'' and ''sections''. Sub-types of ''axonometric projection'' include ''isometric'', ''dimetric'' and ''trimetric projections''.

A lens providing an orthographic projection is known as an [[Telecentric lens#Object-space telecentric lenses|object-space telecentric lens]].

A simple orthographic [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] onto the [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] ''z'' = 0 can be defined by the following matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

For each point ''v'' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;), the transformed point would be
:&lt;math&gt;
Pv = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\ v_y \\ v_z
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\ v_y \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Often, it is more useful to use [[homogeneous coordinates]].  The transformation above can be represented for homogeneous coordinates as 
:&lt;math&gt;
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

For each homogeneous vector ''v'' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1), the transformed vector would be
:&lt;math&gt;
Pv = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\ v_y \\ v_z \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\ v_y \\ 0 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[computer graphics]],  one of the most common matrices used for orthographic [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] can be defined by a [[n-tuple|6-tuple]], (''left'', ''right'', ''bottom'', ''top'', ''near'', ''far''), which defines the [[Clipping_(computer_graphics)|clipping]] planes.  These planes form a box with the minimum corner at (''left'', ''bottom'', -''near'') and the maximum corner at (''right'', ''top'', -''far'').

The box is translated so that its center is at the origin, then it is scaled to the unit cube which is defined by having a minimum corner at (-1,-1,-1) and a maximum corner at (1,1,1).

The orthographic transform can be given by the following matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{right-left} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{right+left}{right-left} \\
0 &amp; \frac{2}{top-bottom} &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{top+bottom}{top-bottom} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{-2}{far-near} &amp; -\frac{far+near}{far-near} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be given as a [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] followed by a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
P = ST = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{right-left} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \frac{2}{top-bottom} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{2}{far-near} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{left+right}{2} \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{top+bottom}{2} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; -\frac{far+near}{2} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The inversion of the Projection Matrix, which can be used as the Unprojection Matrix is defined:

&lt;math&gt;
P^{-1} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{right-left}{2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{left+right}{2} \\
0 &amp; \frac{top-bottom}{2} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{top+bottom}{2} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{far-near}{-2} &amp;  -\frac{far+near}{2} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

{{main|Multiview projection|Axonometric projection}}
[[Image:Convention placement vues dessin technique.svg|thumb|right|Symbols used to define whether a ''multiview projection'' is either third-angle (right) or first-angle (left).]]
With ''multiview projections'', up to six pictures of an object are produced, with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: ''first-angle'' or ''third-angle'' projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being ''projected'' onto planes that form a six-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, usually three views of a drawing give enough information to make a three-dimensional object. These views are known as ''front view'', ''top view'' and ''end view''. Other names for these views include ''plan'', ''elevation'' and ''section''.

The term ''axonometric projection'' (not to be confused with the related ''[[axonometry|principle of axonometry]]'', as described in [[Pohlke's theorem]]) is used to describe the type of orthographic projection where the plane or axis of the object depicted is ''not'' parallel to the projection plane, and where multiple sides of an object are visible in the same image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mitchell | first = William |author2=Malcolm McCullough | title = Digital design media | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | date = 1994 | pages = 169 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JrZoGgQEhKkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-471-28666-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further subdivided into three groups: ''isometric'', ''dimetric'' and ''trimetric projection'', depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal.&lt;ref name="maynard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcreynolds"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4eYq7-2YhYC&amp;pg=PA502&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Advanced graphics programming using openGL|last=McReynolds|first=Tom|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=1-55860-659-9|pages=502|author2=David Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical characteristic of axonometric projection (and other pictorials) is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical.

== Cartography ==
{{main|Orthographic projection in cartography}}
[[File:Orthographic projection SW.jpg|thumb|right|Orthographic projection (equatorial aspect) of eastern hemisphere 30°W&amp;ndash;150°E]]
An orthographic projection map is a [[map projection]] of [[cartography]]. Like the [[stereographic projection]] and [[gnomonic projection]], orthographic projection is a [[perspective projection|perspective (or azimuthal) projection]], in which the [[sphere]] is projected onto a [[tangent plane]] or [[secant plane]].  The ''point of perspective'' for the orthographic projection is at [[Infinity|infinite]] distance.  It depicts a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] of the [[globe]] as it appears from [[outer space]], where the [[horizon]] is a [[great circle]].  The shapes and areas are [[Distortion#Map projections|distorted]], particularly near the edges.&lt;ref name="SnyderWorkingManual"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Snyder, J. P.| title=Map Projections—A Working Manual (US Geologic Survey Professional Paper 1395) | publisher=US Government Printing Office | location=Washington, D.C.| year=1987 | pages=145–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder16"&gt;Snyder, John P. (1993). ''Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections'' pp. 16–18. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-76746-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The orthographic projection has been known since antiquity, with its cartographic uses being well documented. [[Hipparchus]] used the projection in the 2nd century BC to determine the places of star-rise and star-set. In about 14 BC, Roman engineer [[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] used the projection to construct sundials and to compute sun positions.&lt;ref name="Snyder16"&gt;Snyder, John P. (1993). ''Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections'' pp. 16–18. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-76746-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitruvius also seems to have devised the term orthographic (from the Greek ''orthos'' (= “straight”) and graphē (= “drawing”) for the projection. However, the name ''[[analemma]]'', which also meant a sundial showing latitude and longitude, was the common name until [[François d'Aguilon]] of Antwerp promoted its present name in 1613.&lt;ref name="Snyder16"/&gt;

The earliest surviving maps on the projection appear as woodcut drawings of terrestrial globes of 1509 (anonymous), 1533 and 1551 (Johannes Schöner), and 1524 and 1551 (Apian).&lt;ref name="Snyder16"/&gt;

'''Paul Souriau''' (1852–1926) was a [[France|French]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] known for his works on [[Invention|invention theory]] and [[aesthetics]].

He studied at the [[École normale supérieure]] where he wrote a [[thesis or dissertation|doctoral thesis]] entitled ''Théorie de l'invention'' published in 1881. In his thesis, he argues that inventions are not the result of a rigorous scientific method but rather come as a [[Determinism|deterministic]] consequence of a set of conditions in which the inventor lives. This theory was contested very soon after its publication in the 1882 edition of the ''Revue Internationale de l'Enseignement''.&lt;ref&gt;Société de l'enseignement supérieur (1882) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TdfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=th%C3%A9orie%20de%20l'invention%20souriau&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PR8#v=onepage&amp;q=th%C3%A9orie%20de%20l'invention%20souriau&amp;f=false Revue internationale de l'enseignement, Volume 3], G. Masson, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1882 his wife gave birth to [[Étienne Souriau]], who also became a philosopher in [[aesthetics]]. The French thesis was created simultaneously with a [[Latin]] thesis titled ''De motus perceptione''. The Latin thesis emphasized the importance of vision in movement perception, hence the initial title ''De visione motus''.&lt;ref&gt;Guyard MM. S., Havet L., Monod G., Paris G. (1882) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8fbUAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=th%C3%A9orie%20de%20l'invention&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=souriau&amp;f=false Revue critique d'histoire et de littérature, Volume 1], Ernest Leroux, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis was a precursor for his later works on movement perception.

He became a professor at the Faculté des Lettres de [[Lille]] (now [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]]) very soon after its foundation in 1887. In 1889, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of movement.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1889) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j7YRAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false L'esthétique du mouvement], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The book described two levels of movement [[aesthetics]]: the mechanical beauty (the adaptation of the movement to fulfil its goal) and the movement expression (the meaning of the movement for an observer). By doing so Souriau distinguished movement from perception of movement, two concepts which later became the subjects of studies of [[motor cognition]] and [[psychophysics]].

Throughout his career, but more particularly during the first decade of the 20th century, he published his reflections on the [[aesthetics]] of arts while being a professor at [[Henri Poincaré University]] ([[Nancy, France|Nancy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1901) [https://archive.org/stream/limaginationdel00sourgoog#page/n12/mode/1up L'imagination de l'artiste], Librairie Hachette et Cie, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1904) [https://archive.org/stream/labeautrationne01sourgoog#page/n10/mode/1up La beauté rationnelle], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1906) [https://archive.org/stream/larverieesthtiq01sourgoog#page/n9/mode/1up La rêverie esthétique: essai sur la psychologie du poète], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1909) [https://archive.org/stream/lasuggestiondans00souruoft#page/n9/mode/2up La suggestion dans l'art], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, [[Félix Alcan]] was his main editor.

[[File:Victor Hugo.jpg|thumb|Photogravure of [[Victor Hugo]], 1883]]

'''Photogravure''' is an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printmaking]] or photo-mechanical process whereby a copper plate is grained (adding a pattern to the plate) and then coated with a light-sensitive gelatin tissue which had been exposed to a film positive, and then [[etching|etched]], resulting in a high quality [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] plate that can reproduce detailed continuous tones of a photograph.

== History ==
[[File:W.E.F. Britten - Alfred, Lord Tennyson - St. Simeon Stylites.jpg|thumb|A 1901 photogravure illustration by [[William Edward Frank Britten|W. E. F. Britten]] for [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s poem ''St. Simeon Stylites''.]]

The earliest forms of photogravure were developed by two original pioneers of [[History of photography|photography]] itself, first [[Nicéphore Niépce]] in France in the 1820s, and later [[Henry Fox Talbot]] in England. Niépce was seeking a means to create photographic images on plates that could then be etched and used to make prints on paper with a traditional printing press. Niépce's early images were among the first [[photograph]]s, pre-dating [[daguerreotype]]s and the later wet collodion photographic process. Talbot, inventor of the [[calotype]] paper [[Negative (photography)|negative]] process, wanted to make paper prints that would not fade. He worked on his photomechanical process in the 1850s and patented it in 1852 ('photographic engraving') and 1858 ('photoglyphic engraving').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foxtalbot.dmu.ac.uk/talbot/biography.html#printersink |title=Talbot's Correspondence:Biography |publisher=De Montfort University |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photogravure in its mature form was developed in 1878 by Czech painter [[Karel Klíč]], who built on Talbot's research. This process, the one still in use today, is called the Talbot-Klič process.

Because of its high quality and richness, photogravure was used for both original [[fine art]] prints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photogravure.com/history/chapter_pictorialism.html|title=Pictorialism &amp; The Photo-Secession|publisher=Katzman, Mark|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and for photo-reproduction of works from other media such as paintings. Photogravure is distinguished from [[rotogravure]] in that photogravure uses a flat [[intaglio printing|copper plate]] etched rather deeply and printed by hand, while in rotogravure, as the name implies, a rotary cylinder is only lightly etched, and it is a factory printing process for [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and packaging. In France the correct term for photogravure is ''héliogravure'', while the French term ''photogravure'' refers to any photo-based etching technique.

Photogravure registers a wide variety of tones, through the transfer of etching ink from an etched copper plate to special dampened paper run through an etching press. The unique tonal range comes from photogravure's variable depth of etch, that is, the shadows are etched many times deeper than the highlights. Unlike half-tone processes which vary the size of dot, the depth of ink wells is varied in a photogravure plate. The human eye resolves these fine variations into a continuous tone image. Photogravure practitioners such as [[Peter Henry Emerson]] and others brought the art to a high standard in the late 19th century. This continued with the work of [[Alfred Stieglitz]] in the early 20th century, especially in relation to his publication [[Camera Work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photogravure.com/history/chapter_camerawork.html|title=Camera Notes &amp; Camera Work|publisher=Katzman, Mark|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication also featured the photogravures of [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]] who was a fine gravure printer and envisioned his photographic work as gravures rather than other photo-based processes. The speed and convenience of silver-gelatin photography eventually displaced photogravure which fell into disuse after the [[Edward S. Curtis]] gravures in the 1920s. One of the last major portfolios of fine art photogravures was [[Paul Strand]]'s ''Photographs from Mexico'' from 1940, reissued as ''The Mexican Portfolio'' in 1967 by DeCapo Press. Many years later, photogravure has experienced a revival in the hands of Aperture and Jon Goodman, who studied it in Europe. Photogravure is now actively practiced in several dozen workshops around the world.

== Technique ==

Photogravure plates go through several distinct stages:

* First, a [[continuous tone]] film positive is made from the original photographic negative. A smaller negative can be enlarged onto a sheet of film, which is then processed to a range of continuous tones with specific densities.
* The second stage is to sensitize a sheet of pigmented gelatin tissue by immersion into a 3.5% solution of [[potassium dichromate]] for 3 minutes. Once dried against an [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] (Plexiglas, Perspex) surface, it is ready for the next stage.
* The third stage (usually the next day) is to expose the film positive to the sensitized gravure tissue. The positive is placed on top of the sensitized sheet of pigmented gelatin tissue. The sandwich is then exposed to [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. A separate exposure to a very fine stochastic or hard-dot [[mezzotint]] screen is made, or alternatively an [[aquatint]] grain of [[asphaltum]] or rosin is applied and fused to the copperplate usually before the exposed gelatin tissue is adhered to the plate. The UV light travels through the positive and screen (if used) in succession, each time hardening the gelatin in proportion to the degree of light exposed to it.
* The fourth stage is to adhere the exposed tissue to the copper plate. The gelatin tissue is adhered or "laid down" onto the highly polished copper plate under a layer of cool water. It is squeezed into place and the excess water is wiped clear.
* Once adhered, the fifth stage is to use a hot water bath to remove the paper backing and to wash away the softer, unexposed gelatin. The remaining depth of hardened gelatin is relative to the exposure. This layer of hardened gelatin forms a contoured resist on the copper plate. The resist is dried, and the edges and back of the copper are stopped out (staged).
* The sixth stage is to etch the plate in a series of [[ferric chloride]] baths, from the densest to slightly more dilute, in steps. The density of these baths is measured in degrees [[Baumé scale|Baumé]]. The ferric chloride migrates through the gelatin, etching the shadows and blacks under the thinnest areas first. The etching progresses through the tonal scale from dark to light as the plate is moved to successively more dilute baths of ferric chloride. The image is etched onto the copperplate by the ferric chloride, creating a gravure plate with tiny "wells" of varying depth to hold ink. The pattern formed by the aquatint grain or the screen exposure creates minute "lands" around which the etching occurs, giving the copperplate the ''tooth'' to hold ink. The "wells" which hold the ink vary in depth, a unique aspect of photogravure.
* The final stage is to print the cleaned plate.

=== Printing the plate ===

Printing a photogravure is similar to printing any other [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] plate, especially a finely etched [[aquatint]]. A stiff, oily intaglio printing ink is applied to the whole surface of the plate with a rubber brayer, or a small, stiff squeegee, or a rolled tamper. The plate is then gently wiped with tarlatans to remove the excess ink and drive it into the recesses (wells). It is finally wiped with the fatty part of the palm of the hand in quick glancing strokes. This removes all remaining ink from the polished highlights and high points and leaves ink only in the etched recesses. After the edges are cleaned, the plate is placed on the printing bed of an intaglio press. It is covered with a sheet of dampened rag paper and then two to three layers of thin wool blankets. It is then run through the press at high pressure. The high pressure pushes the fibers of the dampened paper into the wells of the plate which then transfers the ink onto the paper thereby creating the impression. The paper is carefully peeled off the plate and placed between blotters and weighted so it will dry flat. The plate can now be re-inked for another impression or it can be cleaned for storage.

Macdermid Autotype, the last manufacturer of the gelatin pigment paper (tissue) needed to make traditional copper plate photogravure, announced the end of their production in August 2009. Since then, other manufacturers, including Bostick &amp; Sullivan, Phoenix Gravure, and others in India, Taiwan, and Japan have begun supplying gelatin pigment paper (resist tissue) to the market. These products are used by practitioners of traditional photogravure etching and by commercial printers.

== Alternatives ==

=== Digital direct-to-plate photogravure ===

Donald Farnsworth at the art workshop [[Magnolia Editions]] developed a digital direct-to-plate photogravure process that does not use gelatin.  Instead, a series of 'masks' (layers of resist) are printed onto a copper plate using a flatbed UV cured acrylic printer: “The flatbed printer allows us to etch a stochastic [random] dot pattern into the plate in a completely controlled, precise way... This process is an inversion of the traditional photogravure method, where you’re etching through a sheet of gelatin, and gradually the gelatin is getting thinner and more acid reaches the plate, so the last thing that’s etched are the light tones.”&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;[http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/Content/PressRelease/Gravure_Article.pdf "Direct to Plate Photogravure: Catching Up With the Past."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714020910/http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/Content/PressRelease/Gravure_Article.pdf |date=2011-07-14 }} Stone, Nick. Retrieved 2009-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the digital direct-to-plate method requires that the light values be etched first; then the printer is used to lay down a new layer of ink onto the plate between acid baths, masking out the lighter values to protect them from subsequent etches. The initial mask looks like it has barely been printed; the masks grow in density until the plate eventually appears almost completely black.

In another variation of the traditional process, where the acid baths are increasingly watered down as the process unfolds, the direct-to-plate process begins with a weak bath and is gradually etched in baths which are increasingly acidic.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;

=== Photo-polymergravure / Polymer photogravure ===

Photopolymer plates, usually used for relief and letterpress printing, can be used to make photogravure plates.  These [[polymer]] plates, when developed, are a hard plastic, which allows for fewer impressions to be made. Some feel that they rival the quality of traditional copper plate photogravure, while others find that the lack of differential depth in the polymer coating compromises quality.

The process involves a series of exposures of the polymer plate. First, it is exposed under strong light with a random dot screen placed on top of it (called an aquatint screen in fine art printing or a stochastic screen in commercial printing). Next, the plate is exposed to a positive transparency of an image. This transparency can be a continuous tone positive on film, but is most often made as a digital 'positive' (made in the same way as a [[Digital negative (transparency)|digital negative]]) printed with an inkjet printer. The plate is then developed; for most types and brands of plates, this is done in water.

After proper drying and curing, the plate can be inked and printed. The dual exposures produce an "etched" polymer plate with many thousands of indentations of varying depth which hold ink, which in turn are transferred as a continuous tone image to a sheet of paper. Depending on the quality, the resulting print may look similar to or the same as those produced with the traditional photogravure process, though without the same amount of three-dimensional depth on the surface of the plate, and arguably, the print itself.

Two polymer plates commonly in use are Printight plates made by the [[Toyobo]] Corporation and Solarplates.

}}

'''Sally Hardesty''' (renamed '''Erin Hardesty''' in the 2003 remake) is a [[fictional character]] in [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]], created by [[Tobe Hooper]] and portrayed by actress [[Marilyn Burns]] in the original film series and [[Jessica Biel]] in the [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|2003 remake]]. Introduced in ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974), after a series of grave robberies, Hardesty, her paraplegic brother Franklin, and their friends travel across Texas to investigate upon hearing reports that her grandfather's grave may have been vandalized. She subsequently appears in the sequel ''[[Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation]]'' (1994) as a patient on a gurney. 

In the 2003 film, Hardesty is forced to face [[Leatherface]] and his cannibalistic family after picking up a distraught hitchhiker who kills herself. Originally, the remake was intended to be told in flashback format from the perspective of an aged Hardesty, with Burns set to reprise her iconic role. The plot would have revolved around the aftermath of Sally's escape with her reporting her traumatizing experience with Leatherface to the authorities. 

In academic materials, Hardesty has been regarded as one of the earliest examples of the [[final girl]] trope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3315496/marilyn-burns-first-final/|title=Marilyn Burns: The First 'Final Girl'|last=|first=|date=|website=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=|access-date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of film, Hardesty is featured in merchandise based on the films, is referenced in the [[video game]] ''[[Dead by Daylight]]'' (2017), and has a main role in the ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' novelization of the 2003 film.

==Appearances==
===''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre''===

In ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', Sally and her [[paraplegic]] brother, Franklin, travel with three friends - Jerry, Kirk, and Pam - to visit the grave of the Hardesty's grandfather after reports of grave robbing in the area. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor tells them that the pumps are empty. They continue toward the homestead, planning to return to the gas station on the way back when it has received fuel delivery. When they arrive, Kirk and Pam find a swimming-hole dried up but hear a generator running. They stumble upon a nearby house. Later, Leatherface appears and kills Franklin with a chainsaw and Sally runs to the old house. She runs upstairs and finds the desiccated bodies of an old couple. She jumps out of the second story window to escape Leatherface and runs to the gas station. 

The proprietor ties Sally up, gags her and forces her into the back of his truck and drives to the house. Sally is tied to a chair at a dinner table and Leatherface and the hitchhiker bring the desiccated body of the old man downstairs. They decide that he should be the one who should kill her. After several failed attempts of the old man trying to hit Sally with a hammer, she manages to escape and jump through the window and flee. She reaches the road and a semi-truck stops to help her but Leatherface attacks the driver. She jumps into the back of a pickup truck that stops to help her, escaping Leatherface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/576425-foraging-for-subtext-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-1974|title=Foraging For Subtext: ‘The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’ (1974)|last=|first=|date=|website=Coming Soon|publisher=|access-date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/site/203833-the-series-project-the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-part-1|title=The Series Project: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Part 1)|last=|first=|date=|website=Crave Online|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====

Although she does not physically appear in the sequel ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'' (1986), Sally's aftermath from the first film is mentioned in the introduction. The narrator states that Sally described her traumatic encounter with [[Leatherface]] and his family as feeling like she had "broken out of a window in hell", and it is revealed that she had went into [[catatonia]] after her revealing her ordeal to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oh-the-horror.com/page.php?id=618|title=Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, The (1986)|last=|first=|date=|website=oh-the-horror.com|publisher=|access-date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film identifies her as '''Sally Hardesty-Enright'''. In the intro speech for ''[[Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III]]'', the narrator states that Sally eventually died in a private health care facility in 1977. In ''[[Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation]]'' (1994), Sally is briefly shown being wheeled through a hospital on a gurney while still in a coma. [[Marilyn Burns]] reprises her role for this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://halloweenlove.com/hl-exclusive-writerdirector-kim-henkel-reveals-secrets-of-texas-chainsaw-massacre-the-next-generation/|title=HL Exclusive: Writer/Director Kim Henkel Reveals Secrets of ‘Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation’|publisher=Halloween Love|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally appears in a flashback scene in the 2013 film ''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'', which serves as a direct sequel to the 1974 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/04/texas-chainsaw-3d-review|title=Texas Chainsaw 3D Review|last=|first=|date=|website=IGN|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
While studying at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], Burns auditioned for the role of Sally when a casting call was held for ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' (1974). Burns previously met Hooper when he was kicked off the set of [[Sidney Lumet]]'s drama film ''[[Lovin' Molly]]'' (1974), in which Burns worked as a [[Stand-in|stand-in]] for [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Blythe Danner]]. Burns did most of her own stunts during filming such as jumping through the window during the ending and during the dinner scene, her finger was actually cut by a real knife with no fake blood being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/marilynburns/|title=Lady of the Chainsaw: An Interview with Marilyn Burns|last=|first=|date=January 2004|website=The Terror Trap|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://classic-horror.com/newsreel/marilyn_burns_texas_chain_saw_massacre_interview|title=Marilyn Burns ("Texas Chain Saw Massacre") Interview|last=Yapp|first=Nate|date=October 30, 2010|website=Classic-Horror.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the 2003 remake was intended to be told in flashback format with an aged Sally recounting her experience with Leatherface to authorities.

==Reception==
In ''Shocking Cinema of the Seventies'', Xavier Mendik says that "Blonde Sally survives, and she's still intact. Bruised and cut, but still intact. Her hair is matted and dirty now, her tight vest is torn, her hip-hugging jeans no so white, but she's still alive. Whether this is a good thing, she does not yet know. For now, tied up, face to face with maniacs she thought she'd never see again (Hitchhiker: "I thought you was in a hurry?!"), it is all too much. Her eyes go wide before she blacks out. And then she wakes, from one nightmare into another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shocking Cinema of the Seventies|last=Mendik|first=Xavier|publisher=Noir Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0-95365-644-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Making and Remaking Horror in the 1970s and 2000s: Why Don’t They Do It Like They Used To?'', David Roche contrasts Sally to [[Laurie Strode]] from the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' series]] stating, "All in all, Sally Hardesty and Laurie Strode have very little in common, apart from the fact that both characters survive the horror they have witnessed" and goes on to say that "Sally, the hippie, is very "feminine" and not especially heroic: she undergoes intense suffering, attempts to sell her body, and seems to lose her mind. Sally is, in effect, the most resisting body. As such, the character of Sally simultaneously enables the Family to attempt to assert its masculinity in the face of the abject female and contributes to the discovery of the instability of sexist patriarchal values by bearing witness to the way the Family's mimicry of patriarchy reveals its constructiveness;  these two functions coalesce in the shots of Sally's eyes. I would, thus, argue that the character of Sally by no means represents a feminist development, but her resilience does enable an anti-essentialist subtext to emerge to some extent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making and Remaking Horror in the 1970s and 2000s: Why Don’t They Do It Like They Used To?|last=Roche|first=David|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|year=2014|isbn=1-62674-246-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, James Rose&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|last=Rose|first=James|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781906733995|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; believes that Sally and Laurie have a lot of similarities, stating:
:"Possibly the most significant impact Hooper's film has had upon the horror genre is its sustained trauma of Sally Hardesty. The juxtaposition of her terrible plight but eventual survival seemingly reconfigured the genre and created, as Clover has termed it, the character of the Final Girl. Yet, for all her endurance, Sally is not the ''first'' Final Girl but more a survivor who stands alongside ''Halloween'''s Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis); for as much as both survive, each, in the end, requires male intervention to fully save them from the narrative's male antagonist: Sally is rescued by a passing driver, while Laurie is saved by Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance). Despite this, both Sally and Laurie combine to make manifest the key attributes of the Final Girl as both struggled, endured and, in Laurie's case, attacked their aggressor until they could escape and be saved. In the slasher films that followed in the wake of Chain Saw and Halloween, the Final Girl steadily gains in strength until she herself vanquishes the male antagonist."

He goes on to state the difference between the two:
:"It is this that prevents Sally from being a true Final Girl, for she (unlike Laurie and all the others that followed) never turns upon her aggressors and attacks ''them''. Instead, she simply endures, runs from them and, by chancem seizes an opportunity to escape. However, this is not to disagree with Clover's positioning of Sally as a Final Girl, as she does indeed endure and it is this that makes her so noteworthy."

Editor Stefano Lo Verme compared Burns's performance as Sally to the performances of [[Sandra Peabody]] as [[Mari Collingwood]] in ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972) and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as [[Laurie Strode]] in ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://movieplayer.it/articoli/le-scream-queen-piu-affascinanti-del-cinema-horror_16022/|title=SCREAMING ACTRESSES: FROM VERA FARMIGA TO JAMIE LEE CURTIS, THE GREAT SCREAM QUEEN BETWEEN CINEMA AND TV|last=Verme|first=Stefano Lo|date=|website=June 25, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sesame Street Live''' is a [[Adapted live stage tours|live touring show]] based on the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and produced by [[Feld Entertainment]].

==History==
[[VStar Entertainment Group|Vee Corporation]] was started in March 1980&lt;ref name=vt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nakashima|first1=Rebecca|title=VStar Finds New CEO|url=http://www.venuestoday.com/news/detail/vstar-finds-new-ceo-4616|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=Venues Today|date=April 6, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; from an idea by founder [[Vincent Egan]] to produce a live character show just for Sesame Street.&lt;ref name="sp"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopps|first1=Megan|title=Dayton resident, creator of Sesame Street Live, dies at 74|url=http://pressnews.com/2016/12/06/dayton-resident-creator-of-sesame-street-live-dies-at-74/|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=Sun Press|publisher=ECM Publishers, Inc.|date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based it off his time working for the Ice Follies which had a segment with those Muppets. Egan approached Jim Henson's company and [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], who were interested.&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite news|last1=St. Anthony|first1=Neal|title=Bringing Muppets to 'Live'|url=http://www.startribune.com/bringing-muppets-to-live/80240617/|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=Star Tribune|date=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With outside funding, Vee was able to sign a licensing agreement with the Children's Television Workshop for the characters.&lt;ref name="sp"/&gt;

The first Sesame Street Live show opened in September 1980 at the [[Metropolitan Sports Center]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] for a five-day run. That show was successful. The following shows in five locations had lackluster attendance costing VEE the profits made in Bloomington. Egan figured that the marketing material was confusing people in those markets as what type of show was not specified. He overhauled the script and marketing while getting his creditors to wait for payments. That Christmas, the show went on to play for four weeks at [[Madison Square Garden]]'s 4,000-seat Felt Forum in New York City before an audience of 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="st"/&gt;

VEE quickly ramp up to two different shows for the 1981 to 1982 season then added a third Australia show in 1982 to 1983. From the 1983-1984 season until the 1988-1989 season there were only two Sesame Street Live shows on tour.&lt;ref name="bcam"/&gt;

In order to keep the show running annually in the same cities, new plot lines are created and rotated through the tour.  Because the target audience changes as children grow up, shows are often removed from the rotation for a few years, then return with some modifications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2725">The '''Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008''', also known as S.2913, was a bill legislated by the [[United States Senate]] on April 24, 2008.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-2913|title=Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008 (2008; 110th Congress S. 2913) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored by [[Senator Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) with Senator [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Robert Bennett]] (R-UT) and Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-UT) as co-sponsors.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt; It was referred to a committee and then reported by the committee on May 15, 2008.

== Summary ==
The bill was designed to provide limitations on the judicial branch from remedying copyright infringement cases remedying [[orphan works]]. Orphan works are copyrighted works for which the copyright owners cannot be identified and contacted. The infringing party has to meet several limits though in order to avoid legal penalties: a.) the infringing party performed and documented a reasonably diligent search in good faith to locate and identify the copyright owner before using the work, but was unable to locate and identify the owner, b.) the infringing use of the work provided attribution to the owner of the copyright, if known.&lt;ref name="washingtonwatch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_SN_2913.html|title=S. 2913, The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008 - Washington Watch|work=washingtonwatch.com|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, it was to limit monetary compensation, to what was described to be a reasonable standard, for infringed work if the infringing party was unable to locate the owner of the work ("due diligence"). It prohibited reasonable compensation if the infringing party was a non-profit educational institution, museum, library, or archive, or a public broadcasting entity, had tried to locate and contact the copyright owner, as well as immediately removed the copyrighted material if the owners of the works request it.&lt;ref name="washingtonwatch.com"/&gt;

== Reason for non-passage==
Sessions of [[United States Congress|Congress]] last two years and any bills proposed in that session must be dealt with in that two-year span. At the end of each congressional session, according to the bylaws of passing legislation, bills and resolutions that are not passed are cleared from the books.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt; Discussion on the bill was stymied by Senators who had no interest in passing the bill.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The '''University of Applied Arts Vienna''' ({{lang-de|Universität für angewandte Kunst Wien}}, or informally just ''Die Angewandte'') is an [[Art school|arts university]] and institution of higher education in [[Vienna]], the capital of [[Austria]]. It has had [[university]] status since 1970.

==History==
The predecessor of the ''Angewandte'' was founded in 1863 as the ''k. k. [[Kunstgewerbeschule]]'' ('''Vienna School of Arts and Crafts'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dieangewandte.at/en/university/profile/history|title=History and educational assignment - From the Imperial Royal Arts and Crafts School to the "Angewandte" of Today|website=www.dieangewandte.at/en/university/profile/history|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the example of the South Kensington Museum in London, now the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], to set up a place of advanced education for designers and craftsmen with the Arts and Crafts School in Vienna. It was closely associated with the ''Österreichischen Museums für Kunst und Industrie'' (Imperial Royal Austrian Museum of Art and Industry, today known as the [[Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna|MAK]]). 

It  was the first school of its kind on the continent. In 1941 it became an institution of [[higher education]]. 1941-45 it was called "Reichshochschule fuer angewandte Kunst",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://austria-forum.org/af/AEIOU/Kunstuniversit%C3%A4ten/Kunstuniversit%C3%A4ten_english|title=Kunstuniversitäten (english)|last=http://austria-forum.org/|first=Austria-Forum {{!}}|work=Austria-Forum|access-date=2017-04-18|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1948 was taken over by the [[Austrian state]] as an [[academy]]. In 1970 it was awarded the title of a [[university]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblPdf/1970_54_0/1970_54_0.pdf|title=Federal Law Gazette of the republic Austria (Bundesgesetzblatt der Republik Österreich)|last=|first=|date=1970|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813191008/https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblPdf/1970_54_0/1970_54_0.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1998 it was renamed the ''Universität für angewandte Künste'' (''University of applied arts'').

Famous artists such as [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Koloman Moser]], [[Vivienne Westwood]], [[Karl Lagerfeld]],Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, [[Jil Sander]], [[Pipilotti Rist]], [[Matteo Thun]], [[François Valentiny]], [[Hugo Markl]] and [[Stefan Sagmeister]] were part of the university's staff or student body. Today its faculty includes many distinguished artists and teachers, such as [[Judith Eisler]], [[Erwin Wurm]], [[Hartmut Esslinger]], [[Greg Lynn]], Wolf D Prix (of [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]), [[Peter Weibel]] and the philosopher [[Burghart Schmidt]].

==Present==
The university has currently ca. 1,800 students and c. 380 faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dieangewandte.at/jart/prj3/angewandte-2016/data/uploads/Universitaet/Berichte/Rechnungsabschluss_Pruefbericht_2015.pdf|title=Final report of accounts of the university, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students come from 70 different countries to study in the 29 disciplines of the school, structured in 60% Austrians, 25% Europeans and 15% from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uni-ak.ac.at/uqe/download/WB2015.pdf|title=Knowledge balance of the university, data from 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of their processes is made public in ca. 200 exhibitions a year and a multitude of different events and other public presentations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2424">'''Wyler''' or '''Wyler Genève''' is an Italian [[Binda Group]]'s watch manufacturer: the original Swiss company was acquired by Italian corporation. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2009. 
==History==
[[Paul Wyler]] was born in 1896. Wyler presented its first 16 and 19-line precision movements to the public in 1923. The particularity of these was the [[Incaflex]] balance wheel, which was legendary at the time. The Wyler Incaflex balance wheel is protected along its diameter by two curved, elastic arms, which absorb any shocks to the balance wheel. In addition to producing his own calibres, Wyler also modified movements of other large-scale producers and sold these on to other watch companies. In some cases, the basic calibre was changed so much that the movements should actually be considered as Wyler calibres.

In 1934, Wyler was the official watch of Italy's World Cup winning team.

In 1937 the company caused a stir by launching a water-resistant watch that was not fitted with the conventional soft gaskets. The mineral glass was pressed in between the edge of the case and a pressed or screwed bezel, the gap between the winding shaft and the watch case was sealed hydraulically by fitting the winding shaft and bushing together, in the same material, to 1/500&amp;nbsp;mm.

Wyler gained worldwide notoriety with a spectacular marketing stunt in 1956, when two watches were dropped from the top of the Eiffel Tower and continued to function after the fall.

In 1960 manual and self-winding models from the Incaflex range became the official railway watch of the Santa Fe Railroad. In 1972, the Wyler Watch Corp. New York became a distributor for [[Eterna]].

== The rebirth of the brand ==
The brand was reborn as ''Wyler Genève'' at [[Baselworld]] 2006, following a decision by the Binda Group to reposition it.

At [[Baselworld]] 2007, the Wyler Genève [[Chronograph]] and tourbillons were presented, and in autumn 2007 the Wyler-Zagato watch was launched in conjunction with the Italian Atelier Zagato. The watch has an 8-day manual-winding manufacture movement.
