Although he used the name ''Dr.'' Sebi, Bowman was not a doctor and was considered a [[quackery|quack]] by actual doctors, attorneys, and consumer protection agencies.&lt;ref name="The Source"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FoxNews"/&gt;

==Biography==
===Early years===
Bowman was born in Ilanga, Honduras. He first learned of herbal healing from his grandmother. Bowman moved to the United States {{When|date=February 2018}} and, according to his literature, was dissatisfied with traditional medical practices in treating his asthma, diabetes, and [[erectile dysfunction|impotency]]. After visits to Mexico to see an herbalist,{{who|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/famed-herbal-healer-dr-sebi-dies-police-custody |title=Famed Herbal Healer Dr Sebi 'Dies In Police Custody': The 83-year-old claimed to have a cure for AIDS and cancer along with a long list of other related cures |editor=Press |date=8 August 2016 |publisher=The Voice |accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom Bowman claimed healed him, he began an herbal healing practice in New York.

===Career=== 
He began{{When|date=February 2018}} another practice in Honduras he called the USHA Research Institute in a village called Usha near [[La Ceiba, Honduras]]. Bowman made vast amounts of money, more than $3000 a day,&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; after giving advice to some notable celebrities including [[Lisa Lopes]], [[Steven Seagal]], [[John Travolta]], [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name="The Source" /&gt; After the lawsuits in New York he relocated to [[Los Angeles, California]].
===Arrest and death controversy===
Bowman was arrested for [[money laundering]] in March 2016 while attempting to transfer from a plane from the United States to a private plane at the [[Juan Manuel Gálvez International Airport|Juan Manuel Gálvez de Roatan Airport]] while carrying $37,000 in cash. On 28 May 2016 he was arrested again carrying $50,000 and taken into custody.&lt;ref name="The Source"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesource.com/2016/08/08/dr-sebi-dies-in-police-custody-in-honduras/ |title=Dr. Sebi Dies In Police Custody In Honduras |editor=Polygod |date=8 August 2016 |publisher=The Source |accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first released pending a court hearing on 6 June 2016, only to be re-arrested by the Public Ministerio on money laundering charges.&lt;ref name="The Source"/&gt; He was held for several weeks in a Honduran prison as his family was attempting to obtain his release and subsequently died en route to [[Hospital Vicente D'Antoni|Hospital D'Antoni]] on 6 August 2016 due to complications of [[pneumonia]] after police officials realized the severity of his health.&lt;ref name="Rolling Out"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollingout.com/2016/08/07/famed-healer-dr-sebi-dies-suspicious-arrest-hospitalization/ |title=Famed healer Dr. Sebi dies after suspicious arrest and hospitalization |editor=Barnes, Mo |date=7 August 2016 |publisher=Rolling Out |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Defender"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicagodefender.com/2016/08/15/no-mainstream-farewell-for-dr-sebi/ |title=No Mainstream Farewell for Dr.Sebi |editor=EL' Zabar, Kai |date=15 August 2016 |publisher=Chicago Defender |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="The Root"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroot.com/5-mysteries-surrounding-the-life-and-death-of-dr-sebi-1790856373 |title=5 Mysteries Surrounding the Life and Death of Dr. Sebi |editor=Crockett Jr., Stephen A. |date=11 August 2016 |publisher=The Root |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of his time in custody and the condition of the jail may have contributed to his death.&lt;ref name="Rolling Out"/&gt;

There is a conspiracy theory believed by some among his followers who question his arrest and death claiming that there was a conspiracy to silence him because his teachings [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|differed from the medical establishment]].&lt;ref name="The Root"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolling Out"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Defender"/&gt;
==Personal life==
Bowman considered himself an [[Africa]]n, not an "[[Afro-Hondurans|African-Honduran]]", but an African ''in'' Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sojourntohonduras.com/Pages/Preview.aspx |title=Chapter 8 Alfredo Bowman is Dr. Sebi The Healer |publisher=Sojourn to Honduras |accessdate=9 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826082553/http://www.sojourntohonduras.com/Pages/Preview.aspx |archive-date=2016-08-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death, he had seventeen living children.&lt;ref name="The Source"/&gt; His maternal grandfather was from [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Dr. Sebi |year= 2014 |title=Conversation With Dr. Sebi, Speaks About Haitians and Haiti |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiTZkkZYks |accessdate=9 August 2016 |editor=Andy B. |location=La Cieba, Honduras |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Lawsuits==
In 1987, New York City charged him with a criminal charge of [[practicing medicine without a license]]. It was recognized that "Dr. Sebi" was not a physician, he was acquitted because jurors claimed the state failed to show he made a medical diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jamison |first=Harold L |date=October 1, 1988 |title=Herbalist found not guilty in ‘fake’ healing case |newspaper=New York Amsterdam News |url=http://www.naturallifeenergy.com/documents/sebi-found-not-guilty.pdf |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404061520/http://www.naturallifeenergy.com/documents/sebi-found-not-guilty.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-04 |access-date=16 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later sued by the New York Attorney General for [[consumer fraud]] and prevented from making therapeutic claims for his products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/sebi/nyag_testimony.pdf|title=Hearing on Dietary Supplements. Before the House Committee on Government Operations Subcommittee on Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations, July 20, 1993, pp 106-110.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===People of the State of New York v. Ogun Herbal Research Institute===
At a 1993 Congressional hearing, Shirley Stark, who headed the NYAG's Consumer Fraud Section, indicated that a civil suit against Bowman's company had been successful, stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"A particularly glaring example of unsubstantiated therapeutic claims made for herbal supplements occurred a few years ago when the USHA Herbal Research Institute, run by a self-styled nutritionist calling himself "Dr. Sebi," advertised in the Village Voice and the Amsterdam News that "AIDS HAS BEEN CURED" by USHA and that they also specialize in cures for Leukemia, sickle cell anemia, herpes, lupus and other diseases. For an initial fee of $500 and $80 for each additional visit, patients were told they could be cured of AIDS and other diseases. The "cures" consisted of various herbal products, for each of which USHA made therapeutic claims. Eva Therapeutic Salve, for example, was referred to in USHA's brochure as . . . "very effective on major skin problems, in prenatal use, against poor circulation, cancer, cysts, hemorrhoids and arthritis." In fact, these claims were false. Our office filed suit against USHA and entered a consent agreement under which USHA can no longer make therapeutic claims for any of its products"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/sebi/nyag_testimony.pdf|title=Statement of Shirley Stark Assistant Attorney General of New York before the House Committee on Government Operations Subcommittee on Human Resources and Intergovernmental Realations on Dietary Supplements|page=108|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consent judgement prohibits the Ogun Herbal Research Institute ([[Trade name|d/b/a]] "USHA"), Fig Tree Products Company, Alfredo Bowman, Maa Bowman, and their successors, heirs and assigns from (i) claiming that their products or services could cure, relieve or alter in any way the course of AIDS, herpes, leukemia, sickle cell anemia, lupus, or any other human disease or physical condition, (ii) distributing or advertising such products, and (iii) diagnosing, treating or prescribing for any human disease without a valid state license by the [[New York State Education Department]]. A sum of $900 for costs was assessed to the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casewatch.org/ag/ny/usha/consent_1988.pdf|title=Supreme Court of the State of New York (New York County), Index No. 40396/87 (pg. 1-10), Filed June 28, 1988|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alfredo Bowman and Dr. Sebi LLC v. Michael Jackson===
In 2004, Bowman claims that he was not paid in full for an alleged treatment for Michael Jackson to help him overcome painkiller addiction to [[Pethidine|Demerol]] and [[morphine]] with his ''African Bio-Electric Cell Food Therapy,'' which apparently lasted six months at an [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] retreat providing him with "special herb compounds" and trained cooks.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/sebi.html |title=A Skeptical Look at the Late "Dr. Sebi" |editor=[[Stephen Barrett|Barrett, Stephen]] (M.D.) |date=16 August 2016 |publisher=Quack Watch |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowman claims that $380,000 was outstanding and sought $600,000 in lost revenue of the deferment of clients and various speaking arrangements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=8687&amp;page=archive-read |title=Jackson sued by herbalist |editor=Press |date=15 October 2004 |publisher=The Namibian |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Jackson's brother Randy only gave him $10,000.&lt;ref name ="TelegraphObit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/musicnews/Michael+Jackson-628.html |title=Michael Jackson 'sued by herbalist' |editor=Press |publisher=Female First |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymone Bain, a publicist of Jackson acknowledges that Bowman was a friend of Jackson but denies that his client received any "professional treatment" or that he had any painkiller addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/48452/michael-sued-over-alleged-detox |title=Michael Sued over Alleged Detox |editor=Ryan, Joal |date=13 October 2004 |publisher=E!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9232">'''Alkali Lake Chemical Waste Dump''' is a [[hazardous waste]] disposal site near the southwest edge of [[Alkali Lake (Oregon)|Alkali Lake]], a seasonally dry [[Dry lake|playa]] in [[Lake County, Oregon]]. It is in the [[Summer Lake (Oregon)|Summer Lake]] watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deq12.deq.state.or.us/fp20/FPDetail.aspx?SiteID=6013|title=Oregon DEQ Facility Profiler 2.0: Site 6013|date=1999-03-31|work=[[Oregon Department of Environmental Quality]]|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has been the focus of [[Oregon Department of Environmental Quality]] (DEQ) efforts to remediate a complex mix of toxic chemicals. Problems were initially caused by the dumping of hazardous waste near the lakebed between 1969 and 1971.

==Description==
Beginning in February 1969,&lt;ref name=DEQPCJ2009&gt;Proposed Consent Judgment for Portion of Cleanup Costs at Alkali Lake Facility [http://www.deq.state.or.us/Webdocs/Controls/Output/PdfHandler.ashx?p=ab7ef6d9-06be-4a5b-b080-97bc64bff35b.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical Waste Storage and Disposition, a [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] company, stored roughly 25,000 [[55-gallon drum]]s of chemical waste near the shore of the playa with a permit from the [[Oregon Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name="headache" /&gt;&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; The drums contained pesticides including [[2,4-D]] and [[MCPA]] herbicide residue containing chlorophenols, polymeric chlorophenoxyphenols and [[dioxin]]s/furans (including [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]]); metallic chloride waste, and paints and paint solvent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deq.state.or.us/lq/ecsi/ecsidetail.asp?seqnbr=291#contamination Site Summary Report - Details for Site ID 291, Alkali Lake Disposal Site], 
Environmental Cleanup Site Information (ECSI) Database, Oregon DEQ, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical Waste Storage was contracted for waste disposal by the Chipman division of Rhodia,&lt;ref name=DEQPCJ2009 /&gt; a [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] [[herbicide]] manufacturer, and by [[Oregon Metallurgical Corporation]], a [[titanium]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;"PUBLIC COMMENT SOUGHT ON WASTES NEAR LAKEVIEW".

'''Andrea Fischer''' (born January 14, 1960 in [[Arnsberg]]/Westfalen) was a member of the [[Germany|German]] [[Bundestag]] for the [[German Green Party]] and from 1998 until 2001 Federal Minister for [[Health]]. She dropped out of the Bundestag in 2002.

==Life==
===Education and profession===
After graduating from high school, Andrea Fischer completed an [[apprenticeship]] as an offset printer. She then worked as a [[Offset printing|printer]] and [[proofreader]] and additionally completed her [[Higher education|studies]] in [[economics]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. After completing her studies, she worked as a research assistant at the [[European Parliament]], the [[WZB Berlin Social Science Center]]
and the ''Federal Insurance Institution for Employees'' ''(Bundesversicherungsanstalt für Angestellte)''. 

===Political career===
She has been a member of the [[German Green Party]] since 1985, before that she was a member of the [[Group of International Marxists]] (GIM), the then German section of the Fourth International. From 1994 to 2002 she was a member of the [[German Bundestag]]. After the [[German federal election, 1998|1998 federal elections]], she was appointed [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]] on 27 October 1998 as a member of the [[Cabinet of Germany|federal government]] headed by [[Gerhard Schröder]]. She [[resigned]] from office on 9 January 2001 in the wake of the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] [[crisis]]. Shortly afterwards, the resignation of the [[Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Germany)|Federal Minister of Agriculture]], [[Karl-Heinz Funke]], was also announced. In the film ''Schlachtfeld Politik - Die finstere Seite der Macht'' ({{lang-en|Battlefield Politics - The dark side of power}}) by [[Stephan Lamby]], she describes that there was massive [[pressure]] from the party leadership. The film asks whether Andrea Fischer had to resign after ''[[Joschka Fischer]]'s wild years'' ([[Der Spiegel]] edition 2/2001), not so much because of the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] [[crisis]] as to relieve [[Joschka Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY2Vet3efPc Schlachtfeld Politik], youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer was elected as the leading [[Alliance 90/The Greens]] candidate in the [[Berlin state election, 2011|Berlin election]] on 18 September 2011 in the district assembly ''(Bezirksverordnetenversammlung)'' of Berlin's [[Mitte]] [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|borough]], where she was chair of the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]] parliamentary group until 30 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Berliner Woche]]: [http://www.berliner-woche.de/nachrichten/bezirk-mitte/artikel/1122-andrea-fischer-zur-regionsraetin-in-hannover-gewaehlt Andrea Fischer zur Regionsrätin in Hannover gewählt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114163811/http://www.berliner-woche.de/nachrichten/bezirk-mitte/artikel/1122-andrea-fischer-zur-regionsraetin-in-hannover-gewaehlt/ |date=2014-01-14 }}, 2. Oktober 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2012, Fischer was elected by the [[Regierungsbezirk|Regional Assembly]] to the office of Finance Director of the [[Hanover Region]], which had been restructured by Regional President [[Hauke Jagau]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung [http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/CDU-Frau-Barbara-Thiel-muss-gehen-Region-sucht-neuen-Dezernenten CDU-Frau Thiel muss gehen], vom 26.09.2014&lt;/ref&gt; It manages the areas of finance, facility management and hospitals. In April 2013 she took over as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the ''Klinikum Region Hanover''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung]]: [http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/Region-muss-Klinikum-vor-Pleite-retten Region muss Klinikum vor Pleite retten], vom 5. April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbyism===
After her time as an active [[politician]], Fischer became active as a [[freelance]] [[publicist]] and [[lobbyist]] in international health policy. From 2001 to 2009 she was [[patron]] of the ''Federal Association of Experienced Psychiatrists'' ''(Bundesverband Psychiatrie-Erfahrener)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpe-online.de/verband/vorstandsmitteilungen/schirmherrin-trennung.pdf BPE trennt sich von Schirmherrin Andrea Fischer. Pressemitteilung des BPE vom 19.

'''Auditory verbal agnosia''' ('''AVA'''), also known as '''pure word deafness''', is the inability to comprehend speech.  Individuals with this disorder lose the ability to understand language, repeat words, and write from dictation. Some patients with AVA describe hearing spoken language as meaningless noise, often as though the person speaking was doing so in a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.udallas.edu/udjs/departments/psychology/2013-2014/auditory-verbal-agnosia.php|title=Auditory Verbal Agnosia|last=Guilbeau|first=Catherine|date=December 16, 2017|website=University of Dallas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, spontaneous speaking, reading, and writing are preserved. The maintenance of the ability to process non-speech auditory information, including music, also remains relatively more intact than spoken language comprehension.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poeppel|first=David|date=2001-09-01|title=Pure word deafness and the bilateral processing of the speech code|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog2505_3/abstract|journal=Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=25|issue=5|pages=679–693|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2505_3|issn=1551-6709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who exhibit pure word deafness are also still able to recognize non-verbal sounds.&lt;ref name=Wolberg&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wolberg SC, Temlett JA, Fritz VU |title=Pure word deafness |journal=S.

Researchers have documented that in most patients exhibiting auditory verbal agnosia, the discrimination of consonants is more difficult than that of vowels, but as with most neurological disorders, there is variation among patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ackermann H, Mathiak K |title=[Symptomatology, Neuroanatomlcal Correlates and Pathomechanisms of Central Hearing Disorders (Pure Word Deafness, Verbal/Nonverbal Auditory Agnosia, Cortical Deafness) A Review] |journal=Fortschr Neurol Psychiatr |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=509–23 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10598334 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-995228 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditory verbal agnosia (AVA) is not the same as '''[[auditory agnosia]]'''; patients with (nonverbal) auditory agnosia have a relatively more intact speech comprehension system despite their impaired recognition of nonspeech sounds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Presentation==
Auditory verbal agnosia can be referred to as a [[Aphasia|pure aphasia]] because it has a high degree of specificity. Despite an inability to comprehend speech, patients with auditory verbal agnosia typically retain the ability to hear and process non-speech auditory information, speak, read and write. This specificity suggests that there is a separation between speech perception, non-speech auditory processing, and central language processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In support of this theory, there are cases in which speech and non-speech processing impairments have responded differentially to treatment. For example, some therapies have improved writing comprehension in patients over time, while speech remained critically impaired in those same patients.

The term "pure word deafness" is something of a misnomer. By definition, individuals with pure word deafness are not deaf – in the absence of other impairments, these individuals have normal hearing for all sounds, including speech. The term "deafness" originates from the fact that individuals with AVA are unable to ''comprehend'' speech that they hear. The term "pure word" refers to the fact that comprehension of verbal information is selectively impaired in AVA. For this reason, AVA is distinct from other [[auditory agnosia]]s in which the recognition of nonspeech sounds is impaired. [[Auditory agnosia|Classical (or pure) auditory agnosia]] is an inability to process environmental sounds. [[Auditory agnosia|Interpretive or receptive agnosia]] (amusia) is an inability to understand music.

Patients with pure word deafness complain that speech sounds simply do not register, or that they tend not to come up. Other claims include speech sounding as if it were in a foreign language, the words having a tendency to run together, or the feeling that speech was simply not connected to the patient's voice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Auditory verbal agnosia has been shown to form as a result of tumor formation, especially in the posterior third ventricle, trauma, lesions, [[cerebral infarction]], encephalitis as a result of herpes simplex, and Landaui-Kleffner syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shivashankar|first=N|last2=Shashikala|first2=H.R|last3=Nagaraja|first3=D|last4=Jayakumar|first4=P.N|last5=Ratnavalli|first5=E|title=Pure word deafness in two patients with subcortical lesions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-8467(01)00136-6|journal=Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery|volume=103|issue=4|pages=201–205|doi=10.1016/s0303-8467(01)00136-6|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasselimis|first=Dimitrios S.|last2=Angelopoulou|first2=Georgia|last3=Kolovos|first3=Georgios|last4=Daskalaki|first4=Argyro|last5=Peppas|first5=Christos|last6=Tavernarakis|first6=Antonios|last7=Potagas|first7=Constantin|title=Pure word deafness due to herpes simplex encephalitis|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2016.11.018|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|volume=372|pages=11–13|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2016.11.018|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact location of damage which results in pure word deafness is still under debate, but the planum temporale, posterior STG, and white matter damage to the [[Acoustic radiation|acoustic radiations]] (AR) have all been implicated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maffei|first=Chiara|last2=Capasso|first2=Rita|last3=Cazzolli|first3=Giulia|last4=Colosimo|first4=Cesare|last5=Dell'Acqua|first5=Flavio|last6=Piludu|first6=Francesca|last7=Catani|first7=Marco|last8=Miceli|first8=Gabriele|title=Pure word deafness following left temporal damage: Behavioral and neuroanatomical evidence from a new case|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2017.10.006|journal=Cortex|volume=97|pages=240–254|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2017.10.006|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditory verbal agnosia is rarely diagnosed in its pure form. Auditory verbal agnosia can both present as the result of acute damage or as chronic, progressive degeneration over time. Cases have been documented that result from severe acute head trauma resulting in bilateral temporal lobe damage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia has also been documented to present progressively over several years. In one such case, the patient exhibited progressive word deafness over a 9-year period but did not exhibit any other cognitive of mental deterioration. [[MRI]]s showed cortical atrophy in the left superior temporal lobe region.&lt;ref name="Otsuki 1998" /&gt;

In childhood, auditory verbal agnosia can also be caused by [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], also called acquired epileptic aphasia. It is often the first symptom of this disease.&lt;ref name="Metz-Lutz 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Metz-Lutz|first1=MN.|date=Aug 2009|title=The assessment of auditory function in CSWS: lessons from long-term outcome.|journal=Epilepsia|volume=50 Suppl 7|issue=|pages=73–6|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02225.x|PMID=19682057}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 45 cases suggested a relationship between prognosis and age of onset with poorer prognosis for those with earlier onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tharpe|first=Anne|year=1991|title=Diagnostic and Management Considerations of Acquired Epileptic Aphasia or Landau-Kleffner Syndrome|journal=The American Journal of Otology|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extremely rare cases, auditory verbal agnosia has been known to present as a symptom of [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disease]], such as [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 2011|title=Pure word deafness in a patient with early-onset Alzheimer's disease: an unusual presentation|url=|journal=J Clin Neurol|volume=7|issue=4|pages=227–30|doi=10.3988/jcn.2011.7.4.227|pmc=3259498|pmid=22259620|vauthors=Kim SH, Suh MK, Seo SW, Chin J, Han SH, Na DL}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases auditory verbal agnosia is a symptom that is typically followed by more severe neurological symptoms typical of Alzheimer's disease.

==Diagnosis==
{{expand section |section only describes intact abilities but no specification of deficits|date=November 2013}}
There is no uniform performance among patients with auditory verbal agnosia; therefore it is not possible to attribute specific phonetic or phonological deficits to the syndrome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to diagnose AVA, two intact abilities need to be established:
* Words that are heard must have undergone adequate acoustic analysis as evidenced by correct repetition;&lt;ref name = Ellis&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=A.W.|title=c|year=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|location=East Sussex, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The semantic representation of the word must be intact as evidenced by immediate comprehension of the word when presented in written form.&lt;ref name = Ellis/&gt; 
If both of these criteria are met ''and'' lack of auditory verbal comprehension is apparent, a diagnosis of AVA may follow.

In at least one instance, the [[Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination]] has been used to profile AVA. This method was able to show that the patient experienced marked difficulty in speech perception with minor to no minor deficits in production, reading, and writing, fitting the profile of AVA. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-01-01|title=Speech perception, rapid temporal processing, and the left hemisphere: A case study of unilateral pure word deafness|url=|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=49|issue=2|pages=216–230|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.11.009|issn=0028-3932|author=Slevc L. Robert|pmc=3031136}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this provides a well-known example, other verbal-audio test batteries can and have also been used to diagnose pure speech deafness.

===Cognitive deficits===
Auditory verbal agnosia is the inability to distinguish phonemes.&lt;ref name="Wolberg" /&gt; In some patients with unilateral auditory verbal agnosia, there is evidence that the ability to acoustically process speech signals is affected at the prephonemic level, preventing the conversion of these signals into phonemes.&lt;ref name="Wang Peach 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Emily|last2=Peach|first2=Richard K.|last3=Xu|first3=Yi|last4=Schneck|first4=Michael|last5=Manry|first5=Charles|title=Perception of Dynamic Acoustic Patterns by an Individual with Unilateral Verbal Auditory Agnosia|journal=Brain and Language| volume=73|issue=3| year=2000|pages=442–455|doi=10.1006/brln.2000.2319}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two predominate hypotheses that address what happens within the language center of the brain in people that have AVA. One of the hypotheses is that an early stage of auditory analysis is impaired. The fact that AVA patients have the ability to read shows that both the semantic system and the speech output lexicon are intact. The second hypotheses suggests that there is either a complete or partial disconnection of the auditory input lexicon from the semantic system. This would suggest that entries in the lexicon can still be activated but they cannot go on to cause subsequent semantic activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=A.W.|title=Human Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|location=East Sussex, Uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to these two different hypotheses, researchers in one study differentiated between two different types of AVA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simons|first=Jon S.|author2=Matthew A. Lambon Ralph|title=The Auditory Agnosias|journal=Neurocase|year=1999|volume=5|pages=379–406|url=http://www.memlab.psychol.cam.ac.uk/pubs/Simons1999%20Neurocase.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2013|doi=10.1080/13554799908402734}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this study, one form of AVA is a deficit at the prephonemic level and is related to the inability to comprehend rapid changes in sound.This form of AVA is associated with bilateral temporal lobe lesions. Speech perception in patients with this form of AVA has been shown to improve significantly in understanding when the pace of speech is drastically slowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The second type of AVA that the study discusses is a deficit in linguistic discrimination that does not adhere to a prephonemic pattern. This form is associated with left unilateral temporal lobe lesions and may even be considered a form of Wernicke's aphasia.  Often individuals diagnosed with auditory verbal agnosia are also incapable of discriminating between non-verbal sounds as well as speech. The underlying problem seems to be temporal in that understanding speech requires the discrimination between specific sounds which are closely spaced in time.&lt;ref name="Stefanatos 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stefanatos GA, Gershkoff A, Madigan S |title=On pure word deafness, temporal processing, and the left hemisphere |journal=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=456–70; discussion 455 |year=2005 |pmid=16209426 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this is not unique to speech; studies using non-speech sounds closely spaced in time (dog bark, phone ring, lightning, etc.) have shown that those with auditory verbal agnosia are unable to discriminate between those sounds in the majority of cases, though a few putative examples of speech-specific impairment have been documented in the literature.

===Neurological deficits===
Auditory verbal agnosia is caused by bilateral damage, often in the form of cerebrovascular accidents which form as a result of an [[embolism]], to the posterior superior [[temporal lobe]]s or disruption of connections between these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchman|first=A. S.|last2=Garron|first2=D. C.|last3=Trost-Cardamone|first3=J. E.|last4=Wichter|first4=M. D.|last5=Schwartz|first5=M.|date=1986-05-01|title=Word deafness: one hundred years later.|url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/49/5/489|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry|language=en|volume=49|issue=5|pages=489–499|doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.5.489|issn=0022-3050|pmid=2423648|pmc=1028802}}&lt;/ref&gt; A unilateral lesion in the left or right superior temporal lobe can also result in pure word deafness, this being much more common in the left hemisphere than the right.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=M.|last2=Sandercock|first2=P.|last3=Ghadiali|first3=E.|date=1987-12-01|title=Pure word deafness and unilateral right temporo-parietal lesions: a case report.|url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/50/12/1708|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry|language=en|volume=50|issue=12|pages=1708–1709|doi=10.1136/jnnp.50.12.1708|issn=0022-3050|pmid=3437316|pmc=1032628}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with lesions to the left posterior superior temporal lobe, but no such unilateral case has yet been documented without damage to the white matter tract connecting superior temporal lobes bilaterally or bilateral damage to the superior temporal lobe. In cases where unilateral damage to the left superior temporal lobe has been documented, patients exhibited problems processing both speech and non-speech sounds (in other words, not typical of auditory verbal agnosia).&lt;ref name="Stefanatos 2005" /&gt; These facts, in combination with the existence of cases of damage to these white matter tracts without detectable cortical damage, in combination with cases of pure word deafness resulting enlargement of the [[third ventricle]] alone suggest that the disorder results from damage to the left-right superior temporal circuit rather than the superior temporal area on one hemisphere or the other.

Many of the bilateral cases share one essential feature: after the first (unilateral) lesion, speech perception was typically intact after an initial period of disturbance. Only after the second lesion (in the other hemisphere) were permanent speech perception problems the consistent outcome. The fact that most of these patients only manifested auditory verbal agnosia subsequent to the second lesion supports the hypothesis that both sides of the superior temporal gyrus are necessary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Auditory verbal agnosia is rarely diagnosed in its pure form. Auditory verbal agnosia can present as the result of acute damage or chronic, [[Primary progressive aphasia|progressive degeneration]] over time. Cases have been documented that result from severe acute head trauma resulting in bilateral temporal lobe damage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia has also been documented to present progressively over several years. In one such case, the patient exhibited progressive word deafness over a 9-year period but did not exhibit any other cognitive of mental deterioration. This patient was found, using MRIs, to have cortical atrophy in the left superior temporal lobe region.&lt;ref name="Otsuki 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=Slowly progressive pure word deafness|url=|journal=Eur. Neurol.|volume=39|issue=3|pages=135–40|doi=10.1159/000007923|pmid=9605389|vauthors=Otsuki M, Soma Y, Sato M, Homma A, Tsuji S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments==

===Sign language therapy===
[[Sign language]] therapy has been identified as one of the top five most common treatments for auditory verbal agnosia. This type of therapy is most useful because, unlike other treatment methods, it does not rely on fixing the damaged areas of the brain. This is particularly important with AVA cases because it has been so hard to identify the causes of the agnosia in the first place, much less treat those areas directly. Sign language therapy, then, allows the person to cope and work around the disability, much in the same way it helps deaf people. In the beginning of therapy, most will work on identifying key objects and establishing an initial core vocabulary of signs. After this, the patient graduates to expand the vocabulary to intangible items or items that are not in view or present. Later, the patient learns single signs and then sentences consisting of two or more signs. In different cases, the sentences are first written down and then the patient is asked to sign them and speak them simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Patrick J., and Audrey L. Holland. Clinical Management of Patient with Pure Word Deafness. Veterans Administration Medical Center and University of Pittsburgh, n.d. Web. 5 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Because different AVA patients vary in the level of speech or comprehension they have, sign language therapy learning order and techniques are very specific to the individual's needs.

=== Tumor Removal ===
In incidents where tumors and their pressure effects are the cause of pure word deafness, removal of the tumor has been shown to allow for the return of most auditory verbal comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-12-01|title=Pure word deafness in two patients with subcortical lesions|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846701001366|journal=Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery|volume=103|issue=4|pages=201–205|doi=10.1016/S0303-8467(01)00136-6|issn=0303-8467|author=Shivashankar N, Shashikala H.R, Nagaraja D, Jayakumar P.N, Ratnavalli E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatments used for Landau-Kleffner syndrome ===
{{main|Landau-Kleffner syndrome#Treatment}}

====Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy====
Treating auditory verbal agnosia with [[intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIG) is controversial because of its inconsistency as a treatment method. Although IVIG is normally used to treat immune diseases, some individuals with auditory verbal agnosia have responded positively to the use of IVIG.&lt;ref name="Mikati 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mikati | first1 = MA. | last2 = Shamseddine | first2 = AN. | title = Management of Landau-Kleffner syndrome. | journal = Paediatr Drugs | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–89 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.2165/00148581-200507060-00006| PMID = 16356025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, patients are more likely to relapse when treated with IVIG than other pharmacological treatments. IVIG is, thus, a controversial treatment as its efficacy in treating auditory verbal agnosia is dependent upon each individual and varies from case to case.

====Diazepam therapy====
In a study conducted by Masaaki Nagafuchi et al. (1993), a 7-year-old girl began taking a dose of 2&amp;nbsp;mg [[diazepam]] orally every day. She demonstrated major improvements in behavior and comprehension of speech while under diazepam therapy. Within a month, conversation problems were eliminated. After a year of therapy, her repetition ability was almost normal. After two years, her ability to discriminate monosyllabic words was within the normal range. Her audiological recognition had remained normal from the time of onset (i.e., she could recognize familiar noises such as a baby crying or a telephone ringing).&lt;ref name="Nagafuchi"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=M.|last1= Nagafuchi|first2= K.|last2= Iinuma|first3= K.|last3= Yamamoto|first4= T.|last4= Kitahara |title=Diazepam Therapy of Verbal Auditory Agnosia|journal=Brain and Language|volume =45|issue =2|year= 1993| pages =180–188|doi=10.1006/brln.1993.1042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more general term used for this kind of undignified practice, particularly in India, is "[[manual scavenging]]". Proper emptying of pit latrines is part of a city-wide [[fecal sludge management]] concept.

==Description==
Because of the lack of infrastructure for [[sewage]] removal, the city turns to other means. The ''bayakou'' in Port-au-Prince are paid to come annually to empty the pits of full pit latrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/opinion/26wilentz.html|title=In Haiti, Waiting for the Grand Bayakou|last=Wilentz|first=Amy|date=2010-11-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bayakou'' use plastic buckets to empty pit latrines during the night.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/haitis-shadow-sanitation-system|title=Haiti’s Shadow Sanitation System|last=Katz|first=Jonathan M.|date=12 March 2014|website=The New Yorker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bayakou work as a crew. One part of the bayakou team climbs through the toilet's squat hole into the pit under the latrine and fills the bucket.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Then the person in the pit hands the bucket up to another crew-member.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[human waste]] is put into sacks and placed into a [[wheelbarrow]] which a third person carts away.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The waste is normally dumped on the ground, ravines or sometimes into [[Vacuum truck|vacuum trucks]] run by private companies who will take the waste to the treatment plant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Dumping waste anywhere other than in a treatment plant is illegal.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oursoil.org/supporting-haitis-underground-sanitation-workers/|title=Supporting Haiti's "Underground" Sanitation Workers|work=SOIL Haiti|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bayakou have been arrested for transporting waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iapmonline.org/Documents/archive/20100607_Haiti_SOIL.aspx|title=Waste Not, Want Not|last=Webb|first=Steven|date=April 2010|website=IAPMonline|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before entering the pit, ''bayakou'' pour floor cleaner into the pit in order to soften the [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many ''bayakou'' clean the pit in the nude because the filth in the latrines will ruin their clothes and protective gear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/07/30/540359412/haiti-s-bayakou-hauling-away-human-excrement-by-hand|title=Haiti's 'Bayakou': Hauling Away Human Excrement By Hand|last=Hersher|first=Rebecca|date=30 July 2017|website=NPR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazards of the job include injury from objects thrown into latrines and exposure to infectious diseases such as [[cholera]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Summary==
Basic taste qualities like sour, salty, sweet, bitter and umami serve specific functions in identifying food components found in the diet of humans and animals, and are recognized by proteins in the oral cavity. Recognition of bitter taste and aversion to it are thought to protect the organism against the ingestion of poisonous food compounds, which are often bitter. Bitter taste receptors are expressed not only in the mouth but also in extraoral tissues. BitterDB database, available at http://bitterdb.agri.huji.ac.il/bitterdb/, includes over 670 compounds that were reported to taste bitter to humans. The compounds can be searched by name, chemical structure, similarity to other bitter compounds, association with a particular human bitter taste receptor, and so on. The database also contains information on mutations in bitter taste receptors that were shown to influence receptor activation by bitter compounds.

==Database overview==

===Bitter compounds===
[[File:Search Examples of bitter compounds in BitterDB.jpg|frame|right|alt=|Search Examples of bitter compounds in BitterDB]]
'''BitterDB''' currently contains more than 670 compounds that were cited in the literature as bitter. For each compound, the database offers information regarding its molecular properties, references for the compound’s bitterness, including additional information about the bitterness category of the compound (e.g. a ‘bitter-sweet’ or ‘slightly bitter’ annotation), different compound identifiers (smiles, CAS registry number, IUPAC systematic name), an indication whether the compound is derived from a natural source or is synthetic, a link to the compound’s [[PubChem]] entry and different file formats for downloading (sdf, image, smiles).
Over 200 bitter compounds have been experimentally linked to their corresponding human bitter taste receptors. For those compounds, BitterDB provides additional information, including links to the publications indicating these ligand–receptor interactions, the effective concentration for receptor activation and/or the [[EC50]] value and links to the associated bitter taste receptors entries in the '''BitterDB'''.

====Querying and browsing====
Bitter compounds can be queried and browsed in different ways. For example, 'advanced search' option allows user to retrieve compounds that fit different criteria, such as a combination of specific physical properties or a combination of associated human bitter taste receptors.
In addition to the querying options the user can browse through a sort-able table with all the '''BitterDB''' compounds.

===Bitter taste receptors===
In addition, '''BitterDB''' contains data about the 25 known human bitter taste receptors. Several properties are displayed for each receptor. The bitter taste receptors can be searched using different criteria: name, known ligands and [[UniProt]] accession number. Using a table that presents all the bitter taste receptors and some information about them, the user can browse and also sort by various options, such as the number of bitter ligands associated with the receptor.

===Local BLAST service and global alignment===
'''BitterDB''' offers two additional features: a local [[BLAST]] service to determine the local similarity between a query sequence and the different human bitter taste receptors, and a global alignment of the 25 human bitter taste receptors. The alignment was generated using [[Clustalw|ClustalW2]], and displays the secondary structure of each receptor, as predicted by the TOPCONS server.

===Users can upload bitter compounds===
'''BitterDB''' offers an ‘upload’ option, by which the users are encouraged to submit information about bitter compounds. These data will be reviewed by the authors and uploaded to the database accordingly. The users can join the mailing list in order to receive database updates.

Founded in 2001, the '''Child Health Nutrition Research Initiative''' ('''CHNRI''') is a network of interested partners supported by the [[Global Forum for Health Research]], based in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. CHNRI efforts support the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of:
* Eradicating extreme [[poverty]] and [[hunger]]
* Reducing [[child mortality]]
* Combating [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and diseases in children

CHNRI is helping to set research priorities in [[child health]], development and nutrition, and resolve related methodological issues. It also sponsors research into priority child health and nutrition problems, especially in low- and middle-income countries, with a focus on research to inform policies for scaling up effective interventions.

CHNRI focuses on increasing the level of communication and discussion amongst players devoted to research on child health and nutrition; such as nutritionists, child health specialists, and child development specialists. It provides a platform to initiate and maintain debate on the importance and direction of the research, bringing scientists together and implementing bodies to discuss issues relevant to the current status of knowledge and the requirements for the future.

The secretariat of CHNRI is now located in [http://www.inclentrust.org The INCLEN Trust International]. The board is chaired by [http://faculty.jhsph.edu/Default.cfm?faculty_id=61 Dr Robert E. Black]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Professor and Chair, Department of International Health, [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]], United States.

A '''chillum''', or '''chilam''', is a straight conical pipe with end-to-end channel, traditionally made of clay and used since at least the eighteenth century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trocadero.com/paha/items/495809/item495809store.html A bidri chillum, India, 18th Century]&lt;/ref&gt; by Hindu monks, known as [[sadhu]]s &lt;ref&gt;Dolf Hartsuiker.  [http://www.adolphus.nl/sadhus/stories/holysmoke.html Holy Smoke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011184141/http://adolphus.nl/sadhus/stories/holysmoke.html |date=2007-10-11 }}  ''Sadhus and Yogis of India''&lt;/ref&gt; in India. It was invented in India.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The culture of chillum-smoking has spread from India to the rest of the world since the mid-1960s.{{Dubious|date=October 2014}}

==Chillum stone==
When smoking a chillum a chillum stone is often inserted in the pipe to keep from directly inhaling debris much like a screen or filter is used in other pipes. They are generally tight fitting, conical with a flat top and usually have a small hole drilled down through the centre and slits down the sides to allow smoke to pass freely. Before they were commercially available people would search for the right sized pebble off the ground to fit their pipes. Some still do.

According to [[Alfred Dunhill]], Africans have long employed chillum-style pipes for smoking [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and later tobacco. Gourds and various horns were often employed while conical bowls were common in [[Uganda]]. One of the more famous pipes is an ivory cone pipe once belonging to "Waganda" monarch King Mtesa.&lt;ref name="dunhill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunhill|first1=Alfred|title=The Pipe Book|date=1924|publisher=A. &amp; C. Black|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, it has also seen use in sacraments by [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20020224/arts/arts1.html Spotlight on Rastafarian sects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214125910/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20020224/arts/arts1.html |date=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20030427/ent/ent3.html 'Rasta in Transition' launched at Livity Restaurant ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114102815/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20030427/ent/ent3.html |date=2009-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s the embellished bamboo chillum has become an American folk art form. These pipes are handmade and often sold by the artists on street corners in places like the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district of San Francisco and the [[Greenwich Village]] area of New York City. As designs these contemporary smoking pipes recall traditional decorated bamboo pipes from Borneo,&lt;ref name="dunhill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunhill|first1=Alfred|title=The Pipe Book|date=1924|publisher=A. &amp; C. Black|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the American carved bamboo design often employs a brass lighting fixture for a bowl. Since the 1970s, street artist Darrel "Pipeman" Mortimer of San Francisco has made nearly 10,000 such pipes, each signed, numbered, and sold personally.&lt;ref name=Austin&gt;Austin, Buck: "Darrel Mortimer", Alarm Magazine, Chicago, summer 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rastafari ceremony==
In "reasoning sessions" and [[Grounation Day|grounations]], the ritual chillum used is made of a cow's horn or conical wood piece, fitted with a long drawtube giving the smoke time to cool before inhalation. 

A [[bong]]-like chillum equipped with a water filtration chamber is sometimes referred to as a [[Chalice (pipe)|chalice]], based on a quote from the [[Bible|Biblical]] book of [[Deuteronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/godkings/rastafari.html ''The Rastafari'' by Maria Baptist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605225407/http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/godkings/rastafari.html |date=June 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks and praises are offered to [[Jah]] before [[cannabis smoking|smoking]] the chillum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_spirit1.shtml The Rastafarians by Leonard E. Barrett 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">The '''Commission on Dental Competency Assessments''' (formerly the '''North East Regional Board of Dental Examiners''') is one of five examination agencies for [[dentist]]s in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/licensure/licensure-dental-students|title=Clinical Testing for Dentist Licensure|website=www.ada.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other examination agencies are the [[Western Regional Examining Board]], the [[Central Regional Dental Testing Service]], the [[Council of Interstate Testing Agencies, Inc.]] and the [[Southern Regional Testing Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2016-archive/march/ada-calls-for-increased-licensure-portability&lt;/ref&gt; These were organized to better standardize clinical exams for licensure. Historically each state had its own independent licensing exam.

On January 9, 2015, the NERB became the Commission on Dental Competency Assessments (CDCA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2015-archive/february/north-east-regional-board-is-now-the-commission-on-dental-competency-assessments&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDCA (formerly NERB), administers the ADEX Dental and Dental Hygiene Exams.&lt;ref&gt;http://adexexams.org/faq/&lt;/ref&gt; The CDCA also administers Dental Specialty exams&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcaexams.org/specialty-exam/|title=Specialty Exam {{!}} CDCA|website=www.cdcaexams.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a Florida Laws and Rules exam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcaexams.org/florida-laws-and-rules-dental-hygienist-2/|title=Florida Laws and Rules – Dental Hygienist {{!}} CDCA|website=www.cdcaexams.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and an Expanded Function Dental Assistant (EFDA) exam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcaexams.org/dental-auxiliary-information/|title=Dental Auxiliary Exam Information {{!}} CDCA|website=www.cdcaexams.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The CDCA has grown to include 44* states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and Jamaica. The only states that still do not accept the CDCA for both Dental and Hygiene exams are: Alaska, *California (''expected'' Dental ''in'' ''2018)'', Delaware, Georgia, *Nebraska ''(accepts ''Dental'' but not ''Hygiene'')'', *New York ''(accepts ''Hygiene'' but not ''Dental'')'', Oklahoma and *South Dakota (''expected'' Dental ''and'' Hygiene ''in 2018)'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcaexams.org/adex-acceptance-map/|title=ADEX Acceptance Map {{!}} CDCA|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cdcaexams.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Complete Wellbeing''''' was a [[Personal development|personal growth]] [[magazine]] founded in 2006. It was published from [[Mumbai, India]], and distributed all over the country. It stopped publishing its print edition with its June 2016 issue. It continues to publish content on its [https://completewellbeing.com website].

==History and profile==
''Complete Wellbeing'' was first published on 1 November 2006.&lt;ref name="afa"&gt;{{cite news|title=New magazine, 'Complete Wellbeing', to be launched|url=http://www.afaqs.com/news/story/16259_New-magazine-Complete-Wellbeing-to-be-launched|accessdate=25 September 2016|work=Afaqs|date=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine promotes the idea that individuals are not sum of parts but an integrated whole. In other words, one's [[mind]], body and [[soul]] must work in harmony to feel well. It highlights the inter-connectedness of an individual's physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects. The magazine targets both men and women.&lt;ref name="afa"/&gt;

In 2012 ''Complete Wellbeing'' received the Medscape India Award for excellence in media for wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mxmindia.com/2012/06/complete-wellbeing-bags-medscape-award/ MXM India Complete wellbeing bags medscape award]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3303">The '''defined daily dose''' ('''DDD''') is a statistical measure of [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]] consumption, defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).  It is used to standardize the comparison of drug usage between different drugs or between different health care environments. The DDD is not to be confused with the [[therapeutic dose]] or with the dose actually prescribed by a physician for an individual patient.&lt;ref name="WHOCC"&gt;WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC): [http://www.whocc.no/ddd/definition_and_general_considera/ DDD Definition and general considerations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO's definition is: "The DDD is the assumed average [[maintenance dose]] per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults."&lt;ref name="WHOCC" /&gt;

==Use==
A common problem when comparing drugs is that different medications can be of different potency. For example, 20&amp;nbsp;mg of the [[beta blocker]] [[propranolol]] are much less effective than 20&amp;nbsp;mg of the beta blocker [[bisoprolol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mutschler|first=Ernst|author2=Gerd Geisslinger |author3=Heyo K. Kroemer |author4=Monika Schäfer-Korting |title=Arzneimittelwirkungen|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft|location=Stuttgart|date=1996|edition=7|pages=289&amp;ndash;90|isbn=3-8047-1377-7|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reflect this, the WHO has decided on a DDD for propranolol of 160&amp;nbsp;mg&lt;ref&gt;WHOCC: [http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=C07AA05 Propranolol]&lt;/ref&gt; and for bisoprolol of 10&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref&gt;WHOCC: [http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=C07AB07 Bisoprolol]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual patients can still be prescribed higher or lower doses, for instance in children, patients with liver or kidney impairment, patients with a [[combination therapy]], or due to differences in [[drug metabolism]] between individuals or [[ethnicities]] ([[genetic polymorphism]]).&lt;ref name="WHOCC" /&gt;

The DDD system is most frequently used in academic articles and reports, and as a tool for comparison and control over nationwide total drug consumption. For example, the overall drug consumption of beta blockers can be measured in DDDs and compared between different countries, sexes or other populations.

==Calculation==
If the DDD for a certain drug is given, the number of DDDs used by an individual patient or (more commonly) by a collective of patients is as follows.

&lt;math&gt;Drug\ usage\ (in\ DDDs) = \frac{Items\ issued  \times Amount\ of\ drug\ per\ item}{DDD}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the [[analgesic]] (pain reliever) [[paracetamol]] has a DDD of 3&amp;nbsp;g, which means that an average patient who takes paracetamol for its main indication, which is pain relief, uses 3 grams per day. This is equivalent to six standard tablets of 500&amp;nbsp;mg each. If a patient consumes 24 such tablets (12&amp;nbsp;g of paracetamol in total) over a certain span of time, this equals a consumption of four DDDs.

&lt;math&gt;Drug\ usage\ (in\ DDDs) = \frac{24\ (items) \times 500\ (mg/item)}{3000\ mg} = 4&lt;/math&gt;

'''Emotional responsivity''' refers to the ability to acknowledge an affective stimuli by exhibiting [[emotion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mathews, J.R.  |author2=Barch, D.M.|title=Emotion responsivity, social cognition, and functional outcome in schizophrenia.|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=2010|volume=119|issue=1|pages=50–59|doi=10.1037/a0017861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any response, whether it is appropriate or not, would showcase the presence of this phenomenon. Although emotional responsivity is a general term that is applied to nonclinical populations, it has also been associated with individuals with [[schizophrenia]] and [[autism]].

Emotional responsivity is said to have a unique association with social interaction. Studies suggest that social interaction, especially at home, can influence the way a child responds to emotional stimuli. For example, if child grew up in a home where emotional displays  resulted in punishment or negative criticism, the child would have the tendency to find ways to hide their emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg, N.,  Fabes, R.A., Carlo, G., &amp; Karbon, M.|title=Emotional responsivity to others: Behavioral correlates and socialization antecedents|journal=New Directions for Child Development|date=1992|pages=57–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measures of emotional responsivity ==

In experimental studies, emotional responsivity can be measured through various tasks, which would allow participants' facial expressions and behavior to be recorded and sometimes [[Coding (social sciences)|coded]]. Tasks used to measure emotional responsivity, particularly in children, include:
* '''Facial stimuli''': This task involves asking a participant to view pictures of human faces that display different facial expressions. Participants would then be asked to rate their emotional experience.The facial expression would be considered the affective stimuli.
* '''Surprise Boxes''': This task involves an experimenter opening a box in front of a participant, usually a child, and displaying either an amazed reaction, by saying "ohh" or, a frightened reaction, by saying "ahh."
* '''Experimenter Distress''': In this task, the experimenter bangs his or her knee, displaying distress &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sigman, M.D. |author2=Kasari, C. |author3=Kwon, J. |author4=Yirmiya, N. |title=Responses to the negative emotions of others by autistic, mentally retarded, and normal children|journal=Child Development|date=1992|volume=63|issue=4|pages=796–807|doi=10.2307/1131234}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Yummy Yucky''': In this task, a child is asked to eat a certain food that was chosen by his or her parent. An experimenter then tastes the chosen food and either displays a pleased or disgusted facial expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Repacholi, B. M.  |author2=Gopnick, A.|title=Early reasoning about desires: Evidence from 14- and 18-month-olds. Developmental Psychology|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1997|volume=33|pages=12–21.|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.33.1.12|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.33.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional responsivity can also be examined through psycho-physiological approaches such as:
* '''Facial electromyography'''
* '''Skin conductance'''
== Emotional Responsivity in Children With Sleep Deprivation ==

Sleeping issues in children have been linked to many physical and mental health problems later on in adulthood and created a greater risk for emotional and behavioral issues in children. Studies haven't  been able to link the physiological functions with sleeping disturbances to these psychological consequences. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reidy, Hamann, Inman, Johnson, Brennan|first=Brooke L., Stephan, Cory, Katrina C., Patricia A.|date=January 24, 2016|title=Decreased sleep duration is associated with increased fMRI responses to emotional faces in children|url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.libproxy.umassd.edu/S0028393216300276/1-s2.0-S0028393216300276-main.pdf?_tid=74845b66-acae-46f1-bf42-df88bd24fa77&amp;acdnat=1539268308_c9f8e350d61396a39d6e646d36e96bcb|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=|pages=54-62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional liability, responsivity, psychological responses to positive and negative picture stimuli have all been a result of sleep deprivation. 

Doctors today are using neuroimaging to connect the relationship between sleep and neural mechanisms that cause emotional responsively in children. There studies resulted, "In general, the largest and most extensive sleep-related correlations for any emotion were found for disgust expressions" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

== Emotional Responsivity in Children with Autism ==

There was a study done involving twenty six children with autism and fifteen children with other learning disabilities, in which an adult displayed some form of emotion to study how the children respond. They focused on attention, hedonic tone, latency to changes in tone and a emotional contagion summery was made. Studies showed correlations between measures of joint attention, emotional contagion, and the severity of autism. Results showed that children with autism did not demonstrate changes in affect, however their responses occurred much less than in comparison groups.

'''Ex-Rad''' (or '''Ex-RAD'''), also known by the code name '''ON 01210.Na''', or '''recilisib sodium''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Approved Name|USAN]]) is a drug developed by Onconova Therapeutics and the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name=pr2010&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-09/poc-otp092710.php |title=Onconova Therapeutics presents new data demonstrating radioprotection by Ex-RAD at RRS annual meeting |date=2010-09-27 |publisher=EurekAlert |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xNPCFCyV?url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-09/poc-otp092710.php |archivedate=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This newly developed compound is said to be a potent radiation protection agent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Chemically, it is the sodium salt of 4-carboxystyryl-4-chlorobenzylsulfone.&lt;ref name=ghosh2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1667/RR1367.1 |title=Radiation Protection by a New Chemical Entity, Ex-Rad: Efficacy and Mechanisms |year=2009 |last1=Ghosh |first1=Sanchita P. |last2=Perkins |first2=Michael W. |last3=Hieber |first3=Kevin |last4=Kulkarni |first4=Shilpa |last5=Kao |first5=Tzu-Cheg |last6=Reddy |first6=E.

==Clinical trials==
The results of two [[Clinical trial#Phase I|Phase I]] clinical studies in healthy human volunteers indicate that subcutaneously injected Ex-Rad is safe and well tolerated, with "no evidence of systemic side effects".&lt;ref name=onsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onconova.com/exrad.shtml |title=Ex-RAD® for Protection from Radiation Injury |year=2009 |publisher=Onconova Therapeutics |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xNOvmmk0?url=http://www.onconova.com/exrad.shtml |archivedate=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in mice demonstrated the efficacy of Ex-Rad by increasing the survival rate of mice exposed to typically lethal whole-body irradiation. The study tested oral and [[parenteral]] administration of Ex-Rad for both pre- and post-exposure radiomitigation.&lt;ref name=pr2010 /&gt;

Research on Ex-Rad has involved collaboration with the [[Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute]] (AFRRI), the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology at [[Georgetown University]], [[Long Island University]]'s Arnold &amp; Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy, and the Department of Oncological Sciences at the [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine|Mt. Sinai School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=pr2010 /&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Onconova suggests that Ex-Rad protects cells exposed to radiation against DNA damage, and that the drug's mechanism of action does not involve scavenging [[free radicals]] or arresting the [[cell cycle]]. Instead, they claim it employs a "novel mechanism" involving "intracellular signaling, damage sensing, and DNA repair pathways".&lt;ref name=onsite /&gt; Ex-RAD is a chlorobenzylsulfone derivative that works after free radicals have damaged DNA. Onconova CEO Ramesh Kumar believes this is a better approach than trying to scavenge free radicals. “Free radicals are very short-lived, and so the window of opportunity to give a drug is very narrow,” he says. In cell and animal models, Ex-RAD protects [[hematopoietic]] and [[gastrointestinal]] tissues from radiation injury when given either before or after exposure.&lt;ref name="cen"/&gt;

Washington, DC.  [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sw_swppp_guide.pdf “Developing Your Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan: A Guide for Construction Sites.”] Document No. EPA-833-R-060-04. May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''fiber roll''' is a temporary [[erosion control]] and [[sediment control]] device used on [[construction]] sites to protect [[water quality]] in nearby streams, rivers, lakes and seas from sediment erosion. It is made of [[straw]], [[coconut]] fiber or similar material formed into a tubular roll.

==Installation==
Each horizontal contour level row of fiber rolls is installed on slopes, ending with one at the base of the slope, below an active construction area before [[soil]] disturbance (earth moving) begins. The space between  each row of fiber roll is dependent on the steepness of the slope.  The steeper the slope, the more rows of evenly spaced horizontal contour level fiber rolls are used. Each fiber roll is installed on a horizontal contour level in shallow trenches 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) deep and fastened to the ground with wooden stakes.

Properly installed fiber rolls are effective at trapping [[sediment]], generally more effectively than [[straw bale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA.
[http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/Documents/Construction/SE-5.pdf "California Stormwater BMP Handbook: Fiber Rolls."] Fact Sheet No. SE-5. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA. [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=121 "National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices: Fiber Rolls."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905033857/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=121 |date=2007-09-05 }} June 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During rain storms, the rolls intercept surface [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] (but not concentrating or channeling the  runoff) and reduce the velocity of flow. Water passes through a fiber roll while leaving behind the sediment on the uphill side of the roll, thereby reducing sediment [[erosion]].

==Limitations==
Fiber Rolls have several limitations to their uses:&lt;ref name="Fiber Rolls"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiber Rolls|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=factsheet_results&amp;view=specific&amp;bmp=121|work=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=14 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214224255/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=factsheet_results&amp;view=specific&amp;bmp=121|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Fiber rolls may be difficult to move once they become saturated with water.
*Fiber rolls should not be used on very steep land that is prone to mudslides, landslides or creep.
*If fiber rolls are not properly staked into the ground, they may be carried away by high flows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4311">A '''Guideline Daily Amount''' ('''GDA''') is a [[nutrition facts label]] that originally began in 1998 as a collaboration between the UK government, the food industry and consumer organizations. The process was overseen by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD). To help consumers make sense of the nutrition information provided on food labels, they translate science into consumer friendly information, providing guidelines on pack that help consumers put the nutrition information they read on a food label into the context of their overall diet.

GDAs are guidelines for healthy adults and children about the approximate amount of calories, fat, saturated fat, total sugars, and sodium/salt. The GDA labels have the percentage of daily value per serving and the absolute amount per serving of these categories. The front-of-packages (FOP) GDAs must at least have calories listed, but the back-of-package (BOP) GDAs must list, at a minimum, these five.&lt;ref name="mainpage"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foodlabel.org.uk/label/gda_values.aspx | title=Guideline Daily Amounts (Using the front of pack label) | work=Label | accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified version of the GDA system was adopted by the Australian food and beverage industry in 2006 and called the 'Daily Intake Guide'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydailyintake.net/ Daily Intake Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digwebsite.squarespace.com/dig-story/ | title=Daily Intake Guide | work=The DIG Story | accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the original GDA system analysis as adopted as an industry standard in the European Union and in 2012 a variant was adopted in the US and called 'Facts Up Front'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factsupfront.org/ Facts Up Front]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since introduction into the world outside the UK there has been controversy on what the GDAs actually show, for example, calculating a personal R.I., which is dependent on a person's height, weight, amount of daily activity and age, an intake rating which is about 5-10% above what that person should actually be eating and drinking. When calculating the GDAs the CIAA uses the average caloric intake needed for women because this best fits the needs of the majority of the population. Women need, on average, between 1800–2200 kilocalories (kcal) a day whereas children need between 1500–2000 kcal and men 2200–2700 kcal.&lt;ref name=mainpage/&gt; In March 2009, the European Food Safety Authority published its opinion on intake levels for Europe and they were consistent with numbers behind the GDAs developed in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gda.ciaa.eu/custom_documents/documents/consumers/FDF_GDA%20Brochure_2010.pdf | title=Improving the food literacy of consumers | accessdate=August 12, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817022413/http://gda.ciaa.eu/custom_documents/documents/consumers/FDF_GDA%20Brochure_2010.pdf | archivedate=August 17, 2011 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, not all categories are equal.  While a GDA for calorific intake might represent a broad target in so far as people need to take in a minimum of calories to survive, the GDA for saturated fat is not a target, as ingesting no saturated fats at all would not be harmful to health, so long as there were fats of a non-saturated variety in the diet.

GDAs are now in widespread use across the food industry and appear both on the front and back of food packaging.

In 2014, GDAs were beginning to be replaced by [[reference intakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GDA: Food &amp; drink labelling|url=http://www.gdalabel.org.uk/gda/reference-intakes.aspx|publisher=Food and Drink Federation|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Hamilton Laughlin''' (March 11, 1880&amp;nbsp;– January 26, 1943) was an American educator, eugenicist, and sociologist. He served as the Superintendent of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] from its inception in 1910 to its closing in 1939, and was among the most active individuals in influencing American eugenics policy, especially [[compulsory sterilization]] legislation.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Harry Hamilton Laughlin was born March 11, 1880 in [[Oskaloosa, Iowa]]. He graduated from the First District Normal School (now [[Truman State University]]) in [[Kirksville, Missouri]]. In 1917, he earned a Doctor of Science from [[Princeton University]] in the field of [[cell biology|cytology]].

===Career===
==== Eugenics Record Office ====
He worked as a high school teacher and principal before his interest turned to eugenics. This led to his correspondence with [[Charles Davenport]], an early researcher into [[Mendelian inheritance]] in the United States. In 1910, Davenport asked Laughlin to move to [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to serve as the superintendent of his new research office.

The [[Eugenics Record Office]] (ERO) was founded at [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York]], by Davenport with initial support from [[Mary Williamson Averell]] (Mrs. E. H. Harriman) and [[John Harvey Kellogg]], and later by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laughlin|first=Harry|title=Eugenical Sterilization in the United States|url=http://alexwellerstein.com/laughlin/|publisher=PSYCHOPATHIC LABORATORY OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF CHICAGO|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laughlin was made the managing director and was zealous in pursuing the goals of the institution, even co-writing a ''eugenical comedy in four acts'' for performance at the ERO for the amusement of the field workers being trained. He regularly lectured to various groups around the country.

Laughlin provided extensive statistical testimony to the [[United States Congress]] in support of the Johnson-Reed [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. Part of his testimony dealt with "excessive" [[insanity]] among [[immigrant]]s from [[southern Europe]] and [[eastern Europe]]. He was eventually appointed as an ''expert eugenics agent'' to the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization (the 1924 law applied national-origin quotas on immigrants, which stopped the large [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Russians|Russian]] influx of the early 1900s). At least one contemporary scientist, bacterial geneticist [[Herbert Spencer Jennings]], condemned Laughlin's statistics as invalid because they compared recent immigrants to more settled immigrants.

In 1927, the [[Eugenics Research Association]], of which Laughlin was an officer, began a study of the heritage of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]]. Some senators were enthusiastic, others reluctantly complied, while Senator [[William Cabell Bruce]] questioned whether eugenics was even a science and refused to participate. Laughlin wrote to Bruce's hometown newspaper in an attempt to get the information.

==== Sterilization laws ====&lt;!-- Linked from Eugenical Sterilization in the United States --&gt;
One of Laughlin's key interests was to aid in the proliferation of [[compulsory sterilization]] legislation in the United States, which would presumably sterilize the "unfit" members of the population. By 1914, twelve states had already passed sterilization laws, beginning with [[Indiana]] in 1907 and [[Connecticut]] in 1909. However, the laws were not employed with significant vigor, with the exception of [[California]]. In his study of this "problem," Laughlin deduced that much of the state sterilization legislation was poorly worded and left it open to questions of constitutionality and confusion over bureaucratic responsibility. As a result, Laughlin drafted the ''[[Model Eugenical Sterilization Law]]'', a [[model act]] for compulsory sterilization, intended to satisfy these difficulties. He published the proposal in his 1922 study of American sterilization policy, ''Eugenical Sterilization in the United States.'' It included as subjects for eugenic sterilization: the feeble-minded, the insane, criminals, epileptics, alcoholics, blind persons, deaf persons, deformed persons, and indigent persons. An additional eighteen states passed laws based on Laughlin's model, including [[Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924|Virginia in 1924]].

The first person ordered sterilized in Virginia under the new law was [[Carrie Buck]], on the grounds that she was the "''probable potential parent of socially inadequate offspring.''" A lawsuit ensued and Laughlin, who had never met Buck, gave a deposition endorsing her suitability for sterilization, calling the family members of ''"the shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of anti-social whites of the South".'' Other scientists from the ERO testified in person. The state won the case, which was appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1927. The resulting case, ''[[Buck v. Bell]],'' upheld the constitutionality of the laws that Laughlin helped write. Five months after the court confirmed the law, Carrie Buck was sterilized. A law allowing for the sterilization of repeat criminals was overturned in 1942, in ''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma]],'' but sterilizations of mental patients continued into the 1970s. Altogether more than 60,000 Americans were sterilized. Virginia repealed its sterilization law in 1974. Laughlin also supported the passage of Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act]], which outlawed [[miscegenation]]. In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that law in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]].''

==== Association with German eugenics ====
The [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] of [[Nazi Germany]] passed the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] in 1933, closely based on Laughlin's model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Better for All the World: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity | last = Bruinius | first = Harry | publisher = [[Vintage Books]] | place = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-375-71305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 35,000 and 80,000 persons were sterilized in the first full year alone. (It is now known that over 350,000 persons were sterilized). Laughlin was awarded an honorary degree by the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1936 for his work behalf of the "science of [[ethnic cleansing|racial cleansing]]." (Five other Americans received honorary degrees the same year). However, reports about the extensive use of compulsory sterilization in Germany began to appear in US newspapers. By the end of the decade, eugenics had become associated with [[Nazism]] and poor science. Support for groups like the [[American Eugenics Society]] began to fade. In 1935, a review panel convened by the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute]] concluded that the ERO's research did not have scientific merit. By 1939, the Institute withdrew funding for the ERO, and the office was forced to close.

Laughlin was a founding member of the [[Pioneer Fund]], and was its first president, serving from 1937 to 1941. The Pioneer Fund was created by [[Wickliffe Draper]] in order to promote the ''betterment of the race'' through eugenics. Draper had been supporting the Eugenics Research Association and its ''Eugenical News'' since 1932. One of the first projects that Laughlin pursued for the Fund was the distribution of two films from Germany depicting the success of eugenic programs in that country. A biographer has described Laughlin as "among the most racist and anti-Semitic of early twentieth-century eugenicists."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul A. Lombardo|Lombardo, Paul A.]] "The American Breed": Nazi Eugenics and the Origins of the Pioneer Fund. ''[[Albany Law Review]]'', Vol. 65, No. 3, P. 822.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World government ====
As well as his interest in eugenics, Laughlin was fascinated by the idea of establishing a world government. He worked on his plans for this institution throughout his adult life. The world government model that he devised was loosely based on the [[U.S. Constitution]] and the [[League of Nations]]. The allotment of representation in the body was heavily biased in favor of Europe and North America, particularly Great Britain and the United States. Laughlin believed that his world government model would promote the eugenicist aim of preventing the intermixing of different races. Many leading internationalists expressed interest in Laughlin's world government plan, including [[Edward M. House]], [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s foreign policy adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-gilded-age-and-progressive-era/article/making-the-world-safe-for-eugenics-the-eugenicist-harry-h-laughlins-encounters-with-american-internationalism1/3C5A5B5B6F3EA7CE705A0E6605EAEDAB|title=Making the World Safe for Eugenics: The Eugenicist Harry H.

===Personal life===
He was married to Pansy Laughlin in 1902, and they did not have children. They resided in [[Missouri]] in retirement. After his retirement from the Eugenics Record Office they returned to Kirksville in December 1939. Dr. Laughlin died January 26, 1943, and was buried near his father and mother in Highland Park Cemetery in Kirksville.

'''Healthcare in Singapore''' is supervised by the [[Ministry of Health (Singapore)|Ministry of Health]] of the [[Singapore Government]]. It largely consists of a government-run [[Universal health care|universal healthcare system]] with a significant [[private healthcare]] sector. In addition, financing of healthcare costs is done through a mixture of direct government subsidies, compulsory savings, national healthcare insurance, and [[cost sharing]].

Singapore generally has an efficient and widespread system of healthcare. Singapore was ranked 6th in the [[World Health Organization]]'s ranking of the world's health systems in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore ranked world's No. 2 for health-care outcomes: EIU|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-ranked-worlds-no-2-for-health-care-outcomes-eiu |website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg Global Health Index of 163 countries ranked Singapore the 4th healthiest country in the world and first in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore healthiest Asian country; Italy tops global list despite economic crisis|url=http://www.ibtimes.sg/italy-named-worlds-healthiest-country-despite-economic-crisis-8576 |website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to global consulting firm [[Towers Watson]], Singapore has "one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes".&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"&gt;John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 "The Singapore health system – achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure"], Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419231253/http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 |date=19 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to a combination of a strong reliance on medical savings accounts, [[cost sharing]], and government regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/upshot/what-makes-singapores-health-care-so-cheap.html|title=What Makes Singapore’s Health Care So Cheap?|last=Carroll|first=Aaron E.|date=2 October 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=24 October 2017|last2=Frakt|first2=Austin|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government regularly adjusts policies to actively regulate "the supply and prices of healthcare services in the country" in an attempt to keep costs in check. However, for the most part the government does not directly regulate the costs of private medical care. These costs are largely subject to market forces, and vary enormously within the [[private sector]], depending on the medical specialty and service provided.&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore" /&gt; However, Towers Watson has claimed that the specific features of the Singapore healthcare system are unique, and have been described as a "very difficult system to replicate in many other countries." Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programmes.&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore" /&gt;

==Public health system==
Since the 1990s, all [[public hospital]]s, [[polyclinic]]s, and specialty centres have been restructured as government-owned corporations, and operate under three healthcare groups or "clusters":
# [[National Healthcare Group]]
# [[National University Health System]]
# [[SingHealth]]

The 8 public hospitals comprise 6 acute general hospitals ([[Singapore General Hospital|SGH]], [[National University Hospital|NUH]], [[Changi General Hospital|CGH]], [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital|TTSH]], [[Khoo Teck Puat Hospital|KTPH]] &amp; [[Ng Teng Fong General Hospital|NTFGH]]), a women's and children's hospital ([[KK Women's and Children's Hospital|KKH]]) and a psychiatry hospital ([[Institute of Mental Health (Singapore)|IMH]]).&lt;ref name="Hospital Services"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Hospital Services | work = | website = Ministry of Health, Singapore | publisher = Ministry of Health, Singapore | date = | url = https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/our_healthcare_system/Healthcare_Services/Hospitals.html | doi = | accessdate = July 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are 8 national specialty centres for cancer ([[National Cancer Centre Singapore|NCCS]]), cardiac ([[National Heart Centre Singapore|NHCS]]), eye ([[Singapore National Eye Centre|SNEC]]), skin ([[National Skin Centre|NSC]]), neuroscience ([[National Neuroscience Institute|NNI]]), dental care ([[National Dental Centre Singapore|NDCS]]) and a medical centre for multiple disciplines ([[National University Cancer Institute, Singapore|NCIS]] and [[National University Heart Centre, Singapore|NHCS]]).&lt;ref name="Hospital Services"/&gt;

As of 2012, Singapore had a total of 10,225 doctors in its healthcare system, giving a doctor to population ratio of 1:520. The nurse (including midwives) to population ratio was 1:150, with a total of 34,507 nurses. There were 1,645 dentists, giving a ratio of 1 dentist to 3,230 people.&lt;ref name=MOH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126024055/https://www.doctorpage.sg/doctors|title=Find a Doctor in Singapore - DoctorPage|date=26 January 2013|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 70–80% of Singaporeans obtain their medical care within the public health system. Overall government spending on public healthcare amounts to 1.6% of annual GDP. This amounted to an average of $1,104 Government Health Expenditure per person.&lt;ref name=MOH&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Health Facts|url=http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/statistics/Health_Facts_Singapore.html|publisher=Ministry of Health, Singapore|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health-related spending is the third largest expenditure item, after defence and education expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singapore-budget-2017/a-smaller-budget-surplus-of-s191b-likely-for-fy17|title=A smaller budget surplus of S$1.91b likely for FY17|last=Ramchandani|first=Nisha|date=21 February 2017|work=The Business Times|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the median age of the population increases, Singapore's healthcare spending is expected to rise. Healthcare spending has risen from $4 billion in 2011 to $9.8 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/new-ways-to-fund-better-long-term-care|title=Long-term care: If this is so important, why aren't we putting our money where our mouth is?|last=Basu|first=Radha|date=7 October 2017|work=The Straits Times|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==
Singapore's healthcare system uses a mixed financing system that includes nationalised life insurance schemes and deductions from the compulsory savings plan, or the [[Central Provident Fund]] (CPF), for working Singaporeans and permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing.html|title=Costs and Financing|last=|first=|date=|work=Ministry of Health|access-date=22 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism is intended to reduce the overuse of healthcare services.

===Medisave===
Medisave is a medical savings account under an individual's CPF account that is used for payment of future medical expenses as well as premiums of medical insurance policies. Funds can be pooled within and across an entire extended family

===Medishield===
Launched in 1990, Medishield is a low cost basic insurance scheme intended for those whose savings are insufficient to meet their medical expenses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/brunch/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-integrated-shield-plans|title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Integrated Shield Plans|last=Huang|first=Claire|date=15 July 2017|work=The Business Times|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premiums can be paid out of Medisave accounts. A new scheme, '''Medishield Life''', replaced the Medishield in November 2015. Co-insurance payment rates are to be reduced from 10–20% to 3–10% and the lifetime claim limit is to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/medishield-life-coverage-to-kick-in-at-midnight|title=MediShield Life coverage to kick in at midnight|last=Khalik|first=Salma|date=31 October 2015|work=The Straits Times|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme helps to pay for hospital bills and selected outpatient treatments. The government provides premium subsidies to lower- to middle-income residents, the elderly and new policyholders transitioning from cheaper policies.

The '''Integrated Shield Plan''' (IP) includes both the MediShield Life component and an additional private insurance coverage component run by private insurers, to cover for optional benefits in public hospitals and private hospitals. Premiums for the IP can be paid by the Medisave funds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Eldershield===
'''Eldershield''' is a severe disability insurance scheme which insures against the cost of private nursing homes and related expenses. Since 2002, members with a CPF Medisave account will automatically be enrolled in the scheme at the age of 40, unless they choose to opt out. Three private insurers, [[Aviva]], [[Great Eastern Life|Great Eastern]] and [[NTUC Income]] were chosen to manage ElderShield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/govt-studying-proposal-take-over-running-eldershield|title=Govt studying proposal to take over running of ElderShield|last=Tan|first=Weizhen|date=7 July 2017|work=TODAY|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 1.2 million policyholders as of 2015, with $2.6 billion collected in premiums, and around $100 million in payout claims and $130 million in premium rebates between 2002 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/s-90m-paid-out-in-eldershield-claims-since-its-2002-launch-8078248|title=S$90m paid out in ElderShield claims since its 2002 launch|last=|first=|date=4 April 2016|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024205038/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/s-90m-paid-out-in-eldershield-claims-since-its-2002-launch-8078248|archive-date=2017-10-24|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/20170206008/OQ-6%20Feb%202017.pdf|title=Parliamentary Debates Singapore – Official Report|last=|first=|date=|website=National Archives of Singapore|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medifund===
In addition to the insurance schemes, '''Medifund''' is government endowment fund for those who are unable to meet their assessed contribution. Risks are not pooled, so an individual may be exposed to catastrophic expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of $155.2 million was allocated to patients in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/medifund-assistance-dropped-s1552m-last-year|title=Medifund assistance dropped to S$155.2m last year|last=|first=|date=24 November 2016|work=TODAY|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidies===
Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents warded in public hospitals receive government subsidies for their medical fees, which scale according to their chosen class of ward as well as their income. Since 1 January 2009, patients warded in B2 and C class wards in public hospitals undergo means testing to determine the level of subsidy they are entitled to, based on the average monthly income received over the last available 12-month period including bonuses for salaried employees. However, patients receiving services such as Day Surgery, A&amp;E services, Specialist Outpatient and polyclinic visits receive standardised subsidies regardless of income without requiring means testing.

People with no income, such as retirees or housewives, will have their subsidy rate pegged to the value of their homes, whereas all unemployed residents of HDB flats excluding those in executive condominiums (EC) will be entitled to the highest tier of subsidy.

As follows is a table detailing the subsidies available:

==Private healthcare==
The increasingly large private sector provides care to those who are privately insured, foreign patients, or public patients who are able to afford what often amounts to very large out-of-pocket payments above the levels provided by government subsidies.

The government uses the capacity of the private sector to reduce waiting times in the public sector.  In 2015 it plans to use the [[Raffles Medical Group]] to receive non-critical ambulance cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical tourism===
In October 2003, acting Minister for Health [[Khaw Boon Wan]] launched SingaporeMedicine to promote Singapore as a regional medical hub. He said more than 200,000 foreigners visited Singapore for medical services in 2002 and that the Economic Review Committee reaffirmed its ambition of serving 1 million foreign patients annually by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2018/10/02/sg-medical-tourism-started-by-khaw-asking-philip-yeo-to-implement-khaw-exhorts-yeo-with-may-the-force-be-with-you/|title=SG medical tourism started by Khaw asking Philip Yeo to implement - Khaw exhorts Yeo with 'May the Force be with you' - The Online Citizen|date=2 October 2018|website=Theonlinecitizen.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, Khaw said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"SingaporeMedicine that we are launching today shall be the rallying point and a powerful symbol of our collective will and commitment towards this ambition...

In three specialties alone, heart, eye and cancer, I see tens of millions of middle-class patients within a 7-hour flying radius, waiting to be served. If they can be attracted here, they will keep us all very busy...

This is my dream for Singapore as the regional medical hub, where regional doctors and nurses compete to work here to learn, and where international patients seek us out for care and treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/speeches/view-html?filename=2003102098.htm|title=Speech By Ag Minister Khaw Boon Wan, At The Launch Of Singaporemedicine, 20 October 2003, 4.00 Pm|website=Nas.gov.sg|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== National Electronic Record Programme ===
The National Electronic Record Programme was launched in 2011 and is used by more than 280 institutions to support [[telehealth]] and [[telemedicine]].&lt;ref name="Palgrave"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pioneer Generation Package === 
The [[Pioneer Generation Package]] (PGP) is a S$9 billion package launched in 2014 aimed at helping approximately 450,000 Singaporeans born on or before 31 December 1949 and obtained citizenship before 31 December 1986 through a series of healthcare and social support schemes over an estimated 20-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Budget 2015 Annex B-1: Pioneer Generation Package|url=http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/data/budget_2014/download/annexb1.pdf|website=Singaporebudget.gov.sg|accessdate = 27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/pioneer-generation-package | title=PIONEER GENERATION PACKAGE | accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Shortage of hospital beds===

The '''Holmes and Rahe stress scale''' is a list of 43 [[Stress (medicine)|stressful]] life events that can contribute to [[illness]].

==Development==
In 1967, [[psychiatrist]]s [[Thomas Holmes (psychiatrist)|Thomas Holmes]] and [[Richard Rahe]] examined the medical records of over 5,000 medical patients as a way to determine whether stressful events might cause illnesses. Patients were asked to tally a list of 43 life events based on a relative score. A positive [[Correlation_and_dependence|correlation]] of 0.118 was found between their life events and their illnesses.

Their results were published as the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS),&lt;ref name="pmid6059863"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes TH, Rahe RH |title=The Social Readjustment Rating Scale |journal=J Psychosom Res |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=213–8 |year=1967 |pmid=6059863 |doi=10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; known more commonly as the '''Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale'''.  Subsequent validation has supported the links between stress and illness.&lt;ref name="pmid346993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rahe RH, Arthur RJ |title=Life change and illness studies: past history and future directions |journal=J Human Stress |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=3–15 |year=1978 |pmid=346993 |doi=10.1080/0097840X.1978.9934972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting research==
Rahe carried out a study in 1970 testing the [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of the stress scale as a predictor of illness.&lt;ref name="pmid5495261"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rahe RH, Mahan JL, Arthur RJ |title=Prediction of near-future health change from subjects' preceding life changes |journal=J Psychosom Res |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=401–6 |year=1970 |pmid=5495261 |doi=10.1016/0022-3999(70)90008-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale was given to 2,500 US sailors and they were asked to rate scores of 'life events' over the previous six months. Over the next six months, detailed records were kept of the sailors' health.  There was a +0.118 correlation between stress scale scores and illness, which was sufficient to support the hypothesis of a link between life events and illness.&lt;ref name="pmid4648894"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rahe RH, Biersner RJ, Ryman DH, Arthur RJ |title=Psychosocial predictors of illness behavior and failure in stressful training |journal=J Health Soc Behav |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=393–7 |year=1972 |pmid=4648894 |doi= 10.2307/2136831|jstor=2136831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the [[Cornell University|Cornell]] medical index assessing, the stress scale correlated with visits to medical dispensaries, and the H&amp;R stress scale's scores also correlated independently with individuals dropping out of stressful [[underwater demolition]]s training due to medical problems.&lt;ref name="pmid4648894"/&gt; The scale was also assessed against different populations within the [[United States]] (with [[African American|African]], [[Mexican people|Mexican]] and [[White American]] groups).&lt;ref name="pmid5685294"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Komaroff AL, Masuda M, Holmes TH |title=The social readjustment rating scale: a comparative study of Negro, Mexican and white Americans |journal=J Psychosom Res |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=121–8 |year=1968 |pmid=5685294 |doi=10.1016/0022-3999(68)90018-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale was also tested [[Cross-cultural psychology|cross-culturally]], comparing [[Japan]]ese&lt;ref name="pmid6059865"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Masuda M, Holmes TH |title=The Social Readjustment Rating Scale: a cross-cultural study of Japanese and Americans |journal=J Psychosom Res |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=227–37 |year=1967 |pmid=6059865 |doi=10.1016/0022-3999(67)90012-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malaysia]]n&lt;ref name=Woon1971&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woon, T.H. |author2=Masuda, M. |author3=Wagner, N.N. |author4= Holmes, T.H.  |year=1971 |title=The Social Readjustment Rating Scale: A Cross-Cultural Study of Malaysians and Americans |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=373–386 |doi=10.1177/002202217100200407 |url=http://jcc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/2/4/373 |accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; groups with American populations.

== Adults ==
To measure stress according to the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale, the number of "Life Change Units" that apply to events in the past year of an individual's life are added and the final score will give a rough estimate of how stress affects health.

Hwabyung is a colloquial and somewhat inaccurate name, as it refers to the etiology of the disorder rather than its symptoms or apparent characteristics. Hwabyung is similar to [[Amuk]]. Hwabyung is known as a [[culture-bound syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Min2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=4 |number=1 |title=Hwabyung in Korea: Culture and Dynamic Analysis |last=Min |first=Sung Kil |publisher=World association of cultural psychiatry |journal=World Cultural Psychiatry Research Review |url=http://www.wcprr.org/pdf/04-01/2009.01.1221.pdf |year=Jan 2009 |issn=1932-6270 |pages=12–21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813080043/http://www.wcprr.org/pdf/04-01/2009.01.1221.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word hwabyung is composed of ''hwa'' (the Chinese-Korean word for "fire" which can also contextually mean "anger") and ''byung'' (the Chinese-Korean word for "syndrome" or "illness").&lt;ref&gt;Min, Sung Kil.

*familial stressors, e.g. [[spousal infidelity]] or conflict with in-laws
*witnessing acts/actions/phenomena that conflict with one's own moral and/or ethical principles

The syndrome itself is believed to be the result of the continued repression of feelings of anger without addressing their source. In [[holistic medicine]] the containment of anger in hwabyung disturbs the balance of the [[Wu Xing|five bodily elements]], resulting in the development of [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] symptoms such as panic, insomnia, and depression after a long period of repressed feelings.

It is possible that hormonal imbalances such as those around the time of [[menopause]] may also be an underlying cause of hwabyung in middle-aged women, the most often-diagnosed demographic.

==Treatment==
Western doctors are more likely to diagnose it as a kind of stress or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' currently lists ''hwabyeong'' among its culture-bound illnesses. Outside of Korea, informally ''hwabyeong'' may be mistaken as a reference to a psychological profile marked by a short temper, or explosive, generally bellicose behavior. To the contrary, ''hwabyeong'' is a traditional psychological term used to refer to a condition characterized by passive suffering, is roughly comparable to depression, and is typically associated with older women.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, M. (2011, August 22). Identifying and treating the culture‐bound syndrome of Hwa-Byung among older Korean immigrant women: Recommendations for practitioners. Retrieved March 5, 2013, from EbscoHost [http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=7&amp;sid=f4fd4368-6cc8-4c25-a799-d1fc7270eb40%40sessionmgr15&amp;hid=3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2011-08591-002].&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that when diagnosing Hwabyeong, the culture of the patient is well understood. Since Hwabyeong can often be misdiagnosed as depression, the symptoms and culture need to be clearly and thoroughly looked into. Once Hwabyeong has been diagnosed, past treatments need to be reviewed. The treatments for the patient can then be a combination of pharmacological, and therapy-based interventions.

The treatment methods used to combat hwabyung include [[psychotherapy]], [[pharmaceutical drug|drug treatment]], [[family therapy]], and community approaches. To be more successful psychiatrists might need to incorporate the teachings from traditional and religious healing methods or the use of han-puri, which is the sentiment of resolving, loosening, unraveling and appeasing negative emotions with positive ones. One example of hann-puri would be a mother who has suffered from poverty, less education, a violent husband, or a harsh mother-in-law, can be solved many years later by the success of her son for which she had endured hardships and sacrifices.&lt;ref name=Min2009/&gt;

The '''ideographic approach''' refers to the idea in [[psychology]] proposed by [[Brysbaert]] that the conclusions of a study stay limited to the phenomenon under study.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3242">'''Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Baudin Victor''' (23 October 1811 [[Nantua]] - 3 December 1851 Paris) was a French physician and deputy to the [[Assembly in 1849]] famous for having been killed on a [[barricade]].

==Career==
He studied medicine in Lyon and Paris. 
He served as a medical officer in Algeria, where he met [[Eugène Cavaignac]].

==The events of 1851 ==
Baudin was initiated into Freemasonry on 15 June 1842, at the Lodge Hall Friends of Honor French , which was suspended in 1846 3 .

Elected on 13 May 1849, he sat with representatives of the Mountain, and is part of the resistance committee organized by the Republicans to try to raise the workers of the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]] against the ''coup d'etat'' of 2 December 1851, of Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (later Emperor Napoleon III).

During the insurrection caused by the coup, a barricade was erected on 3 December by the workers of the Sainte-Marguerite, who were joined by several members, including: [[Pierre Malardier]], Member of Nièvre and Baudin, representative of the Ain to the Legislative Assembly in 1849. 
While Victor Schoelcher, accompanied by several MPs, without arms, went out to meet a company of the 19th line coming from the [[Place de la Bastille]] with the intention to negotiate with the soldiers, laborers mocked these representatives of the people, saying: "Do you think we'll get us killed for you to keep your five dollars a day!"  Baudin, flag in hand, mounted on the barricade stared and said: "You'll see how to die for five dollars!."
It was at that time a rock wounded a soldier of 19th line. 
His comrades immediately replied angrily, and Baudin fell, mortally wounded.
The word repeatedly reported is however not attested by any eyewitness. 
It appears in the historical narrative of journalist [[Eugene Ténot]] of Paris in December 1851 written in 1868. 

A public subscription was then launched by the newspaper ''The Rise'' to raise a monument to martyr of freedom. 
This initiative earned [[Louis Charles Delescluze]], publisher of a trial in which [[Léon Gambetta]], then a young lawyer, distinguished himself. 

The monument, located behind the Place de la Bastille on the avenue Ledru-Rollin near the spot where he was killed, was dismantled in 1942 to be melted under a law of the Vichy government to "recovery Nonferrous Metals". 
The mayor of Paris has recently refused to reinstate it. 
The city, however, gave in 1978 the name of rue Alphonse Baudin in a new way the 11th arrondissement.

==Legacy==
He was buried secretly at [[Montmartre Cemetery]], where his grave became a place of rendezvous for Republicans. 
His remains were deposited in the [[Panthéon, Paris]], on 4 August 1889 for the Centennial of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/1789-1889/Tome_1/BAUDET-LAFARGE_BAVOUX.PDF|title=Baudet, Jean-Baptiste|publisher=Assmeblee Nationale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kes''' is a fictional character, portrayed by actress [[Jennifer Lien]], who appears in the American [[Science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] and [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] crew of the starship [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] after they are stranded in the [[Delta Quadrant]], far from the rest of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]].  

== Arc ==

=== Television ===
Kes was born on [[stardate]] 2369 on the planet Ocampa in the [[Delta Quadrant]]. As part of the Ocampa species, she has [[telepathy]] and an average life expectancy of nine years. The Ocampa live in an underground city created by an alien known as the Caretaker, who had inadvertently destroyed the planet's atmosphere and ecosystem. The Caretaker provides food and water for the Ocampa, who become dependent on his care. Kes hopes to develop her [[Psionics|psionic powers]], which her ancestors were rumored to have possessed with great proficiency. After finding a way to the planet's surface, she is captured and tortured by the Kazon for access to the city and its resources. [[Neelix]] rescues her, and the pair become romantically involved. The Caretaker realizes he is dying and abducts beings from the [[Alpha Quadrant]] to find a suitable mate so he can reproduce and pass the responsibility of caring for the Ocampa to his offspring.  

In "[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]", he kidnaps [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] members and the [[Starfleet]] crew of the starship [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']]. Kes helps their captains [[Kathryn Janeway]] and [[Chakotay]] recover their missing crew members. Janeway destroys the Caretaker's vessel to prevent the Kazon from acquiring the technology, which strands both the Maquis and Starfleet crews in the Delta Quadrant. Kes and Neelix decide to help them as guides.&lt;ref name="caretaker"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Caretaker|series=Star Trek: Voyager|network=UPN|date=January 16, 1995|season=1|number=1 &amp; 2|episodelink=Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|credits=Berman, Rick; Piller, Michael; Taylor, Jeri}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While aboard USS ''Voyager'', Kes starts a [[hydroponics]] garden to provide vegetables and fruit for the crew's meals. She develops a close friendship with [[The Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|the Doctor]] while studying to become his medical assistant. While helping the Doctor develop a better bedside manner and overall set of social skills, Kes pushes for the crew to treat him as a human instead of just a [[hologram]]. The [[Vidiians]] harvest Neelix's lung in "[[Phage (Star Trek: Voyager)|Phage]]", leading to Kes donating one of her own to save his life. During "[[Elogium]]", emanations from space-dwelling lifeforms cause Kes to prematurely enter the elogium, the Ocampa female reproductive state. This condition can only occur once during a Ocampa life cycle. Kes and Neelix disagree over the idea of having children. Neelix eventually agrees to being a father, but Kes decides against conceiving a child. After leaving the lifeforms, the Doctor determines Kes had gone through a false alarm and would be able to go through the elogium in the future.&lt;ref name="elogium"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Elogium|series=Star Trek: Voyager|network=UPN|date=September 18, 1995|season=2|number=4|episodelink=Elogium (Star Trek: Voyager)|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|credits=Biller, Kenneth; Tayor, Jeri; Diggs, Jimmy; Kay, Steve J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When ''USS Voyager'' discovers a second Ocampa colony in "[[Cold Fire (Star Trek: Voyager)|Cold Fire]]", Kes is tutored by its leader Tanis on how to expand her mental abilities. She was also being trained by Tuvok, though he took a more cautious approach focused on control. Under Tanis' tutelage, Kes develops [[pyrokinesis]], but she is unable to control the power and almost kills Tuvok by boiling his blood. Kes discovers that Tanis is collaborating with the Caretaker's mate, Suspiria, to destroy the ship, and she subdues him with her powers. Kes is disturbed by the harm she can do with her abilities, though Tuvok reminds her that she must learn to control, rather than fear, such darker impulses.&lt;ref name="coldfire"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Cold Fire|series=Star Trek: Voyager|network=UPN|date=November 13, 1995|season=1|number=10|episodelink=Cold Fire (Star Trek: Voyager)|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|credits=Braga, Brannon; Williams, Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Warlord (Star Trek: Voyager)|Warlord]]", Tieran takes control of Kes' body and uses her mental powers to stage a coup against his planet's dictator. While under Tieran's influence, Kes breaks up with Neelix. The crew eventually free Kes from Tieran's control and kill him, though she is traumatized by the experience.&lt;ref name="warlord"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Warlord|series=Star Trek: Voyager|network=UPN|date=November 20, 1996|season=3|number=10|episodelink=Warlord (Star Trek: Voyager)|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|credits=Klink, Lisa; Price, Andrew S.; Gaberman, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Doctor grafts other personalities into his program in "[[Darkling (Star Trek: Voyager)|Darkling]]", he develop an evil alternate personality and kidnaps Kes after injuring her suitor, Zahir. Kes considers leaving USS ''Voyager'' for Zahir, though she later decides against this.&lt;ref name="darkling"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Darkling|series=Star Trek: Voyager|network=UPN|date=February 19, 1997|season=3|number=18|episodelink=Darkling (Star Trek: Voyager)|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|credits=Menosky, Joe; Braga, Brannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In "[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]", Kes lives short periods of her life in reverse order, starting with her death and ending with her birth. In this [[alternative timeline]], she [[Tom Paris]], and they have a daughter, Linnis. Linnis marries [[Harry Kim (Star Trek)|Harry Kim]], and they have a son. In this timeline, Kes participates in ''Voyager's'' year-long battle with the Krenim during the "[[Year of Hell]]", becoming infected with particles from a [[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles|chronoton]] torpedo. The Doctor helps Kes return to normal temporal sync, and she documents information about the Krenim and their future attack.&lt;ref name="beforeandafter"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Before and After|series=Star Trek: Voyager|network=UPN|date=April 9, 1997|season=3|number=21|episodelink=Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|credits=Biller, Kenneth}}&lt;/ref&gt; During "[[Scorpion (Star Trek: Voyager)|Scorpion]]", USS ''Voyager'' becomes entangled in a major conflict between the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] and [[Species 8472]].&lt;ref name="scorp1"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Scorpion, Part I|series=Star Trek: Voyager|network=UPN|date=May 21, 1997|season=3|number=26|episodelink=Scorpion (Star Trek: Voyager)|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|credits=Braga, Brannon; Menosky, Joe; Livingston, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scorp2"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Scorpion, Part II|series=Star Trek: Voyager|network=UPN|date=September 3, 1997|season=4|number=1|episodelink=Scorpion (Star Trek: Voyager)|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|credits=Braga, Brannon; Menosky, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially due to her exposure to the powerful telepathic influx of Species 8472, Kes begins to evolve into a different state of being. In "[[The Gift (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Gift]]". she realizes she can no longer remain with ''Voyager'', as her powers threaten to destroy the ship. She uses her newly acquired powers to hurl ''Voyager'' and crew safely beyond Borg space, 9,500 light-years closer to [[Earth in science fiction#Star Trek|Earth]] before turning into living energy. Kes revisits USS ''Voyager'' in "[[Fury (Star Trek: Voyager)|Fury]]", in which she is near the end of life cycle and experiencing memory loss. She mistakenly believes that Janeway kidnapped her from Ocampa, and travels back in time to negotiate with the Vidiians; she promises to help them access the ship to harvest the crews' organs if they take her younger self home. After stopping this plan, Kes creates a hologram to remind her future self about her affection for the crew and how much they had cared for her. The older version of Kes says goodbye to the crew before taking her ship back to Ocampa. 

=== Literature and merchandise ===
Kes is featured in the novel trilogy ''Dark Matters'', where she is primarily shown gathering mutated [[dark matter]]. Referenced as the "Entity", Kes forgot portions of her past and slowly regains her memories over the course of the trilogy by returning the previous locations from the show. She decides to not contact the USS ''Voyager'' crew after being told she is an alternative version of Kes, different from the one present in "Fury". Despite this decision, Tuvok senses her presence before her final departure. The novel trilogy ''String Theory'' reveals the Kes from "Fury" was really the manifestation of her dark side, caused as a side effect during a confrontation with a renegade Nacene (the same species as the Caretaker). Kes reappears to help the Doctor and [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] with the birth of a Ocampa-Nacene hybrid, where she acts as a [[surrogate mother]] for the child. In the 2012 novel ''The Eternal Tide'', Kes assists [[Q (Junior)|Q Junior]] in resurrecting Admiral Janeway after she is assimilated and the Borg Cube she was on was destroyed; Kes' actions restored Janeway's body to its most perfect state after Q was able to teach her how to pull her body back together. For the short story "Restoration", Kes sacrifices herself to revive Ocampa's ecosystem. A [[Mirror Universe|mirror universe]] version of the character is also included in several publications. Aside from these literary appearances, an action figure of Kes was also released.

== Development ==

=== Creation and casting ===
Early development of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' began in July 1993, where producers initially imagined the Ocampa as an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] alien species. In later meetings, they further expanded the Ocampa as having a short lifespan similar to a [[Mayfly]]. Kes was intended to live for only seven years, with changes in her appearance planned for each season to emphasize her age progression.&lt;ref name="Book11"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: pp. 175-177&lt;/ref&gt; The androgyny concept was dropped, as the first cast description identified Kes as a female. The character was initially named Dah.&lt;ref name="Book4"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Producers proposed a second Ocampa, shown near the end of his lifespan, as part of the main cast, though this idea was abandoned in favor of the character [[Neelix]], who was a late addition to the series.&lt;ref name="Book11" /&gt; Kes was initially created as a [[Reconnaissance|scout]] for [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']]'s journey through the Delta Quadrant,&lt;ref name="Book11" /&gt; before Neelix assumed the role of the ship's guide.&lt;ref name="Book4" /&gt; She was then reimagined as a [[medical intern]] instead.&lt;ref name="Book4" /&gt; In an August 1993 memo, series creator [[Jeri Taylor]] suggested Kes have a [[Superhuman abilities|superhuman ability]] and be caught in a war between two factions.&lt;ref name="Book12"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book13"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Producers debated over the nature of the character's psychic powers, leading them to ask production associate Zayra Cabot and the Joan Pearce Research for information on [[parapsychology]].&lt;ref name="AdditionalBookSource1"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; They then agreed to portray Kes with "some measure of telepathic ability" for the pilot episode ("Caretaker"), with the intention of addressing it further in future episodes.&lt;ref name="AdditionalBookSource2"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DawsonMulgrewLien1995.jpg|thumb|left|275px|A 1995 promotional image, featuring Lien (right) with her ''Star Trek: Voyager'' co-stars [[Kate Mulgrew]] (center) and [[Roxann Dawson]] (left)]]

When casting Kes, "Caretaker" director [[Winrich Kolbe]] looked for an actress that "could be fragile, but with a steely will underneath". The casting call specified only women in their early-twenties or younger were considered for the role.&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;[[#GrossAltman1995|Gross &amp; Altman (1995)]]: p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; Producers hired [[Jennifer Lien]] based on her youth and their belief she could embody the character's "somewhat childlike and fragile" qualities and short life span.&lt;ref name="Book8"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Lien was one of the first cast members hired for the series,&lt;ref name="Book8" /&gt; and at the age of nineteen, she was its youngest actor.&lt;ref name="Book8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Book5"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Author Stephen Edward Poe attributed her discomfort during promotional interviews to her age.&lt;ref name="Book8" /&gt; Lien only had a basic understanding of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise prior to receiving the part.&lt;ref name="Book8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Magazine1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Bassom|first=David|date=September 1996|title=Jennifer Lien|magazine=[[Star Trek Monthly]]|location=London|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|issue=19|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said this allowed her to approach her performance without anxiety. She had auditioned for the show due to the opportunity to play a new alien species, and explained "it meant that anything could happen, offering me the chance to learn and grow as an actress".&lt;ref name="Magazine1" /&gt; [[Jennifer Gatti]] was considered as a runner-up for Kes,&lt;ref name="Book22"&gt;[[#GrossAltman1996|Gross &amp; Altman (1996)]]: p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; though she would later [[guest star]] in the episode "[[Non Sequitur (Star Trek: Voyager)|Non Sequitur]]".&lt;ref name="Book32"&gt;[[#Ruditis2003|Ruditis (2003)]]: p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Kes' role in "Caretaker", series creator [[Michael Piller]] said she was supposed to encourage the audience to care about Neelix.&lt;ref name="Book7"&gt;[[#GrossAltman1996|Gross &amp; Altman (1996)]]: p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Piller was concerned the pilot was too "passionless" due to its focus on a [[Action adventure film|action-adventure]] storyline over individual character development;&lt;ref name="Book7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Book15"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; he explained: "The biggest danger in the pilot was in creating a story that nobody cared about."&lt;ref name="Book15" /&gt; In June 1994, [[Robert Blackman]] created the costumes for the episode.&lt;ref name="Book6"&gt;[[#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; He cited Kes' clothing as a challenge since producers were still unclear about the character and Lien was very [[introverted]].

=== Characterization and relationships ===
The "Caretaker" script stated Kes was "a dazzling, ethereal beauty, waifish and fragile", with a "dignity – her bearing, an alertness in her look, that suggests a being of powerful intelligence".&lt;ref name="Book222"&gt;[[#Ruditis2003|Ruditis (2003)]]: p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Star Trek'' official website, the character is described as "a tough survivor and a bit of a rebel".&lt;ref name="Source2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/kes|title=Kes|publisher=[[StarTrek.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140828/http://www.startrek.com/database_article/kes|archive-date=June 12, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 interview, Lien characterized her as "strong and curious and intelligent" despite still being "a child in a way with the same fears and inhibitions and worries that we all have".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finch|first=Amanda|date=September 1996|title=Spotlight – Jennifer Lien|journal=SCI-FI Universe|volume=3|issue=1|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She saw the character's lack of "cynicism or precociousness or pretentiousness or sarcasm" as different from typical young female roles.&lt;ref name="SourceCommentary"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Lien|first=Jennifer|subject-link=Jennifer Lien|interviewer=|title=Cast Reflections: Season One|publisher=[[Paramount Television]]|date=February 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; While referring to "this kind of diversity in a character" as difficult to play,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; she enjoyed the process and said: "It's a joy to pretend to be this extraordinary creature, so open and everything so new."&lt;ref name="SourceCommentary" /&gt; Author [[Paul Ruditis]] summed up the role with the phrase "fragile power", which he identified as a [[paradox]].&lt;ref name="Book222" /&gt; During filming, Lien was not given information about her characters' future storylines prior to receiving the final copies of the scripts. Unlike the show's other actors, she did not campaign for changes to Kes, explaining "I felt my contribution was more in the acting, and not in the writing".&lt;ref name="Magazine2"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Simpson|first1=Paul|last2=Thomas|first2=Ruth|date=March 2000|title=Kes &amp; Tell|magazine=[[Star Trek Monthly]]|location=London|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|issue=76|page=28-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the character's developing mental abilities, Lien felt "it displays another side of Kes which is her confidence in being able to choose a path for her life"; she associated temptation as a key part of her character's arc.&lt;ref name="Magazine3"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=1996|title=Star Trek: Voyager|magazine=[[TV Zone]]|location=London|publisher=[[Visual Imagination]]|issue=23|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comic Book Resources]]' Angie Dahl cited Kes as one of the top twenty most powerful ''Star Trek'' characters based on her powers.&lt;ref name="Source13"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-characters-ranking/|title=Top 20 Strongest Characters In Star Trek, Officially Ranked|last=Dahl|first=Angie|date=June 17, 2018|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EthanPhillips.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Neelix, portrayed by [[Ethan Phillips]] (''pictured''), was Kes' primary relationship on the show.|alt=A headshot of a man looking toward the camera.]]

Kolbe interpreted Kes as the [[alter ego]] to Neelix, citing them as bringing romance and comedy to the series.&lt;ref name="Book1" /&gt; Lien and Neelix's actor [[Ethan Phillips]] said they enjoyed filming their scenes together.&lt;ref name="Book222" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Source19"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-05-05-9505050232-story.html|title=Illinois Native Loves The Alien Role She's In|last=Spelling|first=Ian|date=May 5, 1999|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the couple as having a "traditional young love", Ruditis found Kes to be the more dominant partner do to her ability dispense emotion guidance.&lt;ref name="Book222" /&gt; Although the relationship was introduced in the pilot, he referred to it as "somewhat undefined as the series progressed".&lt;ref name="Book20" /&gt; Writer [[Kenneth Biller]] wanted to establish the pair as living together and sexually active, but Taylor and Berman thought Kes looked too young for those storylines. Biller proposed scenes in which the character talk about sex for the first time as a way to explore "the weirdness of alien sexuality". This discussion lead to dialogue being included in the episode "Elogium".&lt;ref name="Magazine4"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Kutzera|first=Dale|date=1996|title=Star Trek Voyager|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|location=Forrest Park|publisher=CFQ Media, LLC|volume=28|issue=4/5|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips requested the writers provide closure for the couple following their break-up; they denied his request, saying: "No, let's just drop it, let's move on."&lt;ref name="Book20"&gt;[[#Ruditis2003|Ruditis (2003)]]: pp. 158-159&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips viewed the break-up as "muddy" as it occurred as part of Kes' possession.&lt;ref name="BreakUp1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Spelling|first=Ian|date=November 1997|title=Interview – Ethan Phillips|magazine=The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine|location=New York|publisher=[[Starlog]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producers had planned a scene for the episode "[[Fair Trade (Star Trek: Voyager)|Fair Trade]]", in which Kes and Neelix discuss the change in their relationships, but it was removed due to time constraints.&lt;ref name="Book20" /&gt; Berman discussed the couple during a 1997 interview, saying: "There was a relationship with Neelix that didn't work out that well."&lt;ref name="Magazine12"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=December 1997|title=Rick Berman|magazine=Star Trek: Communicator|location=New York|publisher=FANtastic Media|volume=|issue=114|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kes has a more parent-child relationship with Janeway and the Doctor, portrayed by [[Kate Mulgrew]] and [[Robert Picardo]], respectively. Ruditis identified Kes' trust in Janeway as representing her desire to explore the universe.&lt;ref name="Book222" /&gt; Picardo viewed Kes as the Doctor's "sounding board" and "emotional confessor", as she mentored him on being human. Following the removal of Kes from the show, Picardo was concerned the Doctor would be relegated to the role as the [[comic relief]]. He suggested producers inverse the Doctor's relationship with Kes to show him teaching [[Seven of Nine]] about humanity.&lt;ref name="Source18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/star-trek-interview-exclusive/|title=Star Trek Interview Exclusive|last=Edwards|first=Richard|date=July 2, 2012|work=[[GamesRadar+]]|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a darker relationship between the Doctor and Kes was planned for the episode "Darkling". According to writer [[Joe Menosky]], the Doctor's evil alter ego was intended to be "perversely sexual and sadistic" with a "psychosexual" attraction to Kes. Menosky had planned a scene in which the Doctor interacts with holograms of Kes on the [[holodeck]], including performing surgery on one.&lt;ref name="Magazine5"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Kaplan|first=Anna L.|date=1997|title=Robert Picardo|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|location=Forrest Park|publisher=CFQ Media, LLC|volume=29|issue=6/7|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[B'Elanna Torres]] had few scenes with Kes, the character's actor [[Roxann Dawson]] requested for further interaction between the two.&lt;ref name="Source6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56829726.html|title=As a Group, Actors like Show's Course|last=Spelling|first=Ian|date=June 30, 1996|work=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=November 7, 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Departure and return ===

Lien was removed from ''Star Trek: Voyager'' during its [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 4)|fourth season]] to accommodate the introduction of [[Jeri Ryan]], who plays Seven of Nine.&lt;ref name="Book21"&gt;[[#Ruditis2003|Ruditis (2003)]]: p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chakotay]]'s actor [[Robert Beltran]] said changing a lead character mid-season was unusual for the ''Star Trek'' franchise,&lt;ref name="Magazine9"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Schneider|first=Sue|date=March 16, 1998|title=Chakotay's Choice|magazine=[[Star Trek Monthly]]|location=London|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|issue=38|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Taylor believed it was typical for a show in its later seasons.&lt;ref name="SourceCommentary2" /&gt; Media outlets believed [[Harry Kim (Star Trek)|Harry Kim]]'s actor [[Garrett Wang]] was going to be replaced instead, but was kept due to his appeal to a specific demographic and his placement on [[People (magazine)|''People'']]'s "50 Most Beautiful People in the World" list.

Producers invited Lien to return for the episode "Fury" as they wanted to use her character "to move the story forward".&lt;ref name="Magazine2" /&gt; Berman said he promised the actress that the episode would be "a terrific story, and thus a good reason to bring Kes back".&lt;ref name="Magazine11" /&gt; Lien retained her "also starring" billing from season four.&lt;ref name="Source27" /&gt; Braga developed the concept for "Fury", which was written by Fuller and [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]]. Anna L. Kaplan of ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' described Fuller's involvement as "ironic" given his participation in the character's exit.&lt;ref name="Magazine11"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Kaplan|first=Anna L.|date=1997|title=Voyager Season Six Episode Guide|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|location=Forrest Park|publisher=CFQ Media, LLC|volume=33|issue=5|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lien requested that the script be rewritten as she was uncomfortable with it. She did not have the same allergic response to the ear prosthetics since she did not have to wear them for the same length of time.&lt;ref name="Magazine2" /&gt; Prior to the episode, Lien had stopped acting to pursue an [[associate degree]] in health. When discussing her approach, she felt it was difficult to play a different version of Kes and interact with the other characters who had changed since her last appearance. Lien preferred her performance in "The Gift" over "Fury", saying she made "a lot of poor acting choices" in the latter.&lt;ref name="Source17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/catching-up-with-jennifer-lien|title=Catching Up with Jennifer Lien|date=August 9, 2010|publisher=[[Startrek.com|StarTrek.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728040127/http://www.startrek.com/article/catching-up-with-jennifer-lien#|archive-date=July 28, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mental health of Filipino Americans''' is emotional and cognitive status of Americans of [[Filipinos|Filipino]] descent. [[Filipino Americans]] are more likely to suffer from mental illness than other Asian Americans due to a variety of social and economic factors.&lt;ref name="sentell"&gt;Sentell T., Unick G. J., Ahn H.J., Braun K. L., Jill Miyamura, and Shumway M. (2013). "Illness Severity and Psychiatric Hospitalization Rates Among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders". ''Psychiatric Services''. 64:11, 1095–1102 doi:10.1176/appi.ps.201200408&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental illness ==
According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], young Filipino women are more likely to think of [[Suicide|committing suicide]] than most [[Minority group|minorities]]. 13.6% are diagnosed with [[Clinical depression|depression]]. Filipinos are diagnosed with depression more than [[White people|Caucasian]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and the majority of Americans. Mothers in Filipino families are more likely to have acute depression.&lt;ref name="javier"&gt;Javier, J. R., Supan, J., Lansang, A., Beyer, W., Kubicek, K., &amp; Palinkas, L. A. (2014). Preventing filipino mental health disparities: Perspectives from adolescents, caregivers, providers, and advocates. [[Asian American Journal of Psychology]], 5(4), 316-324.doi:10.1037/a0036479&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Colonialism ===
The after-effects of [[colonialism]] still influence various Filipino immigrants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Compared to [[Asian Pacific American|Asian Pacific Islanders]], Filipinos are more likely to be diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. Studies show that Asian Americans have more serious disorders and have more prolonged stays at mental institutions than Caucasians.&lt;ref name="sentell" /&gt;

=== Immigration ===
[[Immigration]] is one associated with mental illness in Filipinos. Filipino immigrants take part in fewer mental health services than other Americans. Filipino Americans were once immigrants.&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;Kim HJ, Park E, Storr CL, Tran K, Juon HS (2015) Depression among Asian-American Adults in the Community: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. PLOS ONE 10(6): e0127760. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127760)&lt;/ref&gt; Filipinos are one of the largest groups of Asian-American immigrants. About 1.66 million Filipinos are immigrants.&lt;ref name="tsai"&gt;Tsai, J. H.-C. and Thompson, E. A. (2013), "Impact of social discrimination, job concerns, and social support on Filipino immigrant worker mental health and substance use". ''Am. J. Ind. Med''., 56: 1082–1094. doi:10.1002/ajim.22223&lt;/ref&gt; Some Filipino immigrants do not apply for programs such as [[Medicaid]] because they are worried that it would reduce their chances of becoming citizens.&lt;ref name="office"&gt;Office of the Surgeon General (US); Center for Mental Health Services (US).; National Institute of Mental Health (US). 2001. "Mental Health Care for Asian Americans and Pacific. In Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity—A Supplement to Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General". (107-126).Washington, D.C.:Rockville (MD): ''Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(US)''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Asian American immigrants are diagnosed with depression for various factors, such as not understanding English or inability to take health exams.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; The Filipino American Community Epidemiological Study (FACES) examined situations that may cause mental illness in Filipino immigrants. Employment worries increase stress, which can cause mental illness.&lt;ref name="tsai" /&gt; Males who do not know English well enough are more prone to mental illness than English speakers. Female immigrants were more likely to have long-term disorders. Males are more susceptible to disorders that lead them to depend on alcohol and drugs.&lt;ref name="ta"&gt;Takeuchi, D. T., Nolan, Z., Hong, S., Chae, D. H., &amp; al, e. (2007). Immigration-related factors and mental disorders among Asian Americans. American Journal of Public Health, 97(1), 84-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models of Filipino-American identity and experience ==

Several models have been constructed to characterize the Filipino-American experience. These theories include the Identity Development Model, colonial mentality and the [[Model minority|Model Minority]] Myth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118094747|title=Filipino American Psychology: A Handbook of Theory, Research, and Clinical Practice - Nadal - Wiley Online Library|last=Nadal|first=Kevin L.|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118094747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity development model ===
Filipino Americans experience racial and ethnic identity development in a different way, than other Asian American groups. The Philippines was colonized by Spain for over 300 years, and came to partially identify itself with Spain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Filipino Americans also identify with Asian and/or [[Pacific Islander|Pacific Islanders]], leaving Filipino Americans with the possibility of multiple (or compound) racial and ethnic identities. The identity development model contains six stages that Filipino Americans may experience as they develop their identity. These stages include: ethnic awareness, assimilation to American culture, awareness of socio-political differences, Panethnic Asian American consciousness, ethnocentric realization and introspection or acceptance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ethnic awareness develops when an individual becomes aware of the culture associated with their ethnicity. This includes language, social activities, food, music and traditions. Typically this stage arrives during childhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  During the assimilation stage, the individual notices the differences between her ethnic culture and other cultures and assimilates with one or more such cultures. Typically this is some flavor of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; American values and traits are typically presented as preferable or even superior. For example, skin-whitening and bleaching products are promoted as a way to become more attractive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=E J R|last2=Nadal|first2=Kevin L.|date=2013|title=The colonial context of Filipino American immigrants’ psychological experiences.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0032903|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=19|issue=3|pages=298–309|doi=10.1037/a0032903|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Awareness of Social/Political Differences" stage, Filipino Americans become actively aware of traits that separate them from other cultures, often sensitized by racial and cultural injustices. Differences can be interpreted positively (e.g., by coming to appreciate Filipino culture) or negatively (via experiencing racism).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

The "Panethnic Asian-American Consciousness" stage occurs when individuals begin to associate with individuals of other Asian American groups and learn that such groups have much in common with them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The "Ethnocentric Identity and Introspection" stage is the rejection of a broader Asian American identity and in favor or a specific Filipino identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The final Introspection stage is the acceptance of their other identities (e.g., as an Asian) without rejecting their Filipino heritage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Colonial mentality ===
[[Colonial mentality]] is a form of internalized oppression in which an individual feels inferior because his heritage includes the experience of colonization. This mentality makes individual feel the need to associate more towards American and/or Spanish values and traditions rather than their own, perceiving their colonizer to be superior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Colonial mentality has been shown to impacts the psychological well-being of Filipino Americans. Those strongly affected are more likely to have low self-esteem and could develop symptoms of depression more often than others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The four levels of impact on an individual: self-denigration, lack of appreciation of Filipino culture, discrimination against less-cultured individuals, and tolerance and acceptance of oppression by non-Filipinos.

=== Model minority ===
{{Expand section|Needs statistics|date=July 2018}}
[[Model minority]] is a stereotypical assumption that members of a particular ethnic group excel in areas of behavior and education.&lt;ref&gt;Museus, Samuel D., ''Conducting research on Asian Americans in higher education''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes that apply specifically to Filipino Americans include: low divorce rate, propensity to speak English better than other Asian Americans and lower poverty rate among Asian Americans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stereotypes of Filipino Americans include academic success among women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ocampo|first=Anthony C.|date=2013-10-09|title="Am I Really Asian?": Educational Experiences and Panethnic Identification among Second–Generation Filipino Americans|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/522881|journal=Journal of Asian American Studies|volume=16|issue=3|pages=295–324|doi=10.1353/jaas.2013.0032|issn=1096-8598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Model minority stereotypes pressure Filipino Americans to live up to their image. Students have been seen to question whether or not they are actually Asian if they are unable to match the stereotype.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This affects individuals' self-esteem.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4554">'''Narrative Television Network''' (NTN) makes movies, television shows and educational programming accessible to millions of blind and [[visually impaired]] people and their families.  Founded in 1988 by [[Jim Stovall]], the Narrative Television Network unobtrusively adds the voice of a narrator to the existing program between the dialogue so that blind or low vision people can hear what they can’t see.  The Narrative Television Network has received an [[Emmy Award]], a Media Access Award and an International Film and Video Award for its pioneering work in making movies, television and educational programming accessible for the visually impaired. The Narrative Television Network website offers readers a “Text Only” version of its pages to increase accessibility for blind and visually impaired readers who use screen readers.

== History&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Narrative Television Network|url=http://www.narrativetv.com/NTN_Story.html|website=www.narrativetv.com|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
When Narrative Television Network creator and president Jim Stovall lost his eyesight at age 28, he initially felt that he never wanted to leave the controlled environment of his home. Shortly thereafter, Jim Stovall met Kathy Harper in a support group for blind and visually impaired individuals, and the two discussed the challenges blind and visually impaired TV and movie audience members face because of missed visual components of stories.

Jim and Kathy began to research together and discovered that 13 million people in the United States have visual impairment severe enough to limit their enjoyment of TV shows and movies. This research inspired the two to develop a plan to make programming more accessible for blind and visually impaired people, and started by borrowing equipment to record some narrative soundtracks to begin their work with the goal of adding these soundtracks to existing movie audio.

&lt;ref&gt;Jim Stovall has been a national champion Olympic weightlifter, a successful investment broker, and an entrepreneur. In 2000, Stovall was selected as the one of the Ten Outstanding Young Americans by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce. In 2010, Stovall received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Council of the Blind for his work with the Narrative Television Network. &lt;/ref&gt;
NTN now has 1,200 broadcast and cable affiliates, and is shown in eleven countries outside of the United States.

Narrative Television Network founder and president Jim Stovall works as one of the three primary narrators, adding his voice to educational and informational programming. 

Susan Crane and Beth Sharp also work as primary narrators. 

Susan Crane joined Narrative Television Network in 2001 to narrate television programming and movies. Beth Sharp joined Narrative Television Network in 2002 to work as a scriptwriter and to perform programming voice work.

'''Nutrition and pregnancy''' refers to the nutrient intake, and dietary planning that is undertaken before, during and after pregnancy. Nutrition of the fetus begins at conception. For this reason, the nutrition of the mother is important from before conception (probably several months before) as well as throughout pregnancy and breast feeding. An ever-increasing number of studies have shown that the nutrition of the mother will have an effect on the child, up to and including the risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes throughout life.

An inadequate or excessive amount of some nutrients may cause malformations or medical problems in the fetus, and neurological disorders and handicaps are a risk that is run by mothers who are malnourished.&lt;ref name="mary_e_barasi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barasi EM |year=2003 |title=Human Nutrition - A Health Perspective |location=London |publisher=Arnold |isbn=0-340-81025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 24% of babies worldwide are born with lower than optimal weights at birth due to lack of proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/nutrition/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; 10 facts on nutrition |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2011-03-15 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal habits such as consumption of alcohol or large amounts of caffeine can negatively and irreversibly affect the development of the baby, which happens in the early stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Riley&gt;{{cite book|title=Pregnancy: The Ultimate Week-by-Week Pregnancy Guide|publisher=Meredith Books|isbn=0-696-22221-3|pages=21–22| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7BKtTKqAQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pregnancy+books&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_B58Tv6iCYO3rAeuvbT0Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pregnancy%20books&amp;f=false|author=Riley L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caffeine]] consumption during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss.&lt;ref name=Chen2016/&gt; The available research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate, is critical both in pre-and peri-conception.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; 

==Nutrition before pregnancy==

As with most diets, there are chances of over-supplementing, however, as general advice, both state and medical recommendations are that mothers follow instructions listed on particular vitamin packaging as to the correct or recommended daily allowance (RDA). Daily prenatal use of iron substantially improves birth weight, potentially reducing the risk of [[Low birth weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Haider, BA, Olofin, I, Wang, M|title= Anaemia, prenatal iron use, and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=21| year=2013|doi=10.1136/bmj.f3443|display-authors=etal| pages=f3443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Folic acid]] supplementation is recommended prior to conception, to prevent development of [[spina bifida]] and other [[neural tube defect]]s. It should be taken as at least 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day throughout the first [[Trimesters|trimester]] of pregnancy, 0.6&amp;nbsp;mg/day through the pregnancy, and 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day while breastfeeding in  addition to eating foods rich in folic acid such as green leafy vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drugs During Pregnancy and Lactation: Handbook of Prescription Drugs and Comparative Risk Assessment|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CE569saGK70C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=folic+acid+pregnancy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0jFTVe7zGMW6ggSTqoDACA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=folic%20acid%20pregnancy&amp;f=false|publisher = Gulf Professional Publishing|date = 2001|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9780444507631|first = Christof|last = Schaefer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iodine]] levels are frequently too low in pregnant women, and iodine is necessary for normal thyroid function and mental development of the fetus, even [[cretinism]]. Pregnant women should take prenatal vitamins containing iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=S5oCjZZZ1ggC&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq=iodine+levels+pregnancy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vTBTVa39KImegwTB9oG4CQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iodine%20levels%20pregnancy&amp;f=false|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2006|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9780781741330|first = Maurice Edward|last = Shils|first2 = Moshe|last2 = Shike}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vitamin D]] levels vary with exposure to sunlight. While it was assumed that supplementation was necessary only in areas of high latitudes, recent studies of Vitamin D levels throughout the United States and many other countries have shown a large number of women with low levels. For this reason, there is a growing movement to recommend supplementation with 1000&amp;nbsp;IU of Vitamin D daily throughout pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Association between maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal = BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date = 2013|issn = 1756-1833|pmid = 23533188|pages = f1169|volume = 346|first = Fariba|last = Aghajafari|first2 = Tharsiya|last2 = Nagulesapillai|first3 = Paul E.|last3 = Ronksley|first4 = Suzanne C.|last4 = Tough|first5 = Maeve|last5 = O'Beirne|first6 = Doreen M.|last6 = Rabi|doi=10.1136/bmj.f1169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A large number of pregnant women have been found to have low levels of  [[vitamin B12]], but supplementation has not yet been shown to improve pregnancy outcome or the health of the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation: A Reference Guide to Fetal and Neonatal Risk|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OIgTE4aynrMC&amp;pg=PA1573&amp;dq=vitamin+b12+pregnancy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PDFTVcPCM9HxggSRz4H4Cw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vitamin%20b12%20pregnancy&amp;f=false|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2011|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9781608317080|first = Gerald G.|last = Briggs|first2 = Roger K.|last2 = Freeman|first3 = Sumner J.|last3 = Yaffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), are beneficial for fetal development. Several studies have shown lower risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight in mothers with higher intakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effect of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid intake during pregnancy on maternal, infant, and child health outcomes: a systematic review|journal = Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology|date = Jul 2012|issn = 1365-3016|pmid = 22742604|pages = 91–107|volume = 26 Suppl 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2012.01292.x|first = Beth|last = Imhoff-Kunsch|first2 = Virginia|last2 = Briggs|first3 = Tamar|last3 = Goldenberg|first4 = Usha|last4 = Ramakrishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of n-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation|journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date = Jun 2006|issn = 0002-9165|pmid = 16841854|pages = 1452S-1457S|volume = 83|issue = 6 Suppl|first = CL|last = Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iron]] is needed for the healthy growth of the fetus and placenta, especially during the second and third trimesters.  It is also essential before pregnancy for the production of hemoglobin.There is no evidence that a hemoglobin level of 7 grams/100 ml or higher is detrimental to pregnancy, but it must be acknowledged that maternal hemorrhage is a major source of maternal mortality worldwide, and a reserve capacity to carry oxygen is desirable. According to the Cochrane review conclusions iron supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy but the positive effect on other maternal and infant outcomes is less clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peña-Rosas|first=Juan Pablo|last2=De-Regil|first2=Luz Maria|last3=Garcia-Casal|first3=Maria N.|last4=Dowswell|first4=Therese|date=2015-07-22|title=Daily oral iron supplementation during pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD004736|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004736.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26198451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition during pregnancy==
The United States and the European Union have established vitamin and mineral recommendations for during pregnancy and lactation. The amounts in the table below are the higher of the two. The citations separately list recommendations for pregnancy and lactation. Recommendations (RDAs = Recommended Dietary Allowances and PRIs = Population Reference Intakes) are set higher than what has been determined to be average requirements so as to address women who have above average needs. For some nutrients there is not enough information to set a recommendation, so the term Adequate Intake (AI) is used based on what appears to be sufficient.&lt;ref name=DRITable /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA-Recommended /&gt;

Supplementing one's diet with foods rich in [[folic acid]], fruits and dark green leafy vegetables helps to prevent [[neural tube]] birth defects in the fetus.

===Alcohol===
{{main|Alcohol and pregnancy}}
[[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]]s are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome. Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, hearing loss and vision problems.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about FASDs|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=April 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523194618/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|archivedate=23 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol and recreational drug use.&lt;ref name=Cor2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coriale|first1=G|last2=Fiorentino|first2=D|last3=Di Lauro|first3=F|last4=Marchitelli|first4=R|last5=Scalese|first5=B|last6=Fiore |first6=M|last7=Maviglia |first7=M|last8=Ceccanti|first8=M|title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD): neurobehavioral profile, indications for diagnosis and treatment.|journal=Rivista di psichiatria|date=2013|volume=48|issue=5|pages=359–369|pmid=24326748|doi=10.1708/1356.15062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four drinks per day.

The American Academy of Pediatrics established a conservative set of recommendations in 2015: "During pregnancy:no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk; and binge drinking poses dose-related risk to the developing fetus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams JF, Smith VC |title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders |journal=Pediatrics |volume=136 |issue=5 |pages=e1395–e1406 |year=2015 |pmid=26482673 |doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3113 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that alcohol should be avoided entirely during pregnancy, given the relatively unknown effects of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e88335.pdf |publisher=World Health Organisation |title=Framework for alcohol policy in the WHO European Region }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish and omega-3 fatty acids===
Fish consumption during pregnancy is encouraged by European,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=EFSA Dietetic Products|first=Nutrition, and Allergies (NDA)|date=2014-07-01|title=Scientific Opinion on health benefits of seafood (fish and shellfish) consumption in relation to health risks associated with exposure to methylmercury |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3761/abstract|journal=EFSA Journal|language=en|volume=12|issue=7|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3761|issn=1831-4732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55|title=Australian Dietary Guidelines (2013) {{!}} National Health and Medical Research Council|last=Council|first=National Health and Medical Research|date=2013-02-07|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/|title=2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines - health.gov|website=health.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason given is that fat-containing fish such as salmon and tuna contain [[eicosapentaenoic acid|eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]]. These are termed long chain, [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]], [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]], and are considered as important for fetal neurodevelopment.&lt;ref name=Starling2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Starling|first=Phoebe|last2=Charlton|first2=Karen|last3=McMahon|first3=Anne T.|last4=Lucas|first4=Catherine|date=2015-03-18|title=Fish Intake during Pregnancy and Foetal Neurodevelopment—A Systematic Review of the Evidence|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/3/2001|journal=Nutrients|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=2001–2014|doi=10.3390/nu7032001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, fish are good sources of vitamins A, D, and B12, as well as the mineral iodine.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt;

Due to risks of heavy-metal toxicity on fetal neurodevelopment, many mothers are concerned about eating fish during pregnancy. Overall, current research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Current research suggests that 2-3 servings of low-methylmercury containing fish per week in pregnancy is both safe and beneficial.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Mercury accumulates in fish through their own diet ([[bioaccumulation]]). A general rule of thumb is that fish higher up on the food chain, and with longer life spans will contain higher levels of mercury. Fish lower on the food chain and with shorter life spans will have lower metal content. However, it is important to note that the bioaccumulation of metals in fish is also dependent on geographical location, so it is hard to make global recommendations on specific fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosch|first=Adina C|last2=O'Neill|first2=Bernadette|last3=Sigge|first3=Gunnar O|last4=Kerwath|first4=Sven E|last5=Hoffman|first5=Louwrens C|date=2016-01-15|title=Heavy metals in marine fish meat and consumer health: a review|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.7360/abstract|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|language=en|volume=96|issue=1|pages=32–48|doi=10.1002/jsfa.7360|issn=1097-0010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to consuming fish is to use fish oil dietary supplements containing both EPA and DHA, or algae-derived DHA-only oils. The New York Times reported on a laboratory evaluation of 30 popular fish oil supplements. Some of those had less than the label claimed amounts of DHA. As for safety, "All of the products tested contained only very low levels of mercury, ranging from one to six parts per billion per serving. That range is far below the upper safety limit of 100 parts per billion set by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, an industry trade group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/whats-in-your-fish-oil-supplements/ |title=What’s in Your Fish Oil Supplements? |last=Conner |first=Anahad |date=22 January 2014 |website=The New York Times |access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folic acid ===
Folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin [[folate]], is critical both in pre-and peri-conception.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; Deficiencies in folic acid may cause [[neural tube defects]] (NTDs). Women who had 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg of folic acid in their systems due to supplementing 3 months before childbirth significantly reduced the risk of NTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recommendations {{!}} Folic Acid {{!}} NCBDDD {{!}} CDC|url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/recommendations.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80 countries use [[Food fortification|fortification of certain foods]] with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wald NJ, Morris JK, Blakemore C |title=Public health failure in the prevention of neural tube defects: time to abandon the tolerable upper intake level of folate |journal=Public Health Rev |volume=39 |issue= |pages=2 |date=2018 |pmid=29450103 |pmc=5809909 |doi=10.1186/s40985-018-0079-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamins C and E===
The combination of vitamin E and vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women does not appear to be efficacious for reducing risk of [[stillbirth]], [[neonatal death]], [[preterm birth]], [[preeclampsia]] or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name="Rumbold2015" /&gt; Antioxidant vitamins as dietary supplements had been proposed as having benefits if consumed during pregnancy. For the combination of vitamin E with vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women, a Cochrane review of 21 clinical trials concluded that the data do not support vitamin E supplementation - majority of trials alpha-tocopherol at 400 IU/day plus vitamin C at 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/day - as being efficacious for reducing risk of [[stillbirth]], [[neonatal death]], [[preterm birth]], [[preeclampsia]] or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name=Rumbold2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumbold A, Ota E, Hori H, Miyazaki C, Crowther CA |title=Vitamin E supplementation in pregnancy |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=9 |pages=CD004069 |date=September 2015 |pmid=26343254 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004069.pub3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review identified only three small trials in which vitamin E was supplemented without co-supplementation with vitamin C. None of these trials reported any clinically meaningful information.&lt;ref name=Rumbold2015/&gt; A second Cochrane review of 29 trials, published same year, reported on the same combination trials but added analysis of trials with vitamin C alone. The conclusion was that the data do not support routine vitamin C supplementation alone or in combination with other supplements for the prevention of fetal or neonatal death, poor fetal growth, preterm birth or preeclampsia.&lt;ref name=CochraneVitC&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumbold A, Ota E, Nagata C, Shahrook S, Crowther CA |title=Vitamin C supplementation in pregnancy |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=9 |pages=CD004072 |date=September 2015 |pmid=26415762 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004072.pub3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition after pregnancy==
Proper nutrition is important after delivery to help the mother recover, and to provide enough food energy and nutrients for a woman to [[Breastfeeding|breastfeed]] her child. Women having serum [[ferritin]] less than 70&amp;nbsp;µg/L may need [[iron]] supplements to prevent [[iron deficiency anaemia]] during pregnancy and postpartum.&lt;ref name="pmid16733739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milman N, Byg KE, Bergholt T, Eriksen L, Hvas AM |title=Body iron and individual iron prophylaxis in pregnancy--should the iron dose be adjusted according to serum ferritin? |journal=Ann. Hematol. |volume=85 |issue=9 |pages=567–573 |year=2006 |pmid=16733739 |doi=10.1007/s00277-006-0141-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sethi V, Kapil U |title=Iodine deficiency and development of brain |journal=Indian J Pediatr |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=325–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15107513 |doi=10.1007/BF02724099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During lactation, water intake may need to be increased. Human milk is made of 88% water, and the IOM recommends that breastfeeding women increase their water intake by about 300 mL/day to a total volume of 3000 mL/day (from food and drink);  approximately 2,400 mL/day from fluids.&lt;ref name="IOM"/&gt;

'''Ocean Healing Group''' (OHG) is an international [[nonprofit]] organization that provides once in a lifetime, Costa Rica based, adaptive sports adventures and quality of life programs to children with disabilities.

==History==
Ocean Healing Group (OHG) was founded in 2007 by Frank Bauer and paralyzed professional surfer [[Christiaan Bailey]].

==JAWS program==
Their flagship J.A.W.S. (Just Add Water Surfing) program is a [[Costa Rica]]-based, adaptive sports adventure program. The J.A.W.S. program is centered on physical rehabilitation through sports and activities such as [[surfing]], [[snorkeling]], [[zip-line]] tours, [[fishing]], and quad riding tours and typically runs from 7 to 10 days quarterly throughout the year. The program is entirely subsidized for its participant campers and 100 percent of donations received go directly to the facilitation of programs. The JAWS program currently services disabled children with [[cerebral palsy]], [[spina bifida]], [[spinal cord injury]], [[autism]], [[Ataxia Telangiectasia]] and other conditions.

==Advocacy==
In addition to raising money for rehabilitative services for their campers and promoting other like-minded foundations, Ocean Healing Group also engages in public policy advocacy, [[Spinal Cord Injury]] peer support mentor-ship as well as being on the cutting edge, in research and development of adaptive surfing equipment. OHG also holds the distinction of being both the first and only international, adaptive surfing program in the world.

"Our mission is to help them to break down the personal and physical barriers, while building up their self confidence so they can expand the bounds of possibility for themselves...It's all about helping them to carve the "Dis" out of Disability! It's this mindset that makes up the core philosophy of the Ocean Healing Group!...Donations provide lodging, food and travel expenses for these disabled youngsters, but really so much more than that. They provide rehabilitation for the soul, a newfound sense of adventure and perhaps most importantly of all, the experience that when they push themselves to achieve, they can make anything possible!" -Christiaan Bailey (Dec,2009)

'''Syokimau''' was a [[Kamba people|Kamba]] medicine woman and prophetess who lived in the 1800s long before [[Kenya]] became a colony. She was born and lived in Iveti Hills near the today's Machakos town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kareithi|first1=Amos|title=Syokimau, a place that inspires awe, despair in equal measure|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000062869/syokimau-a-place-that-inspires-awe-despair-in-equal-measure|accessdate=9 July 2017|agency=The Standard Group|publisher=Standard Digital|date=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that Syokimau could predict impeding attacks from other communities such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Kikuyu people|Gikuyu]] giving Kamba warriors ample time to prepare for the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Okonjo|first1=Emily|title=SYOKIMAU – THE UNDUMPABLE HUSBAND|url=https://emilyokonjo.wordpress.com/tag/statue-of-syokimau-the-akamba-medicine-woman/|website=Deardiary|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Syokimau is credited as the greatest prophetess among the Kamba people because she foretold the coming of the white men and the construction of the railway line. In her vision, she saw a long snake belching fire and smoke as to moved from waters to another waters. In it there were people with skin like meat who spoke unintelligibly like birds and carried fire in their pockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isichei|first1=Elizabeth|title=Voices of the Poor in Africa: Moral Economy and the Popular Imagination|date=October 10, 2002|publisher=University of Rochester Press|location=New York|isbn=1580461077|page=171|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Voices+of+the+Poor+in+Africa%3A+Moral+Economy+and+the+Popular+Imagination&amp;rlz=1C1GGGE_enKE540KE540&amp;oq=Voices+of+the+Poor+in+Africa%3A+Moral+Economy+and+the+Popular+Imagination&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.1424j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gehman|first1=Richard J.|title=African Traditional Religion in Biblical Perspective|date=June 14, 2016|publisher=Oasis International Ltd|location=Wheaton|isbn=1594521743|page=126|url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=1B4XPF1P4a4C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=prophet+syokimau&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xneOAkfLAm&amp;sig=QwF1jK4J_vDvouIe96rvXB8TFqY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prophet%20syokimau&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her prophecy came to pass in the 20th century after the completion of Kenya-[[Uganda Railway]] that ran from [[Mombasa]] to [[Kisumu]], the lakeside city then known as Port Florence. The people she saw were white people who spoke English and carried matchboxes in their pockets. 
[[Syokimau]], a fast-growing residential area in [[Machakos County]] that is close to [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] and where Syokimau Railway Station and the [[Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway]] Nairobi Terminus are located, is named after her. Some sources claim that Syonguu wa Kathukya, a later prophetess from around [[Athi River]] renamed her territory after Syokimau because she was impressed by her work. That is how the popular residential area came to bear the name of the prophetess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Okonjo|first1=Emily|title=SYOKIMAU – THE UNDUMPABLE HUSBAND|url=https://emilyokonjo.wordpress.com/tag/statue-of-syokimau-the-akamba-medicine-woman/|website=Deardiary|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on '''race and health in the United States''' shows many health disparities between [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|the different racial/ethnic groups]]. The possible causes, such as [[genetics]], [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic]] factors, and [[racism]], continue to be debated. Different health problems, in both mental and physical health, are present in all races but are not always equally treated. Health care professionals show "implicit bias" in the way that they treat patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In America, racism consists of stereotypes mainly that are political and economic. While this article focuses mainly on racism towards African Americans in the health field, it covers various other backgrounds including racism towards Native Americans, Asian Americans, and others while drawing comparisons between various incomes and ages. Race and health in the United States is a topic that has been researched many times over the years. There are various specific diseases that are more present among various races as well as different means for life expectancy.

==Background==

{{See also|Health and race|Health care in the United States}}
In biomedical research conducted in the U.S., the [[Race (U.S. Census)|2000 US census]] definition of race is often applied. According to the Census Bureau in 2000, race refers to one's self-identification with a certain racial group. The Bureau also specifies that race is a social concept, and has no relation to science or anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831085310/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm|title=American Indian and Alaska Native persons, percent, 2000|date=2009-08-31|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This grouping recognizes five ''races'': black or [[African American]], [[White people|White]] ([[European Americans|European American]]), [[Asian people|Asian]], [[native Hawaiian]] or other [[Pacific Islander]], and [[Native American (U.S. Census)|American Indian]] or [[Alaska native]]. According to the [https://link.springer.com/journal/10865 Journal of Behavioral Medicine], America continues to become more diverse. Although the population is increasingly less homogeneous, healthcare is unequally distributed among these five racial groups. The 2000 U.S. Census further specifies the amount of Americans who identified with each racial group; in 2000, 34.6 million identified as African American, 10.2 million as Asian American, and 35.3 million as Hispanic or Latino.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brondolo|first=Elizabeth|last2=Gallo|first2=Linda C.|last3=Myers|first3=Hector F.|date=2008-12-17|title=Race, racism and health: disparities, mechanisms, and interventions|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10865-008-9190-3|journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10865-008-9190-3|issn=0160-7715}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to consider that the 2000 U.S. Census definition is inconsistently applied across the range of studies that address race as a medical factor, making assessment of the utility of racial categorization in medicine more difficult.
However, this definition is inconsistently applied across the range of studies that address race as a medical factor, making assessment of the utility of racial categorization in medicine more difficult. Bias stems from racism, creating stress on the race that is being discriminated against, leading to issues with a person's bodily and mental health.&lt;ref name="Race, Racism, and Health"&gt;{{cite web |title=Race, Racism, and Health |url=https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/collections/racism-and-health.html |website=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated stress overtime on one’s body can lead to health problems such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, heart disease, skin rashes, and gastrointestinal problems, which are also more likely to develop in children.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bronfenbrenner Center for Translational Research |title=Examining the Link Between Racism and Health |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evidence-based-living/201710/examining-the-link-between-racism-and-health |website=Psychology Today |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racism has many detrimental effects on the health of Americans across the entire country, arising mainly from limited access to healthcare, mental health resources, and support.

==Mental Health==
Stress can be derived from many individualistic factors or experiences,has multiple effects on health.  Stress is also associated with chronic diseases. Stress that is derived from racism has specific contextual factors, which adds a daily burden to African-Americans and other demographic groups that are discriminated against. These demographic groups do not often realize that these stressors may be contributing to the state of their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physiological &amp; Psychological Impact of Racism and Discrimination for African-Americans |url=https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/racism-stress.aspx |website=American Psychological Association |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of people are also affected in ways that may not be outward acts of racism by another person, but through education, economics, the justice system, and largely through law enforcement. It is also possible that people who hold racist ideals have mental health problems as well, such as self-centeredness, inability to empathize, and paranoia over groups of people they are discriminating against. Individuals can develop complexes about ethnic groups and races, automatically displaying emotions without learning about the people themselves, and will cut off all friendliness to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chandra MD |first1=Ravi |title=After Charlottesville: Is Racism a Mental Illness? |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-pacific-heart/201708/after-charlottesville-is-racism-mental-illness |website=Psychology Today |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life expectancy==
The twentieth century witnessed a great expansion of the upper bounds of the human life span. At the beginning of the century, average [[life expectancy]] in the United States was 47 years. By century's end, the average life expectancy had risen to over 70 years, and it was not unusual for Americans to exceed 80 years of age. However, although [[longevity]] in the U.S. population has increased substantially, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] disparities in longevity have been persistent. African American life expectancy at birth is persistently five to seven years lower than European Americans.&lt;ref name="lavest"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=LaVeist TA |title=Racial segregation and longevity among African Americans: an individual-level analysis |journal=Health Services Research |volume=38 |issue=6 Pt 2 |pages=1719–33 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14727794 |pmc=1360970 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2003.00199.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of studies focus on the black-white contrast, but a rapidly growing literature describes variations in health status among America's increasingly diverse racial populations. Today, Asian Americans live the longest (87.1 years), followed by Latinos (83.3 years), whites (78.9 years), Native Americans (76.9 years), and African Americans (75.4 years).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Burd-Sharps and Kristen Lewis.

A study by Jack M. Guralnik, Kenneth C. Land, Dan Blazer, Gerda G. Fillenbaum, and Laurence G.

=== Socioeconomic and regional factors ===
A study by [[Christopher J.L. Murray|Christopher Murray]] contends the differences are so stark it is "as if there are eight separate Americas instead of one." Leading the nation in longevity are [[Asian-American]] women who live in Bergen County, N.J., and typically reach their 91st birthdays, concluded Murray's county-by-county analysis. On the opposite extreme are [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] men in swaths of South Dakota, who die around 58.

The risks for many diseases are elevated for socially, economically, and politically disadvantaged groups in the United States, suggesting that socioeconomic inequities are the root causes of most of the differences.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'' 2003{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper 2004{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other dimensions of inequality than those reflected by socioeconomic status also affect racial disparities in health, because other forms of social adversity are also important factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=David R.|last2=Mohammed|first2=Selina A.|last3=Leavell|first3=Jacinta|last4=Collins|first4=Chiquita|title=Race, socioeconomic status, and health: Complexities, ongoing challenges, and research opportunities|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=February 2010|volume=1186|issue=1|pages=69–101|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05339.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05339.x/full|pmc=3442603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women and Infants ==
African American women are three to four times more likely to die in childbirth than white women, while their babies are twice as likely to die than white babies, even when controlled for many factors such as education, income, and health. “White racism” is the highest cause of unrest in communities, pushing them further apart, and causing more black women and infants to die because of it.&lt;ref name="americanprogress.org"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Solomon |first1=Danyelle |title=Racism: The Evergreen Toxin Killing Black Mothers and Infants |url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2018/04/18/449774/racism-evergreen-toxin-killing-black-mothers-infants/ |website=Center for American Progress |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racism in education has decreased significantly over the past century, however this does not help increases in income for blacks, and increased incomes don’t provide better health opportunities, especially for mothers and infants.&lt;ref name="americanprogress.org"/&gt; Higher education and income levels for black mothers does not effect this mortality rate.

===History===
Disparities in health and life span among blacks and whites in the US have existed since before the period of slavery. David R. Williams and Chiquita Collins write that, although racial taxonomies are socially constructed and arbitrary, race is still one of the major bases of division in American life. Throughout US history racial disparities in health have been pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=David R.|last2=Collins|first2=Chiquita|title=US Socioeconomic and Racial Differences in Health: Patterns and Explanations|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=August 1995|volume=21|issue=1|pages=349–386|doi=10.1146/annurev.so.21.080195.002025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 paper, Williams and Collins also argued that, although it is no longer being legally enforced, racial segregation is still one of the primary causes of racial disparities in health because it determines [[socioeconomic status]] by limiting access to education and employment opportunities.&lt;ref name=wc2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=DR|last2=Collins|first2=C|title=Racial residential segregation: a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health.|journal=Public Health Reports|date=2001|volume=116|issue=5|pages=404–16|pmid=12042604|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1497358/pdf/12042604.pdf|pmc=1497358|doi=10.1093/phr/116.5.404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Clayton and Byrd write that there have been two periods of health reform specifically addressing the correction of race-based health disparities. The first period (1865–1872) was linked to [[Freedmen's Bureau]] legislation and the second (1965–1975) was a part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Both had dramatic and positive effects on black health status and outcome, but were discontinued. Even though African-American health status and outcome is slowly improving, black health has generally stagnated or deteriorated compared to whites since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Clayton LA, Byrd WM |title=Race: a major health status and outcome variable 1980-1999 |journal=Journal of the National Medical Association |volume=93 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=35S–54S |date=March 2001 |pmid=12653396 |pmc=2593960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic changes can have broad effects on the health of ethnic groups. Cities in the United States have undergone major social transitions during the 1970s 1980s and 1990s. Notable factors in these shifts have been sustained rates of black poverty and intensified racial segregation, often as a result of [[redlining]].&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC |title=How East New York Became a Ghetto |first=Walter |last=Thabit |isbn=0-8147-8267-1 |page=42 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indications of the effect of these social forces on black-white differentials in health status have begun to surface in the research literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Laveist TA |title=Segregation, poverty, and empowerment: health consequences for African Americans |journal=The Milbank Quarterly |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=41–64 |year=1993 |pmid=8450822 |doi=10.2307/3350274 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |jstor=3350274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
{{Main|Racism in the United States}}
Racial differences in health often persist even at equivalent socioeconomic levels. Individual and institutional discrimination, along with the stigma of inferiority, can adversely affect health. Racism can also directly affect health in multiple ways. Residence in poor neighborhoods, racial bias in medical care, the stress of experiences of discrimination and the acceptance of the societal stigma of inferiority can have deleterious consequences for health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Williams DR |title=Race, socioeconomic status, and health.

Princeton Survey Research Associates found that in 1999 most whites were unaware that race and ethnicity may affect the quality and ease of access to health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Lillie-Blanton M, Brodie M, Rowland D, Altman D, McIntosh M |title=Race, ethnicity, and the health care system: public perceptions and experiences |journal=Medical Care Research and Review |volume=57 Suppl 1 |issue= 4 suppl|pages=218–35 |year=2000 |pmid=11092164 |url=http://mcr.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11092164 |doi=10.1177/1077558700574010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inequalities in health care===
There is a great deal of research into [[inequalities in health care]]. In 2003, the [[Institute of Medicine]] released a report showing that race and ethnicity were significantly associated with the quality of healthcare received, even after controlling for socioeconomic factors such as access to care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10260/unequal-treatment-confronting-racial-and-ethnic-disparities-in-health-care | title=Unequal Treatment:  Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care | work=Institute of Medicine | date=2003 | accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases these inequalities are a result of income and a lack of health insurance, a barrier to receiving services. Almost two-thirds (62 percent) of Hispanic adults aged 19 to 64 (15 million people) were uninsured at some point during the past year, a rate more than triple that of working-age white adults (20 percent). One-third of working-age black adults (more than 6 million people) were also uninsured or experienced a gap in coverage during the year. Blacks had the most problems with [[medical debt]], with 61 percent of uninsured black adults reporting medical bill or debt problems, vs. 56 percent of whites and 35 percent of Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.hon.ch/News/HSN/534137.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with white women, black women are twice as likely and Hispanic women are nearly three times as likely to be uninsured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Health Care for Minority Women: Recent Findings |series=Program Brief.

It has been argued that other cases inequalities in health care reflect a [[systemic bias]] in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups. Raj Bhopal writes that the history of [[Scientific racism|racism in science]] and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and warns of dangers to avoid in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bhopal R |title=Spectre of racism in health and health care: lessons from history and the United States |journal=BMJ |volume=316 |issue=7149 |pages=1970–3 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9641943 |pmc=1113412 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9641943 |doi=10.1136/bmj.316.7149.1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The infant mortality rate for African Americans is approximately twice the rate for European Americans, but, in a study that looked at members of these two groups who belonged to the military and received care through the same medical system, their infant mortality rates were essentially equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rawlings JS, Weir MR |title=Race- and rank-specific infant mortality in a US military population |journal=American Journal of Diseases of Children |volume=146 |issue=3 |pages=313–6 |date=March 1992 |pmid=1543178 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.1992.02160150053020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a study was conducted by the KFF, the Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation, in order to learn more about the infant mortality rate throughout the United States.

A report from Wisconsin’s Department of Health and Family Services showed that while black women are more likely to die from [[breast cancer]], white women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. Even after diagnosis, black women are less likely to get treatment compared to white women.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/wcrs/pdf/cancerwi0004.pdf Wisconsin Cancer Incidence and Mortality, 2000-2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530004014/http://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/wcrs/pdf/cancerwi0004.pdf |date=2008-05-30 }}'' Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services&lt;/ref&gt; University of Wisconsin African-American studies Professor Michael Thornton said the report’s results show [[racism]] still exists today. "There’s a lot of research that suggests that who gets taken seriously in hospitals and doctors’ offices is related to race and gender," Thornton said. "It’s related to the fact that many black women are less likely to be taken seriously compared to the white women when they go in for certain illnesses."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://badgerherald.com/news/2007/10/24/breast_cancer_rates_.php Breast cancer rates differ in races]'' by Amanda Villa

Krieger writes that given growing appreciation of how race is a social, not biological, construct, some epidemiologists are proposing that studies omit data on "race" and instead collect better socioeconomic data. Krieger writes that this suggestion ignores a growing body of evidence on how noneconomic as well as economic aspects of racial discrimination are embodied and harm health across the lifecourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Krieger N |title=Refiguring "race": epidemiology, racialized biology, and biological expressions of race relations |journal=International Journal of Health Services |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=211–6 |year=2000 |pmid=10707306 |doi=10.2190/672J-1PPF-K6QT-9N7U}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert C.

===Cardiovascular disease===
{{See also|Cardiovascular disease}}
Research has explored the effect of encounters with racism or discrimination on physiological activity.  Most of the research has focused on traits that cause exaggerated responses, such as neuroticism, strong racial identification, or hostility.&lt;ref name="pmid12554577"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Harrell JP, Hall S, Taliaferro J |title=Physiological responses to racism and discrimination: an assessment of the evidence |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=243–8 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12554577 |pmc=1447724 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.93.2.243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies suggest that [[high blood pressure|higher blood pressure]] levels are associated with a tendency not to downplay racist and discriminatory incidents, or that directly addressing or challenging unfair situations reduces blood pressure.&lt;ref name="pmid12554577" /&gt; Personal experiences of racist behaviors increase stress and blood pressure.&lt;ref name="pmid12554577" /&gt;

Although the relationship racism and health is unclear and findings have been inconsistent, three likely mechanisms for cardiovascular damage have been identified:&lt;ref name="pmid12811228"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Wyatt SB, Williams DR, Calvin R, Henderson FC, Walker ER, Winters K |title=Racism and cardiovascular disease in African Americans |journal=The American Journal of the Medical Sciences |volume=325 |issue=6 |pages=315–31 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12811228 |doi=10.1097/00000441-200306000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Institutional racism]] leads to limited opportunities for socioeconomic mobility, differential access to goods and resources, and poor living conditions.
* Personal experiences of racism acts as a [[stressor]] and can induce psychophysiological reactions that negatively affect cardiovascular health.
* Negative self-evaluations and accepting negative cultural stereotypes as true ([[internalized racism]]) can harm cardiovascular health.

===Fear of racism===
It has  been argued that while actual racism continues to harm health, fear of racism, due to historical precedents, can also cause some minority populations to avoid seeking medical help. For example, a 2003 study found that a large percentage of respondents perceived discrimination targeted at African American women in the area of [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/1359105303008002669 |title=Birth Control Conspiracy Beliefs, Perceived Discrimination, and Contraception among African Americans: An Exploratory Study |year=2003 |last1=Thorburn Bird |first1=S. |last2=Bogart |first2=L. M. |journal=Journal of Health Psychology |volume=8 |pages=263–276|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise beliefs such as "The government is trying to limit the Black population by encouraging the use of condoms" have also been studied as possible explanations for the different attitudes of whites and blacks towards efforts to prevent the spread of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bird ST, Bogart LM |title=Conspiracy beliefs about HIV/AIDS and birth control among African Americans: implications for the prevention of HIV, other STIs, and unintended pregnancy |journal=The Journal of Social Issues |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=109–26 |date=March 2005 |pmid=17073026 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-4537.2005.00396.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infamous examples of real racism in the past, such as the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]] (1932–1972), have injured the level of trust in the Black community towards public health efforts. The Tuskegee study deliberately left Black men diagnosed with syphilis untreated for 40 years. It was the longest nontherapeutic experiment on human beings in medical history. The AIDS epidemic has exposed the Tuskegee study as a historical marker for the legitimate discontent of Blacks with the public health system. The false belief that AIDS is a form of [[genocide]] is rooted in recent experiences of real racism. These theories range from the belief that the government promotes drug abuse in Black communities to the belief that HIV is a manmade weapon of racial warfare. Researchers in public health hope that open and honest conversations about racism in the past can help rebuild trust and improve the health of people in these communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Thomas SB, Quinn SC |title=The Tuskegee Syphilis Study, 1932 to 1972: implications for HIV education and AIDS risk education programs in the black community |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=81 |issue=11 |pages=1498–505 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1951814 |pmc=1405662 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.81.11.1498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental racism===
{{Main|Environmental racism}}
Environmental racism is the intentional or unintentional targeting of minority communities for the siting of [[pollution|polluting]] [[industry|industries]] such as [[toxic waste]] disposal, through the race-based differential enforcement of environmental rules and regulations and exclusion of people of color from public and private boards and regulatory bodies, resulting in greater exposure of the community to pollution. RD Bullard writes that a growing body of evidence reveals that people of color and low-income persons have borne greater environmental and health risks than the society at large in their neighbourhoods, workplaces and playgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/13549839908725577 |title=Dismantling Environmental Racism in the USA |year=1999 |last1=Bullard |first1=Robert D. |journal=Local Environment |volume=4 |pages=5–19 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental racism stems from the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which focused on environmental reform and wildlife preservation and protection, and was led primarily by the middle class. The early environmental movement largely ignored the plight of poor people and people of color who, even in the mid-20th century, were increasingly exposed to environmental hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Northridge|first=M E|last2=Shepard|first2=P M|date=1997-05|title=Environmental racism and public health.|url=https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.87.5.730|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=87|issue=5|pages=730–732|doi=10.2105/ajph.87.5.730|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies related to [[redlining]] and [[urban decay]] can also acts as a form of [[environmental racism]], and in turn affect public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;''[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=11-13-07&amp;storyID=28458 Minority Communities Need More Parks, Report Says] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220064123/http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=11-13-07&amp;storyID=28458 |date=2008-02-20 }}'' by Angela Rowen The Berkeley Daily Planet&lt;/ref&gt; This may have an indirect affect health since young people have fewer places to play and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.&lt;ref name="parks"/&gt;

Although impoverished or underdeveloped communities are at greater risk of contracting illnesses from public areas and disposal sites, they are also less likely to be located near a distinguished hospital or treatment center. Hospitals relocate to wealthier areas where the majority of patients are privately insured, thus reducing the number of low-income patients.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/04/20/news/economy/hospitals-relocating/index.html|title=Hospitals leave poorer communities for more wealthier ones|last=News|first=Phil Galewitz, Kaiser Health|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas hospitals were previously established in the areas with the greatest need, most are now focused on economic gain from private insurance companies, and are threatened by Medicare funding cuts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Robert Wallace writes that the pattern of the [[AIDS]] outbreak during the 80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of '[[planned shrinkage]]' directed in African-American and Hispanic communities, and implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire extinguishment resources, essential for maintaining urban levels of population density and ensuring community stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wallace R |title=Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=801–13 |year=1990 |pmid=2244222 |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(90)90175-R}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institutionalized racism]] affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The overrepresentation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the 80s and 90s showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hutchinson J |title=AIDS and racism in America |journal=Journal of the National Medical Association |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=119–24 |date=February 1992 |pmid=1602509 |pmc=2637751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutionalized racism ===
A major downfall of the U.S. healthcare system is the unconscious racial biases held by many white American doctors, often resulting in decreased quality of care for African American patients. One such example is the discrepancy in cardiovascular surgical procedures between white and black patients. Compared to their white counterparts, black patients are less likely to receive necessary coronary bypass surgeries and lipid-lowering medications upon discharge from the hospital.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=Betancourt|first=Joseph R.|title=Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|date=2018|url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?aid=1155941056|work=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|editor-last=Jameson|editor-first=J. Larry|edition=20|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|access-date=2018-11-05|last2=Green|first2=Alexander R.|editor2-last=Fauci|editor2-first=Anthony S.|editor3-last=Kasper|editor3-first=Dennis L.|editor4-last=Hauser|editor4-first=Stephen L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that black patients leave treatment centers with a significantly different health outcome.

One potential cause of this discrepancy in treatment is the systematic racism present in the medical field that targets the work of African American scientists. Research shows that doctors and scientists of color are significantly underfunded in the medical community, and are less likely than their white colleagues to win research awards from the [https://www.nih.gov/ National Institute of Health (NIH)]. Since patients of color are often treated by white doctors, miscommunication is common; research shows that many Americans feel their doctors do not listen to their questions or concerns, or are too uncomfortable to ask certain medical questions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Segregation===
Some researchers suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality.  Thomas LaVeis (1989; 1993) tested the hypothesis that [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities. Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities, LaVeist found support for the hypothesis. Since LaVeist's studies, segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of race disparities in mortality.&lt;ref name="lavest"/&gt; Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of [[residential segregation]]. Mortality for male and female [[European Americans]] was not associated in either direction with residential segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hart KD, Kunitz SJ, Sell RR, Mukamel DB |title=Metropolitan governance, residential segregation, and mortality among African Americans |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=434–8 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9518976 |pmc=1508338 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.88.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by Sharon A. Jackson, Roger T. Anderson, Norman J. Johnson and Paul D. Sorlie the researchers found that, after adjustment for family income, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non-Blacks aged 45 to 64 years. In most age/race/gender groups, the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation, respectively. These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Jackson SA, Anderson RT, Johnson NJ, Sorlie PD |title=The relation of residential segregation to all-cause mortality: a study in black and white |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=615–7 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10754978 |pmc=1446199 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.4.615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live (Fang ''et al.'' 1998). Stephanie A. Bond Huie writes that neighborhoods affect health and mortality outcomes primarily in an indirect fashion through environmental factors such as smoking, diet, exercise, stress, and access to health insurance and medical providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/027321701300202028 |title=THE CONCEPT OF NEIGHBORHOOD IN HEALTH AND MORTALITY RESEARCH |year=2001 |last1=Huie |first1=Stephanie A. Bond |journal=Sociological Spectrum |volume=21 |pages=341–358|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, segregation strongly influences premature mortality in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0033-3549(04)50074-2 |vauthors=Cooper RS, Kennelly JF, Durazo-Arvizu R, Oh HJ, Kaplan G, Lynch J |title=Relationship between premature mortality and socioeconomic factors in black and white populations of US metropolitan areas |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=464–73 |year=2001 |pmid=12042610 |pmc=1497360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racism towards doctors and health care professionals ===
Many healthcare professionals have experienced hate and racist remarks towards them at work. Whether it be at a hospital, a walk-in clinic, or a family doctor's office, people are hit with bias based comments concerning "general bias, ethnicity / national origin, race, age, gender, accent, religion, political views, weight, medical education from outside the US, sexual orientation, and more".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This study conducted by [https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20171018/patient-prejudice-survey-results?ecd=stat WebMD and Medscape] features the races of "African American/Black, Asian, Caucasian, and Hispanic" &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Training for doctors to handle this type of prejudice at their work is very low.

===Homicide===
Homicide plays a significant role in the racial gap in life expectancy. In 2008, homicide accounted for 19% of the gap among black men, though it did not play a significant role in the decline in the gap from 2003 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harper|first=Sam|last2=Rushani|first2=Dinela|last3=Kaufman|first3=Jay S.|date=2012-06-06|title=Trends in the Black-White Life Expectancy Gap, 2003-2008|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1172038|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=307|issue=21|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.5059|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report from the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] states "In 2005, homicide victimization rates for blacks were 6 times higher than the rates for whites" and "94% of black victims were killed by blacks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm Homicide trends in the U.S.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212100248/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm |date=2006-12-12 }}, U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[Robert J.

Based on data for 1945 to 1999, forecasts for relative black:white age-adjusted, all-cause mortality and white:black life expectancy at birth showed trends toward increasing disparities. From 1980 to 1998, average numbers of excess deaths per day among American blacks relative to whites increased by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Levine RS, Foster JE, Fullilove RE, etal |title=Black-white inequalities in mortality and life expectancy, 1933-1999: implications for healthy people 2010 |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=474–83 |year=2001 |pmid=12042611 |pmc=1497364 |doi=10.1016/s0033-3549(04)50075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Williams writes that higher disease rates for blacks (or African Americans) compared to whites are pervasive and persistent over time, with the racial gap in mortality widening in recent years for multiple causes of death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{confusing-section|date=April 2012}}
The study of a genetic basis for racial health disparity in the United States is criticised for the use of a "[[melting pot]]" perspective and for neglecting to include indigenous North Americans. This is based on studies suggesting the genetic difference between "races" is greatest with populations that have been reproductively isolated for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Risch, N. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Risch | first1 = N. | last2 = Burchard | first2 = E. | last3 = Elad | first3 = Z. | last4 = Tang | first4 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Categorization of humans in biomedical research: Genes, race and disease | url = | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007 | PMC=139378 | pmid=12184798 | pages=comment2007.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is the opposite of this with a wide variety of cultures in close proximity along with a decreasing social stigma against interracial relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chen, S.|year=2010|title=Interracial marriages at an all-time high, study says|work=CNN|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-04/living/pew.interracial.marriage_1_interracial-marriages-millennial-generation-race-and-ethnicity-matter?_s=PM:LIVING|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712013811/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-04/living/pew.interracial.marriage_1_interracial-marriages-millennial-generation-race-and-ethnicity-matter?_s=PM%3ALIVING|archivedate=2012-07-12|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue is illustrated with the example of those who identify themselves as Hispanic/Latino, typically a mix of Caucasian, Native American and African ancestry.&lt;ref name="Risch, N. 2002"/&gt; Some studies include this as a "race", whereas others do not have that option and force members of this group to choose between identifying themselves as "Caucasian", "Other" or whatever group that individual identifies with. Such admixture of genetic ancestry would lend results more to cultural, environmental and socio-economic explanations of health disparity rather than a genetic explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thetarrytownmeetings.org/sites/default/files/Burnell,%20Sondra%20Patterns%20of%20Prejudice.pdf|title=Reflections on Race and the biologization of difference|last=Gibel Azoulay|first=Katya|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2779">'''Roger Garlock Barker''' (1903 in [[Macksburg, Iowa]]{{spaced ndash}}1990 in [[Oskaloosa, Kansas]]) was a [[social scientist]], a founder of [[environmental psychology]] and a leading figure in the field for decades, perhaps best known for his development of the concept of [[behavior settings]] and [[staffing theory]].

Barker earned his [[PhD]] from [[Stanford University]] and spent two years studying with [[Kurt Lewin]].  In the 1940s Barker and his associate Herbert Wright from the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] set up the Midwest Psychological Field Station in the nearby town of [[Oskaloosa, Kansas]], a town of fewer than 2000 people.  Barker's team gathered empirical data in Oskaloosa from 1947 through 1972, consistently disguising the town as 'Midwest, Kansas' for publications like ''One Boy's Day'' (1952) and ''Midwest and Its Children'' (1955).  Based on this data, Barker first developed the concept of the behavior setting to help explain the interplay between the individual and the immediate environment.

Possibly one of the most valuable developments of Barker's work was the examination of the way in which the number and variety of behavior settings remains remarkably constant even as institutions increased in size. This was explored in his seminal work with Paul Gump published as Barker, R. and Gump, P. (1964) ''Big School Small School'', Stanford: Stanford University Press. They showed that large schools had a similar number of behavior settings to small schools. A consequence of this was that students could take many different roles in small schools (e.g. be in the school band and the school football team), while in larger schools there was a greater tendency to be selective.

Barker died at his home in Oskaloosa, Kansas in September 1990. He was survived by his wife, Louise Shedd Barker, with whom he collaborated on much of his research.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/14/obituaries/roger-g-barker-87-psychology-educator.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker is the subject of a 2014 biography — ''The Outsider: The Life and Times of Roger Barker'' — by award-winning American journalist Ariel Sabar.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/The-Outsider-Barker-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B00I14K8H2/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smegma''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''smēgma''&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smegma |title=Websters dictionary definition for smegma |accessdate=2017-03-02 |work= |publisher=Merriam-Webster }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a combination of [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|shed]] [[Epithelium|skin cells]], skin oils, and moisture. It occurs in both male and female [[mammalian genitalia]].  In female bodies, it collects around the [[clitoris]] and in the folds of the [[labia minora]]; in males, smegma collects under the [[foreskin]].

==Females==
[[File:Female Smegma.jpg|thumb|Human vulva with visible female smegma between the labia.]]

The accumulation of [[sebum]] combined with dead skin cells forms smegma. Smegma clitoridis is defined as the secretion of the [[apocrine glands]] of the clitoris, in combination with [[Desquamation|desquamating]] epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | publisher = Medilexicon  | title = Medical Dictionary | url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=82565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glands that are located around the clitoris and the vulva majoris secrete [[sebum]]. If smegma is not removed frequently it can lead to clitoral adhesion which can make clitoral stimulation (such as masturbation) painful (clitorodynia).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Males==

According to Wright, little smegma is produced during childhood, although the foreskin may contain sebaceous glands. She also says that production of smegma increases from adolescence until sexual maturity when the function of smegma for lubrication assumes its full value, and from middle-age production starts to decline and in old age virtually no smegma is produced.&lt;ref name = "Wright1970"/&gt; Øster reported that the incidence of smegma increased from 1% among 6- to 7-year-olds and 8- to 9-year-olds to 8% among 14- to 15-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds (an overall incidence of 5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Øster J |title=Further fate of the foreskin.

There is no evidence that smegma causes penile cancer,&lt;ref name="VanHowesmegma" /&gt; but its presence over a long period of time may irritate and inflame the penis,&lt;ref name="Wright1970" /&gt; which may increase the risk of cancer. It may also make it harder to see very early cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4657">{{short description|A set of detailed instructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out operations safely and effectively }}
{{For|the 2008 documentary film|Standard Operating Procedure (film){{!}}''Standard Operating Procedure'' (film)}}

A '''standard operating procedure''' ('''SOP''') is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an [[organization]] to help workers carry out '''complex''' routine operations. SOPs aim to achieve efficiency, quality output and uniformity of performance, while reducing [[miscommunication]] and failure to comply with [[industry regulation]]s.

The [[military]] (e.g. in the U.S. and UK) sometimes uses the term '''standing''' (rather than ''standard'') '''operating procedure''' because a military SOP refers to a unit's unique procedures, which are not necessarily standard to another unit. The word "standard" can imply that only one (standard) procedure is to be used across all units.

==Clinical research and practice==
In clinical research, the ''[[International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|International Council for Harmonisation]]'' (ICH) defines SOPs as "detailed, written instructions to achieve uniformity of the performance of a specific function". SOPs usually get applied in pharmaceutical processing and for related clinical studies. There the focus is always set on repeated application of unchanged processes and procedures and its documentation, hence supporting the segregation of origins, causes and effects. Further application is with [[triage]], when limited resources get used according to an assessment on ranking, urgence and staffing possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/contracting/rfqs/support_ant/docs/environ_health_safety/usap_sandh_policy_man/mcmurdostandardmedicalsop-311.pdf |title=McMurdo Station Medical Standard Operating Procedures as of 2006/06 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Study director is mainly responsible for SOPs. The Quality Assurance Unit are individuals who are responsible for monitoring whether the study report and tests are meeting the SOP. 
SOPs can also provide employees with a reference to common business practices, activities, or tasks.  New employees use a SOP to answer questions without having to interrupt supervisors to ask how an operation is performed. The international quality standard [[ISO 9001]] essentially requires the determination of processes (documented as standard operating procedures) used in any manufacturing process that could affect the quality of the product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/quality_management/iso_9001_2008/guidance_on_the_documentation_requirements_of_iso_9001_2008.htm Guidance on the Documentation Requirements of ISO 9001:2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015230555/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/quality_management/iso_9001_2008/guidance_on_the_documentation_requirements_of_iso_9001_2008.htm |date=October 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health safety and environment==
Procedures are extensively employed to assist with working safely. They are sometimes called safe work methods statements (SWMS, pronounced as 'Swims'). They are usually preceded by various methods of analyzing tasks or jobs to be performed in a workplace, including an approach called job safety analysis, in which hazards are identified and their control methods described. Procedures must be suited to the literacy levels of the user, and as part of this, the readability of procedures is important.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, G.A. (2012) Readability of OHS documents - A comparison of surface characteristics of OHS text between some languages, Safety Science, 50(7), 1627-1635.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Franklin''' is a lead character in the fictional universe of the science fiction television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', played by [[Richard Biggs]]. He serves as the chief medical officer on the Babylon 5 space station.

==Character description==
===Personality===
Dr. Franklin is a strong-willed, kind person and idealistic leader on Babylon 5; he is also a workaholic. He is not afraid to take risks to save a patient's life; this habit can occasionally get him into trouble. He has strong moral and ethical values, but he can also be self-righteous and a perfectionist at times. He apparently has a good relationship with his mother and siblings, although his long absences from Earth often lead them to complain that they rarely see him. His father - a famous general in [[EarthForce]]- has a domineering personality, and that has led Stephen to have a strained relationship with him. When they are together they frequently argue and they have conflicting views on a number of subjects. For example, Stephen's father is suspicious of aliens and believes that humans should "take care of their own", while Stephen believes that humanity should be more open to relations with alien races and civilizations. However, in many ways Stephen and his father are more alike than they will admit, and in the series second season they meet and begin to ease their differences. In terms of love and romance throughout the course of the series he has a number of love affairs with various women. His most prominent and long-lasting affair is with "Number One," the attractive and tough-minded leader of the Mars Resistance.

While the character was explicitly described as black in the script of the episode Soul Hunter, his first appearance on the show, J. Michael Straczynski was adamant throughout the run of the series that Franklin be a true individual who could have been played by an actor of any race. Richard Biggs later expressed his gratitude at being able to play a role purely as an actor, not a black actor.

===Career===
Following in the footsteps of his father, General Richard Franklin, Franklin joined [[EarthForce]] in 2232 to become a physician. Shortly after graduating from medical school, he left EarthForce and spent the next three years "hitchhiking" aboard starships, trading his services as doctor for free passage to their destinations. In the course of his work, Franklin took detailed notes on the biology, physiology, and culture of many alien species. In his travels, he encountered a group of [[Minbari]] whose transport ship had crashed at [[Beta Durani]]. The [[Minbari]] were severely injured in the accident, and due to Franklin's lack of knowledge of Minbari biology, they all died. Franklin performed an autopsy on one of the Minbari, and gathered notes on their biology and genetics.

When the [[Earth-Minbari War]] started in 2243, Franklin rejoined EarthForce and was assigned to manage an advanced military hospital on Earth. During the war, all EarthForce doctors were ordered to turn over any notes they had on Minbari biology for use in the production of [[biological warfare|biological weapons]]. When EarthForce discovered that Dr. Franklin had detailed notes on Minbari anatomy and physiology, he was ordered to give his notes to EarthForce researchers. Franklin, believing that it was unethical for a doctor to aid in research to create weapons of mass destruction, refused, and he was arrested by EarthForce.

Franklin was released from prison shortly afterward to accompany Lieutenant Commander [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]] on a mission to the Epsilon solar system as part of an advance team to negotiate peace with the Minbari. They were ferried to the Epsilon system by a Narn warcruiser. The meeting with the Minbari was ended, however, by a sneak attack by the Centauri. They thought the meeting was for a weapons-shipment deal between the humans and the Narns. The Minbari delegate to the meeting was killed in the Centauri attack. Both Franklin and Sheridan (along with the Narn [[G'Kar]]), were captured by the Minbari. However, the Minbari surprisingly released them when Sheridan uttered a Minbari phrase that the Minbari delegate had told him before he died. After his release, Franklin returned to Earth; his activities for the remainder of the Earth-Minbari War are unknown.
 
Between this event and 2258, he met [[Jeffrey Sinclair]], the future Commander of the Babylon 5 station. It was largely on Sinclair's recommendation that Franklin was named the chief medical officer on Babylon 5.

===Babylon 5===

In 2258, he was assigned to the [[Babylon 5]] station as chief surgeon after the recall of [[Benjamin Kyle|Dr. Benjamin Kyle]] to Earth. He stayed there for four years.

Franklin had strong moral convictions, and this was evident numerous times during his tenure at Babylon 5. Sometimes, his convictions conflicted with his duties as an EarthForce officer. These transgressions included the illegal operation of a free health clinic in Down Below, a part of the station where the poorest members of many alien races lived. He also insisted on performing a life-saving operation on an alien child against the parents' wishes; under the alien's religion any surgery was a violation of their religious beliefs. Franklin was devastated when the parents, acting according to their religion, killed their own child after the successful surgery. Dr. Franklin was also a leading participant in an "underground railroad" that helped rogue [[telepath]]s who had refused to join [[PsiCorps]] make their way to freedom; the telepaths were trying to escape from the ruthless Psi Cops. He was also a Foundationist, a new religion on Earth which incorporated the basic beliefs of many older human religions into a single faith. '''Foundationism''' (not to be confused with the school of philosophy called [[foundationalism]]), is a fictional [[religion]] invented by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] for his [[science fiction]] television show, ''[[Babylon 5]]''. Foundationism appeared on [[Earth]] around the year 2157 in response to contact with other intelligent species in the universe. Dr. Franklin explains that "the idea behind the Foundation is that to get back to the roots of all the Earth religions, get past the doctrines to the core of each belief system to find out what they have in common. And they've got a lot more in common than you think. It's just when politics and [[money]] and [[nationalism]] get in the way that things get a little messed up."&lt;ref name="Meditations on the Abyss"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Meditations on the Abyss | episodelink = Meditations on the Abyss | series = Babylon 5 | serieslink = Babylon 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also explains that Foundationists believe that "The closer you get to defining [[God]], the further away it gets."&lt;ref name="In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum"&gt;{{cite episode | title = In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum | episodelink = In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum | series = Babylon 5 | serieslink = Babylon 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As with many characters on [[Babylon 5]], Franklin's personality contained the seeds of his own weaknesses. In his case, Franklin's passionate interest in saving lives and meeting a very high personal standard led to his use of [[stimulants]] ("stims") as shown starting in the third season episode, ''[[A Day in the Strife]]''. Stims were a powerful but dangerous drug, and Franklin admitted his [[Substance dependence|addiction]] obliquely to Delenn in ''[[Ceremonies of Light and Dark]]'', and finally was forced by [[Michael Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] to confront this addiction in ''[[Interludes and Examinations]]''. After he admitted his addiction, Franklin resigned as Babylon 5's medical chief and embarked on a [[walkabout]] of the space station (in the [[Walkabout (Babylon 5)|episode]] of the same name). The term "walkabout" comes from the [[Indigenous Australians|aborigines]] in [[Australia]]; Franklin had learned of the practice from his Foundationist religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Walkabout"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Walkabout | episodelink = Walkabout (Babylon 5) | series = Babylon 5 | serieslink = Babylon 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later episode Franklin finally realized that he had run away from problems his entire life, and that he was doing so again. He finally confronted his problem, and although while on his "walkabout" he was nearly killed, he returned to medlab a stronger and wiser person for the experience.

Although he spent most of the series in medlab saving lives, Franklin also saw his share of action and adventure during the series. He was an active participant in the Earth Alliance Civil War, where he aided the Mars Resistance in its fight to free the Mars colony from Earth control. During the war between the Centauri Republic and the Interstellar Alliance he also worked with the [[telepath]] [[Lyta Alexander]] in investigating reports of [[Drazi]] atrocities against the Centauri on the Drazi homeworld; both Franklin and Lyta were nearly killed during the investigation.

In 2262, during the series fifth and final season, Franklin resigned from his post at Babylon 5 to accept the position of ''Head of Xenobiological Research'' on Earth upon the retirement of Dr. Benjamin Kyle. At the beginning of 2263, he selected Dr. Lillian Hobbes as his replacement on Babylon 5. Franklin later conducted research in the attempt to fight the plague the [[Drakh]] inflicted on Earth.  He is seen in the [[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]] episode "Each Night I Dream of Home."

==Current status==
At the end of the series, Franklin was still the head of Xenobiological research on Earth.  When Sheridan learned he was dying, Franklin went to Minbar for one last party. From there, Franklin traveled to Babylon 5, where he witnessed the station's decommissioning and destruction. [[J. Michael Straczynski]] has said that Franklin eventually dies while exploring an unknown planet, but has not revealed the details of exactly how or when he dies.&lt;ref name="jms"&gt;[http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-1158 JMSNews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Richard Biggs]] died in May 2004, the Franklin character will not make any further appearances in any future Babylon 5 movies or television series. When Biggs died, Straczynski had been working on a Babylon 5 script titled ''[[The Memory of Shadows]]''.  Straczynski decided not to recast the Franklin character, and rewrote the script to remove him from the story.  In the ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales]]'' anthology, it is explained that both Franklin and [[G'Kar]] - played by [[Andreas Katsulas]] who died in February 2006 - had left to explore space beyond the 'galactic rim'.

'''Tobacco Free Florida''' is an anti-smoking organisation based in the U.S. state of [[Florida]], administered by the [[Florida Department of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobaccofreeflorida.com/about-us/ About Tobacco Free Florida]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doh.state.fl.us/tobacco/tobacco_home.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
Since the Tobacco Free Florida Campaign was founded in February 2008, The four main programmatic goals have been:
* Promote cessation of [[tobacco]] use
* Prevent the initiation of [[tobacco]] use among youth and adults
* Eliminate [[secondhand smoke]] exposure
* Reduce [[tobacco]]-related health disparities

== History ==
Since 1989, Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services have been actively involved in the prevention of [[tobacco]] use.  In 1997, [[Florida]] settled a large lawsuit with a large [[tobacco]] industry and was granted $11.3 billion to assist with [[Medicaid]] costs incurred by health care services for smokers. As a result of the lawsuit, the Tobacco Pilot Program was launched by the [[Florida Department of Health]] to help educate the youth on the impacts of [[tobacco]] use.  When Florida's [[legislation]] decided to reduce funding to $1 million annually five years later after the Tobacco Pilot Program was launched, Floridians passed a constitutional amendment in 2006,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} which requires an annual appropriation of 15% of the gross 2005 tobacco settlement fund (adjusted for inflation) to provide money for a statewide [[tobacco]] education and prevention program.

In 2007, the Zimmerman Agency&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimmerman.com/ Zimmerman Agency, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded $17.1 million contract to conduct a statewide social marketing, media, and public relations campaign. The Tobacco Free Florida brand was  created as the department's health communication intervention component. The Tobacco Free Florida Campaign helps thousands of Floridians quit using smoke and smokeless [[tobacco]] products through the use of TV, radio, print and social media. It operates on a budget of about $65 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobaccofreeflorida.com/Contents-32/About-Tobacco-Free-Florida/ |title=About Tobacco Free Florida |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign overview ==
The campaign started in 2008 was created to discourage the use of [[tobacco]] among all Floridians but with a specific emphasis on youth ages 11–17, adults ages 18–24, [[chronic disease]] sufferers, pregnant women, low-income households, parents and small businesses. Using [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Haitian Creole]] media executions, the campaign is able to target all audiences through various communication channels. The Tobacco Free Florida and Quitline&lt;ref&gt;[http://floridaquitline.com/ Florida Quitline]&lt;/ref&gt; commercials have become famous through the years of their existence. Tobacco Free Florida chooses to create existing high-impact spots with "messages that elicit strong emotions response, such as personal testimonials and strong viscerally negative content."  For example, a commercial that showed a [[brain]] cut in half to show the clot that has formed due to [[cigarette]] smoke. Billboards and posters are used to display images of unhealthy [[lungs]], millions of [[cigarette]] buds collected and alarming statistics regarding [[tobacco]] use.

Along with radio, commercial and social media Tobacco Free Florida has several ground work initiatives, including Smokifier Vans that travel the state visiting festivals, sporting events, and co-branded partners ([[YMCA]] and [[Walmart]]).  The vans have age-progression software photo booths that ages visitors as smokers and nonsmokers allowing Floridians to experience the physical effects  of smoking.

== Sports partnerships ==
Tobacco Free Florida has successfully established partnerships with all of the following sports organizations:
* [[Tampa Bay Rays]]
* [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]
* [[Florida Panthers]]
* [[Miami Heat]]
* [[Orlando Magic]]
* [[Miami Dolphins]]
* [[Florida State University]]
* [[University of Florida]]
* [[Bethune Cookman University]]
* [[University of South Florida]]
* [[University of Central Florida]]

== Super Bowl ads ==
In 2010, Tobacco Free Florida purchased a package of ads for $447,992.50 to be run multiple times before, during and after the [[Super Bowl]] Game. The ads were created with a [[smoking]] cessation message intended to target adult smokers.  A focus group was run on people who had seen the commercials and concluded that people did not care that they were at an increased risk of dying from [[cancer]] or [[heart disease]] but they did care that every year [[smoking]] leaves 31,000 children fatherless.  The overall impact of the ad was to target adult smokers to think about their [[tobacco]] use affecting their children and family.

The '''Transparent Anatomical Manikin''' (''TAM'') is a three-dimensional, transparent model of a human being, created for medical instructional purposes. TAM was created by designer Richard Rush in 1968.&lt;ref name="roadside"&gt;{{cite web | title=Transparent Women | work=Roadside America | url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/29213 | accessdate=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of a see-through reproduction of a [[female]] [[human]] [[Human body|body]], with various [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] being wired so specific body systems would light up on command, on cue with a pre-recorded educational presentation.

Rush eventually produced 42 TAMs, many of which are still displayed in US health education museums.&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt; A cheaper model, the ''Mobile TAM'', was created by Rush in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt;

The Transparent Anatomical Manikin was used as cover art on the 1970 soundtrack album ''[[Music from The Body]]'', by [[Roger Waters]] and [[Ron Geesin]], and the [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s 1993 album ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]''.&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt;

'''Water supply and sanitation in Rwanda''' is characterized by a clear government policy and significant donor support. In response to poor sustainability of rural water systems and poor service quality, in 2002 local government in the Northern [[Byumba Province]] contracted out service provision to the local private sector in a form of public-private partnership. Support for public-private partnerships became a government policy in 2004 and locally initiated public-private partnerships spread rapidly, covering 25% of rural water systems as of 2007.

In urban areas, the Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC) is in charge of water supply. In March 2015, the government signed a 27-year contract with a private company to invest $75 million in order to provide 40,000 cubic meters/day of bulk water from a wellfield next to the [[Nyabarongo River]] to the capital Kigali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kigali Bulk Water Supply Project will add 40,000m3/d of potable water|url=http://www.wasac.rw/index.php/media-centre/news/146-kigali-bulk-water-supply-project-will-add-40-000m3-d-of-potable-water|publisher=WASAC|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first contract of this type in Sub-Saharan Africa.

== Access ==

=== Level and trend ===
[[File:Access to Improved Water Sources and Sanitation in Sub-Saharan Africa.png|thumb|450px|Access to improved water supply and sanitation, in 7 [[Water supply and sanitation in Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan countries]], from 1990 until 2008.&lt;ref name="JMP"&gt;[http://www.wssinfo.org WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program, retrieved on 30 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
Figures on access to water and sanitation vary depending on the source of information, apparently in part because different definitions may have been used for access to an [[Improved water source]] and [[Improved sanitation]]. The fact that many rural water systems are not functioning properly makes it also difficult to estimate effective access to improved water supply.

The following table compares access to water supply according to various sources, highlighting the difficulty to obtain reliable data on the change in access to water supply because of different definitions used. The data appear to indicate that access decreased over time, while in the same period significant investments were undertaken in rural water supply. The government's 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper acknowledges that indeed "sustained access to potable water sources has probably declined in rural areas" since 1995.&lt;ref name="PRSP"&gt;[http://povlibrary.worldbank.org/files/Rwanda_PRSP.pdf PRSP p. 25-26]&lt;/ref&gt; A main reason is poor maintenance and insufficient cost recovery, leading to the breakdown of systems, in particular those relying on pumping.

According to both the '''2000 Multi-Indicator Survey''' and the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey, access to an improved source of water supply was 91% in urban areas and 67% in rural areas. According to the same source, access to adequate sanitation was 54% in urban areas and 37% in rural areas.&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt;

According to calculations based on data from the '''2002 census''', access to an improved source of water supply was 80% in urban areas and 67% in rural areas, including in the definition of improved source house connections, yard connections, public standposts, protected wells and protected springs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsrwanda.gov.rw/TablesFrench/TA30F.htm 2002 census: Main source of water supply]&lt;/ref&gt; If figures were comparable, this would indicate a decline in access in urban areas and a stagnation in rural areas. The following map shows access to an improved source of water supply by districts and towns according to the 2002 census: [http://www.statisticsrwanda.gov.rw/Maps/French/map50.htm Map of access to an improved source of water supply]

According to the '''2005 Integral Household Living Conditions Survey''', however, 66% of the urban population and 57% of the rural population had access to an improved source of drinking water. With respect to adequate sanitation, access was estimated at only 10% in urban areas and 8% in rural areas.)&lt;ref name="OECD Rwanda"&gt;See [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/27/19/38562991.pdf OECD Rwanda] and [http://www.statistics.gov.rw/news.php?id_article=23 Enquête Intégrale sur les Conditions de Vie des Ménages EICV 2005 survey]&lt;/ref&gt;
If the figures were comparable, this would imply a massive decrease in access to water and sanitation in both urban and rural areas over the preceding five years.

However, according to a World Bank report, access to rural water supply in Rwanda increased from 41% in 2001 to 55% in 2005.&lt;ref name="IDA"/&gt; The 2005 figure thus is roughly in line with the figures of the 2005 Integral Household Living Conditions Survey. According to the government, access to water supply in rural areas increased significantly in only two years from 57% in 2005 to 71% in 2007.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt;

According to the '''2008 Demographic and Health Survey''' 60% of the population had access to an improved water source, broken down by 73% in urban areas and 57% in rural areas. The JMP estimates based on one national survey conducted in 1992 and 12 national surveys conducted between 1998 and 2008 that access to an improved water source declined from 66% in 1995 to 65% in 2010. The decline was most marked in urban areas – from 91% to 76%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WHO / UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme|title=Estimates for the use of|url=http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/RWA_wat.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF estimated access to an improved water source in Uganda in 2011 at 71% and access to improved sanitation at 64%.&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt;

=== Impact of lack of access ===
Lack of access to water supply and sanitation has significant health impacts. In addition, it imposes a significant burden on women and girls who have to carry water. For instance, more than one in five households in [[Umutara]] is more than an hour away from its water source. This has implications for the quality of women's and girls' lives, their economic productivity and their access to education.&lt;ref name="PRSP"/&gt; Even where people statistically do have access to an [[improved water source]] such as a communal borehole that in some cases is shared by up to 175 families, they sometimes have to wait for more than four hours before they can get water.&lt;ref&gt;IRC:[http://www.irc.nl/page/49940 Quote of the Week:Annet Maragijimana, 13-year girl waiting at a borehole in Gasagara, Rwanda], accessed on 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Times:[http://www.newtimes.co.rw/index.php?issue=14014&amp;article=19757 Borehole gives Gasagara a sip of relief], 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infrastructure ===
Water infrastructure in Rwanda consisted of 15 urban and about 796 rural water systems in 2002.&lt;ref name="PRSP2"&gt;[http://povlibrary.worldbank.org/files/Rwanda_PRSP.pdf PRSP p. 51]&lt;/ref&gt; Urban water systems are fed by water from 17 water treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EWSA Water Production|url=http://www.ewsa.rw/index.php/En/products-services/water/distribution-water|publisher=EWSA|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural water systems feed mostly standpipes. Handpumps using groundwater and managed springs provide water separately from water systems.

Some rural water systems are large and complex. For example, in 2001 there were 50 water systems that spanned more than one [[Districts of Rwanda|district]] and 10 water systems that spanned more than one [[Provinces of Rwanda|province]].&lt;ref name="PRSP"/&gt; The largest one serves 120,000 users in villages several miles apart. Although these systems are "piped," this typically means that water is distributed to water points in the village where users must go to retrieve water.

Source: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;51 and p.&amp;nbsp;25, quoting the 2001 inventory of rural water supply systems

Despite favorable rainfall, little use is made of [[rainwater harvesting]], except by a few health centers and churches.&lt;ref name="PRSP"/&gt;

Concerning sanitation, only about 15% of urban wastewater is collected through sewers. As far as sanitation in institutions is concerned, only 20% of primary schools in both rural and urban areas have latrines. The situation in secondary schools, prisons, health centers and markets is also poor.&lt;ref name="PRSP"/&gt;

== Service quality ==
About half of rural water schemes did not function in 2004 according to an extensive field survey.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt;

== Water resources and water use ==
Rwanda has abundant rainfall and water resources, totalling 5 billion cubic meters per year (177 billion cu&amp;nbsp;ft/yr).&lt;ref name="WRI"&gt;[http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/wat_cou_646.pdf WRI]&lt;/ref&gt; However, deforestation and erosion affect the productivity of springs, which are the main source of water supply in rural areas.

Rwanda has 22,300 springs registered in a spring inventory.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt; Total water use was estimated at 150 million cubic meters per year (5.3 billion&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;ft/yr) in 2000, of which 24% (36 million m³/year or 1.27 billion cu&amp;nbsp;ft/year) was for domestic uses, corresponding to only 4 cubic meters per capita per year or about 11 liters per capita per day (140&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;ft/capita/yr or about 3&amp;nbsp;U.S. gallons or 2½ imperial gallons/capita/day).&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries/rwanda/indexfra.stm FAO Aquastat]&lt;/ref&gt; Another source estimates total water use at 800 million cubic meters per year (28 billion cu&amp;nbsp;ft/yr) in 1993, of which 5% (40 million m³/yr or 1.4 billion cu&amp;nbsp;ft) were for domestic uses.&lt;ref name="WRI"/&gt;

== Development of the water sector ==
From 1990–1993 the country was engulfed in a [[Rwandan Civil War|Civil War]], followed by a massive [[Rwandan Genocide|Genocide]] in 1994. The government has set itself the target to achieve universal access to water supply and sanitation by 2018.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt; As described below, the water sector followed a different development pattern in rural and urban areas.

===Rural areas===
From 1950 to 1984 water in rural areas was provided free of charge to beneficiaries and infrastructure was owned by the national government. Beginning in 1984 the responsibility for rural service provision was transferred to communities. In 1987 a decree (Arrêté Présidentiel n°291/11 du 15 mai 1987)  transferred ownership of rural water infrastructure to districts, well before the government enacted a comprehensive decentralization policy.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Reconstruction activities after the 1994 genocide initially did not achieve a large increase in water supply and sanitation coverage, nor was there a sustainable management model for water systems in rural areas. Many users did not pay for water, some collected funds were mismanaged, and voluntary members of water committees in charge of operating and maintaining systems were often poorly motivated. As a result, about half of rural water schemes did not function in 2004 according to an extensive field survey.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt; The adoption of a new sector policy based on a demand driven approach in 1997 did not change the situation much.

In 2000 the government began a process of decentralization, giving the country's 30 [[Districts of Rwanda|districts]] more revenues and decision-making authority. Districts, which were already nominally the owners of rural water infrastructure, now began to develop their capacity to plan and execute infrastructure projects. 
In 2002 local government in the Northern [[Byumba Province]], inspired by similar experiences in neighboring [[Uganda]], contracted out service provision to the local private sector in a form of public-private partnership. Following that local experience, the government eventually abandoned its policy of community management and decided in 2004 to promote local public-private partnerships following the "Byumba model". With the backing up of the national government, districts thus competitively bid out and signed contracts with private service providers throughout the country. In 2007, 140 rural piped water systems (25% of the total) were managed through public-private partnerships.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt; Investments in rural water supply increased substantially since 2002, leading to an increase in access to water supply in rural areas from 57% in 2005 to 71% in 2007 according to government figures.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt;

===Urban areas===
WASAC is a company that distributes water in Rwanda.  As a national utility, the company has been in existence since 1976, as ELECTROGAZ.  In 1939 the water, electricity and gas utility "REGIDESO" was established to supply water, electricity and gas to [[Rwanda-Urundi]] with its seat in Bujumbura. The company was later divided into REGIDESO Rwanda and REGIDESO Burundi in 1963. In 1976, REGIDESO Rwanda became the state-owned monopoly ELECTROGAZ. 
In 2003 the government signed a management contract with [[Lahmeyer]] International to manage and restructure ELECTROGAZ in collaboration with Hamburg Water Works for 5 years. In March 2006, the management contract was terminated and management of the company reverted to the Government of Rwanda. In 2009 Rwanda Water and Sanitation Corporation (RWASCO) was created, institutionally separating water supply and energy. However, only one year later it was absorbed into the Rwandan Energy Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA). In 2008, RWASCO had signed a three-year agreement with the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) of Uganda for performance improvement and to promote commercial service delivery. In 2014 the urban water sector was again separated from the energy sector, creating a water and sanitation utility, now called WASAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WASAC: History|url=http://www.wasac.rw/index.php/about-us/history|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy, regulation and planning ===
The Ministry of Lands, Environment, Forests, Water and Mines (Ministère des Terres, de l'Environnement, des Forêts, de l'Eau et des Mines – Miniter), through its water and sanitation directorate (Direction de l'eau et de l'assainissement), is in charge of determining water policies and strategies in Rwanda. It is also in charge of monitoring drinking water quality and promoting user awareness.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

The Ministry of Infrastructure (Mininfra) is supporting districts in the construction of water supply systems, latrines and hygiene promotion with the support of UNICEF.

The Ministry of Local Government, Good Governance, Rural Development and Social Affairs (Minaloc) is in charge of accompanying local participatory planning processes, appying the government's Community Development Policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minaloc.gov.rw/spip.php?article24 Minaloc: Community Development Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; Actual planning is carried out by Rwanda's 30 [[Districts of Rwanda|districts]] through District Development Plans which are elaborated using a participatory approach. The districts also own the water infrastructure.

The regulatory agency Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (RURA), created by law in 2001, is responsible for the economic regulation of the telecommunications, electricity, water, sanitation, gas and transportation sectors. Its mission is to:

* Ensure that certain utilities provide goods and services throughout the country to meet in transparency all reasonable demands and needs of all natural persons and organizations; 
* Ensure that all utility suppliers have adequate means to finance their activities; 
* Continually promote the interest of users and potential users of the goods and services provided by utilities so that there is [[effective competition]] when competition is introduced in each utility sector and protection of users from abuses of monopoly positions is ensured because certain public utility sectors have a monopoly over the market.
* Facilitate and encourage private sector participation in investments in public utilities; 
* Ensure compliance by public utilities with the laws governing their activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rura.gov.rw/en/index.htm Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the agency's water and sanitation department is to:

* regulate in a way that promotes fair competition, sustainable and efficient use of water resources; 
* ensure better quality of services to customers at fair prices;
* ensure effective protection of environment by enforcing wastes disposal and by-products treatment regulations.

In practice, according to the agency's annual reports up to 2004, it seems that the regulatory agency focused much of its activities in the water and sanitation sector on the supervision of the management contract for Electrogaz (now EWSA).

=== Service provision ===
'''Urban areas.''' The Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC) is in charge of urban water supply and sanitation in Rwanda. Its predecessor EWSA had more than 118,000 water customers in 2013, up from only 38,500 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial operations|url=http://www.ewsa.rw/index.php/En/products-services/water/commercial-services-water/commercial-operations-water|publisher=EWSA|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rural areas.''' There are 847 piped rural water systems in Rwanda and 19,300 protected springs. Most of the piped water systems are pumped systems, as opposed to gravity systems, since in Rwanda many settlements are at higher altitude than the water sources serving them. Many systems serve a large number of villages: The largest ones serve up to 120,000 people living in villages dozens of kilometers apart. Almost all users are served through water sales points where water is sold or given away for free by the bucket. House connections are rare in rural areas.

Services in rural areas are provided by community-based organizations (about 650 systems), by private operators under contract with district governments (about 140 systems) and privately owned systems (about 60), most of which were privately owned since at least 2000.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt;

== Financial aspects ==

=== Tariffs ===
[[File:Rwanda.PNG|thumb|300px|Standpost/Borne Fontaine operator in [[Gisagara]] district in the southern part of Rwanda selling to a business client]]
'''Rural areas'''. Water tariffs in rural areas are usually measured by [[jerrycan]] (bucket) for water sold at water kiosks or public standposts. In rural water systems managed by private operators in 2004 the water tariffs per [[jerrycan]] of 20 liters varied between 14 and 25 Rwandan Franc (RWF), equivalent to about 2.5 to 4.5 US cents per gerrycan or US$1.25 – 2.25 per cubic meter, according to the Utilities Regulatory Agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rura.gov.rw/en/index.htm Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency Annual Report 2004, p. 24] Exchange rate of 1:550 from www.oanda.com for 2006, since no 2004 exchange rate was available.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to a World Bank report of 2008 tariffs range from only RWF 2.5 (gravity-fed systems) to RWF 15 (pumping systems) per jerrycan (equivalent to US$0.25 to US$1.40/m3). In addition, and to alleviate the financial burden for the poorest part of
the rural population, the districts keep a list of vulnerable households (widows, poor
single-parent households), who get free access to water points. These lists are drawn up by communities and approved by local authorities.&lt;ref name="RWSS ICR"/&gt;

According to the World Bank, "the principle of paying water at standposts in accordance with the volume consumed has been widely accepted, as the water users acknowledged the improvements in service delivery. More than fifteen years of experience with administrative or community management of water services proved that free or unpaid water resulted in little water or no water at all."&lt;ref name="RWSS ICR"/&gt;

For the few house connections the volumetric tariff is set at between RWF622 and RWF850 per m3 (US$1.13 and 1.55 per m3) according to the regulatory agency and at RWF185 to RWF600 per m3 according to the World Bank.

'''Urban areas'''. As of June 2013 the urban water tariff was RWF240 per m3 for the first five cubic meters per month and RWF300 per m3 for any consumption between 6 and 20 m3 per month. Higher tariffs are charged for higher consumption. Water at public kiosks is sold at RWF240 per m3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tariffs and charges: Water|url=http://www.ewsa.rw/index.php/En/products-services/water/commercial-services-water/tariffs-and-charges-water|publisher=EWRA|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost recovery ===
Cost recovery in rural water schemes has apparently improved in those schemes that are run as public-private partnerships, despite the fact that some poor users receive water for free. Private operators also pay a monthly rent to the districts for the right to use the systems, which remain publicly owned.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt;

=== Investment ===
'''Level and composition'''. Investments in rural water supply and sanitation increased from US$3.5 million in 2002 to US$32 million in 2006.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt;

'''Mechanism'''. Investments are channeled from donors and the national government to districts and communities through a Community Development Fund (CDF) established in 2001. 10% of tax revenues are allocated to the CDF by law, although actual transfers remained short of this target in 2003. In that year, 4 bn Rwandan Francs (RWF) were approved, but only 1 bn RWF were disbursed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/10/24/000012009_20051024111136/Rendered/PDF/324980rev0pdf.pdf Urban Infrastructure and City Management Project, Project Appraisal Document 2005, p. 28]. See also [http://www.rwandagateway.org/article.php3?id_article=2800 Rwanda News Agency], 5th-September 2006, EU "pleased" with CDF performance&lt;/ref&gt; The 30 [[Districts of Rwanda]] sign annual performance contracts with the President of the Republic about the construction of water facilities and the protection of catchment areas. A commission assesses progress on a quarterly basis.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt;

=== Financing ===
A large share of investments is financed by donors, including by the World Bank. Communities contribute to the initial capital costs.&lt;ref name="Minitere"/&gt;  In 2009 the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program and the government of Rwanda completed a study of Rwanda's funding mechanisms for water and sanitation which found that "existing financing modalities are highly fragmented and not appropriate for consistent financing of an ambitious water sector program". A new financing option recommended by the study was awaiting government approval in October 2009. It proposes a pooled Water and Sanitation Fund that would handle both government and donor contributions through the same national procedures. Districts would submit projects based on their regular planning procedures while a unit managing the Fund would appraise and monitor the projects. The Fund would be established under a new water supply and sanitation authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/index.cfm?page=page_disp&amp;pid=1503 Water and Sanitation Program]:[http://www.wsp.org/index.cfm?page=page_disp&amp;pid=21096&amp;sa=0#africa3 New Financing Options for Rural Water Systems in Rwanda], WSP News October 2009, accessed on 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== External cooperation ==
Donors in the Rwandan rural water sector follow a unified implementation framework which is based on the government's national strategy and program and medium-term expenditure framework.&lt;ref name="IDA"&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/IDA/0,,contentMDK:21256336~menuPK:3266877~pagePK:51236175~piPK:437394~theSitePK:73154,00.html World Bank:IDA at work]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Rwandan Development Gateway, in 2005 Rwanda's "achievements in establishing an aid coordination, harmonization, and alignment framework are being recognized as international best-practice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwandagateway.org/article.php3?id_article=1915&amp;lang= Rwanda: Aid Effectiveness]&lt;/ref&gt; This is significant progress compared to the observation in the government's 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which had observed "a piecemeal and uncoordinated approach" among donors in the sector and had called for a sector-wide approach.&lt;ref name="PRSP2"/&gt;

The [[World Bank]] supported rural water supply and sanitation through a series of projects, including the US$72.3 million [http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P002222 water supply 02 project] (1987–1998) and the US$20 million [http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?Projectid=P045182&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;pagePK=64283627&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;piPK=73230 Rural Water and Sanitation Project] (2000–2007). The latter has provided 352,000 people with access to improved water services by December 2006. At the same time more than 12 percent of the 830 water-piped systems existing in the country were privately managed.&lt;ref name="IDA"/&gt; The World Bank rated the project highly satisfactory in its 2008 completion report.&lt;ref name="RWSS ICR"&gt;World Bank:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64193027&amp;piPK=64187937&amp;theSitePK=523679&amp;menuPK=64187510&amp;searchMenuPK=64187283&amp;siteName=WDS&amp;entityID=000333037_20080804233018 Rwanda – Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, Implementation Completion and Results Report], 26 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the [[European Union]] (EU) signed a contract with the Rwandan government for a major water project in the Bugesera Region ([[Kigali]] rural) worth 16 billion Rwandan francs (Euro 23.24 million). The water project will benefit the four districts of Kanzenze, Gashora, Bicumbi and Kanombe in the eastern part of Kigali city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwandagateway.org/article.php3?id_article=789 Rwanda News Agency 21 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Development Bank]] has recently committed US$12 million to rural water supply and sanitation. The British and Belgian governments also support water supply and sanitation projects in Rwanda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/27/19/38562991.pdf OECD Rwanda]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Government of the Netherlands has committed US$22 million for a Water for Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project to be implemented by [[UNICEF]]. The aim of the project is to increase the provision of water services and of sanitation facilities as well as to spread good hygiene practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[allafrica.com]]:[http://allafrica.com/stories/200911020465.html Rwanda: U.S.$ 22 Million Water And Sanitation Project Unveiled], 2 November 2009, retrieved on 10 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The project is implemented by four districts in the Northern Province with the support of the Ministry of Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mininfra.gov.rw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=268 Ministry of Infrastructure]:[http://mininfra.gov.rw/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=101&amp;Itemid=319 WASH PROJECT]&lt;/ref&gt; An evaluation of a previous US$5 million UNICEF project for Water and Environmental Sanitation (WES) implemented from 1997 to 2000 concluded that its goals had been too ambitious and its hygiene and environmental sanitation component yielded little impact.

'''Wound healing''' is a complex process in which the skin, and the tissues under it, repair themselves after injury.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Nguyen DT, Orgill DP, Murphy GT |title=Biomaterials for Treating Skin Loss|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-6yjAgAAQBAJ|page=25}}|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-84569-554-5|pages=25–57. Orgill DP, Blanco C (editors)|chapter=4 The Pathophysiologic Basis for Wound Healing and Cutaneous Regeneration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this article, wound healing is depicted in a discrete timeline of physical attributes (phases) constituting the post-trauma repairing process. In undamaged skin, the [[epidermis]] (surface layer) and [[dermis]] (deeper layer) form a protective barrier against the external environment. When the barrier is broken, a regulated sequence of biochemical events is set into motion to repair the damage.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rieger"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rieger S, Zhao H, Martin P, Abe K, Lisse TS | title = The role of nuclear hormone receptors in cutaneous wound repair | journal = Cell Biochemistry and Function | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25529612 | pmc = 4357276 | doi = 10.1002/cbf.3086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is divided into predictable phases: blood clotting ([[hemostasis]]), [[inflammation]], tissue growth (proliferation), and tissue remodeling (maturation). Blood clotting may be considered to be part of the inflammation stage instead of a separate stage.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stadelmann WK, Digenis AG, Tobin GR | title = Physiology and healing dynamics of chronic cutaneous wounds | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 176 | issue = 2A Suppl | pages = 26S-38S | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9777970 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9610(98)00183-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Wound Healing.jpg|thumb|Deep wound on shin with stitches healing over five weeks]]

The wound healing process is not only complex but also fragile, and it is susceptible to interruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing [[chronic wound]]s. Factors that contribute to non-healing chronic wounds are diabetes, venous or arterial disease, infection, and metabolic deficiencies of old age.&lt;ref name="Enoch"&gt;Enoch, S. Price, P. (2004). [http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2004/august/Enoch/Pathophysiology-Of-Healing.html ''Cellular, molecular and biochemical differences in the pathophysiology of healing between acute wounds, chronic wounds and wounds in the elderly''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Wound care encourages and speeds wound healing via cleaning and protection from reinjury or infection. Depending on each patient's needs, it can range from the simplest [[first aid]] to entire nursing specialties such as [[wound, ostomy, and continence nursing]] and [[burn center]] care.

==Stages==
* [[Hemostasis]] (blood clotting): Within the first few minutes of injury, [[platelets]] in the blood begin to stick to the injured site. This activates the platelets, causing a few things to happen. They change into an amorphous shape, more suitable for clotting, and they release chemical signals to promote clotting. This results in the activation of [[fibrin]], which forms a mesh and acts as "glue" to bind platelets to each other. This makes a [[thrombus|clot]] that serves to plug the break in the blood vessel, slowing/preventing further bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Rasche H |title=Haemostasis and thrombosis: an overview|journal=European Heart Journal Supplements|date=2001|volume=3|issue=Supplement Q|pages=Q3–Q7|doi=10.1016/S1520-765X(01)90034-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Versteeg HH, Heemskerk JW, Levi M, Reitsma PH | title = New fundamentals in hemostasis | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 327–58 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23303912 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00016.2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inflammation: During this phase, damaged and dead cells are cleared out, along with bacteria and other pathogens or debris. This happens through the process of [[phagocytosis]], where white blood cells "eat" debris by engulfing it. [[Platelet-derived growth factor]]s are released into the wound that cause the migration and division of cells during the proliferative phase.
* Proliferation (growth of new tissue): In this phase, [[angiogenesis]], [[collagen]] deposition, [[granulation tissue]] formation, epithelialization, and wound contraction occur.&lt;ref name="Midwood"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Midwood KS, Williams LV, Schwarzbauer JE | title = Tissue repair and the dynamics of the extracellular matrix | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 1031–7 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15094118 | doi = 10.1016/j.biocel.2003.12.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In angiogenesis, vascular endothelial cells form new blood vessels.&lt;ref name="chang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang HY, Sneddon JB, Alizadeh AA, Sood R, West RB, Montgomery K, Chi JT, van de Rijn M, Botstein D, Brown PO | title = Gene expression signature of fibroblast serum response predicts human cancer progression: similarities between tumors and wounds | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = E7 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14737219 | pmc = 314300 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020007 | displayauthors = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation, [[fibroblast]]s grow and form a new, provisional [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) by excreting collagen and [[fibronectin]].&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt;  Concurrently, re-epithelialization of the epidermis occurs, in which [[epithelial cell]]s proliferate and 'crawl' atop the wound bed, providing cover for the new tissue.&lt;ref name="Garg"&gt;Garg, H.G. (2000).  ''Scarless Wound Healing''.  New York Marcel Dekker, Inc. Electronic book.&lt;/ref&gt; In wound contraction, [[myofibroblast]]s decrease the size of the wound by gripping the wound edges and contracting using a mechanism that resembles that in smooth muscle cells. When the cells' roles are close to complete, unneeded cells undergo [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt;
* Maturation (remodeling): During maturation and remodeling, collagen is realigned along tension lines, and cells that are no longer needed are removed by programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]].

==Timing and reepithelialization==
Timing is important to wound healing. Critically, the timing of wound reepithelialization can decide the outcome of the healing.&lt;ref name=Cubison2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cubison TC, Pape SA, Parkhouse N | title = Evidence for the link between healing time and the development of hypertrophic scars (HTS) in paediatric burns due to scald injury | journal = Burns | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 992–9 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 16901651 | doi = 10.1016/j.burns.2006.02.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the epithelization of tissue over a denuded area is slow, a scar will form over many weeks, or months;&lt;ref name=Kraftlynde&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Kraft J, Lynde C,| title = Giving Burns the First, Second and Third Degree - Classification of burns | quote =  Formation of a thick eschar, slow healing (&gt;1month), Obvious scarring, | publisher = skincareguide.ca | url = http://www.skincareguide.ca/articles/general_skin_care/gen_skin_care_art_3.html | access-date = 31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bursurg201406/&gt; If the epithelization of a wounded area is fast, the healing will result in regeneration.&lt;ref name=bursurg201406&gt;{{Cite web  | title = POST BURN SCAR RELATIVE TO RE-EPITHELIALIZATION  | publisher = Burnsurgery.org | year = 2011 | url = http://www.burnsurgery.com/Modules/BurnWound%201/sect_IX.htm| quote = Healing in 2 weeks – minimal to no scar; Healing in 3 weeks – minimal to no scar except in high risk scar formers;Healing in 4 weeks or more – hypertrophic in more than 50% of patients| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425052018/http://www.burnsurgery.com/Modules/BurnWound%201/sect_IX.htm | archive-date = 25 April 2014 | access-date = 16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early vs cellular phase==
[[Image:Fluorescent wound healing.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence micrograph]] of cells in ''[[Drosophila]]'' larvae healing after a puncture wound. The arrow points to cells that have fused to form [[syncytia]], and the arrowheads point to cells that are oriented to face the wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galko MJ, Krasnow MA | title = Cellular and genetic analysis of wound healing in Drosophila larvae | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = E239 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15269788 | pmc = 479041 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020239 | url = http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Wound healing is classically divided into hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although a useful construct, this model employs considerable overlapping among individual phases. A complementary model has recently been described&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; where the many elements of wound healing are more clearly delineated. The importance of this new model becomes more apparent through its utility in the fields of [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] (see Research and development section below). In this construct, the process of wound healing is divided into two major phases: the ''early phase'' and the ''cellular phase'':&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;

The early phase, which begins immediately following skin injury, involves cascading molecular and cellular events leading to hemostasis and formation of an early, makeshift extracellular matrix that provides structural [[scaffolding|staging]] for cellular attachment and subsequent cellular proliferation.

The cellular phase involves several types of cells working together to mount an inflammatory response, synthesize granulation tissue, and restore the epithelial layer.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; Subdivisions of the cellular phase are:  [1] [[Macrophage]]s and inflammatory components (within 1–2 days), [2] [[Epithelial]]-[[mesenchymal]] interaction: re-epithelialization ([[phenotype]] change within hours, migration begins on day 1 or 2), [3] [[Fibroblasts]] and [[myofibroblasts]]: progressive alignment, collagen production, and matrix contraction (between day 4 and day 14), [4] [[Endothelial cell]]s and angiogenesis (begins on day 4), [5] Dermal matrix: elements of fabrication (begins on day 4, lasting 2 weeks) and alteration/remodeling (begins after week 2, lasting weeks to months—depending on wound size).&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;

== Inflammatory phase ==
Just before the inflammatory phase is initiated, the [[clotting cascade|clotting]] cascade occurs in order to achieve [[hemostasis]], or stop blood loss by way of a fibrin clot. Thereafter, various soluble factors (including chemokines and cytokines) are released to attract [[cell (biology)|cells]] that [[phagocytosis|phagocytise]] debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue, in addition to releasing signaling molecules that initiate the proliferative phase of wound healing.

===Clotting cascade===
{{Main|Coagulation}}

When [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] is first wounded, [[blood]] comes in contact with [[collagen]], triggering blood [[platelet]]s to begin secreting inflammatory factors.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"&gt;Rosenberg L., de la Torre J. (2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic457.htm Wound Healing, Growth Factors].  Emedicine.com. Accessed January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Platelets also express sticky [[glycoprotein]]s on their [[cell membrane]]s that allow them to [[platelet aggregation|aggregate]], forming a mass.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt;

[[Fibrin]] and [[fibronectin]] cross-link together and form a plug that traps [[protein]]s and particles and prevents further blood loss.&lt;ref name="Sandeman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandeman SR, Allen MC, Liu C, Faragher RG, Lloyd AW | title = Human keratocyte migration into collagen gels declines with in vitro ageing | journal = Mechanisms of Ageing and Development | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 149–57 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11080534 | doi = 10.1016/S0047-6374(00)00177-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This fibrin-fibronectin plug is also the main structural support for the wound until collagen is deposited.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; Migratory cells use this plug as a matrix to crawl across, and platelets adhere to it and secrete factors.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; The clot is eventually lysed and replaced with [[granulation tissue]] and then later with collagen.

Platelets, the cells present in the highest numbers shortly after a wound occurs, release mediators into the blood, including [[cytokine]]s and [[growth factor]]s.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/&gt;  Growth factors stimulate cells to speed their rate of division. Platelets release other proinflammatory factors like [[serotonin]], [[bradykinin]], [[prostaglandin]]s, [[prostacyclin]]s, [[thromboxane]], and [[histamine]],&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; which serve several purposes, including increasing cell proliferation and migration to the area and causing [[blood vessel]]s to become dilated and [[porous]]. In many ways, extravasated platelets in trauma perform a similar function to tissue [[macrophage]]s and [[mast cell]]s exposed to [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|microbial molecular signature]]s in [[infection]]: they become activated, and secrete molecular mediators – vasoactive amines, [[eicosanoid]]s, and [[cytokine]]s  – that initiate the [[inflammation|inflammatory]] process.

===Vasoconstriction and vasodilation===
Immediately after a [[blood vessel]] is breached, ruptured [[cell membrane]]s release inflammatory factors like [[thromboxane]]s and [[prostaglandin]]s that cause the vessel to spasm to prevent blood loss and to collect inflammatory cells and factors in the area.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; This [[vasoconstriction]] lasts five to ten minutes and is followed by [[vasodilation]], a widening of blood vessels, which peaks at about 20 minutes post-wounding.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Vasodilation is the end result of factors released by platelets and other cells. The main factor involved in causing vasodilation is [[histamine]].&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/&gt; Histamine also causes blood vessels to become porous, allowing the tissue to become [[edema]]tous because proteins from the bloodstream leak into the extravascular space, which increases its osmolar load and draws water into the area.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Increased [[porosity]] of blood vessels also facilitates the entry of inflammatory cells like [[leukocyte]]s into the wound site from the [[bloodstream]].&lt;ref name="Dealey"&gt;Dealey C. (1999). ''The care of wounds: A guide for nurses''.  Oxford ; Malden, Mass. Blackwell Science.  Electronic book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Theoret"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1053/j.ctep.2004.08.009 | vauthors = Theoret CL | year = 2004 | title = Update on wound repair | url = | journal = Clinical Techniques in Equine Practice | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 110–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymorphonuclear neutrophils===
Within an hour of wounding, [[granulocyte|polymorphonuclear neutrophil]]s (PMNs) arrive at the wound site and become the predominant cells in the wound for the first two days after the injury occurs, with especially high numbers on the second day.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"&gt;de la Torre J., Sholar A.  (2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic477.htm Wound healing: Chronic wounds].  Emedicine.com.  Accessed January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They are attracted to the site by fibronectin, growth factors, and substances such as [[kinin]]s. Neutrophils phagocytise debris and kill bacteria by releasing [[free radical]]s in what is called a '[[respiratory burst]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenhalgh DG | title = The role of apoptosis in wound healing | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 9 | pages = 1019–30 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9785465 | doi = 10.1016/S1357-2725(98)00058-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="muller"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muller MJ, Hollyoak MA, Moaveni Z, Brown TL, Herndon DN, Heggers JP | title = Retardation of wound healing by silver sulfadiazine is reversed by Aloe vera and nystatin | journal = Burns | volume = 29 | issue = 8 | pages = 834–6 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14636760 | doi = 10.1016/S0305-4179(03)00198-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cleanse the wound by secreting [[protease]]s that break down damaged tissue. Functional neutrophils at the wound site only have life-spans of around 2 days, so they usually undergo apoptosis once they have completed their tasks and are engulfed and degraded by [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin P, Leibovich SJ | title = Inflammatory cells during wound repair: the good, the bad and the ugly | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 599–607 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16202600 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2005.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leukocytes to enter the area include [[helper T cell]]s, which secrete [[cytokines]] to cause more T cells to divide and to increase inflammation and enhance vasodilation and vessel permeability.&lt;ref name="Dealey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santoro"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santoro MM, Gaudino G | title = Cellular and molecular facets of keratinocyte reepithelization during wound healing | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 304 | issue = 1 | pages = 274–86 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15707592 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.10.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; T cells also increase the activity of macrophages.&lt;ref name="Dealey"/&gt;

===Macrophages===

=== Decline of inflammatory phase===
As inflammation dies down, fewer inflammatory factors are secreted, existing ones are broken down, and numbers of neutrophils and macrophages are reduced at the wound site.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt;  These changes indicate that the inflammatory phase is ending and the proliferative phase is underway.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; In vitro evidence, obtained using the [[dermal equivalent]] model, suggests that the presence of macrophages actually delays wound contraction and thus the disappearance of macrophages from the wound may be essential for subsequent phases to occur.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newton PM, Watson JA, Wolowacz RG, Wood EJ | title = Macrophages restrain contraction of an in vitro wound healing model | journal = Inflammation | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 207–14 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15673162 | doi = 10.1023/B:IFLA.0000049045.41784.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because inflammation plays roles in fighting infection, clearing debris and inducing the proliferation phase, it is a necessary part of healing. However, inflammation can lead to [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage if it lasts too long.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; Thus the reduction of inflammation is frequently a goal in therapeutic settings. Inflammation lasts as long as there is debris in the wound. Thus, if the individual's immune system is compromised and is unable to clear the debris from the wound and/or if excessive detritus, devitalized tissue, or microbial [[biofilm]] is present in the wound, these factors may cause a prolonged inflammatory phase and prevent the wound from properly commencing the proliferation phase of healing. This can lead to a [[chronic wound]].

== Proliferative phase ==

About two or three days after the wound occurs, [[fibroblasts]] begin to enter the wound site, marking the onset of the proliferative phase even before the inflammatory phase has ended.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"&gt;Falanga V.  (2005). Wound Healing.  American Academy of Dermatology (AAD).&lt;/ref&gt; As in the other phases of wound healing, steps in the proliferative phase do not occur in a series but rather partially overlap in time.

===Angiogenesis===
{{Further|Angiogenesis}}
Also called neovascularization, the process of angiogenesis occurs concurrently with fibroblast proliferation when endothelial cells migrate to the area of the wound.&lt;ref name="Kuwahara"&gt;Kuwahara R.T. and Rasberry R.  2007.  [http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic533.htm Chemical Peels]. Emedicine.com.  Accessed September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the activity of fibroblasts and epithelial cells requires oxygen and nutrients, angiogenesis is imperative for other stages in wound healing, like epidermal and fibroblast migration. The tissue in which angiogenesis has occurred typically looks red (is [[erythema]]tous) due to the presence of [[capillary|capillaries]].&lt;ref name="Kuwahara"/&gt;

Angiogenesis occurs in overlapping phases in response to inflammation:
#'''Latent period:''' During the haemostatic and inflammatory phase of the wound healing process, vasodilation and permeabilisation allow leukocyte extravasation and phagocytic debridement and decontamination of the wound area. Tissue swelling aids later angiogenesis by expanding and loosening the existing collagenous extracellular matrix.
#'''Endothelial activation''': As the wound macrophages switches from inflammatory to healing mode, it begins to secrete endothelial chemotactic and growth factors to attract adjacent endothelial cells. Activated endothelial cells respond by retracting and reducing cell junctions, loosening themselves from their embedded endothelium. Characteristically the activated endothelial cells show enlarged nucleoli.
#'''Degradation of endothelial basement membrane''': The wound macrophages, mast cells and the endothelial cells themselves secrete proteases to break down existing vascular basal lamina.
#'''Vascular sprouting''': With the breakdown of endothelial basement membrane, detached endothelial cells from pre-existing capillaries and post-capillary venules can divide and migrate chemotactically towards the wound, laying down new vessels in the process. Vascular sprouting can be aided by ambient hypoxia and acidosis in the wound environment, as hypoxia stimulates the endothelial transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) to transactivate angiogenic genes such as VEGF and GLUT1. Sprouted vessels can self-organise into luminal morphologies, and fusion of blind channels give rise to new capillary networks.
#'''Vascular maturation''': the endothelium of vessels mature by laying down new endothelial extracellular matrix, followed by basal lamina formation. Lastly the vessel establishes a pericyte layer.

[[Stem cell]]s of [[endothelial cell]]s, originating from parts of uninjured blood vessels, develop [[pseudopod]]ia and push through the [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]] into the wound site to establish new blood vessels.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt;

[[Endothelial cell]]s are attracted to the wound area by fibronectin found on the fibrin scab and [[chemotaxis|chemotactically]] by angiogenic factors released by other cells,&lt;ref name="romo"&gt;Romo T. and Pearson J.M. 2005.  [http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic13.htm Wound Healing, Skin].  Emedicine.com. Accessed December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. from macrophages and platelets when in a low-oxygen environment. Endothelial growth and proliferation is also directly stimulated by [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and presence of [[lactic acid]] in the wound.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"/&gt; For example, hypoxia stimulates the endothelial [[transcription factor]], [[hypoxia-inducible factor]] (HIF) to [[transactivate]] a set of proliferative genes including [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[GLUT1|glucose transporter 1]] (GLUT1).

To migrate, endothelial cells need [[collagenase]]s and [[plasminogen activator]] to degrade the clot and part of the ECM.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; [[Zinc]]-dependent [[metalloproteinase]]s digest [[basement membrane]] and ECM to allow cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis.&lt;ref name="Lansdown"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lansdown AB, Sampson B, Rowe A | title = Experimental observations in the rat on the influence of cadmium on skin wound repair | journal = International Journal of Experimental Pathology | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–41 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11422539 | pmc = 2517695 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2613.2001.00180.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When macrophages and other growth factor-producing cells are no longer in a hypoxic, lactic acid-filled environment, they stop producing angiogenic factors.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; Thus, when tissue is adequately [[perfusion|perfused]], migration and proliferation of endothelial cells is reduced. Eventually blood vessels that are no longer needed die by [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt;

===Fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation===
Simultaneously with angiogenesis, [[fibroblast]]s begin accumulating in the wound site. Fibroblasts begin entering the wound site two to five days after wounding as the inflammatory phase is ending, and their numbers peak at one to two weeks post-wounding.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; By the end of the first week, fibroblasts are the main cells in the wound.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Fibroplasia ends two to four weeks after wounding.

As a model the mechanism of fibroplasia may be conceptualised as an analogous process to angiogenesis (see above) - only the cell type involved is fibroblasts rather than endothelial cells. Initially there is a latent phase where the wound undergoes plasma exudation, inflammatory decontamination and debridement. Oedema increases the wound histologic accessibility for later fibroplastic migration. Second, as inflammation nears completion, macrophage and mast cells release fibroblast growth and chemotactic factors to activate fibroblasts from adjacent tissue. Fibroblasts at this stage loosen themselves from surrounding cells and ECM. Phagocytes further release proteases that break down the ECM of neighbouring tissue, freeing the activated fibroblasts to proliferate and migrate towards the wound. The difference between vascular sprouting and fibroblast proliferation is that the former is enhanced by hypoxia, whilst the latter is inhibited by hypoxia. The deposited fibroblastic connective tissue matures by secreting ECM into the extracellular space, forming granulation tissue (see below). Lastly collagen is deposited into the ECM.

In the first two or three days after injury, fibroblasts mainly migrate and proliferate, while later, they are the main cells that lay down the collagen matrix in the wound site.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Origins of these fibroblasts are thought to be from the adjacent uninjured cutaneous tissue (although new evidence suggests that some are derived from blood-borne, circulating adult stem cells/precursors).&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/&gt; Initially fibroblasts utilize the fibrin cross-linking fibers (well-formed by the end of the inflammatory phase) to migrate across the wound, subsequently adhering to fibronectin.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt;   Fibroblasts then deposit [[ground substance]] into the wound bed, and later collagen, which they can adhere to for migration.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/&gt;

[[Granulation tissue]] functions as rudimentary tissue, and begins to appear in the wound already during the inflammatory phase, two to five days post wounding, and continues growing until the wound bed is covered.  Granulation tissue consists of new blood vessels, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and the components of a new, provisional [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM). The provisional ECM is different in composition from the ECM in normal tissue and its components originate from fibroblasts.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; Such components include fibronectin, collagen, [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, [[elastin]], [[glycoprotein]]s and [[proteoglycan]]s.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; Its main components are fibronectin and [[hyaluronan]], which create a very hydrated matrix and facilitate cell migration.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt; Later this provisional matrix is replaced with an ECM that more closely resembles that found in non-injured tissue.

Growth factors ([[PDGF]], [[TGF-β]]) and fibronectin encourage proliferation, migration to the wound bed, and production of ECM molecules by fibroblasts. Fibroblasts also secrete growth factors that attract epithelial cells to the wound site.  Hypoxia also contributes to fibroblast proliferation and excretion of growth factors, though too little oxygen will inhibit their growth and deposition of ECM components, and can lead to excessive, fibrotic [[scar|scarring.]]

====Collagen deposition====
One of fibroblasts' most important duties is the production of [[collagen]].&lt;ref name="Kuwahara"/&gt;

Collagen deposition is important because it increases the strength of the wound; before it is laid down, the only thing holding the wound closed is the fibrin-fibronectin clot, which does not provide much resistance to [[traumatic injury]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; Also, cells involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue construction attach to, grow and differentiate on the collagen matrix laid down by fibroblasts.&lt;ref name="Ruszczak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruszczak Z | title = Effect of collagen matrices on dermal wound healing | journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = 12 | pages = 1595–611 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14623403 | doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Type III collagen]] and [[fibronectin]] generally begin to be produced in appreciable amounts at somewhere between approximately 10 hours&lt;ref name=pollock&gt;Fig. 9-1. The cellular, biochemical, and mechanical phases of wound healing. {{cite book | last1 = Pollock | first1 = Raphael E. | first2 = F.

Their deposition peaks at one to three weeks.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; They are the predominating tensile substances until the later phase of maturation, in which they are replaced by the stronger [[type I collagen]].

Even as fibroblasts are producing new collagen, collagenases and other factors degrade it. Shortly after wounding, synthesis exceeds degradation so collagen levels in the wound rise, but later production and degradation become equal so there is no net collagen gain.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; This homeostasis signals the onset of the later maturation phase. Granulation gradually ceases and fibroblasts decrease in number in the wound once their work is done.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = DiPietro LA, Burns AL | date = 2003 | title =  Wound Healing: Methods and Protocols.  |series = Methods in Molecular Medicine | location = Totowa, N.J. | publisher = Humana Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the granulation phase, fibroblasts begin to commit apoptosis, converting granulation tissue from an environment rich in cells to one that consists mainly of collagen.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt;

===Epithelialization===
The formation of granulation tissue into an open wound allows the reepithelialization phase to take place, as epithelial cells migrate across the new tissue to form a barrier between the wound and the environment.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; [[Stratum basale|Basal]] [[keratinocyte]]s from the wound edges and [[dermal appendage]]s such as [[hair follicle]]s, [[sweat glands]] and [[Sebaceous gland|sebacious (oil) glands]] are the main cells responsible for the epithelialization phase of wound healing.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; They advance in a sheet across the wound site and proliferate at its edges, ceasing movement when they meet in the middle. In healing that results in a scar, sweat glands, hair follicles&lt;ref name="sweatgland"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu XB, Sun TZ, Li XK, Sheng ZY | title = Morphological and distribution characteristics of sweat glands in hypertrophic scar and their possible effects on sweat gland regeneration | journal = Chinese Medical Journal | volume = 118 | issue = 3 | pages = 186–91 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15740645 | url = http://www.cmj.org/Periodical/LinkIn.asp?journal=Chinese%20Medical%20Journal&amp;linkintype=pubmed&amp;year=2005&amp;vol=118&amp;issue=3&amp;beginpage=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=follicles2014/&gt; and nerves do not form.

However, epithelial cells require viable tissue to migrate across, so if the wound is deep it must first be filled with granulation tissue.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"&gt;Mulvaney M. and Harrington A.  1994.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20031218072356/http://www.vnh.org/MilitaryDerm/Ch7.pdf Chapter 7: Cutaneous trauma and its treatment].  In, ''Textbook of Military Medicine: Military Dermatology''.

Accessed through web archive on September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the time of onset of migration is variable and may occur about one day after wounding.&lt;ref name="larjava"&gt;Larjava H., Koivisto L., and Hakkinen L. 2002.

Georgetown, Tex., Austin, Tex Landes Bioscience, Inc. Electronic book.&lt;/ref&gt; Cells on the wound margins proliferate on the second and third day post-wounding in order to provide more cells for migration.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt;

If the [[basement membrane]] is not breached, epithelial cells are replaced within three days by division and upward migration of cells in the [[stratum basale]] in the same fashion that occurs in uninjured skin.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; However, if the basement membrane is ruined at the wound site, reepithelization must occur from the wound margins and from skin appendages such as hair follicles and sweat and oil glands that enter the [[dermis]] that are lined with viable keratinocytes.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; If the wound is very deep, skin appendages may also be ruined and migration can only occur from wound edges.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"/&gt;

Migration of keratinocytes over the wound site is stimulated by lack of [[contact inhibition]] and by chemicals such as [[nitric oxide]].&lt;ref name="Witte and Barbul"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witte MB, Barbul A | title = Role of nitric oxide in wound repair | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 183 | issue = 4 | pages = 406–12 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11975928 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9610(02)00815-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before they begin to migrate, cells must dissolve their [[desmosomes]] and [[hemidesmosomes]], which normally anchor the cells by [[intermediate filaments]] in their [[cytoskeleton]] to other cells and to the ECM.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;  [[Transmembrane]]  [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[protein]]s called [[integrin]]s, which are made of [[glycoprotein]]s and normally anchor the cell to the basement membrane by its [[cytoskeleton]], are released from the cell's intermediate filaments and relocate to [[actin]] filaments to serve as attachments to the ECM for [[pseudopod]]ia during migration.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt; Thus keratinocytes detach from the basement membrane and are able to enter the wound bed.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"/&gt;

Before they begin migrating, keratinocytes change shape, becoming longer and flatter and extending cellular processes like [[pseudopod|lamellipodia]] and wide processes that look like ruffles.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;  [[Actin]] filaments and [[pseudopod]]ia form.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"/&gt; During migration, [[integrin]]s on the pseudopod attach to the ECM, and the actin filaments in the projection pull the cell along.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt; The interaction with molecules in the ECM through integrins further promotes the formation of actin filaments, lamellipodia, and [[pseudopod|filopodia]].&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;

Epithelial cells climb over one another in order to migrate.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; This growing sheet of epithelial cells is often called the epithelial tongue.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"/&gt; The first cells to attach to the [[basement membrane]] form the [[stratum basale]]. These basal cells continue to migrate across the wound bed, and epithelial cells above them slide along as well.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"/&gt; The more quickly this migration occurs, the less of a scar there will be.&lt;ref name="Son"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cap.2005.01.011 |title=Effects of β-glucan on proliferation and migration of fibroblasts |year=2005 |last1=Son |first1=Hyun Joo |last2=Bae |first2=Hyun Chul |last3=Kim |first3=Hyun Jeong |last4=Lee |first4=Dong Hee |last5=Han |first5=Dong-Wook |last6=Park |first6=Jong-Chul | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Current Applied Physics |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=468–71 |bibcode=2005CAP.....5..468S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fibrin]], collagen, and fibronectin in the ECM may further signal cells to divide and migrate.  Like fibroblasts, migrating keratinocytes use the fibronectin cross-linked with fibrin that was deposited in inflammation as an attachment site to crawl across.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; 
 
[[File:Scab.jpg|thumb|A scab covering a healing wound]]

Cells can only migrate over living tissue,&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; so they must excrete collagenases and proteases like [[matrix metalloproteinases]] (MMPs) to dissolve damaged parts of the ECM in their way, particularly at the front of the migrating sheet.&lt;ref name="larjava"/&gt; Keratinocytes also dissolve the basement membrane, using instead the new ECM laid down by fibroblasts to crawl across.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;

As keratinocytes continue migrating, new epithelial cells must be formed at the wound edges to replace them and to provide more cells for the advancing sheet.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt; Proliferation behind migrating keratinocytes normally begins a few days after wounding&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"/&gt; and occurs at a rate that is 17 times higher in this stage of epithelialization than in normal tissues.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt; Until the entire wound area is resurfaced, the only epithelial cells to proliferate are at the wound edges.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"/&gt;

Growth factors, stimulated by integrins and MMPs, cause cells to proliferate at the wound edges.  Keratinocytes themselves also produce and secrete factors, including growth factors and basement membrane proteins, which aid both in epithelialization and in other phases of healing.&lt;ref name="Bayram"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bayram Y, Deveci M, Imirzalioglu N, Soysal Y, Sengezer M | title = The cell based dressing with living allogenic keratinocytes in the treatment of foot ulcers: a case study | journal = British Journal of Plastic Surgery | volume = 58 | issue = 7 | pages = 988–96 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16040019 | doi = 10.1016/j.bjps.2005.04.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth factors are also important for the innate immune defense of skin wounds by stimulation of the production of antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil chemotactic cytokines in keratinocytes.   
  
Keratinocytes continue migrating across the wound bed until cells from either side meet in the middle, at which point [[contact inhibition]] causes them to stop migrating.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;  When they have finished migrating, the keratinocytes secrete the proteins that form the new basement membrane.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;  Cells reverse the morphological changes they underwent in order to begin migrating; they reestablish [[desmosome]]s and [[hemidesmosome]]s and become anchored once again to the basement membrane.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;  [[Stratum basale|Basal cells]] begin to divide and differentiate in the same manner as they do in normal skin to reestablish the strata found in reepithelialized skin.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;

===Contraction===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Contraction]] --&gt;
Contraction is a key phase of wound healing with repair. If contraction continues for too long, it can lead to disfigurement and loss of function.&lt;ref name="Hinz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hinz B | title = Masters and servants of the force: the role of matrix adhesions in myofibroblast force perception and transmission | journal = European Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 85 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 175–81 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16546559 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejcb.2005.09.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is a great interest in understanding the biology of wound contraction, which can be modelled in vitro using the [[collagen gel contraction assay]] or the [[dermal equivalent]] model.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grinnell F | title = Fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and wound contraction | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 124 | issue = 4 | pages = 401–4 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8106541 | pmc = 2119916 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.124.4.401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contraction commences approximately a week after wounding, when fibroblasts have differentiated into [[myofibroblast]]s.&lt;ref name="Eichler and Carlson"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eichler MJ, Carlson MA | title = Modeling dermal granulation tissue with the linear fibroblast-populated collagen matrix: a comparison with the round matrix model | journal = Journal of Dermatological Science | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–108 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16226016 | doi = 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2005.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[full thickness]] wounds, contraction peaks at 5 to 15 days post wounding.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; Contraction can last for several weeks&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"/&gt; and continues even after the wound is completely reepithelialized.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; A large wound can become 40 to 80% smaller after contraction.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt;  Wounds can contract at a speed of up to 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm per day, depending on how loose the tissue in the wounded area is.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt;  Contraction usually does not occur symmetrically; rather most wounds have an 'axis of contraction' which allows for greater organization and alignment of cells with collagen.&lt;ref name="Eichler and Carlson"/&gt;

At first, contraction occurs without myofibroblast involvement.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mirastschijski U, Haaksma CJ, Tomasek JJ, Agren MS | title = Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM 6001 attenuates keratinocyte migration, contraction and myofibroblast formation in skin wounds | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 299 | issue = 2 | pages = 465–75 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15350544 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.06.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, fibroblasts, stimulated by growth factors, differentiate into myofibroblasts.  Myofibroblasts, which are similar to smooth muscle cells, are responsible for contraction.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"/&gt;  Myofibroblasts contain the same kind of actin as that found in [[smooth muscle]] cells.&lt;ref name="Hinz"/&gt;

Myofibroblasts are attracted by fibronectin and growth factors and they move along fibronectin linked to fibrin in the provisional ECM in order to reach the wound edges.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt;  They form connections to the ECM at the wound edges, and they attach to each other and to the wound edges by [[desmosomes]].  Also, at an adhesion called the [[fibronexus]], actin in the myofibroblast is linked across the cell membrane to molecules in the extracellular matrix like fibronectin and collagen.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"/&gt;  Myofibroblasts have many such adhesions, which allow them to pull the ECM when they contract, reducing the wound size.&lt;ref name="Hinz"/&gt;  In this part of contraction, closure occurs more quickly than in the first, myofibroblast-independent part.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"/&gt;

As the actin in myofibroblasts contracts, the wound edges are pulled together.  Fibroblasts lay down collagen to reinforce the wound as myofibroblasts contract.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; The contraction stage in proliferation ends as myofibroblasts stop contracting and commit apoptosis.&lt;ref name="Hinz"/&gt;  The breakdown of the provisional matrix leads to a decrease in hyaluronic acid and an increase in chondroitin sulfate, which gradually triggers fibroblasts to stop migrating and proliferating.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt;  These events signal the onset of the maturation stage of wound healing.

== Maturation and remodeling==
When the levels of collagen production and degradation equalize, the maturation phase of tissue repair is said to have begun.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; During maturation, [[type III collagen]], which is prevalent during proliferation, is replaced by type I collagen.&lt;ref name="Dealey"/&gt; Originally disorganized collagen fibers are rearranged, cross-linked, and aligned along [[tension lines]].&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt; The onset of the maturation phase may vary extensively, depending on the size of the wound and whether it was initially closed or left open,&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; ranging from approximately 3 days&lt;ref name=pollock/&gt; to 3 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2005/august/Schultz/Extrace-Matric-Acute-Chronic-Wounds.html worldwidewounds.com] &gt; [http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2005/august/Schultz/images/New_fig_3.jpg Figure 3 – The time relationship between the different processes of wound healing.] by Gregory S Schultz, Glenn Ladwig and Annette Wysocki – in turn adapted from Asmussen PD, Sollner B. Mechanism of wound healing. In: Wound Care. Tutorial Medical Series. Stuttgart: Hippokrates Verlag, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The maturation phase can last for a year or longer, similarly depending on wound type.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt;

As the phase progresses, the [[tensile strength]] of the wound increases.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; Collagen will reach approximately 20% of its tensile strength after 3 weeks, increasing to 80% by 12th week. The maximum scar strength is 80% of that of unwounded skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton LM, Phillips TJ | title = Wound healing and treating wounds: Differential diagnosis and evaluation of chronic wounds | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 589–605; quiz 605–6 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26979352 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2015.08.068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since activity at the wound site is reduced, the scar loses its red appearance as [[blood vessel]]s that are no longer needed are removed by [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt;

The phases of wound healing normally progress in a predictable, timely manner; if they do not, healing may progress inappropriately to either a [[chronic wound]]&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; such as a [[venous ulcer]] or pathological scarring such as a [[keloid scar]].&lt;ref name="O'Leary"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Leary R, Wood EJ, Guillou PJ | title = Pathological scarring: strategic interventions | journal = The European Journal of Surgery = Acta Chirurgica | volume = 168 | issue = 10 | pages = 523–34 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12666691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Desmouliere"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Desmoulière A, Chaponnier C, Gabbiani G | title = Tissue repair, contraction, and the myofibroblast | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–12 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15659031 | doi = 10.1111/j.1067-1927.2005.130102.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting wound healing==
Many factors controlling the efficacy, speed, and manner of wound healing fall under two types: local and systemic factors.&lt;ref name="Rieger"/&gt;

===Local factors===
* Moisture; keeping a wound moist rather than dry makes wound healing more rapid and with less pain and less scarring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Metzger S | title = Clinical and financial advantages of moist wound management | journal = Home Healthcare Nurse | volume = 22 | issue = 9 | pages = 586–90 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15359168 | doi = 10.1097/00004045-200409000-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mechanical factors
* [[Edema]]
*[[Ionizing radiation]]
*Faculty technique of wound closure
* [[Ischemia]] and [[necrosis]]
* Foreign bodies. Sharp, small foreign bodies can penetrate the skin leaving little surface wound but causing internal injury and internal bleeding. For a glass foreign body, "frequently, an innocent skin wound disguises the extensive nature of the injuries beneath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iconomou TG, Zuker RM, Michelow BJ | title = Management of major penetrating glass injuries to the upper extremities in children and adolescents | journal = Microsurgery | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–6 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8469109 | doi = 10.1002/micr.1920140202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First-degree nerve injury requires a few hours to a few weeks to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nerve injury |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Johns Hopkins Health System |website=Johns Hopkins Medicine |access-date=2 October 2016 |url= http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/peripheral_nerve_surgery/conditions/nerve_injury.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a foreign body passes by a nerve and causes first-degree nerve injury during entry, then the sensation of the foreign body or pain due to internal wounding may be delayed by a few hours to a few weeks after entry. A sudden increase in pain during the first few weeks of wound healing could be a sign of a recovered nerve reporting internal injuries rather than a newly developed infection.
* Low [[oxygen tension]]
* Perfusion

===Systemic factors===

* [[Inflammation]]
* [[Diabetes]] – Individuals with diabetes demonstrate reduced capability in the healing of acute wounds. Additionally, diabetic individuals are susceptible to developing chronic diabetic foot ulcers, a serious complication of diabetes which affects 15% of people with diabetes and accounts for 84% of all diabetes-related lower leg amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brem H, Tomic-Canic M | title = Cellular and molecular basis of wound healing in diabetes | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 117 | issue = 5 | pages = 1219–22 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17476353 | pmc = 1857239 | doi = 10.1172/jci32169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The impaired healing abilities of diabetics with diabetic foot ulcers and/or acute wounds involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt; This impaired healing involves hypoxia, fibroblast and epidermal cell dysfunction, impaired angiogenesis and neovascularization, high levels of metalloproteases, damage from reactive oxygen species and AGEs (advanced glycation end-products), decreased host immune resistance, and neuropathy.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;
* [[Nutrient]]s – Malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies have a recognizable impact on wound healing post trauma or surgical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnold M, Barbul A | title = Nutrition and wound healing | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 117 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 42S-58S | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16799374 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000225432.17501.6c }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients including proteins, carbohydrates, arginine, glutamine, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, copper, zinc and iron all play significant roles in wound healing.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo S, Dipietro LA | title = Factors affecting wound healing | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–29 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20139336 | pmc = 2903966 | doi = 10.1177/0022034509359125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fats and carbohydrates provide the majority of energy required for wound healing.  Glucose is the most prominent source of fuel and it is used to create cellular ATP, providing energy for angiogenesis and the deposition of new tissues.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt; As the nutritional needs of each patient and their associated wound are complex, it is suggested that tailored nutritional support would benefit both acute and chronic wound healing.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;
* [[Metabolic disease]]s
* [[Immunosuppression]]
* [[Connective tissue]] disorders
* [[Smoking]] – Smoking causes a delay in the speed of wound repair notably in the proliferative and inflammatory phases. It also increases the likelihood of certain complications such as wound rupture, wound and flap necrosis, decrease in wound tensile strength and infection.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;
* Age – Increased age (over 60 years) is a risk factor for impaired wound healing.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt; It is recognized that, in older adults of otherwise overall good health, the effects of aging causes a temporal delay in healing, but no major impairment with regard to the quality of healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gosain A, DiPietro LA | title = Aging and wound healing | journal = World Journal of Surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–6 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14961191 | doi = 10.1007/s00268-003-7397-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed wound healing in patients of increasing age is associated with altered inflammatory response; for example delayed T-cell infiltration of the wound with alterations in the production of chemokines, and reduced macrophage phagocytic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swift ME, Burns AL, Gray KL, DiPietro LA | title = Age-related alterations in the inflammatory response to dermal injury | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 117 | issue = 5 | pages = 1027–35 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11710909 | doi = 10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01539.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alcohol – Alcohol consumption impairs wound healing and also increases the chances of infection. Alcohol affects the proliferative phase of healing. A single [[unit of alcohol]] causes a negative effect on re-epithelialization, wound closure, collagen production and angiogenesis.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;

== Research and development ==
Up until about 2000, the classic paradigm of wound healing, involving [[stem cells]] restricted to organ-specific lineages, had never been seriously challenged. Since then, the notion of [[adult stem cells]] having cellular ''plasticity'' or the ability to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into non-lineage cells has emerged as an alternative explanation.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; To be more specific, [[hematopoietic]] [[progenitor cells]] (that give rise to mature cells in the blood) may have the ability ''de-differentiate''  back into hematopoietic stem cells and/or ''transdifferentiate'' into non-lineage cells, such as fibroblasts.&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song G, Nguyen DT, Pietramaggiori G, Scherer S, Chen B, Zhan Q, Ogawa R, Yannas IV, Wagers AJ, Orgill DP, Murphy GF | title = Use of the parabiotic model in studies of cutaneous wound healing to define the participation of circulating cells | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 426–32 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20546556 | pmc = 2935287 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-475X.2010.00595.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem cells and cellular plasticity===
Multipotent adult stem cells have the capacity to be self-renewing and give rise to different cell types. Stem cells give rise to progenitor cells, which are cells that are not self-renewing, but can generate several types of cells. The extent of stem cell involvement in cutaneous (skin) wound healing is complex and not fully understood.

It is thought that the epidermis and dermis are reconstituted by mitotically active stem cells that reside at the apex of [[rete ridges]] (basal stem cells or BSC), the bulge of [[hair follicle]]s (hair follicular stem cell or HFSC), and the papillary dermis (dermal stem cells).&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; Moreover, bone marrow may also contain stem cells that play a major role in cutaneous wound healing.&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/&gt;

In rare circumstances, such as extensive cutaneous injury, self-renewal subpopulations in the bone marrow are induced to participate in the healing process, whereby they give rise to collagen-secreting cells that seem to play a role during wound repair.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; These two self-renewal subpopulations are (1) bone marrow-derived [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSC) and (2) [[hematopoietic stem cells]] (HSC). Bone marrow also harbors a progenitor subpopulation ([[endothelial]] progenitor cells or EPC) that, in the same type of setting, are mobilized to aid in the reconstruction of blood vessels.&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/&gt; Moreover, it thought that, extensive injury to skin also promotes the early trafficking of a unique subclass of [[leukocytes]] (circulating [[fibrocyte]]s) to the injured region, where they perform various  functions related to wound healing.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;

=== Wound repair versus regeneration ===
An injury is an interruption of morphology and/or functionality of a given tissue. After injury, structural tissue heals with incomplete or complete regeneration.&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen/&gt; Whereas, tissue without an interruption to the morphology almost always completely regenerates. An example of complete regeneration without an interruption of the morphology is non-injured tissue, such as skin.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2/&gt; Non-injured skin has a continued replacement and regeneration of cells which always results in complete regeneration.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2/&gt;

There is a subtle distinction between 'repair' and 'regeneration'.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen/&gt; ''Repair'' means ''incomplete regeneration''.&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 =Su  | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.3 Incomplete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = The new tissue is not the same as the tissue that was lost. After the repair process has been completed, there is a loss in the structure or function of the injured tissue. In this type of repair, it is common that granulation tissue (stromal connective tissue) proliferates to fill the defect created by the necrotic cells. The necrotic cells are then replaced by scar tissue.| url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?contentID=493 | access-date = 2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair or incomplete regeneration, refers to the physiologic adaptation of an organ after injury in an effort to re-establish continuity without regards to exact replacement of lost/damaged tissue.&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt;

An example of a tissue regenerating completely after an interruption of morphology is the [[endometrium]]; the endometrium after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle heals with complete regeneration.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 =Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology| publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal. This type of regeneration is common in physiological situations. Examples of physiological regeneration are the continual replacement of cells of the skin and repair of the endometrium after menstruation. Complete regeneration can occur in pathological situations in tissues that have good regenerative capacity.  | url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?ContentID=492 | access-date = 2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, after a tissue breakdown, such as in skin, a regeneration closer to complete regeneration may be induced by the use of biodegradable ([[collagen]]-[[glycoaminoglycan]]) scaffolds. These scaffolds are structurally analogous to [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) found in normal/un-injured dermis.&lt;ref name="Yannas, Lee, Orgill, Skrabut, Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yannas IV, Lee E, Orgill DP, Skrabut EM, Murphy GF | title = Synthesis and characterization of a model extracellular matrix that induces partial regeneration of adult mammalian skin | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 933–7 | date = February 1989 | pmid = 2915988 | pmc = 286593 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.86.3.933 | bibcode = 1989PNAS...86..933Y | jstor = 33315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental conditions required for tissue regeneration often oppose conditions that favor efficient wound repair, including inhibition of (1) platelet activation, (2) inflammatory response, and (3) wound contraction.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; In addition to providing support for fibroblast and endothelial cell attachment, biodegradable scaffolds inhibit wound contraction, thereby allowing the healing process to proceed towards a more-regenerative/less-scarring pathway. Pharmaceutical agents have been investigated which may be able to turn off [[myofibroblast]] differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Leary R, Ponnambalam S, Wood EJ | title = Pioglitazone-induced myofibroblast cell death: implications for cutaneous scarring | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 665–7 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14511015 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05501.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new way of thinking derived from the notion that [[heparan sulfate]]s are key player in tissue homeostasis:  the process that makes the tissue replace dead cells by identical cells. In wound areas, tissue homeostasis is lost as the heparan sulfates are degraded preventing the replacement of dead cells by identical cells. [[Heparan sulfate analogue]]s cannot be degraded by all know heparanases and glycanases and bind to the free heparin sulfate binding spots on the ECM, therefore preserving the normal tissue homeostasis and preventing scarring.&lt;ref name="Tong2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tong M, Tuk B, Hekking IM, Vermeij M, Barritault D, van Neck JW | title = Stimulated neovascularization, inflammation resolution and collagen maturation in healing rat cutaneous wounds by a heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan mimetic, OTR4120 | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 840–52 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19903305 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-475X.2009.00548.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barritault"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barritault D, Caruelle JP | title = [Regenerating agents (RGTAs): a new therapeutic approach] | language = French | journal = Annales Pharmaceutiques Francaises | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–44 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16568015 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-4509(06)75306-8 | trans-title = Regenerating agents (RGTAs): a new therapeutic approach }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intech"&gt;Van Neck et al, Heparan sulfate proteoglycan mimetics thrive tissue regeneration: an overview.

Repair or regeneration with regards to hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a). In normal circumstances after injury [[HIF1A|HIF-1a]] is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Scientists found that the simple up-regulation of HIF-1a via PHD inhibitors regenerates lost or damaged tissue in mammals that have a repair response; and the continued down-regulation of Hif-1a results in healing with a scarring response in mammals with a previous regenerative response to the loss of tissue. The act of regulating HIF-1a can either turn off, or turn on the key process of mammalian regeneration.&lt;ref name=HIF-1a2015&gt;{{cite web| last = eurekalert.org staff | title = Scientist at LIMR leads study demonstrating drug-induced tissue regeneration | website = eurekalert.org | publisher = Lankenau Institute for Medical Research (LIMR), | date = 3 June 2015 | url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-06/mlhl-sal060215.php | access-date = 3 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HIFregulation2015&gt;Zhang Y, Strehin I, Bedelbaeva K, Gourevitch D, Clark L, Leferovich J, Messersmith PB, Heber-Katz E.

===Scarless wound healing===
''Scarless wound healing'' is a concept based on the healing or repair of the skin (or other tissue/organs) after injury with the aim of healing with subjectively and relatively ''less'' [[scar]] tissue than normally expected. Scarless healing is sometimes mixed up with the concept of ''[[scar free healing]],'' which is wound healing which results in absolutely no scar (''free'' of scarring). However they are different concepts.

A reverse to scarless wound healing is [[scarification]] (wound healing to scar more). Historically, certain cultures consider scarification attractive;&lt;ref name="Rush2005"&gt;Rush, J. (2005). Spiritual tattoo: a cultural history of tattooing, piercing, scarification, branding, and implants, Frog Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this is generally not the case in the modern western society, in which many patients are turning to [[plastic surgery]] clinics with unrealistic expectations. Depending on [[scar]] type, treatment may be [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] (intralesional steroid injections, [[surgery]]) and/or conservative ([[Cold compression therapy|compression therapy]], topical [[silicone gel]], [[brachytherapy]], [[photodynamic therapy]]).&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown BC, McKenna SP, Siddhi K, McGrouther DA, Bayat A | title = The hidden cost of skin scars: quality of life after skin scarring | journal = Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive &amp; Aesthetic Surgery | volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 1049–58 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18617450 | doi = 10.1016/j.bjps.2008.03.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical judgment is necessary to successfully balance the potential benefits of the various treatments available against the likelihood of a poor response and possible complications resulting from these treatments. Many of these treatments may only have a [[placebo effect]], and the evidence base for the use of many current treatments is poor.&lt;ref name="Bayat2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bayat A, McGrouther DA, Ferguson MW | title = Skin scarring | journal = BMJ | volume = 326 | issue = 7380 | pages = 88–92 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12521975 | pmc = 1125033 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.326.7380.88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, comprehension of the basic biologic processes involved in [[wound repair]] and [[tissue regeneration]] have expanded due to advances in cellular and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref name="Clark1996"&gt;Clark, R. (1996). The molecular and cellular biology of wound repair, Springer Us.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the principal goals in wound management are to achieve rapid wound closure with a functional tissue that has minimal aesthetic scarring.&lt;ref name="Tonnesen2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonnesen MG, Feng X, Clark RA | title = Angiogenesis in wound healing | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology. Symposium Proceedings | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–6 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11147674 | doi = 10.1046/j.1087-0024.2000.00014.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ultimate goal of wound healing biology is to induce a more perfect reconstruction of the wound area. Scarless wound healing only occurs in mammalian foetal tissues&lt;ref name="Ferguson1996" /&gt; and complete [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] is limited to lower vertebrates, such as [[salamanders]], and [[invertebrates]].&lt;ref name="Brockes2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A, Velloso CP | title = Regeneration as an evolutionary variable | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 199 | issue = Pt 1-2 | pages = 3–11 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11523827 | pmc = 1594962 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2001.19910003.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In adult humans, injured tissue are repaired by [[collagen]] deposition, collagen remodelling and eventual scar formation, where fetal wound healing is believed to be more of a regenerative process with minimal or no scar formation.&lt;ref name="Ferguson1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferguson MW, Whitby DJ, Shah M, Armstrong J, Siebert JW, Longaker MT | title = Scar formation: the spectral nature of fetal and adult wound repair | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 854–60 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8628785 | doi = 10.1097/00006534-199604000-00029 | url = http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&amp;volume=97&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=854 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, foetal wound healing can be used to provide an accessible mammalian model of an optimal healing response in adult human tissues. Clues as to how this might be achieved come from studies of wound healing in embryos, where repair is fast and efficient and results in essentially perfect regeneration of any lost tissue.

The etymology of the term scarless wound healing has a long history.&lt;ref name =scrlss20131/&gt;&lt;ref name =scrlss20132/&gt;&lt;ref name =scrlss20133/&gt; In print the antiquated concept of scarless healing was brought up the early 20th century and appeared in a paper published in the London Lancet. This process involved cutting in a surgical slant, instead of a right angle…; it was described in various Newspapers.&lt;ref name =scrlss20131&gt;{{cite news | title = Scarless Healing | newspaper = Star | location = Christchurch, New Zealand | pages = Page 4 | publisher = Star | date = 1906-07-07 | url = http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TS19060707.2.27&amp;e=-------10-PubMetaTS-231-byDA---0elmwood-- | access-date = 2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =scrlss20132&gt;{{cite news | title = Scarless Healing | newspaper = Marlborough Express, Volume XXXIX, Issue 160, | pages = Page 1 | publisher = paperspast.natlib.govt.nz | date = 1906-07-12 | url = http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=MEX19060712.2.8 | access-date = 2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =scrlss20133&gt;{{cite news | title = A Wonderful New Surgery | newspaper = Reading Eagle | pages = Page 6 | publisher = | date = 1906-07-06 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DIctAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XJwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4204,3012981&amp;dq=scarless+healing&amp;hl=en| access-date = 2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
After inflammation, restoration of normal tissue integrity and function is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted cytokines. Disruption of normal feedback mechanisms in cancer threatens tissue integrity and enables a malignant tumor to escape the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karin M, Clevers H | title = Reparative inflammation takes charge of tissue regeneration | journal = Nature | volume = 529 | issue = 7586 | pages = 307–15 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26791721 | pmc = 5228603 | doi = 10.1038/nature17039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulating wound healing from a growth perspective==
Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the physical relationships governing wound healing and subsequent scarring, with mathematical models and simulations developed to elucidate these relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cumming BD, McElwain DL, Upton Z | title = A mathematical model of wound healing and subsequent scarring | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 7 | issue = 42 | pages = 19–34 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19324672 | pmc = 2839370 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2008.0536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of tissue around the wound site is a result of the migration of cells and collagen deposition by these cells.  The alignment of collagen describes the degree of scarring; basket-weave orientation of collagen is characteristic of normal skin, whereas aligned collagen fibers lead to significant scarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gurtner GC, Werner S, Barrandon Y, Longaker MT | title = Wound repair and regeneration | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7193 | pages = 314–21 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18480812 | doi = 10.1038/nature07039 | bibcode = 2008Natur.453..314G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been shown that the growth of tissue and extent of scar formation can be controlled by modulating the stress at a wound site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gurtner GC, Dauskardt RH, Wong VW, Bhatt KA, Wu K, Vial IN, Padois K, Korman JM, Longaker MT | title = Improving cutaneous scar formation by controlling the mechanical environment: large animal and phase I studies | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 254 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–25 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21606834 | doi = 10.1097/SLA.0b013e318220b159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of tissue can be simulated using the aforementioned relationships from a biochemical and biomechanical point of view.  The biologically active chemicals that play an important role in wound healing are modeled with Fickian diffusion to generate concentration profiles.  The balance equation for open systems when modeling wound healing incorporates mass growth due to cell migration and proliferation.  Here the following equation is used:

D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Div (R) + R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,

where ''ρ'' represents mass density, ''R'' represents a mass flux (from cell migration), and ''R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents a mass source (from cell proliferation, division, or enlargement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhl E, Steinmann P | title = Computational modeling of healing: an application of the material force method | journal = Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 187–203 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 14872320 | doi = 10.1007/s10237-003-0034-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships like these can be incorporated into an [[agent-based model]]s, where the sensitivity to single parameters such as initial collagen alignment, cytokine properties, and cell proliferation rates can be tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rouillard AD, Holmes JW | title = Mechanical regulation of fibroblast migration and collagen remodelling in healing myocardial infarcts | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 590 | issue = 18 | pages = 4585–602 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22495588 | pmc = 3477759 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2012.229484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wound closure intentions{{anchor|Types}}==
Successful wound healing is dependent on various cell types, molecular mediators and structural elements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Velnar T, Bailey T, Smrkolj V | title = The wound healing process: an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms | journal = The Journal of International Medical Research | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 1528–42 | date = 2009-10-01 | pmid = 19930861 | doi = 10.1177/147323000903700531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary intention===
Primary intention is the healing of a clean wound without tissue loss.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this process, wound edges are brought together, so that they are adjacent to each other (re-approximated). Wound closure is performed with sutures (stitches), staples, or adhesive tape or glue.

Primary intention can only be implemented when the wound is precise and there is minimal disruption to the local tissue and the epithelial basement membrane, e.g. surgical incisions.&lt;ref name="Armitage 496–501"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armitage|first=Jon|last2=Lockwood|first2=Sonia | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011-10-01|title=Skin incisions and wound closure |journal=Surgery (Oxford)|series=Wound Management|volume=29|issue=10|pages=496–501|doi=10.1016/j.mpsur.2011.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process is faster than healing by secondary intention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also less scarring associated with primary intention, as there are no large tissue losses to be filled with granulation tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Primary intention does require some granulation tissue to form.)
*Examples of primary intention include: well-repaired [[laceration]]s, well reduced [[bone fracture]]s, healing after [[flap surgery]].

===Secondary intention===
* Secondary intention is implemented when primary intention is not possible.
* This is due to wounds being created by major trauma in which there has been a significant loss in tissue or tissue damage.&lt;ref name="Armitage 496–501"/&gt;
*The wound is allowed to granulate.
*Surgeon may pack the wound with a gauze or use a drainage system.
*Granulation results in a broader scar.
*Healing process can be slow due to presence of drainage from infection.
*Wound care must be performed daily to encourage wound debris removal to allow for granulation tissue formation.
*Using antibiotics or antiseptics for the surgical wound healing by secondary intention is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norman G, Dumville JC, Mohapatra DP, Owens GL, Crosbie EJ | title = Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 3 | pages = CD011712 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 27021482 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Examples: [[gingivectomy]], [[gingivoplasty]], [[tooth extraction]] sockets, poorly reduced fractures, burns, severe lacerations, pressure ulcers.

===Tertiary intention===
(Delayed primary closure or secondary suture):
*The wound is initially cleaned, debrided and observed, typically 4 or 5 days before closure.
*The wound is purposely left open.
*Examples: healing of wounds by use of [[tissue graft]]s.

If the wound edges are not reapproximated immediately, delayed primary wound healing transpires. This type of healing may be desired in the case of contaminated wounds. By the fourth day, phagocytosis of contaminated tissues is well underway, and the processes of epithelization, collagen deposition, and maturation are occurring. Foreign materials are walled off by macrophages that may metamorphose into epithelioid cells, which are encircled by mononuclear leukocytes, forming granulomas. Usually the wound is closed surgically at this juncture, and if the "cleansing" of the wound is incomplete, chronic inflammation can ensue, resulting in prominent scarring.

==Complications of wound healing==

The major complications are many:

#Deficient scar formation: Results in [[wound dehiscence]] or rupture of the wound due to inadequate formation of granulation tissue.
#Excessive scar formation: [[Hypertrophic scar]], [[keloid]], [[desmoid]].
#Exuberant granulation ([[proud flesh]]).
#Deficient contraction (in skin grafts) or excessive contraction (in burns).
#Others: [[Dystrophic calcification]], pigmentary changes, painful scars, [[incisional hernia]]

Other complications can include [[Infection]] and [[Marjolin's ulcer]].

==Biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds==
