{{nihongo|'''Arai Helmet, Limited'''|株式会社 アライヘルメット|Kabushiki-gaisha Arai Herumetto}} is a Japanese company that designs and manufactures [[motorcycle helmet]]s and other helmets for motorsport. It was formed in 1926 by Hirotake Arai as a [[Hatmaking|hatmaker]].&lt;ref name="familypride"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.araiamericas.com/Arai_Advantage/family.html |title=Family Pride |publisher=Araiamericas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502061615/http://www.araiamericas.com/Arai_Advantage/family.html |archivedate=2011-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Michio "Mitch" Arai runs the company and his grand son, Akihito, is also involved.&lt;ref name="familypride"/&gt;

==Background==
Every Arai helmet is hand-built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.araiamericas.com/Arai_Advantage/pursuit.html |title=Pursuit of Quality |publisher=Araiamericas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502061620/http://www.araiamericas.com/Arai_Advantage/pursuit.html |archivedate=2011-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
All Arai helmets sold in the US meet or exceed the [[Snell Memorial Foundation]] safety standards. The current certification for motorcycles is M2010 which was released in the beginning of 2010.  For auto racing and karting the helmets that are sold today are still SA2005 and K2005 certified, these helmets will be legal for competition until 2015.  The 2010 certified auto racing and karting helmets will not be available for sale until October 1, 2010.  These will be certified as SA2010, K2010 and a new SAH2010 will be introduced which will include HANS anchor posts as part of the certification process.

The product has been ranked first in customer satisfaction in all ten annual [[J. D. Power and Associates]] Motorcycle Helmet Satisfaction Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/pressrelease.aspx?ID=2008060 |title=2008 Motorcycle Helmet Satisfaction Study &amp;#124; J.D.

The '''Breadalbane Brooch''' is a luxurious [[Celtic art|Celtic]] [[penannular brooch]] probably made in [[Ireland]], but later altered and then found in [[Scotland]]. Probably dating to the 8th century, with 9th-century alterations, it is an intricately designed, [[silver-gilt]] dress fastener that is closely related to a select group of brooches that were produced in Ireland and Britain during the  'golden age' of late [[Celtic art]]. The brooch has been in the [[British Museum]] since 1919, and is normally on display.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=66790&amp;partId=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The brooch and pin were cast in silver with exquisite [[geometric]] and [[zoomorphic]] interlace patterns and inset with three green-glass [[cabochon]] gems (one of which is missing).  Several moulded sections were used, although the main ring was cast in one piece, other goldsmith's techniques were used in the decoration. both front and back were partially [[gilding|gilded]], with gold and [[gold foil]] also used in parts of the decoration. There may have been inset pieces of [[amber]], which are now missing. There is decoration on both front and back, in rather different styles, a feature also found in the [[Tara Brooch]] and [[Hunterston Brooch]].&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 94&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Image:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 015-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Photo with flash showing the colour variations better]]

This is one of a number of brooches which were made in the Irish "pseudo-penannular" style, with the ring fully closed (like the two just mentioned and the [[Londesborough Brooch]]), but later adapted to a true penannular brooch by cutting away the bridging section linking the large terminals.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 94-95&lt;/ref&gt; The pin, which moves freely around the ring between the terminals (see other picture), is broken but would have originally extended to at least double the brooch's diameter.  It appears to be a replacement, made in Scotland, probably at the same time that the form of the ring was adapted, by cutting the bridge to make the brooch truly penannular.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of ownership==
The design and manufacture of the brooch mixes Celtic and [[Picts#Art|Pictish]] styles - it may originally have been a gift from an Irish dignitary to his Scottish counterpart, who later repaired or embellished the brooch according to local tastes. The original [[provenance]] of the brooch is unknown, although it is conjectured that the brooch was found in [[Perthshire]] in Scotland as it was probably first owned by [[Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane]], whose country estate was located in that county. The brooch was later donated to the national collection by Sir John Ramsden, following the sale of the Breadalbane Collection in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Byzantine culture}}
The city of [[Byzantium]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] occupies an important place in the history of [[garden design]] between eras and cultures (c. 4th century - 10th century CE). The city, later renamed [[Constantinople]] and the present day [[Istanbul]], was capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and survived for a thousand years after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The [[garden]]s of Byzantium were, however, mostly destroyed after the 15th-century Turkish conquest of the city.

==Design==
Byzantine gardens were based largely on Roman ideas emphasizing elaborate [[mosaic]] designs, a typical classical feature of formally arrayed trees and built elements such as [[fountain]]s and small [[shrines]]. These gradually grew to become more elaborate as time passed. Byzantine gardens have influenced Islamic gardens and particularly moorish gardens (because Spain was before a Byzantine province, [[Hispania Baetica]].

==Study==
Little else is known about Byzantine gardens, however, and very few references, let alone entire treatises, exist on the subject. The Byzantines, like their [[Greco-Roman]] predecessors, attached great importance to such matters of [[aesthetics]]. However, ancient [[Greek gardens]] and [[Roman gardens]] were more developed and documented.

[[Image:Enghien 050918 (21).jpg|right|thumb|A modern bronze copy of a [[Greek Art|Greek]] garden statue, the type of which survived well into [[Late Antiquity]].]]

==Later Greek rule==
During the last 250 years of Greek rule, ending in 1453, conditions drastically curtailed the tradition,  which stretched back to Hellenistic times, of building luxurious villas, mostly outside the cities, with pleasing gardens, as appear in mosaics and frescoes or are recorded in texts. This period seems to have been less thoroughly investigated than have most earlier periods, and a concentration on it should produce a more coherent picture than another attempt to cover the whole span of Byzantine history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4501">The '''color killer''' is an electronic stage in color [[TV]] receiver sets which acts as a cutting circuit to cut off the color amplifiers when the TV receives a [[monochrome]] signal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/color+killer+circuit thefreedictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monochromatic transmission ==
When a receiver is tuned to a monochrome transmission, the displayed scene should have no color components. However, there are two factors which result in color display even during monochrome transmission:
* a high frequency component of the luminance signal
* a high frequency of external noise

When the frequencies of these signals equals the frequency of the color subcarrier wave, they may create an irritating color dot pattern like ''confetti'', which interferes with the monochrome picture.

== Color transmission ==
In a color TV waveform, a reference pulse, called the [[colorburst|burst]],{{efn|name=burst}} is transmitted along the [[back porch]] portion of the video signal. If the transmitted signal is monochromatic, then the burst is not transmitted. The color killer is actually a muting circuit in the chroma section which supervises the burst and turns off the color amplifiers if no burst is received (i.e. when the received signal is monochromatic.)&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grob-Charles E.Herndon:''Basic television and Video systems'', Glanceo McGraw Hill, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-02-800437-2}}, p. 456–458.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equation ==
In [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] transmissions, the color TV signal can be represented as:{{efn|name=SECAM}}

:&lt;math&gt;E(t) = E_y(t)+ a_1\cdot(E_b(t)-E_y(t))\cdot \sin(\omega t)+ a_2\cdot(E_r(t)-E_y(t))\cdot \cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; are attenuation factors, &lt;math&gt;E_y &lt;/math&gt; is the [[luminance]] signal, &lt;math&gt;(E_b-E_y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(E_r-E_y)&lt;/math&gt; are the so-called color difference signals and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency of the color carrier. &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is within the luminance bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;For more complete equation see ''Reference Data for Radio Engineers'', Howard W. Sams Co, {{ISBN|978-0-672-21218-5}}, pp. 30–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color eraser (''Mehikon'') ==
In the '70s, the Israeli government considered the import of color televisions as frivolous and a luxury that would increase social gaps. Therefore, the government ordered the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] to cease broadcasting in color.  As it was impractical to strip out the chrominance signal from material recorded in color, this was accomplished by simply omitting the [[burst phase]] signal from the broadcast.  The "damaged" signal triggered the "color killer" mechanism, installed in color TV sets to prevent the appearance of color. This method was named ''Mehikon'' ({{lang-he|מחיקון}} "eraser").

Soon after its introduction of the "Color eraser", special TV sets with an ''Anti-Mehikon'' ({{lang-he|אנטי-מחיקון}} "anti-eraser") device were offered. This device re-constructed the burst phase signal according to several known standards. The client had to turn a knob until the pictures on the screen appeared in natural colors. According to a report in ''[[Yediot Aharonoth]]'' from January 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Report from 19 January 1979 by Leah Etgar on Yediot Aharonot's economic supplement ("HaLirot Shelkha"), partially cited in "The Future that was: Anti-Mekhikon", a historical review by Gal Mor, [[Ynet]], 7 June 2004 (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; clients had to adjust the knob every 15 minutes on average in normal conditions, or up to 10 times an hour when special problems occurred, in order to restore natural colors or if the picture suddenly turned black and white.

Based on information from owners of electricity appliance stores, the report estimated that 90% of those who bought color TV sets also bought the ''Anti-Mehikon'' device, which added about 5–10% to the price of the television.

Eventually, the Mehikon idea was proven to be futile, and the Israeli television stopped using it in 1980, allowing color transmissions to be received freely.

[[File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|thumb|The Curtain Theatre is labelled in the top right of this London street map. [[:File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|Enlarge]]]]
'''The Curtain Theatre''' was an [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]] playhouse located in Hewett Street, [[Shoreditch]] (part of the modern [[London Borough of Hackney]]), just outside the [[City of London]]. It opened in 1577, and continued staging plays until 1624.&lt;ref&gt;N. W. Bawcutt, ''The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama: The Records of Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels, 1623-1673'', Oxford, 1996, pp. 141, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Curtain was built some {{Convert|200|yd|}} south of London's first playhouse, [[The Theatre]], which had opened a year before, in 1576. It was called the "Curtain" because it was located near a plot of land called Curtain Close, not because of the sort of front curtain associated with modern theatres, but of its proximity of the City walls, curtain or [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] referring to the part of city walls between two [[bastion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Quincy Adams, ''Shakespearean Playhouses'', Boston, 1917, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Its remains were rediscovered in archaeological excavation in 2012.  The most significant find was that the Curtain was rectangular not round.  They found a {{Convert|14|m||adj=on}} stage, and evidence of a tunnel under the stage and galleries at the first floor level. Finds included a ceramic bird whistle; ceramic money boxes for collecting entry fees; beads likely for decorating stage costumes and a small statue of Bacchus.

==History==
The Curtain Theatre was built in 1577 in [[Shoreditch]], and was London's second playhouse. Little is known of the companies that performed there, or of the plays they performed. The first clear mention of the Curtain is in 1584, when the [[City of London]] petitioned the parish of [[Shoreditch]] to shut down their playhouses.&lt;ref name="Bowsher"/&gt;{{rp|63}} The proprietor appears to have been Henry Lanman, described as a "gentleman": in 1585, Lanman made an agreement with the proprietor of the Theatre, [[James Burbage]], to use the Curtain as a supplementary house, or "easer," to the more prestigious older playhouse. From 1597 to 1599, it became the premier venue of [[Shakespeare's]] Company, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], who had been forced to leave their former playing space at The Theatre after the latter closed in 1596. It was the venue of several of Shakespeare's plays, including ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (which gained "Curtain plaudits") and ''Henry IV'' [[Henry IV, Part 1|Part I]] and [[Henry IV, Part 2|Part II]]. The Lord Chamberlain's Men also performed [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' here in 1598, with Shakespeare in the cast.&lt;ref&gt;E.K. Chambers, ''The Elizabethan Stage'' volume III, Oxford, 1923, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year Jonson gained a certain notoriety by killing actor [[Gabriel Spencer]] in a duel in nearby [[Hoxton|Hoxton Fields]].

The Lord Chamberlain's Men departed the Curtain when the [[Globe Theatre]], which they built to replace the Theatre, was ready for use in 1599.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EvSLt5GaPjwC| title= Making Shakespeare: From Stage to Page|last=Stern| first=Tiffany| isbn=978-0415319652| publisher=[[Routledge]]| page=15| date=February 2004|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For seven years Henry Lanman (owner of the Curtain) had an agreement with James Burbage (owner of the Theatre) that all profit would be shared between them. This deal is how many believe Lanman was able to afford to open the Curtain, the rest is all very unclear. J. Leeds Barroll focuses in ''Shakespeare studies: An annual gathering of Research, Criticism and Reviews'' on the fact that Henry Lanman had offered the Curtain as an easer to James Burbage, proprietor of the Theatre. Thereby, he assumes that Lanman’s business, the Curtain, must have been doing as well as Burbage’s business, the Theatre, since both, Lanman and Burbage, had agreed on a pooling arrangement for seven years in 1585, to pool profits. As far as is known, Lanman ran the Curtain as a private concern for the first phase of its existence; He died in 1606&lt;ref&gt;William Ingram, ''The Business of Playing: The Beginnings of the Adult Professional Theater in Elizabethan London'', Cornell University Press, 1992, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is assumed by Edmund Chambers that the theatre had been re-arranged into a shareholder’s enterprise before his death at some point. [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], one of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, owned a share in the Curtain and left it to his heirs in his last will and testament in 1603. [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] member [[John Underwood (actor)|John Underwood]] did the same in 1624.&lt;ref name="Bowsher"/&gt;{{rp|63}}&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that both of these shareholders belonged to Shakespeare's company may indicate that the re-organization of the Curtain occurred when the Lord Chamberlain's Men were acting there. Otherwise, it would be very unwise of Burbage to pool profits if he did better in the first place. Thus, the suggestion is given that both proprietors were doing equal business. Burbage's father [[Richard Burbage|Richard]] had shares in the theatre at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Collier"/&gt;{{rp|144}}

The London theatres, including the Curtain, were closed for much of the period from September 1592 to April 1594 due to the bubonic plague.{{sfn|Chambers|1930|pp=44–7}} In 1597, people wrote to the local magistrates' court demanding that no plays take place at the Curtain or the Theatre that year.&lt;ref name="Collier"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DpsNAAAAQAAJ| title=The works of William Shakespeare |publisher=General Books |last=Collier |first=John Payne |author-link=John Payne Collier |isbn=9780217290210| date=2012|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}} The Curtain was named in [[John Stow]]'s ''Survey of London'' in 1598, but was not listed in the 1603 edition.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Theatrical City: Culture, Theatre and Politics in London, 1576-1649| last1=Smith| first1=David L.| last2= Strier| first2=Richard| last3=Bevington| first3=David| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| date=2002| page=50| isbn=0521526159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1600, the [[Privy Council]] tried unsuccessfully to shut down the Curtain theatre,&lt;ref name="Bowsher"/&gt; and in 1603, the Curtain became the playhouse of [[Queen Anne's Men]] (formerly known as [[Worcester's Men]], and formerly at the Rose Theatre, where they'd played [[Thomas Heywood|Heywood's]] ''A Woman Kill'd With Kindness'' in February of that year).&lt;ref name="Bowsher"/&gt;{{rp|64}} In 1607, ''The Travels of the Three English Brothers,'' by [[William Rowley|Rowley]], [[John Day (dramatist)|Day]], and [[George Wilkins|Wilkins]], was performed at the Curtain.

The Curtain was in use from 1577 until at least 1624, after which its ultimate fate is obscure as there is no record of it after 1627. The reasons for its closure are not known.

==Site and rediscovery==
The Curtain was believed to have been built near [[The Theatre]], but the exact location was for many years unknown.&lt;ref name="SO"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.shakespeare-online.com/theatre/thecurtain.html| title= The Curtain| publisher=Shakespeare Online|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/curtain-elizabethan-theatre.htm| title= Curtain Elizabethan Theatre|  publisher=Elizabethan Era Online| access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a commemorative plaque was erected at 18 Hewett Street.&lt;ref name="Bowsher"&gt;{{cite book|title= Shakespeare's London Theatreland: Archaeology, History and Drama| last=Bowsher| first=Julian |publisher=[[Museum of London Archaeology]]| date=July 2012| isbn=9781907586125}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Curtain Theatre |url=http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-the-curtain-theatre.htm |date=28 Feb 2007 |publisher=London Borough of Hackney | accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, archaeologists from [[Museum of London Archaeology|MOLA]] (Museum of London Archaeology) announced that they had discovered the remains of the theatre during trial excavations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Remains of Shakespeare’s Curtain Theatre discovered in Shoreditch|publisher=[[Museum of London Archaeology]]|date=6 June 2012 |url=http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/NewsProjects/CurtainTheatre.htm |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian20120605"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/06/shakespeare-curtain-theatre-shoreditch-east-lonfon |title=Shakespeare's Curtain theatre unearthed in east London |work=The Guardian |date=5 June 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |last=Kennedy |first=Maev}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 plans were submitted to develop the site with a 40-storey tower of 400 apartments plus Shakespeare museum, 250-seat outdoor auditorium and park, with the archaeological remains visible in a glass enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Curtain lifts on open-air stage at Shakespeare theatre site in Shoreditch|work=[[Evening Standard]]|date=24 January 2013|accessdate=5 July 2013|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/curtain-lifts-on-openair-stage-at-shakespeare-theatre-site-in-shoreditch-8464712.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thestageshoreditch.com/|title=The Stage, Shoreditch|last=|first=|date=12 April 2016|website=The Stage, Shoreditch|publisher=|access-date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the project is expected in 2019.

Also uncovered was a fragmentary ceramic bird whistle, dating from the late 16th century. This raised the question of whether the bird whistle was merely a Tudor toy or a prop for plays that needed sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Bird whistle from first Romeo and Juliet|last=Furness|first=Hannah|date=18 March 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, a tunnel structure - accessed by doors on either end of the stage - was unearthed, which would have allowed actors to exit from one side and come on again from the other without being seen by the audience.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Fragments of ceramic money boxes were found, which would have been used to collect entry fees from theatregoers, before being taken to an office to be smashed and the money counted - this office was known as the ‘box office’, which is the origin of the term we use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2016/11/10/curtain-theatre-shakespeare-shoreditch-excavation-mysteries-unearthed/|title=Mysteries unearthed in Shoreditch excavation of Shakespeare's Curtain Theatre|last=Loeb|first=Josh|date=2016-11-10|website=Hackney Citizen|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Céline Sciamma''' (born 12 November 1978) is a [[French people|French]] [[screenwriter]] and [[film director]].

Sciamma's work is strikingly minimalist, partly the legacy of her mentor, [[Xavier Beauvois]], who advised her while she was a student at the major French film school, [[La Fémis]]. While highly formalist and idiosyncratic (notably in her lack of dialogue and very stylized [[Mise en scène|mise-en-scene]]), Sciamma's filmmaking, beginning with ''[[Water Lilies (film)|Water Lilies]]'' relates closely to the characteristics of first-time filmmaking in France, notably in its emphasis on [[coming-of-age film]]s focused on adolescents or pre-adolescents. Sciamma is very interested, moreover, in the fluidity of gender and sexual identity among girls during this formative period.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Tim (2011). ''Brutal Intimacy: Analyzing Contemporary French Cinema'', Wesleyan University Press, Middleton CT. {{ISBN|0-8195-6827-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Sciamma was raised in [[Cergy-Pontoise]], a suburb outside of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romney|first1=Jonathan|title=The stars of Girlhood: ‘Our poster is all over Paris, with four black faces on it…’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/26/girlhood-film-karidja-toure-assa-sylla-celine-sciamma|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father Dominique Sciamma is a software designer, and her brother Laurent Sciamma is a stand-up performer and graphic designer. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branquart|first1=Victor|title=Laurent Sciamma : meilleur espoir|url=http://www.standardmagazine.com/laurent-sciamma|work=Standard Magazine|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before attending La Fémis, Sciamma studied literature.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=David|title=Celine Sciamma:interview|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/caline-sciamma-interview|work=TimeOut London|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child she was an avid reader and became interested in film as a teenager.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; She wrote her first original  script for ''[[Water Lilies (film)|Water Lilies]]'' as part of  her final evaluation at La Fémis. [[Xavier Beauvois]], who was chairman of the evaluation panel, persuaded her to make the film.&lt;ref name="Lambies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambies|first1=Josep|title=Céline Sciamma talks 'Tomboy'|url=https://www.timeout.com/barcelona/film/celine-sciamma-talks-tomboy|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after finishing school she began shooting the film in her hometown.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt|first1=Rosy|title= INTERVIEW WITH CÉLINE SCIAMMA|url=http://takeonecinema.net/2011/interview-with-celine-sciamma/|accessdate= 13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her debut film ''[[Water Lilies (film)|Water Lilies]]'' was selected for screening in the section ''[[Un certain regard]]'' at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film secured three nominations for the 2008 [[César Awards]]; Sciamma was nominated for the 2008 [[César Award for Best Debut]], and actresses [[Adèle Haenel]] and [[Louise Blachère]] were both nominated for the 2008 [[César Award for Most Promising Actress]].

Sciamma directed her first short film ''Pauline'' in 2009 as part of a government anti-homophobia campaign called ‘Five films against homophobia’.&lt;ref name="Lambies"/&gt;

Her 2011 film ''[[Tomboy (2011 film)|Tomboy]]'' was written and shot in a matter of months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silverstein|first1=Melissa|title=Interview with Celine Sciamma: Writer/Director of Tomboy  BLOGS|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/interview-with-celine-sciamma-writer-director-of-tomboy|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sciamma wrote the script in three weeks, completed casting in three weeks, and shot the film in 20 days.&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt; It premiered at the [[61st Berlin International Film Festival]] in the Panorama section of the festival. The film was shown in French schools as part of an educational program. &lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt;

Her 2014 film ''[[Girlhood (film)|Girlhood]]'' was selected to be screened as part of the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section of the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Cannes2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/cannes/cannes-directors-fortnight-2014-lineup-unveiled/5070844.article |title=Cannes Directors' Fortnight 2014 lineup unveiled |accessdate=26 April 2014 |work=Screendaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was also played at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]] and the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]]. In interviews Sciamma stated that ''[[Girlhood (film)|Girlhood]]'' would be her last coming-of-age film and she considered it, along with ''[[Water Lilies (film)|Water Lilies]]'' and ''[[Tomboy (2011 film)|Tomboy]]'', a trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blay|first1=Zeba|title=Interview: 'Girlhood' Director Celine Sciamma on Race, Gender &amp; the Universality of the Story|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/interview-girlhood-director-celine-sciamma-on-race-gender-the-universality-of-the-story-20150206|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In between directing her own films, Sciamma continues to work as a screenwriter for other directors. She was sought after by [[André Téchiné]], whose work Sciamma admired as a youth, to co-write the screenplay for his 2016 film ''[[Being 17]]''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopiejwski|first1=Faustine|title=“Quand on a 17 ans”: Céline Sciamma au scénario du nouveau film d'André Téchiné|url=http://cheekmagazine.fr/culture/cinema-celine-sciamma-quand-on-a-17-ans/|work=CheekMagazine|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her fourth feature film titled ''Portrait of a Lady on Fire'' is set to begin shooting in Autumn 2018 with a anticipated release in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Melanie|title=mk2 launches sales on Céline Sciamma's 'Portrait of A Lady On Fire', Porumboiu's 'The Passenger' (exclusive)|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/mk2-launches-sales-on-celine-sciammas-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-porumboius-the-passenger-exclusive/5132022.article|work=Screendaily|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, Sciamma has served as the co-president of the SRF (Society of Film Directors). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nouveau Conseil d’administration de la Société des réalisateurs de films 2017-2018|url=http://www.la-srf.fr/tags/documentaire|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal Life==
In 2014, Sciamma was in a relationship with the actress [[Adele Haenel]] whom she met on the set of ''[[Water Lilies (film)|Water Lilies]]''. Haenel publicly acknowledged their relationship in her acceptance speech for her César award in 2014.&lt;ref name=JRomney&gt;{{cite web |author=Jonathen Romney|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/04/adele-haenel-unknown-girl-inteview-dardenne|title=Adele Haenel, ''Recycling cliches is a sign that a film lacks courage''|date=4 December 2016|accessdate=8 December 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship continued as of 2017. &lt;ref name=Lavenir&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavenir.net/cnt/dmf20161002_00889843/une-bien-belle-vie-de-courgette|title=Une Bien Belle Vie de Courgette|date=2 October 2016|accessdate=26 February 2017|work=L'Avenir}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pagalparrot.com/famous-lesbians-couples-whose-relationships-we-applaud.html|title=Famous Lesbian Couples Whose Relationships We Applaud|date=2017-02-09|work=PagalParrot|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sciamma is a feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatim|first1=Houssam|title=Céline Sciamma, ou le cinéma au centre de la lutte féministe|url=https://telquel.ma/2018/03/21/rencontre-celine-sciamma-le-cinema-danimation-au-centre-de-la-lutte-feministe_1584548|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in the women’s protest against inequality at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]] alongside many notable women in film including [[Agnes Varda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nayeri|first1=Farah|title=Women Rally on Cannes Red Carpet to Highlight Gender Inequality|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/12/movies/cannes-women-protest.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Sciamma frequently collaborates with [[Para One]] who has scored all her films and who has directed scripts written by Sciamma in the past.

She frequently collaborates with cinematographer [[Crystel Fournier]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barbier|first1=Brigitte|title=La directrice de la photographie Crystel Fournier, AFC, parle de son travail sur "Bande de filles", de Céline Sciamma|url=https://www.afcinema.com/La-directrice-de-la-photographie-Crystel-Fournier-AFC-parle-de-son-travail-sur-Bande-de-filles-de-Celine-Sciamma.html?lang=fr|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is noted for casting non-professional actors in her films.

Sciamma has said that fashion and style form an important part of characterization which is why though uncredited, she works as the costume designer for all her films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Mariah|title=‘GIRLHOOD’ DIRECTOR CELINE SCIAMMA TALKS PARIS, FRIENDSHIP, AND COLORFUL STORYTELLING|url=https://tribecafilm.com/stories/girlhood-director-celine-sciamma-talks-paris-frien|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10519">The '''Danubian Limes''' ({{lang-de|Donaulimes}}), or '''Danube Limes''', refers to the Roman military frontier or ''[[Limes]]'' which lies along the [[River Danube]] in the present-day German state of [[Bavaria]], in [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]].

The Danube was not always or everywhere used by the Romans as the military frontier which was moved north or south in some locations according to military conquests, but it was maintained in many places as a fairly permanent defensive structure for long periods. 

Unlike the [[Neckar-Odenwald Limes]] in [[Germany]] the border [[rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] were reinforced with numerous [[watchtower]]s, [[Roman camp|legion camps]] (''castra'') and [[Roman fort|forts]] (''castella''), due to the boggy and [[wikt:dendritic|dendritic]] nature of the river banks. The camps were built in the mid-1st century. Later, under [[Trajan]], the camps, which had originally only been surrounded by earthen embankments, were also enclosed by stone walls.

A [[Roman road]], the Danube Way ({{lang-la|Via Istrum}}) was laid along the ''Limes'', which linked the stations, camps and forts as far as the [[Danube delta]].&lt;ref&gt;The widespread name for the lower courses of the Danube river in Roman times was the Ister.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subdivisions ==
Because of the sheer length of this border, the Danubian Limes is often divided into the following subdivisions:
* [[Rhaetian Limes]], only those elements along the Danube being counted as part of the Danubian Limes.
* Noric Limes
* [[Pannonian Limes]] (in Upper and Lower Pannonia)
* [[Limes Moesiae|Moesian Limes]]

== Germany and Austria ==
[[File:Westl. u-turm tulln.JPG|thumb|The Salz Tower (''Salzturm'') in Tulln, Lower Austria, the former western horseshoe tower (''Hufeisenturm'') at Comagena]]
The oldest Roman camp in Austria was [[Petronell-Carnuntum|Carnuntum]]. Fourteen kilometres away to the west an auxiliary fort (''Hilfskastelle'') was built near  [[Schlögen]] (today in the municipality of [[Haibach ob der Donau]]) in [[Upper Austria]]. At that time, the ''limes'' ran from [[Vienna]] to [[Linz]] roughly following the present-day [[Wiener Straße (Österreich)|Wiener Straße]] (''B&amp;nbsp;1'').

Because the Danube did not always provide adequate protection, bridgeheads were built on its northern banks against the [[Marcomanni]], such as the one in [[Stillfried]] or at the [[Oberleiser Berg]]. However, these were cleared again under [[Marcus Aurelius]]' son, [[Commodus]], and a seven-kilometre-wide 'death strip' was laid along the Danube.

The increasing number of fortifications that were falling into decay were renovated again under Emperor [[Valentinian I]] (364–375) and upgraded to the conform to the latest military tactics. Walls were thickened, and [[defensive ditch]]es renewed. In addition, towers were built along the walls, such as a watchtower discovered near [[Oberranna]] in 1960. These fortifications lasted only another hundred years before the fall of the Roman Empire. In 488 the land of present-day Austria was cleared. The Roman fortifications along the lower courses of the Danube were overhauled once again, especially under [[Anastasios I]] and [[Justinian I]] They finally served during [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns]] his successor, [[Phocas]], as a basis for larger military operations and some were maintained in the province of [[Moesia Secunda]] until the invasion of the [[Bulgars]] in 679.

A few defensive towers survive: in [[Bacharnsdorf]] in Lower Austria, in [[Mautern an der Donau|Mautern]] (Favianis) and in [[Traismauer]] (Augustiana). In [[Tulln an der Donau|Tulln]] and [[Zeiselmauer-Wolfpassing|Zeiselmauer]], too, there are surviving remnants. In the [[Kürnberg Forest]] near Linz there are remains of a watchtower from the Roman period.

On the Lower Danube, between the present-day Bulgaria and Romania, the Lower Danubian Road was built under Emperor [[Tiberius]] in the 1st century AD on the Bulgarian side of the river.

[[Roman camp]]s, smaller garrisons and watchtowers were built on both sides of the Danube. Civilian settlements, predominantly for veterans and former [[Roman legion|legionaries]] were also built. The following Roman garrisons were the first to be established during the 1st century on the Lower Danube:
* Augustae (near the village of [[Hurlets]])
* Valeriana (near the village of [[Dolni Vadin]])
* Variana (near the village of [[Leskowez]])
* Almus (near the town of [[Lom (town)|Lom]])
* Regianum (near the town of [[Kozloduy]])

The '''dithyramb''' ({{lang-grc|διθύραμβος}}, ''dithyrambos'') was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[hymn]] sung and danced in honor of [[Dionysus]], the god of [[wine]] and [[fertility]]; the term was also used as an [[epithet]] of the god:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2326816 Dithurambos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus. ''Dithyrambos'' seems to have arisen out of the hymn: just as ''paean'' was both a hymn to and a title of [[Apollo]], ''Dithyrambos'' was an [[epithet]] of Dionysos as well as a song in his honour; see Harrison (1922, 436).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]], in ''[[Laws (dialogue)|The Laws]]'', while discussing various kinds of music mentions "the birth of Dionysos, called, I think, the dithyramb."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'',  iii.700 B.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato also remarks in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' that dithyrambs are the clearest example of poetry in which the poet is the only speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|title=Republic|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D3%3Asection%3D394c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in [[Apology (Plato)|The Apology]] Socrates went to the dithyrambs with some of their own most elaborate passages, asking their meaning but got a response of, "Will you believe me?" which "showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|title=The Republic &amp;#124; Edited by Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler |url=http://www.feedbooks.com/book/678/apology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] contrasted the dithyramb's wild and [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstatic]] character with the [[paean]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Ei at Delphi''. Plutarch himself was a priest of Dionysos at Delphi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], the dithyramb was the origin of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449a10–15): "Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the [[Fertility rite|phallic processions]] which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature"; see Janko (1987, 6).&lt;/ref&gt; A wildly enthusiastic speech or piece of writing is still occasionally described as ''dithyrambic''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dithyrambic Definition of dithyrambic]. [[TheFreeDictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dithyrambs were sung by choirs at [[Delos]], but the literary fragments that have survived are largely [[Classical Athens|Athenian]]. In Athens, dithyrambs were sung by a [[Greek chorus]] of up to fifty men or boys dancing in circular formation, who may or may not have been dressed as [[Satyr]]s, probably accompanied by the ''[[aulos]]''. They would normally relate some incident in the life of [[Dionysus]] or just celebrate wine and fertility.

The ancient Greeks laid out the criteria of the dithyramb as follows:
* special rhythm
* ''[[aulos]]'' accompaniment in [[Phrygian mode]] &lt;ref&gt;Harvey (1955). [[Aristotle]] records the failed attempt to set it in [[Dorian mode]], in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (8.7).&lt;/ref&gt;
* enriching text
* considerable narrative content
* originally [[Antistrophe|antistrophic character]]

Competitions between groups singing and dancing dithyrambs were an important part of the festivals of Dionysis, such as the [[Dionysia]] and [[Lenaia]]. Each tribe would enter two choirs, one of men and one of boys, each under the leadership of a ''[[coryphaeus]]''. The names of the winning teams of dithyrambic contests in Athens were recorded. The successful ''[[choregos]]'' would receive a statue that would be erected—at his expense—as a public monument to commemorate the victory. However, most of the poets remain unknown.

The earliest mention of dithyramb, found by [[Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge|Sir Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;Pickard-Cambridge, Sir Arthur Wallace. 1927. ''Dithyramb, Tragedy and Comedy''. Second edition revised by T.B.L. Webster, 1962. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-814227-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in a fragment of [[Archilochus]], who flourished in the first half of the seventh century BCE: "I know how to lead the fair song of the Lord Dionysus, the dithyramb, when my wits are fused with wine." As a literary composition for chorus, their inspiration is unknown, although it was likely Greek, as [[Herodotus]] explicitly speaks of [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] as "the first of men we know to have composed the dithyramb and named it and produced it in [[Corinth]]".&lt;ref&gt;Pickard-Cambridge, Sir Arthur Wallace. 1927. ''Dithyramb Tragedy and Comedy''. Second edition revised by T.B.L. Webster, 1962. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-814227-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''dithyramb'' has no known origin, but is frequently assumed to not be derived from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] eymology (''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 333–4).&lt;/ref&gt; An old hypothesis is that the word is borrowed from [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] or [[Pelasgian language|Pelasgian]], and literally means "Vierschritt", i.&amp;nbsp;e., "four-step", compare ''[[Iamb (poetry)|iamb]]'' and ''[[thriambus]]'', but H. S. Versnel rejects this etymology and suggests instead a derivation from a cultic exclamation.&lt;ref name="Versnel1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Versnel|first=H. S.|title=Triumphus: An Inquiry Into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPjBSq2jCrcC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=2 January 2015|year=1970|publisher=Brill Publishers|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=90-04-02325-9|pages=16–38|chapter=I. 2 Θρίαμβος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dithyrambs were composed by the poets [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] and [[Bacchylides]], as well as [[Pindar]] (the only one whose works have survived in anything like their original form).

Later examples were dedicated to other gods, but the dithyramb subsequently was developed (traditionally by [[Arion]]) into a literary form.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, (1998, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] developed from the dithyramb; the two forms developed alongside one another for some time. The clearest sense of dithyramb as proto-tragedy comes from a surviving dithyramb by Bacchylides, though it was composed after tragedy had already developed fully.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/ClasDram/chapters/042reading1dithyramb.htm USU.edu] and [http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/kvhrtgn/CLT%20Readings/A%20DITHYRAMB.htm UFL.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727023728/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/kvhrtgn/CLT%20Readings/A%20DITHYRAMB.htm |date=2006-07-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacchylides' dithyramb is a dialogue between a solitary singer and a choir. It is suggestive of what tragedy may have resembled before [[Aeschylus]] added a second actor instead of the choir.

In the later 5th century BCE, the dithyramb "became a favorite vehicle for the musical experiments of the poets of the 'new music'."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, "Dithyramb," in N.G. Wilson (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece'', Routledge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This movement included the poets [[Timotheus of Miletus]], [[Cinesias (poet)|Cinesias]], [[Melanippides]], and [[Philoxenus of Cythera]]. By the 4th century BCE the [[genre]] was in decline, although the dithyrambic competitions did not come to an end until well after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] takeover of Greece.

==Modern dithyrambs==
Dithyrambs are rare in [[English language]] literature. In [[German literature]] they appear more frequently, and from the 19th century several compositions were inspired by them.

===Literature===
[[John Dryden]]'s ''[[Alexander's Feast (Dryden)|Alexander's Feast]]'' (1697) is a notable example of an English language dithyramb.

[[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote a ''Dithyrambe'' in 1796. [[Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]] composed a set of ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs|Dionysos-Dithyramben]]'' in 1888/89.&lt;ref&gt;See the comprehensive commentary in [[Andreas Urs Sommer]], Kommentar zu Nietzsches Der Antichrist. Ecce homo. Dionysos-Dithyramben. Nietzsche contra Wagner (= Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften (Hg.): Historischer und kritischer Kommentar zu Friedrich Nietzsches Werken, vol. 6/2), Berlin / Boston: Walter de Gruyter 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and dance===
From the 19th century dithyrambs appear frequently in [[classical music]], as well in vocal as instrumental compositions.

[[Franz Schubert]] wrote a song for bass voice based on Schiller's ''Dithyrambe'' ({{D.}} 801, published as Op. 60 No. 2 in 1826). Schubert's earlier attempt at setting the same poem for a more extended vocal ensemble had remained unfinished ({{D.|number=47}}, 1813). [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]] (in ''Schillers lyrische Gedichte'' volume 2, published around 1809) and [[Wilhelm Taubert]] (Op. 144 No. 2, 1864) were other composers setting Schiller's poem. Other composers basing vocal music on dithyrambs include [[Giuseppe Verdi]] ("[[Brindisi (Song Verdi)|Brindisi]]", No. 6 of his 1845 ''[[Album di Sei Romanze (Verdi)|Album di Sei Romanze]]''), and [[Max Bruch]] (Op. 39, {{circa}} 1871). [[Othmar Schoeck]]'s 1911 [[List of compositions by Othmar Schoeck#Lieder|''Dithyrambe'', Op.&amp;nbsp;22]] is based on an unnamed verse by [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Werk- und Nachlassverzeichnis Othmar Schoeck (1886 – 1957)''. Zentralbibliothek Zürich. p. 29. See also [http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=6588 Dithyrambe 'Alles geben die Götter, die unendlichen'] at The LiederNet Archive, and: Marcel Reich-Ranicki. [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/frankfurter-anthologie/marcel-reich-ranicki-in-der-frankfurter-anthologie-alles-geben-die-goetter-von-johann-wolfgang-von-goethe-12603935.html "„Alles geben die Götter“ von Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"] in ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', 4 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instrumental dithyrambs were composed by [[Robert Volkmann]] and [[Hermann Ritter]]. [[Nikolai Medtner]] composed several dithyrambs, including a set of three for solo piano as his Opus 10. Additionally, the final movement of his first violin sonata carries the title, and the last of his ''Vergessene Weisen'' Op. 40 is a ''Danza ditirambica''.

The last movement of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''Duo Concertant'' for violin and piano is entitled ''Dithyrambe''. [[Richard Edward Wilson]]'s 1983 ''Dithyramb'' is for oboe and clarinet. [[Wolfgang Rihm]] composed a 30-minute work, ''Concerto'', in 2000, with the subtitle ''Dithyrambe'' and a scoring for string quartet and orchestra. 

In 1961 the American choreographer [[James Waring]] created a dance piece entitled ''Dithyramb'' with music and objects by the Fluxus artist [[George Brecht]].

The '''Emamzadeh Ebrahim''' ({{lang-fa|امامزاده ابراهیم}}) is a historical structure in [[Kashan]], [[Iran]]. The Emamzadeh belongs to the [[Qajar]] era. It is well known for its [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]] [[dome]], [[tile]]d [[minaret]]s, pleasant yard and beautiful [[iwan]]. [[Painting]]s, tiles and decorations with cut mirrors have been added later in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 188"&gt;'{{cite book|first=Hosseyn |last=Yaghoubi|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān |trans-title=Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|editor-first=Beheshti |editor-last=Arash|page=188|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current changed structure of the Emamzadeh is a work of architects in the recent century. On the [[inscription]] of the door, it has been mentioned about the decorating with cut mirrors by the order of then governor of Kashan. On the other inscription, it has been written about the ancestry of the [[Imamzadeh]], who has been buried there and he was apparently a descendent of [[Musa al-Kadhim]]. In the [[inscription]], it is written also the name of the structure's founder, Khaleh Beygom. Khaleh Beygom's grave is also in the building and there are a few [[poem]]s on her [[gravestone]].&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 188"/&gt;

'''''First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers''''' is a 2000 non-fiction book written by [[Loung Ung]], a [[Cambodia]]n author and childhood survivor of [[Democratic Kampuchea]]. It is her personal account of her experiences during the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|communist years]].

Until the age of five, Loung Ung lived in Phnom Penh, one of seven children of a high-ranking government official. She was a precocious child who loved the open city markets, fried crickets, chicken fights and sassing her parents. While her beautiful mother worried that Loung was a troublemaker—that she stomped around like a thirsty cow—her beloved father knew Loung was a clever girl.

When [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Khmer Rouge]] army [[Cambodian Civil War#Fall of Phnom Penh|stormed into Phnom Penh]] in April 1975, Ung's family fled their home and moved from village to village to hide their identity, their education, their former life of privilege. Eventually, the family dispersed in order to survive. Because Loung was resilient and determined, she trained as a child soldier in a work camp for orphans whilst other siblings were sent to labour camps. As the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War#Invasion of Kampuchea|Vietnamese penetrated Cambodia]], destroyed the Khmer Rouge, the surviving siblings were slowly reunited. Bolstered by the shocking bravery of one brother, the vision of the others and sustained by her sister's gentle kindness amid brutality, Loung forged herself a new life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First They Killed My Father (Ung)|url=http://www.litlovers.com/reading-guides/14-non-fiction/331-first-they-killed-my-father-ung|website=LitLovers|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was criticized by Bunkong Tuon for being inaccurate and, therefore, not being useful for historical research by Sody Lay, an American Cambodian reviewer. Reflecting on this negative review, Bunkong Tuon considers Sody Lay's review right and, at the same time, defends the memoirs as an emotional truth instead of a historical truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tuon |first1=B. |title=Inaccuracy and Testimonial Literature: The Case of Loung Ung's First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers |journal=MELUS: Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States |date=5 June 2013 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=107–125 |doi=10.1093/melus/mlt032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
{{main|First They Killed My Father (film)}}
The book has been adapted into [[First They Killed My Father (film)|a movie]] that was produced and directed by [[Angelina Jolie]]. The film premiered on February 18, 2017 in Siem Reap, Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Angelina Jolie Pitt to Direct Netflix Original Film 'First They Killed My Father'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/07/24/angelina-jolie-pitt-to-direct-netflix-original-film-first-they-killed-my-father/|journal=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The heart of it is Loung's story", Jolie states on the film. "It's the story of a war through the eyes of a child, but it is also the story of a country". To construct an accurate portrait of the genocide and war, Jolie used only Cambodian actors who speak their native language, Khmer. She gathered hundreds of survivors and their children to re-create their stories. The movie was filmed in Cambodia.

'''Fraktur''' is a highly artistic and elaborate illuminated folk art created by the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], named after the [[Fraktur]] script associated with it. Most Fraktur were created between 1740 and 1860.

Fraktur drawings were executed in ink and/or watercolors and are found in a wide variety of forms: the ''Vorschriften'' (writing samples), the ''Taufscheine'' (birth and baptismal certificates), marriage and house blessings, book plates, and floral and figurative scenes. The earlier Fraktur were executed entirely by hand, while printed text became increasingly common in later examples. Common artistic motifs in Fraktur include birds ([[distelfink]]s), hearts, and tulips, as well as [[blackletter]] ([[Fraktur]]) and [[italic script|italic]] [[Western calligraphy|calligraphy]].

Today, many major American museums, including the [[American Folk Art Museum]], [[the Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] have Fraktur in their collection. Important Fraktur have been sold by major American auction houses and antique dealers for prices in excess of $100,000. The definitive text on Fraktur is widely considered to be ''The Fraktur-Writings or Illuminated Manuscripts of the Pennsylvania Germans'', written by Dr. Donald A. Shelley and published by the Pennsylvania German Society in 1961. In late 2004, the majority of Dr. Shelley's Fraktur collection was sold at public [[auction]] at Pook &amp; Pook, Inc. in Downingtown, Pennsylvania for $913,448.

'''George G. Sharp, Inc.''' is a marine design and [[naval architecture]] firm established in 1920 in [[New York City]] by George Gillies Sharp, former Chief Surveyor of the [[American Bureau of Shipping]]. The firm started with the design of excursion steamboats on the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and [[Hudson River|Hudson]] rivers, then moved into oceangoing passenger and cargo shipping. From 1934 Sharp designed a standardized series of merchant ships for the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]. During World War II Sharp designed the standardized [[Victory ship]], of which 534 were built, and 50 [[escort carrier]]s.&lt;ref name=sharp1&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.georgesharp.com/SHARP_Home.htm|publisher=George G.

By the 1930s Sharp was described together with [[Gibbs &amp; Cox]] as one of the leading naval architecture firms in the United States.&lt;ref name=lane1&gt;{{cite book|last=Lane|first=Frederick C.|title=Ships for Victory: A History of Shipbuilding under the U.S. Maritime Commission in World War II|origyear=1951|year=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-6752-5|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, he designed the passenger cargo vessel ''Cristobal'' for Panama Line Service to the Canal Zone.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Work of George G. Sharp, Naval Architect and George G. Sharp Architectural Associates.'' Architecture and Design Vol. XIII (1949). [http://seaa.tulane.edu/ Southeastern Architectural Archive], Special Collections Division, Tulane University Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharp prepared the working drawings for the ''Casablanca class escort carrier''s built by [[Henry J. Kaiser]]'s [[California Shipbuilding Corporation]] in 1942-43.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 612&lt;/ref&gt; and the working plans for the Victory Ship series in 1943, allowing individual shipbuilding yards to modify the plans according to local practices.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the company developed a 17,000-ton luxury liner, the ''SS Del Norte'', for service between New Orleans and the east coast of South America. The Del Norte was built by the [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]] Corporation at Pascagoula, Mississippi and each room featured ocean views through casement windows. The ships were characterized by a dummy funnel in which officer's quarters, radio room and emergency generator were housed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssmaritime.com/Del-Trio.htm |title=Delta Steamship Lines, Inc—The Del-Triplets—SS ''Del Norte'', ''Del Sud'' &amp; ''Del Mar'' |author=Goossens, Reuben |date=2012 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Del Norte'', first of the three, was described as 'today's ship of tomorrow,' it was the first cargo-passenger ship equipped with commercial radar.&lt;ref&gt;"Liner Del Norte Is Due Thursday."

In addition to design services, Sharp provides consultation on modification, maintenance, safety, systems integration and program management, with about 600 employees.&lt;ref name=sharp3&gt;{{cite web|title=Seaport Enhanced|url=http://seaport.georgesharp.com/team.htm|publisher=George G.

"'''Go God Go'''" is the twelfth episode in the [[South Park (season 10)|tenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 151st episode of the series overall, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 1, 2006. The episode is the first in a two-part story arc, which concludes with "[[Go God Go XII]]". 

In "Go God Go", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is unable to wait the three weeks until the [[Wii]] video game console is released, and attempts to [[Cryonics|freeze himself]] to get closer to the release date, but accidentally ends up much later in the future, in the [[Atheism|atheistic]] world of 2546. Meanwhile, Ms. Garrison is forced to teach evolution to her students.

The episode was written and directed by ''South Park'' co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. The episode is a satire on [[atheism]] and mocks evolutionist [[Richard Dawkins]], as well some arguments against religion.

==Plot==
[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is unable to wait three weeks until the [[Wii|Nintendo Wii]] console is released. In an attempt to enter [[Cryonics|cryonic suspension]], he buries himself in the snow at the top of [[Mount Elbert]], with help from [[Butters Stotch|Butters]].

Concurrently, [[Mr. Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] resists being forced to teach the school's [[evolution]] curriculum. In response, the school hires evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] to present the evolution lesson. After some initial friction between the creationist Garrison and atheist Dawkins, a romantic interest soon develops. During their date, Dawkins refers to religion as an [[argument from ignorance]], and Garrison announces that she is now an atheist. The two later have [[sexual intercourse|sex]], and Garrison pushes Dawkins to the realization it is his duty to rid the world of religion and bring about peace with its abolition. Garrison begins to admonish students who express a belief in god, mocking that they likely believe in the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].

By this time, Cartman enters suspended animation, and a freak avalanche has buried his body. Cartman ultimately remains frozen for over five centuries, until being discovered and thawed out by members of the Unified Atheist League (UAL). In the year 2546, the entire world is atheistic and dedicated to rationality and science. Atheism is divided into several [[Religious denomination|denominations]]. These factions are at war with each other over who has the right answer to "the great question".

Cartman is informed of the possible presence of a Nintendo Wii at the Museum of Technology in New New Hampshire. However, they mention that before they are willing to take him there, they require some information alluding to a person they believe he knew in his time: the founder of the UAL who helped initiate a great event that made the entire world atheist. Suddenly, the UAL comes under attack from a rival group, the United Atheist Alliance (UAA), and Cartman is taken captive aboard a UAA ship.

The UAA commander contacts yet another faction, the Allied Atheist Allegiance (AAA), who are made up solely of highly evolved [[sea otter]]s. The Commander of the UAA boasts to the otters about their possession of Cartman, and of how because of this, they are now the atheists in control. This provokes a threatening response from the AAA.

==Production==
Series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] described the production of "Go God Go" and "Go God Go XII" as "painful", mainly because of how it deals with atheism. They spoke about how difficult it is to make such a subject humorous without seeming "preachy". For a time, the episode actually did end up feeling "preachy" because too many ideas and statements were present. To rectify this, large portions of the episodes that more reflected Parker and Stone's personal opinions were removed and replaced with less serious material.&lt;ref name="Commentary"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]; [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|date=2006|title=South Park season ten DVD commentary for the episode "Go God Go"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Commentary 2"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]; [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|date=2006|title=South Park season ten DVD commentary for the episode "[[Go God Go XII]]"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to do an episode with the theme of atheism was finalized when [[Penn Jillette]] emailed Parker and Stone expressing his disappointment in finding out that they are not atheists themselves. Parker and Stone's religion was questioned in an interview, which prompted Jillette's email. It was assumed that they were atheists, so in the interview they clarified that they were not strictly atheists. While this was happening, Parker was anticipating the release of the [[Nintendo Wii]], so it was decided that this scenario would also be a theme in the episode.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commentary 2"/&gt;

At the end of "Go God Go", Cartman is sent to the future; Parker and Stone loved the idea, in-part because it presented the opportunity for easy-to-write material. However, they had essentially forced themselves to create another episode, which they partially disliked because it meant they'd have to write more material that concerns atheism when they felt they had done enough.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commentary 2"/&gt;

Several aspects of both "Go God Go" and "Go God Go XII" pay homage to ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'', a science fiction adventure television series produced by [[Universal Studios]]. [[Richard Dawkins]] and his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' is also parodied. Parker and Stone were very pleased with the work of the animation staff in regards to the designs of the scenes in the future, particularly praising them for accomplishing so much in the short amount of time that a ''South Park'' episode is produced.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commentary 2"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Dan Iverson of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the episode a positive review, with a score of 9.0 out of 10, writing: "Between the shocking Mrs. Garrison story and the hilarious Wii promotion by Cartman, we totally recommend watching this episode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Inverson |url=http://ign.com/articles/2006/11/02/south-park-go-god-go-part-2-review |title=South Park: "Go, God. Go! Part 2" Review |publisher=IGN |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nintendo's response===
The week of November 5, 2006, a poll on Nintendo.com asked "How bad do you want a Wii?". The responses were "Bad", "Way Bad", and "Worse than Cartman", with the third choice receiving 80% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990508065357/http://www.nintendo.com/home/ ''Nintendo.com Home Page 2006-11-07'']&lt;/ref&gt; At Nintendo's 2007 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] press conference, a clip of the episode where Cartman tells his mother he must have a Wii was included in a montage of clips about the demand for the Wii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-07-wii-mario-kart-pulls-drive-by-on-nintendo-gathering/1100-6174021/ |title=E3 '07: Wii Mario Kart pulls drive-by on Nintendo gathering |publisher=GameSpot |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo also sent the ''South Park'' staff several free Wii consoles after the episode first aired.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;

===Richard Dawkins' response===
[[File:Dawkinssouthpark.jpg|thumb|Richard Dawkins was critical of his depiction in the two-parter.]]
[[Richard Dawkins]] reacted to the two-part episode by saying, "I'm buggered if I like being portrayed as a cartoon character buggering a bald transvestite. I wouldn't have minded so much if only it had been in the service of some serious point, but if there was a serious point in there I couldn't discern it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-diary/scientist-parks-trannie-sex-jibe-20100303-pj4j.html |title=Scientist parks trannie sex jibe |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2010-03-04 |accessdate=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Q&amp;A session at the Free Library of Philadelphia, Dawkins said: "I would have thought they could at least have got an actor that could do a proper [[British English|British accent]]. Now, if only I could be offered a [[cameo appearance|cameo role]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', I could show that actor how to do a real British accent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/tourJournal |title=RichardDawkins.net - The Official Richard Dawkins Website |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117145408/http://richarddawkins.net/tourJournal#11 |archivedate=2006-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins later made a cameo in ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[Black-Eyed, Please]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvequals.com/2013/03/10/the-simpsons-season-24-review-black-eyed-please/ |title=The Simpsons Season 24 Review "Black-eyed Please" |publisher=TV Equals |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the episode in a 2012 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Dawkins, who said it was the only episode of ''South Park'' he had seen, thought the fighting among the different atheist sects had "a certain amount of truth in it" and harbored a greater potential for satire. It reminded him of the Judean People's Front and the People's Front of Judea from the film ''[[Monty Python’s Life of Brian]]'', but felt that too much of the episode was devoted to ridiculing him by depicting him having sex with Ms. Garrison. He commented, "That isn't satire because it has nothing to do with what I stand for. And the [[scatological]] part, where they had somebody throwing shit, which stuck to my forehead—that’s not even funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chip Rowe |url=http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/playboy-interview-richard-dawkins |title=Interview: Richard Dawkins |publisher=Playboy |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]] is a religion which incorporates diverse views on the concept of God. Different traditions of Hinduism have different theistic views, and these views have been described by scholars as [[polytheism]], [[monotheism]], [[henotheism]], [[panentheism]], [[pantheism]], [[monism]], [[agnostic]], [[humanism]], [[Atheism in Hinduism|atheism]] or [[Nontheism|non-theism]].&lt;ref&gt;[a] [[Julius J. Lipner]], Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, page 8; Quote: "(...) one need not be religious in the minimal sense described to be accepted as a Hindu by Hindus, or describe oneself perfectly validly as Hindu.

Monotheism is the belief in a single creator God who is almighty, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Trigger (2003), Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521822459}}, pages 473-474&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taliaferro and Elsa J. Marty (2010), A Dictionary of Philosophy of Religion, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1441111975}}, pages 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism does not posit or require such a belief, and is considered a non-monotheistic religion by scholars of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Ackroyd|title=Divinity in Things: Religion Without Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bv8o5lGxtgAC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2009|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-333-1 |pages=78 }}, Quote: "The jealous God who says, "Thou shalt have no other gods but me" belongs to the Jewish-Christian-Muslim tradition, but not to the Hindu tradition, which tolerates all gods but is not a monotheism, monism, yes, but not monotheism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Whaling|title=Understanding Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WudXAAAAYAAJ |year=2010|publisher=Dunedin Academic Press |isbn=978-1-903765-36-4 |pages=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hiroshi Ōbayashi|title=Death and afterlife: perspectives of world religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ub8oAAAAYAAJ |year=1992|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-94104-8 |pages=145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many traditions within Hinduism share the Vedic idea of a metaphysical ultimate reality and truth called [[Brahman]] instead. According to [[Jan Gonda]], Brahman denoted the  "power immanent in the sound, words, verses and formulas of Vedas" in the earliest Vedic texts. The early Vedic religious understanding of Brahman underwent a series of abstractions in the Hindu scriptures that followed the Vedic scriptures. These scriptures would reveal a vast body of insights into the nature of Brahman as originally revealed in the Vedas. These Hindu traditions that emerged from or identified with the Vedic scriptures and that maintained the notion of a metaphysical ultimate reality would identify that ultimate reality as Brahman. Hindu adherents to these traditions within Hinduism revere Hindu deities and, indeed, all of existence, as aspects of the Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, ''Brahman'', The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, pages 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; The deities in Hinduism are not considered to be almighty, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent, and spirituality is considered to be seeking the ultimate truth that is possible by a number of paths.&lt;ref name=johnmurdoch141&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7cEF8JfPHQC |year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03163-0|page=63}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey P.

Deities were not thought to be omniscient or omnipotent and were rarely believed to be changeless or eternal."&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Indian religions, in Hinduism, deities are born, they live and they die in every [[kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]] (eon, cycle of existence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

In [[Hindu philosophy]], there are many different schools.&lt;ref name=bowker194&gt;{{cite book|author=John Bowker|title=Problems of Suffering in Religions of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7IcQL1JBvAC |year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09903-5 |pages=194, 206–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its non-theist traditions such as Samkhya, early Nyaya, Mimamsa and many within Vedanta such as Advaita do not posit the existence of an almighty, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God (monotheistic God), while its theistic traditions posit a personal God left to the choice of the Hindu. The major schools of Hindu philosophy explain morality and the nature of existence through the [[karma]] and [[samsara]] doctrines, as in other Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kaufman | first=Whitley R.

Contemporary Hinduism can be categorized into four major traditions: [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], and [[Smarta Tradition|Smartism]]. Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism worship [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], and [[Devi]] — the Divine Mother — as the Supreme respectively, or consider all Hindu deities as aspects of the formless Supreme Reality or [[Brahman]]. Other minor sects such as [[Ganapatya]] and [[Saura (Hinduism)|Saura]] focus on [[Ganesha]] and [[Surya]] as the Supreme. A sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century (where Vishnu as Krishna is a monotheistic God). This tradition posits a concept of monotheistic God so similar to Christianity that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pages 177-179&lt;/ref&gt; a theory that has been discredited by scholars.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19-21}}

==Vaishnavism==
{{main article|Bhakti movement|Bhakti|Bhakti Yoga|Svayam Bhagavan}}
{{further information|Vaishnavism}}
Krishnaism is a sub-tradition of Vaishnavism wherein Krishna is considered ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]'', meaning 'Lord Himself' and it is used exclusively to designate Krishna as the Supreme Lord.&lt;ref name=Gupta20071&gt;Gupra, 2007, p.36 note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = jsn&gt;''Bhagawan Swaminarayan bicentenary commemoration volume, 1781-1981.'' p. 154: ...Shri Vallabhacharya [and] Shri Swaminarayan... Both of them designate the highest reality as Krishna, who is both the highest avatara and also the source of other avataras. To quote R. Kaladhar Bhatt in this context. "In this transcendental devotieon (Nirguna Bhakti), the sole Deity and only" is Krishna.

Gaudiya Vaishnavas and followers of the [[Vallabha Sampradaya]] [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], use the [[Gopala Tapani Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=B. V. Tripurari |title=Gopala-tapani Upanisad |publisher=Audarya Press |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-932771-12-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bhagavata Purana, to support their view that Krishna is indeed the ''Svayam Bhagavan''. This belief was summarized by the 16th century author [[Jiva Goswami]] in some of his works, such as ''Krishna-sandarbha''.&lt;ref name=Gupta2007&gt;{{cite book| author = Gupta, Ravi M.| year = 2007| title = Caitanya Vaisnava Vedanta of Jiva Gosvami| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 0-415-40548-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta2004&gt;{{cite book| author = Gupta, Ravi M.| year = 2004| title = Caitanya Vaisnava Vedanta: Acintyabhedabheda in Jiva Gosvami's Catursutri tika| publisher = University Of Oxford| isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other sub-traditions of Vaishnavism, Krishna is one of many aspects and [[avatar]]s of Vishnu (Rama is another, for example), recognized and understood from an eclectic assortment of perspectives and viewpoints.&lt;ref name=Mahony1987&gt;{{cite journal| author = Mahony, W.K.| year = 1987| title = Perspectives on Krishna's Various Personalities| journal = History of Religions| volume = 26| issue = 3| pages = 333–335| url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1062381?uid=3739616&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103483476523|deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-02-10| doi = 10.1086/463085| jstor=1062381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Howell Opera House''' is an [[opera house]] located in [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]], [[Michigan]]. The site is listed as historic by The [[Michigan State Historic Preservation Office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/8971.htm] State of Michigan. State Historic Preservation Office. ''Opera House''. Michigan State Historic Preservation Office, 2010. Web. 9 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also listed on The [[National Historic Register]]&lt;ref name&gt;[http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov] United States. Dept. of the Interior. ''National Register of Historic Places''. US Dept. of the Interior, 2010. Web. 9 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the Howell Downtown Historic District.

==History==
The Howell Opera House is a Victorian-style building with a seating capacity of 1,000 people.&lt;ref name=operahouse&gt;[http://www.theoperahouse.us] “The Opera House: Past and Present.” ''The Opera House''. Livingston Arts Council, 2010. Web. 21 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Plans for the theater were drawn and executed by [[Detroit]] architect, Almon C. Varney at the cost of $10,000. Construction began in 1880 by Hunter and Holmes Contractors and doors were opened to patrons on December 30, 1881.&lt;ref name=HowellBicentennial&gt;Gray, D.J. “The Opera House.” ''The Howell Bicentennial History''. Michigan: Howell, 1975. 178-84. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The building is located at 123 W. Grand River.

As the central part of the town, the edifice served not only for artistic performances but as a venue for several local occasions such as high school commencement. The theater also served, for a short duration, as home to the Livingston County Circuit Court in 1889.&lt;ref name=operahouse/&gt;

The Howell Opera House was first owned by the Stair Brothers, E.D. and Orin, who assumed ownership in 1884. The theater was later purchased by Arthur Garland in 1893 &lt;ref name=HowellBicentennial/&gt; who utilized a portion of the space to produce custom-tailored suits.

In 1923, the building was closed by the fire marshal.&lt;ref name=operahouse/&gt; This brought an end to its intended use as quarters for entertainment. For more than 70 years, The Howell Opera House served as storage for a local hardware store.

==Renovation==
In 2000, The Livingston Arts Council purchased The Howell Opera House &lt;ref name=operahouse/&gt; with plans to restore the patronage to function, once again, as a theater.  Renovations began in 2001 with a slow start due to lack of funding.  In 2007, the first installment of the development plan had been completed.&lt;ref&gt;“Livingston Arts Council: Howell Opera House.” ''Christman''. The Christman Company, 2007. Web. 5 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renovations were made solely to the first floor. These renovations include refinished flooring and walls as well as new stairways.&lt;ref&gt;Behnan, Christopher. “Restoration, Popularity of Opera House Still Growing.” ''Daily Press and Argus''. Daily Press and Argus, 2 Sept. 2011. Web. 11 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans have also been made for restoration of the second floor which houses the stage and balcony.

The renovated first floor of the Opera House is now available to rent for special events such as weddings and parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howelloperahouse.com/rental-information/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hugo Awards''' are a set of [[literary award]]s given annually for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The awards are named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', and were officially named the Science Fiction Achievement Awards until 1992. Organized and overseen by the [[Worldcon#World Science Fiction Society|World Science Fiction Society]], the awards are given each year at the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] as the central focus of the event. They were first given in 1953, at the [[11th World Science Fiction Convention]], and have been awarded every year since 1955. Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently Hugo Awards are given in more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works of various types.

The Hugo Awards have been termed as "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing".&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Works that have won have been published in special collections, and the official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool. The 2018 Hugos were presented at the [[76th World Science Fiction Convention|76th Worldcon]], "Worldcon 76", in [[San Jose, California]], on August 19, 2018. The 2019 awards will be presented at the [[77th World Science Fiction Convention|77th Worldcon]], "Dublin 2019: An Irish Worldcon", in [[Dublin]] on August 19, 2019.

For lists of winners and nominees for each category, see the [[#Categories|list of award categories]] below.

The World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) gives out the Hugo Awards each year for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], who founded the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' and who is considered one of the "fathers" of the science fiction genre.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt; Works are eligible for an award if they were published in the prior calendar year, or translated into English in the prior calendar year. There are no written rules as to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy, and the decision of eligibility in that regard is left up to the voters, rather than to the organizing committee. Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the WSFS constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with five nominees per category, except in the case of a tie.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; The awards are split over more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works.&lt;ref name="thacat"/&gt;

For each category of Hugo, the voter may rank "No Award" as one of their choices. Voters are instructed that they should do so if they feel that none of the nominees are worthy of the award, or if they feel the category should be abolished entirely. A vote for "No Award" other than as one's first choice signifies that the voter believes the nominees ranked higher than "No Award" are worthy of a Hugo in that category, while those ranked lower are not.&lt;ref name="thavoting"/&gt;

The six works on the ballot for each category are the most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. With the exception of 1956, the first years of the awards did not include any recognition of runner-up novels, but since 1959 all of the candidates have been recorded.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.&lt;ref name="thaabout"/&gt; Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works in each category.&lt;ref name="2017change"/&gt; Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and take place in a different city around the world each year.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldcon"/&gt;

The idea of giving out awards at Worldcons was proposed by Harold Lynch for the 1953 convention.&lt;ref name="HugoPropose"/&gt; The idea was based on the [[Academy Awards]],&lt;ref name="Nicholls595"/&gt; with the name "Hugo" being given by Robert A. Madle. The award trophy was created by Jack McKnight and [[Benedict Jablonski|Ben Jason]] in 1953, based on the design of hood ornaments of 1950s cars. It consisted of a finned rocket ship on a wooden base. Each subsequent trophy, with the exception of the 1958 trophy, has been similar to the original design. The rocket trophy was formally redesigned in 1984, and since then only the base of the trophy has changed each year.&lt;ref name="HugoTrophy"/&gt; There is no monetary or other remuneration associated with the Hugo, other than the trophy.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;

===Retro Hugos===
Retrospective Hugo Awards, or Retro Hugos, were added to the ballot beginning in 1996. They are awards optionally given by a Worldcon for works that would have been eligible 50, 75, or 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;

Prior to 2017, these could be awarded for the ten years that had a Worldcon where no Hugos were awarded: the conventions in 1939–41, 1946–52, and 1954.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name='2015const'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/const-2015.pdf|date=August 23, 2015|publisher=The World Science Fiction Society|title=Constitution of the World Science Fiction Society, as of August 23, 2015|access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retro Hugos under these rules were given five times: in 1996, 2001, and 2004 for 50 years prior, and 2014 and 2016 for 75 years prior. The Worldcons eligible in 1997–2000, 2002, and 2015 chose not to award Retro Hugos, and under these rules there would have been no more opportunities to award them until 2022 (for 1947).&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo" /&gt; 

A 2017 rule change expanded the criteria to be any year after 1939 in which no Hugos were awarded, whether or not there was a Worldcon that year, or fifteen years in total: 1939–52 and 1954.&lt;ref name="2017minutes"/&gt; [[Worldcon 76]] and [[77th World Science Fiction Convention|Dublin 2019]] then jointly announced that Retro Hugos would be awarded in 2018 for 1943 and in 2019 for 1944.&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoNews2017" /&gt;

==History==

===1950s===
The first Hugo Awards were presented at the [[11th World Science Fiction Convention|11th Worldcon]] in Philadelphia in 1953, which awarded Hugos in seven categories.&lt;ref name="Hugo53"/&gt; The awards presented that year were initially conceived as a one-off event, though the organizers hoped that subsequent conventions would also present them.&lt;ref name="PhilconBook"/&gt; At the time, Worldcons were completely run by their respective committees as independent events and had no oversight between years. Thus there was no mandate for any future conventions to repeat the awards, and no set rules for how to do so.&lt;ref name="Hugo54"/&gt;

The 1954 Worldcon chose not to, but the awards were reinstated at the 1955 Worldcon, and thereafter became traditional. The award was called the Annual Science Fiction Achievement Award, with "Hugo Award" being an unofficial, but better known name.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt; The nickname was accepted as an official alternative name in 1958, and since the 1992 awards the nickname has been adopted as the official name of the award.&lt;ref name="Nicholls595"/&gt;&lt;ref name="91minutes"/&gt;

In 1959, though there were still no formal guidelines governing the awards, several rules were instated which thereafter became traditional. These included having a ballot for nominating works earlier in the year and separate from the voting ballot; defining eligibility to include works published in the prior calendar year, rather than the previous rule of the "preceding year"; and allowing voters to select "no award" as an option, which then won that year in two categories: [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Dramatic Presentation]] and [[Discontinued Hugo Awards|Best New Author]].&lt;ref name="Hugo59"/&gt; The eligibility change additionally sparked a separate rule, prohibiting the nomination of works which had been nominated for the 1958 awards, as the two time periods overlapped.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt;

===1960s===
In 1961, after the formation of the WSFS to oversee each Worldcon committee, formal rules were set down in the WSFS constitution mandating the presenting of the awards as one of the responsibilities of each Worldcon organizing committee. The rules restricted voting to members of the convention at which the awards would be given, while still allowing anyone to nominate works; nominations were restricted to members of the convention or the previous year's convention in 1963.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt; The guidelines also specified the categories that would be awarded, which could only be changed by the World Science Fiction Society board.&lt;ref name="63minutes"/&gt; These categories were for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]], [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story|Short Fiction]] (short stories, broadly defined), Dramatic Presentation, [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine|Professional Magazine]], [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist|Professional Artist]], and [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|Best Fanzine]] (fan magazine).&lt;ref name="Hugo61"/&gt; 1963 was also the second year in which "no award" won a category, again for Dramatic Presentation.&lt;ref name="Hugo63"/&gt;

In 1964 the guidelines were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as up to two categories for that year. These [[Discontinued Hugo Awards|additional awards]] were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but were not required to be repeated by future conventions.&lt;ref name="63const"/&gt; This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded for more than one year.&lt;ref name="thacat"/&gt;

In 1967 categories for [[Hugo Award for Best Novelette|Novelette]], [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer|Fan Writer]], and [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|Fan Artist]] were added, and a category for [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Best Novella]] was added the following year; these new categories had the effect of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously left up to voters.&lt;ref name="Hugo67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo68"/&gt; Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt;

===1970s===
While traditionally five works had been selected for nomination in each category out of the proposed nominees, in 1971 this was set down as a formal rule, barring ties.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt; In 1973, the WSFS removed the category for Best Professional Magazine, and a [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor|Best Professional Editor]] award was instated as its replacement, in order to recognize "the increasing importance of original anthologies".&lt;ref name="Hugo73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholls596"/&gt;

After that year the guidelines were changed again to remove the mandated awards and instead allow up to ten categories which would be chosen by each convention, though they were expected to be similar to those presented in the year before. Despite this change no new awards were added or previous awards removed before the guidelines were changed back to listing specific categories in 1977.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="74minutes"/&gt; 1971 and 1977 both saw "no award" win the Dramatic Presentation category for the third and fourth time; "no award" did not win any categories afterwards until 2015.&lt;ref name="Hugo71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo77"/&gt;

===1980s and 90s===
In 1980 the category for Best Non-Fiction Book (later renamed [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work|Best Related Work]]) was added, followed by a category for [[Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine|Best Semiprozine]] (semi-professional magazine) in 1984.&lt;ref name="Hugo80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo84"/&gt; In 1983, members of the [[Church of Scientology]] were encouraged by people such as [[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]] to nominate as a bloc ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'', written by the organization's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], for the Best Novel award; it did not make the final ballot.&lt;ref name="BEscandal"/&gt; Another campaign followed in 1987 to nominate Hubbard's ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Black Genesis]]''; it made the final ballot but finished behind "no award".&lt;ref name="BGscandal"/&gt; 1989 saw a work—''The Guardsman'' by Todd Hamilton and P. J. Beese—withdrawn by its authors from the final ballot after a fan bought numerous memberships under false names, all sent in on the same day, in order to get the work onto the ballot.&lt;ref name="OlderScandals"/&gt;

In 1990 the Best Original Art Work award was given as an extra Hugo Award, and was listed again in 1991, though not actually awarded, and established afterward as an official Hugo Award.&lt;ref name="91minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="90minutes"/&gt; It was then removed from this status in 1996, and has not been awarded since.&lt;ref name="96minutes"/&gt; The Retro Hugos were created in the mid-1990s, and were first awarded in 1996.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;

===Since 2000===
In 2003, the Dramatic Presentation award was split into two categories, Long Form and Short Form.&lt;ref name="Hugo03"/&gt; This was repeated with the Best Professional Editor category in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hugo07"/&gt; 2009 saw the addition of the [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|Best Graphic Story]] category, while the most recent change to the Hugo Awards was in 2012, when an award for [[Hugo Award for Best Fancast|Best Fancast]] was added.&lt;ref name="Hugo09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo12"/&gt;

In 2015, two groups of science fiction writers, the "[[Sad Puppies]]" led by [[Brad R. Torgersen]] and [[Larry Correia]], and the "Rabid Puppies" led by [[Vox Day]], each put forward a similar [[voting bloc|slate of suggested nominations]] which came to dominate the ballot.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate 8 April 2015"/&gt; The Sad Puppies campaign had run for two years prior on a smaller scale, with limited success. The leaders of the campaigns characterized them as a reaction to "niche, academic, overtly [leftist]" nominees and the Hugo becoming "an affirmative action award" that preferred female and non-white authors and characters.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 6 April 2015"/&gt; In response, five nominees declined their nomination before and, for the first time, two after the ballot was published.&lt;ref name="Hugo2015Stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstAfter"/&gt; Multiple-Hugo-winner [[Connie Willis]] declined to present the awards.&lt;ref name="WillisDecline"/&gt; The slates were characterized by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "right wing",&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015" /&gt; "orchestrated backlash"&lt;ref name="The Guardian 6 April 2015"/&gt; and by ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' as a "group of white guys",&lt;ref name="The A.V. Club 6 April 2015"/&gt; and were linked with the [[Gamergate controversy]].&lt;ref name="Slate 8 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston Globe 7 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Sydney Morning Herald 9 April 2015"/&gt; Multiple Hugo winner [[Samuel R. Delany]] characterized the campaigns as a response to "socio-economic" changes such as minority authors gaining prominence and thus "economic heft".&lt;ref name="DelanySP"/&gt; In all but the Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form category, "no award" placed above all nominees that were on either slate, and it won all five categories that only contained slate nominees.&lt;ref name="Hugo2015Stats"/&gt; The two campaigns were repeated in 2016 with some changes to the campaigns, and the "Rabid Puppy" slate again dominated the ballot in several categories, with all five nominees in Best Related Work, Best Graphic Story, Best Professional Artist, and Best Fancast.&lt;ref name="Puppy2016"/&gt;

In response to the campaigns, a set of new rules, called "E Pluribus Hugo", were passed in 2015 and ratified in 2016 to modify the nominations process. Intended to ensure that organized minority groups cannot dominate every finalist position in a category, the new rules define a [[voting system]] in which nominees are eliminated one by one, with each vote for an eliminated work then spread out over the uneliminated works they nominated, until only the final shortlist remains. These rules were ratified in 2016 to be used for the first time in 2017. A rule mandating that the final nominees must appear on at least five percent of ballots was also eliminated, to ensure that all categories could reach a full set of nominees even when the initial pool of works was very large.&lt;ref name="2016RuleChange"/&gt; Each nominator is limited to five works in each category, but the final ballot was changed to six in each; additionally, no more than two works by a given author or group, or in the same dramatic series, can be in one category on the final ballot.&lt;ref name="2017change"/&gt;

In 2018 the newest permanent category, [[Hugo Award for Best Series|Best Series]], was begun; it was run the year prior as a special Hugo Award prior to being ratified at the business meeting.&lt;ref name="Hugo18"/&gt;

The only discontinued awards which were instated in the WSFS constitution as permanent categories were the Best Professional Magazine and Best Original Art Work Hugo Awards. Worldcon committees may also give out special awards during the Hugo ceremony, which are not voted on. Unlike the additional Hugo categories which Worldcons may present, these awards are not officially Hugo Awards and do not use the same trophy, though they once did.&lt;ref name="thacat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Franson7"/&gt; An additional award, the [[John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer]], is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony and voted on by the same process, but is not formally a Hugo Award.&lt;ref name="thacamp"/&gt; Another such award, for Best Young Adult Book, was first awarded in 2018.&lt;ref name="Hugo18"/&gt;

==Recognition==
The Hugo Award is highly regarded by observers. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has termed it "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing",&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; a claim echoed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', who said that it was "the premier award in the science fiction genre".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; [[Justine Larbalestier]], in ''The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction'' (2002), referred to the awards as "the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards",&lt;ref name="BOTSSF"/&gt; and [[Jo Walton]], writing for ''[[Tor Books|Tor.com]]'', said it was "undoubtedly science fiction's premier award".&lt;ref name="TOR"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' similarly acknowledged it as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" as well as "one of the most venerable, democratic and international" science fiction awards "in existence".&lt;ref name="GuardianHugo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianHugo2"/&gt; [[James E. Gunn (writer)|James Gunn]], in ''The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (1988), echoed ''The Guardian''{{'}}s statement of the award's democratic nature, saying that "because of its broad electorate" the Hugos were the awards most representative of "reader popularity".&lt;ref name="TNESF"/&gt; Camille Bacon-Smith, in ''Science Fiction Culture'' (2000), said that at the time fewer than 1000 people voted on the final ballot; she held, however, that this is a representative sample of the readership at large, given the number of winning novels that remain in print for decades or become notable outside of the science fiction genre, such as ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' or ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]''.&lt;ref name="SFC"/&gt; The 2014 awards saw over 1900 nomination submissions and over 3500 voters on the final ballot, while the 1964 awards received 274 votes.&lt;ref name="2014noms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2014voters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1964voters"/&gt; The 2015 awards saw 2122 nominating ballots and 5950 votes.&lt;ref name="2015noms"&gt;{{cite web |last=Standlee |first=Kevin |title=2015 Hugo Award Finalists Announced |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/2015/04/2015-hugo-award-finalists-announced/ |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |date=2015-04-04 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2015votes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Searle-Kovacevic |first=Marah |title=Sasquan Announces Record Participation in the 2015 Hugo Awards Voting |url=http://sasquan.org/2015/08/sasquan-announces-record-participation-in-the-2015-hugo-awards-voting/ |publisher=Worldcon 2015 |date=2015-08-04 |accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 awards saw 4032 nominating ballots and 3130 votes.&lt;ref name="2016noms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2016votes"/&gt;

[[Brian Aldiss]], in his book ''Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction'', claimed that the Hugo Award was a barometer of reader popularity, rather than artistic merit; he contrasted it with the panel-selected [[Nebula Award]], which provided "more literary judgment", though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped.&lt;ref name="TYS"/&gt; Along with the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction, with Laura Miller of [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] terming it "science fiction's most prestigious award".&lt;ref name="SALONnebula"/&gt;

The official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool.&lt;ref name="HugoLogo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScalziLogo"/&gt; [[Gahan Wilson]], in ''First World Fantasy Awards'' (1977), claimed that noting that a book had won the Hugo Award on the cover "demonstrably" increased sales for that novel,&lt;ref name="FWFA"/&gt; though [[Orson Scott Card]] said in his 1990 book ''How to Write Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy'' that the award had a larger effect on foreign sales than in the United States.&lt;ref name="HWSFF"/&gt; [[Spider Robinson]], in 1992, claimed that publishers were very interested in authors that won a Hugo Award, more so than for other awards such as the Nebula Award.&lt;ref name="SFC"/&gt; Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his 1996 ''Mastering the Business of Writing'' that having the term Hugo Award on the cover, even as a nominee, was a "powerful inducement" to science fiction fans to buy a novel,&lt;ref name="MBW"/&gt; while Jo Walton claimed in 2011 that the Hugo is the only science fiction award "that actually affects sales of a book".&lt;ref name="TOR"/&gt;

There have been several anthologies of Hugo-winning short fiction. The series ''[[The Hugo Winners]]'', edited by [[Isaac Asimov]], was started in 1962 as a collection of short story winners up to the previous year, and concluded with the 1982 Hugos in Volume 5. ''[[The New Hugo Winners]]'', edited originally by Asimov, later by [[Connie Willis]] and finally by [[Gregory Benford]], has four volumes collecting stories from the 1983 to the 1994 Hugos.&lt;ref name="AWCGSF"/&gt; The most recent anthology is ''The Hugo Award Showcase'' (2010), edited by [[Mary Robinette Kowal]]. It contains most of the short stories, novelettes, and novellas that were nominated for the 2009 award.&lt;ref name="THAS"/&gt;

An '''immram''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|m|r|əm}}; plural '''immrama'''; {{lang-ga|iomramh}}, {{IPA-ga|ˈʊmˠɾˠəw|pron}}, ''voyage'') is a class of [[Old Irish]] tales concerning a hero's sea journey to the [[Otherworld]] (see [[Tír na nÓg]] and [[Mag Mell]]). Written in the [[History of Ireland|Christian era]] and essentially Christian in aspect, they preserve elements of [[Irish mythology]].

The immrama are identifiable by their focus on the exploits of the heroes during their search for the Otherworld, located in these cases in the islands far to the west of Ireland. The hero sets out on his voyage for the sake of adventure or to fulfill his destiny, and generally stops on other fantastic islands before reaching his destination. He may or may not be able to return home again.

==Definition==

The immrama are generally confused with a similar Irish genre, the ''[[echtrae]]'' or "adventure". Both types of story involve a hero's journey to an "otherworld", whether a Christian paradise, a fairyland, the land of the gods or a utopia. They are distinguished by date; echtrai are older, dating from the 7th century, while the earliest immram dates only to the 8th century.{{sfn|Thrall|1917}} [[David Dumville]] argues that the immrama include more Christian thinking than the more pagan genre of echtrae,{{sfn|Dumville|1976}} and that, whereas the purpose of the echtrai is to enhance understanding of the old gods and the land in which they live, in an immram these pagan elements occur as a challenge to the hero's faith. In an echtrae the protagonist only ever goes to one location and may arrive in the otherworld with no explanation of the journey, whereas in an immram the hero always has multiple adventures on several islands.{{sfn|Dumville|1976|}}

==Stories==
Originally there were seven officially recognised Immram listed in a list of ancient texts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Of those seven only three survive: ''[[The Voyage of Mael Dúin]]'', ''[[The Voyage of the Uí Chorra]]'', and ''[[The Voyage of Snedgus and Mac Riagla]]''. ''[[The Voyage of Bran]]'' is classified in these same lists as an echtrae, though it also contains the essential elements of the immrama.{{sfn|Wooding|2000b|loc=Introduction}} The later [[Latin]] ''[[Brendan|Voyage of St. Brendan]]'' also contains a voyage across the sea to various otherworldly islands.

==Origins==
Immrama were first recorded as early as the 7th century by monks and scholars who fled Continental Europe before the barbarian invaders of the fifth century. These monks carried the learning of Western Europe and became the vanguard of the Christianizing of Europe.{{sfn|Thrall|1917}} On this account it is expected that Immram have their origins in pre-existing Christian voyage literature, pre-existing Celtic legends, or classical stories the monks would have known. The origins of these stories are attributed to three sources of preexisting stories: Irish myths, Christian genres, and Classic Stories.

The Otherworld in ''The Voyage of Bran'' is a distinctly Celtic feature but this is easily overlooked because the concept of the Christian [[paradise]] and the British and Irish otherworld are closely related. This difference is highlighted in the difference between sinless and sexless in the native and Christian mindset, like in the existing translation where an author may have turned the "Isle of Woman" into a chaste society, with some difficulty. Such an example was with a passage that described a man and a woman playing under a bush without sin or blame.{{sfn|Mac Cana|2000}} This passage in light of several others emphasises a Christian effort to create a sinless and sexless Otherworld.

Immrama may have borrowed heavily from preexisting Christian genres, such as the ''[[hagiography|sanctae vitae]]'' (saints' lives), the ''[[peregrinatio (disambiguation)|peregrinatio]]'' (pilgrimage stories), and the vision tales.{{sfn|Moylan|2007}} As early as the 5th century Irish monks would go on a pilgrimage, a ''peregrination'', sailing from island to island seeking isolation where they would meditate and purge themselves of their sins.{{sfn|Moylan|2007}} The source of inspiration behind the Immram may also be the Christian punishment of sending people adrift for their crimes to be judged by God.{{sfn|Byrne|1932}} Perhaps the largest piece of evidence that immram are Christian works is that the characters in the story are generally wandering priests, monks, and nuns, or at least related to them.

One of the first Celticists, Heinrich Zimmerman, attempted to link the immram with the ''[[Aeneid]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Some of the parallels they make are between the immortal women in the tales who bestow immortality on their lovers for the time they remain with them and the giant sheep on islands in both stories.{{sfn|Thrall|1917}} These parallels have since been debunked by William Flint Thrall.{{sfn|Wooding|2000b|loc=Introduction}}

On top of their literary and mythological precedents, some scholars have argued that the immrama may be exaggerated retelling of historical voyages. The early Irish, particularly [[monk]]s (see [[papar]]), were certainly far travelled, reaching the [[Orkney]], [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]], [[Faroe Islands]] at an early date and perhaps even reaching [[Iceland]]. Some places and things referenced in the immrama and the Brendan tale have been associated with real islands and real things, for instance Brendan's crystal pillar has been suggested to refer to an [[iceberg]].{{sfn|Wooding|2000}}

==Influence==
===Literature===
*The Inrams have been proposed as part inspiration for both [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'', and the poem ''Imram'' by contemporary [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Bedeviled: Lewis, Tolkien and the Shadow of Evil| first = Colin| last =Duriex| page = 181 | year  =2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Australian author [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]]'s novel ''Navigatio'' is a 21st Century Immram that re-imagines the Brendan Voyage. It accretes contradictory and repetitive episodes to create the impression of an unredacted collection of medieval texts.

*[[Anatole France]] satirised the Immram genre in the early part of his 1908 ''[[Penguin Island (novel)|Penguin Island]]'' (French: ''L'Île des Pingouins'').

===Other===
The popularity of ''The Voyage of St. Brendan'' inspired [[Tim Severin]] to undertake a voyage using 5th century technology to demonstrate that the early Irish could have made it as far as North America.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Intellectual property''' ('''IP''') is a category of [[property]] that includes intangible creations of the human intellect, and primarily encompasses [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, and [[trademark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes other types of rights, such as [[trade secret]]s, [[publicity rights]], [[moral rights]], and rights against [[unfair competition]]. Artistic works like music and literature, as well as some discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs, can all be protected as intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/intel1_e.htm |title=What are intellectual property rights? |website=World Trade Organization |publisher=World Trade Organization |access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Intellectual property", ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 10th ed. (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the 19th century that the term "intellectual property" began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world.&lt;ref name="Lemley 2005"&gt;"property as a common descriptor of the field probably traces to the foundation of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by the United Nations." in [[Mark A. Lemley]], [http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf ''Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226035349/http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf |date=2009-02-26 }}, Texas Law Review, 2005, Vol. 83:1031, page 1033, footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a large variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create{{snd}}usually for a limited period of time.  This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to profit from the information and intellectual goods they create.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}} These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.&lt;ref&gt;Rod Falvey and Neil Foster (2006): “The Role of Intellectual Property Rights in Technology Transfer and Economic Growth”: Theory and Evidence, In cooperation with Olga Memedovic UNITED NATIONS INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION (UNIDO),  available: https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/2009-04/Role_of_intellectual_property_rights_in_technology_transfer_and_economic_growth_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is "indivisible" – an unlimited number of people can "consume" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18–19}}

==History==

[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|The [[Statute of Anne]] came into force in 1710]]

The [[Statute of Monopolies]] (1624) and the British [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) are seen as the origins of [[patent law]] and [[copyright]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brad |first=Sherman |author2=Lionel Bently |title=The making of modern intellectual property law: the British experience, 1760–1911 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |page=207 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=u2aMRA-eF1gC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-0-521-56363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property.

The first known use of the term ''intellectual property'' dates to 1769, when a piece published in the ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'' used the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | intellectual property }} (Citing ''Monthly Review'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=cMsvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false vol. 41. p. 290] (1769): "What a niggard this Doctor is of his own, and how profuse he is of other people's intellectual property.")&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear example of modern usage goes back as early as 1808, when it was used as a heading title in a collection of essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | intellectual property }} (Citing ''Medical Repository Of Original Essays And Intelligence'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij9JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA303 vol. 11. p. 303] (1808): "New-England Association in favour of Inventors and Discoverers, and particularly for the Protection of intellectual Property.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The German equivalent was used with the founding of the [[North German Confederation]] whose [[constitution]] granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property (''Schutz des geistigen Eigentums'') to the confederation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de67-18/verfassung67-i.htm 'Article 4 No. 6 of the Constitution of 1867 (German)'] Hastings Law Journal, Vol. 52, p. 1255, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When the administrative secretariats established by the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] (1883) and the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] (1886) merged in 1893, they located in Berne, and also adopted the term intellectual property in their new combined title, the [[United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property]].

The organization subsequently relocated to Geneva in 1960, and was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by [[Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization|treaty]] as an agency of the [[United Nations]]. According to legal scholar [[Mark Lemley]], it was only at this point that the term really began to be used in the United States (which had not been a party to the Berne Convention),&lt;ref name="Lemley 2005" /&gt; and it did not enter popular usage there until passage of the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Lemley, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=582602 "Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding"] (Abstract); see Table 1: 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The history of patents does not begin with inventions, but rather with royal grants by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603) for monopoly privileges... Approximately 200 years after the end of Elizabeth's reign, however, a patent represents a legal [[right]] obtained by an inventor providing for exclusive control over the production and sale of his mechanical or scientific invention... [demonstrating] the evolution of patents from royal prerogative to common-law doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;Mossoff, A. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=863925 'Rethinking the Development of Patents: An Intellectual History, 1550–1800,'] Hastings Law Journal, Vol. 52, p. 1255, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term can be found used in an October 1845 [[Massachusetts Circuit Court]] ruling in the patent case ''Davoll et al. v. Brown.'', in which Justice Charles L. Woodbury wrote that "only in this way can we protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests are as much a man's own...as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears."&lt;ref&gt;''1 Woodb. &amp; M. 53, 3 West.L.J. 151, 7 F.Cas. 197, No. 3662, 2 Robb.Pat.Cas. 303, Merw.Pat.Inv. 414''&lt;/ref&gt; The statement that "discoveries are..property" goes back earlier. Section 1 of the [[French law of 1791]] stated, "All new discoveries are the property of the author; to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery, there shall be delivered to him a patent for five, ten or fifteen years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |title=Patent Archives – Ladas &amp; Parry LLP |publisher=Ladas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115040700/http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, [[France|French]] author A. Nion mentioned ''propriété intellectuelle'' in his ''Droits civils des auteurs, artistes et inventeurs'', published in 1846.

Until recently, the purpose of intellectual property law was to give as little protection as possible in order to encourage innovation. Historically, therefore, they were granted only when they were necessary to encourage invention, limited in time and scope.&lt;ref name="Mark A. Lemley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tlr83&amp;div=30&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals |title=Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding |author=Mark A. Lemley |publisher=Heinonline.org |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly as a result of knowledge being traditionally viewed as a public good, in order to allow its extensive dissemination and improvement thereof.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist; (October 20th 2005): “The Liquidity of Innovation”; How the new market for intellectual property is changing the technology industry, available; https://www.economist.com/node/5015365&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept's origins can potentially be traced back further. [[Jewish law]] includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws, though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of Hasagat Ge'vul (unfair encroachment) was used to justify limited-term publisher (but not author) copyright in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/copyright1.html |title=Jewish Law – Articles ("Jewish Law and Copyright") |publisher=Jlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of [[Sybaris]] offered one year's patent "to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Anthon, A Classical Dictionary: Containing an Account of the Principal Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors, and Intended to Elucidate All the Important Points Connected with the Geography, History, Biography, Mythology, and Fine Arts of the Greek and Romans. Together with an Account of Coins, Weights, and Measures, with Tabular Values of the Same 1273 (Harper &amp; Brothers 1841). See also "The first patent law was enacted in Sybaris, a city in the South of Italy, before the Roman domination; (…) The law was mentioned by Atheneus, an ancient writer..." in Takenaka, Toshiko (2013). Intellectual Property in Common Law and Civil Law. Edward Elgar Publishing. p. 419. (chapter by Mario Franzosi).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jean-Frédéric Morin, "the global intellectual property regime is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, up until the early 2000s the global IP regime used to be dominated by high standards of protection characteristic of IP laws from Europe or the United States, with a vision that uniform application of these standards over every country and to several fields with little consideration over social, cultural or environmental values or of the national level of economic development. Morin argues that "the emerging discourse of the global IP regime advocates for greater policy flexibility and greater access to knowledge, especially for developing countries." Indeed, with the Development Agenda adopted by WIPO in 2007, a set of 45 recommendations to adjust WIPO’s activities to the specific needs of developing countries and aim to reduce distortions especially on issues such as patients’ access to medicines, Internet users’ access to information, farmers’ access to seeds, programmers’ access to source codes or students’ access to scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this paradigm shift has not yet manifested itself in concrete legal reforms at the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it is based on these background that the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement requires members of the WTO to set minimum standards of legal protection, but its objective to have a “one-fits-all” protection law on Intellectual Property has been viewed with controversies regarding differences in the development level of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roisah|first=Kholis|date=2017-12-26|title=Understanding Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement: From Hard and Soft Law Perspective|url=http://pasca.unhas.ac.id/ojs/index.php/halrev/article/view/1153|journal=Hasanuddin Law Review|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=277–289|doi=10.20956/halrev.v3i3.1153|issn=2442-9899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy, the agreement has extensively incorporated intellectual property rights into the global trading system for the first time in 1995, and has prevailed as the most comprehensive agreement reached by the world.&lt;ref&gt;WTO (2013): Intellectual Property; Responding to least developed countries’ special needs in intellectual property; https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/ldc_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property rights==
Intellectual property rights include [[patent]]s, [[copyright]], [[industrial design right]]s, [[trademark]]s, [[plant variety rights]], [[trade dress]], [[geographical indications]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=288514 Article 1(2) of the Paris Convention]: "The protection of industrial property has as its object patents, utility models, industrial designs, trademarks, service marks, trade names, indications of source or appellations of origin, and the repression of unfair competition."&lt;/ref&gt; and in some jurisdictions [[trade secret]]s. There are also more specialized or derived varieties of ''[[sui generis]]'' exclusive rights, such as circuit design rights (called [[mask work]] rights in the US) and [[supplementary protection certificate]]s for pharmaceutical products (after expiry of a patent protecting them) and [[database rights]] (in [[EC law|European law]]). The term "industrial property" is sometimes used to refer to a large subset of intellectual property rights including patents, trademarks, industrial designs, utility models, service marks, trade names, and geographical indications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/index.html|title=Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patents===
{{Main|Patent}}
A [[patent]] is a form of right granted by the government to an inventor or their successor-in-title, giving the owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing an [[invention]] for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, which may be a product or a process and generally has to fulfill three main requirements: it has to be new, not obvious and there needs to be an industrial applicability.&lt;ref name="WIPO Handbook Ch 2"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch2.pdf WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook: Policy, Law and Use.

===Copyright===
{{Main|Copyright}}
A [[copyright]] gives the creator of an original work [[exclusive right]]s to it, usually for a limited time. Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or "works".&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights] |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/909/wipo_pub_909.pdf |format=PDF |author=World Intellectual Property Organisation |title=Understanding Copyright and Related Rights |publisher=WIPO |accessdate=August 2008 |page=8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66HD0x4jV?url=http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/909/wipo_pub_909.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.&lt;ref name="Art and copyright"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=h-XBqKIryaQC&amp;dq=idea-expression+dichotomy&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Art and copyright] |pages=48–49 |author=Simon, Stokes |isbn=978-1-84113-225-9 |year=2001 |publisher=Hart Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial design rights===
{{Main|Industrial design right}}
An [[industrial design right]] (sometimes called "design right" or ''design patent'') protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Generally speaking, it is what makes a product look appealing, and as such, it increases the commercial value of goods.&lt;ref name="wipo.int"/&gt;

===Plant varieties===
{{Main|Plant breeders' rights}}
[[Plant breeders' rights]] or plant variety rights are the rights to commercially use a new variety of a plant. The variety must amongst others be novel and distinct and for registration the evaluation of propagating material of the variety is considered.

===Trademarks===
{{Main|Trademark}}
A [[trademark]] is a recognizable [[sign (semiotics)|sign]], [[design]] or [[expression (language)|expression]] which distinguishes [[Good (economics)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] of a particular trader from the similar products or services of other traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/definitions.jsp |title=Trademark, Patent, or Copyright? |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-about/t-whatis.htm |title=A trade mark is a sign which can distinguish your goods and services from those of your competitors (you may refer to your trade mark as your "brand"). |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patentamt.de/english/trade_marks/index.html |title=Trade marks identify the goods and services of particular traders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade dress===
{{Main|Trade dress}}
[[Trade dress]] is a legal term of art that generally refers to characteristics of the visual and aesthetic appearance of a product or its packaging (or even the design of a building) that signify the source of the product to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert P. |last=Merges |first2=Peter S. |last2=Menell |first3=Mark A. |last3=Lemley |title=Intellectual Property in the New Technological Age |edition=4th rev. |year=2007 |location=New York |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |isbn=978-0-7355-6989-8 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade secrets===
{{Main|Trade secret}}
A [[trade secret]] is a [[formula]], practice, process, [[design]], instrument, [[pattern]], or compilation of [[information]] which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable, by which a [[business]] can obtain an economic advantage over competitors and customers. There is no formal government protection granted; each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets (e.g., Formula of its soft drinks is a trade secret for Coca-Cola.)

==Object of intellectual property law==
The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods for consumers.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time.  Because they can then profit from them, this gives economic incentive for their creation.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is indivisible – an unlimited number of people can "consume" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – while a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of information and intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent their wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18–19}}

By exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work. Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be "absolute protection". "If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions".&lt;ref name="Mark A. Lemley" /&gt; This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of "real" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric. Other recent developments in intellectual property law, such as the [[Leahy-Smith America Invents Act|America Invents Act]], stress international harmonization. Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of [[commodification]] derived from this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farah |first1=Paolo Davide |last2=Tremolada |first2=Riccardo |title=Desirability of Commodification of Intangible Cultural Heritage: The Unsatisfying Role of Intellectual Property Rights |journal=Transnational Dispute Management |date=March 15, 2014 |volume=11 |issue=2 |ssrn=2472339 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.

===Financial incentive===
These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated [[research and development]] costs.&lt;ref name="MonoProf"&gt;[http://www.uclan.ac.uk/schools/school_of_health/research_projects/files/health_innova_IPR_reform_report.pdf Prudential Reasons for IPR Reform], University of Melbourne, Doris Schroeder and Peter Singer, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States Article I Section 8 Clause 8 of the Constitution, commonly called the Patent and Copyright Clause, reads; "[The Congress shall have power] 'To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright &amp; Fair Use|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/law/us-constitution/|website=Stanford University Libraries|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ”Some commentators, such as [[David K. Levine|David Levine]] and [[Michele Boldrin]], dispute this justification.&lt;ref name='R000000'&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=David |authorlink=David K. Levine |author2=Michele Boldrin |author2link=Michele Boldrin |title=Against intellectual monopoly |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2008-09-07 |location= |url=http://www.dklevine.com/papers/imbookfinalall.pdf |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-521-87928-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office approximated that the worth of intellectual property to the U.S. economy is more than US $5 trillion and creates employment for an estimated 18 million American people. The value of intellectual property is considered similarly high in other developed nations, such as those in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Chemotherapy That Costs $70,000 in the U.S. Costs $2,500 in India |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/why-chemotherapy-that-costs-70-000-in-the-us-costs-2-500-in-india/274847/ |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |accessdate=18 April 2013 |author=Thomas Bollyky |date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, IP has become a recognised asset class for use in [[Pension led funding|pension-led funding]] and other types of business finance. However, in 2013, the UK Intellectual Property Office stated: "There are millions of intangible business assets whose value is either not being leveraged at all, or only being leveraged inadvertently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brassell, King |first=Martin, Kelvin |title=Banking on IP? |year=2013 |publisher=The Intellectual Property Office |location=Newport, Wales |isbn=978-1-908908-86-5 |page=15 |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipresearch-bankingip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
The WIPO treaty and several related international agreements underline that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth. The ''WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook'' gives two reasons for intellectual property laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One is to give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations and the rights of the public in access to those creations. The second is to promote, as a deliberate act of Government policy, creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch1.pdf p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA) states that "effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/acta-crc_apr15-2011_eng.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507132516/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/acta-crc_apr15-2011_eng.pdf|date=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists estimate that two-thirds of the value of large businesses in the United States can be traced to intangible assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonecon.com/docs/studies/0807_thevalueofip.pdf |format=PDF |title=Economic Effects of Intellectual Property-Intensive Manufacturing in the United States |author1=Robert J.

Pham |publisher=Sonecon.com |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "IP-intensive industries" are estimated to generate 72 percent more [[value added]] (price minus material cost) per employee than "non-IP-intensive industries".&lt;ref name="Shapiro-Pham"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216195041/http://www.the-value-of-ip.org/ Economic Effects of Intellectual Property-Intensive Manufacturing in the United States], Robert Shapiro and Nam Pham, July 2007 (archived on archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=July 2009}}&lt;!--does advertising count as "value"--&gt;

A joint research project of the [[WIPO]] and the [[United Nations University]] measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found "a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth."&lt;ref name="WIPO: Economic Impact"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/portal/en/news/2007/article_0032.html Measuring the Economic Impact of IP Systems], WIPO, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morality===
According to Article 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], "everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the relationship between intellectual property and [[human rights]] is a complex one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WIPO – The World Intellectual Property Organization |title=Human Rights and Intellectual Property: An Overview |url=http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022125749/http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |archivedate=October 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are moral arguments for intellectual property.

The arguments that justify intellectual property fall into three major categories. Personality theorists believe intellectual property is an extension of an individual. Utilitarians believe that intellectual property stimulates social progress and pushes people to further innovation. Lockeans argue that intellectual property is justified based on deservedness and hard work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/#LocJusIntPro|title=Intellectual Property|last=Moore|first=Adam|date=2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various moral justifications for private property can be used to argue in favor of the morality of intellectual property, such as:

# ''Natural Rights/Justice Argument'': this argument is based on Locke's idea that a person has a natural right over the labour and/or products which is produced by his/her body. Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald V. Bettig. "Critical Perspectives on the History and Philosophy of Copyright" in Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy of Intellectual Property, by Ronald V. Bettig. (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1996), 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to apply his argument to intellectual property rights, in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create. They argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what we create. Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.
# ''Utilitarian-Pragmatic Argument'': according to this rationale, a society that protects private property is more effective and prosperous than societies that do not. Innovation and invention in 19th century America has been attributed to the development of the [[patent]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 416.&lt;/ref&gt; By providing innovators with "durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources", intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility.&lt;ref name="Spinello 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spinello |first=Richard A. |title=Intellectual property rights |journal=Library Hi Tech |date=January 2007 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=12–22 |doi=10.1108/07378830710735821}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 3, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The presumption is that they promote public welfare by encouraging the "creation, production, and distribution of intellectual works".&lt;ref name="Spinello 2007" /&gt; Utilitarians argue that without intellectual property there would be a lack of incentive to produce new ideas. Systems of protection such as Intellectual property optimize social utility.
# ''"Personality" Argument'': this argument is based on a quote from [[Hegel]]: "Every man has the right to turn his will upon a thing or make the thing an object of his will, that is to say, to set aside the mere thing and recreate it as his own".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; European intellectual property law is shaped by this notion that ideas are an "extension of oneself and of one's personality".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Personality theorists argue that by being a creator of something one is inherently at risk and vulnerable for having their ideas and designs stolen and/or altered. Intellectual property protects these moral claims that have to do with personality.

[[Lysander Spooner]] (1855) argues "that a man has a natural and absolute right—and if a natural and absolute, then necessarily a perpetual, right—of property, in the ideas, of which he is the discoverer or creator; that his right of property, in ideas, is intrinsically the same as, and stands on identically the same grounds with, his right of property in material things; that no distinction, of principle, exists between the two cases".&lt;ref&gt;The Law of Intellectual Property, Part 1 Chapter 1 Section 9 – Lysander Spooner&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Ayn Rand]] argued in her book ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'' that the protection of intellectual property is essentially a moral issue. The belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property. To violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal |location=New York |publisher=Signet |year=1967 |origyear=1966 |edition=paperback 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infringement, misappropriation, and enforcement==
{{Main|Intellectual property infringement}}

Violation of intellectual property rights, called "infringement" with respect to patents, copyright, and trademarks, and "misappropriation" with respect to trade secrets, may be a breach of civil law or criminal law, depending on the type of intellectual property involved, jurisdiction, and the nature of the action.

As of 2011 trade in counterfeit copyrighted and trademarked works was a $600 billion industry worldwide and accounted for 5–7% of global trade.&lt;ref name=Bitton&gt;Miriam Bitton (2012) [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/backissues/v102/n1/1021_67.Bitton.pdf Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement's Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures] The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 102(1):67-117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent infringement===
{{Main|Patent infringement|}}

Patent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|69}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined in the [[claim (patent)|claims]] of the granted patent. There is [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug.&lt;ref&gt;Pradip K. Sahu and Shannon Mrksich, Ph.D. [http://www.brinkshofer.com/resource_center/85-the-hatch-waxman-act-research-exempt-from-patent-infringement The Hatch-Waxman Act: When Is Research Exempt from Patent Infringement?] ABA-IPL Newsletter 22(4) Summer 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L.

===Copyright infringement===
{{Main|Copyright infringement}}

Copyright infringement is reproducing, distributing, displaying or performing a [[Copyright law#Scope|work]], or to make [[derivative work]]s, without permission from the copyright holder, which is typically a publisher or other business representing or assigned by the work's creator. It is often called "piracy".&lt;ref name=Panethiere_p2&gt;{{cite web |last=Panethiere |first=Darrell |title=The Persistence of Piracy: The Consequences for Creativity, for Culture, and for Sustainable Development |publisher=UNESCO e-Copyright Bulletin |date=July–September 2005 |page=2 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080816063513/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While copyright is created the instant a work is fixed, generally the copyright holder can only get money damages if the owner registers the copyright.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Enforcement of copyright is generally the responsibility of the copyright holder.&lt;ref name=Xuan_p211&gt;{{cite book |last=Correa |first=Carlos Maria |author2=Li, Xuan |title=Intellectual property enforcement: international perspectives |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2009 |page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bN3o1uwpKF4C&amp;dq=copyright+infringement+international+acta |isbn=978-1-84844-663-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA trade agreement]], signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, and which has not entered into force, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to active police for infringement.&lt;ref name=Bitton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musa&gt;Irina D.

Examples of such doctrines are the [[fair use]] and [[fair dealing]] doctrine.

===Trademark infringement===
{{Main|Trademark infringement}}

Trademark infringement occurs when one party uses a trademark that is identical or [[confusing similarity|confusingly similar]] to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services of the other party. In many countries, a trademark receives protection without registration, but registering a trademark provides legal advantages for enforcement. Infringement can be addressed by civil litigation and, in several jurisdictions, under criminal law.&lt;ref name=Bitton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musa /&gt;

===Trade secret misappropriation===
{{Main|Trade secret#Misappropriation}}

Trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available. In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]]. The United States also has federal law in the form of the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]] ({{usc|18|1831|1839}}), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, {{uscsub|18|1831|a}}, criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, {{usc|18|1832}}, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[common law]] jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] right rather than a [[property]] right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===The term "intellectual property"===
Criticism of the term ''intellectual property'' ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like ''property'' and ''rights'' in fashions that contradict practice and law. Many detractors think this term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations; and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright, patents, trademarks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mike Masnick |authorlink1=Mike Masnick |title=If Intellectual Property Is Neither Intellectual, Nor Property, What Is It? |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080306/003240458/if-intellectual-property-is-neither-intellectual-property-what-is-it.shtml |website=techdirt.com |publisher=[[Techdirt]] |accessdate=17 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813003301/https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080306/003240458/if-intellectual-property-is-neither-intellectual-property-what-is-it.shtml |archivedate=13 August 2014 |date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free Software Foundation]] founder [[Richard Stallman]] argues that, although the term ''intellectual property'' is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it "systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion". He claims that the term "operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues" and that it creates a "bias" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to "property rights".&lt;ref name="mirage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml |title=Did You Say "Intellectual Property"? It's a Seductive Mirage |author=Richard M. Stallman |accessdate=2008-03-28 |publisher=Free Software Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term. He argues that "to avoid spreading unnecessary bias and confusion, it is best to adopt a firm policy not to speak or even think in terms of 'intellectual property'."&lt;ref name="words-to-avoid"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#IntellectualProperty |title=Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing |author=Richard M. Stallman |accessdate=2016-12-01 |publisher=The GNU Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, economists [[Michele Boldrin|Boldrin]] and [[David K. Levine|Levine]] prefer to use the term "intellectual monopoly" as a more appropriate and clear definition of the concept, which they argue, is very dissimilar from property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Boldrin, Michele, and David K. Levine. [http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/against.htm Against intellectual monopoly]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They further argued that “stronger patents do little or nothing to encourage innovation”, mainly explained by its tendency to create market monopolies, thereby restricting further innovations and technology transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine (2009): “Intellectual Property Rights and Economic Growth in the Long-Run”; A model Discovery, available; http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/aea_pp09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On the assumption that intellectual property rights are actual rights, Stallman says that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws, which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system, and later on, a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally, but never interfered with the freedom of average readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/copyright.html |title=copyright and globalization in the age of computer networks |date=19 April 2001 |accessdate=21 October 2015 |website=mit.edu |publisher= |author=Richard Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302072256/http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/copyright.html |archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still referring to copyright, he cites legal literature such as the United States Constitution and [[case law]] to demonstrate that the law is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain to temporarily trade property rights and free speech for public, not private, benefits in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge. He mentions that "if copyright were a natural right nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html |title=Misinterpreting Copyright |date= |accessdate=21 October 2015 |website=gnu.org |publisher= |author=Richard Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905075652/https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html |archivedate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor, writer and political activist [[Lawrence Lessig]], along with many other [[copyleft]] and free software activists, has criticized the implied analogy with physical property (like land or an automobile). They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original).&lt;ref name="lessigperpetual" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Intellectual property" is a silly euphemism |last=Doctorow |first=Cory |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/21/intellectual.property |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property, there is [[artificial scarcity|no natural scarcity]] of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated indefinitely without such re-use diminishing the original. [[Stephan Kinsella]] has objected to ''intellectual property'' on the grounds that the word "property" implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella (2001) [https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/15_2/15_2_1.pdf Against Intellectual Property] Journal of Libertarian Studies 15(2):1–53&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative terms====
In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, intellectual property has often been referred to as [[intellectual rights]], traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold. Use of the term ''intellectual rights'' has declined since the early 1980s, as use of the term ''intellectual property'' has increased.

Alternative terms ''monopolies on information'' and ''intellectual monopoly'' have emerged among those who argue against the "property" or "intellect" or "rights" assumptions, notably [[Richard Stallman]]. The [[backronym]]s ''intellectual protectionism'' and ''intellectual poverty'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella for Ludwig von Mises Institute blog, January 6, 2011. [http://archive.mises.org/15240/intellectual-poverty/ Intellectual Poverty]&lt;/ref&gt; whose initials are also ''IP'', have found supporters as well, especially among those who have used the backronym ''[[Opposition to digital rights management|digital restrictions management]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drm.info/ Official drm.info site] run by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management |title=What is DRM? |publisher=Defective by Design |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that an intellectual property right should (in the interests of better balancing of relevant private and public interests) be termed an ''intellectual monopoly privilege'' (IMP) has been advanced by several academics including Birgitte Andersen&lt;ref&gt;Birgitte Andersen.

More recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that [[patent thickets]] are undermining technological development even in high-tech fields like [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/11/stallmans-got-company-researcher-wants-nanotech-patent-moratorium/ Stallman's got company: Researcher wants nanotech patent moratorium] – Ars Technica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/23/professor-seeks-nanotech-patent-moratorium Freeze on nanotechnology patents proposed to help grow the sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302113908/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/23/professor-seeks-nanotech-patent-moratorium |date=2014-03-02 }}- Wired UK 11-23-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Petra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Overall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation. On the contrary, policies that encourage the diffusion of ideas and modify patent laws to facilitate entry and encourage competition may be an effective mechanism to encourage innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Petra. 2013. "Patents and Innovation: Evidence from Economic History." Journal of Economic Perspectives, 27(1): 23-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In support of that argument, [[Jörg Baten]], Nicola Bianchi and Petra Moser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baten|first1=Jörg|last2=Bianchi|first2=Nicola|last3=Moser|first3=Petra|title=Compulsory licensing and innovation–Historical evidence from German patents after WWI|journal=Journal of Development Economics|date=2017|volume=126|pages=231–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; find historical evidence that especially compulsory licensing – which allows governments to license patents without the consent of patent-owners – encouraged invention in Germany in the early 20th century by increasing the threat of competition in fields with low pre-existing levels of competition.

[[Peter Drahos]] notes, "Property rights confer authority over resources. When authority is granted to the few over resources on which many depend, the few gain power over the goals of the many. This has consequences for both political and economic freedoms with in a society."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite.

The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WIPO – World Intellectual Property Organization |title=Human Rights and Intellectual Property: An Overview |url=http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022125749/http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |archivedate=October 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] issued a document called "Human rights and intellectual property" that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws.

Further along these lines, The ethical problems brought up by IP rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life-saving medicines are given IP protection. While the application of IP rights can allow companies to charge higher than the marginal cost of production in order to recoup the costs of research and development, the price may exclude from the market anyone who cannot afford the cost of the product, in this case a life-saving drug.&lt;ref name=Sonderholm&gt;Jorn Sonderholm (2010) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00358.x/abstract Ethical Issues Surrounding Intellectual Property Rights], Philosophy Compass 5(12): 1107–1115.&lt;/ref&gt; "An IPR driven regime is therefore not a regime that is conductive to the investment of R&amp;D of products that are socially valuable to predominately poor populations".&lt;ref name=Sonderholm /&gt;{{rp|1108–9}}

[[Libertarian]]s have [[Libertarian perspectives on intellectual property|differing views on intellectual property]].{{Fact|date=August 2018}} [[Stephan Kinsella]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] on the [[right-libertarian|right-wing of libertarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella, [http://web.archive.org/web/20180415041048/https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/01/stephan-kinsella/what-it-means-to-be-an-anarcho-capitalist/ "What It Means To Be an Anarcho-Capitalist"], "LewRockwell.com", published 2004-01-20, archived 2018-04-15, accessed 2018-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; [[criticism of intellectual property|argues against intellectual property]] because allowing property rights in ideas and information creates [[artificial scarcity]] and infringes on the right to own tangible property. Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]magine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy&amp;mdash;let's call him Galt-Magnon&amp;mdash;decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this is a good idea, and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule flies in the face of the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/books/against.pdf N. Stephan Kinsella, ''Against Intellectual property''] (2008), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] once said in a letter to Isaac McPherson on August 13, 1813:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his [[candle|taper]] at mine, receives light without darkening me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Thomas Jefferson, ''Letter to Isaac McPherson''] (August 13, 1813)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2005 the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce|RSA]] launched the [[Adelphi Charter]], aimed at creating an international policy statement to frame how governments should make balanced intellectual property law.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James (14 October 2005).

Another aspect of current U.S. Intellectual Property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works; thus, copyright protection can only be obtained in 'original' works of authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Philip |last=Bennet|title=Native Americans and Intellectual Property: the Necessity of Implementing Collective Ideals into Current United States Intellectual Property Laws|year= 2009 |ssrn=1498783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion in nature and scope of intellectual property laws===
[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (Assuming authors create their works by age 35 and live for seventy years)]]

Other criticism of intellectual property law concerns the expansion of intellectual property, both in duration and in scope.

In addition, as scientific knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, originators of technology have sought IP protection for the new technologies. Patents have been granted for living organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Council for Responsible Genetics, [http://www.actionbioscience.org/genomics/crg.html DNA Patents Create Monopolies on Living Organisms.] Accessed 2008.12.18.&lt;/ref&gt; (and in the United States, [[Plant breeders' rights|certain living organisms]] have been patentable for over a century).&lt;ref&gt;Plant Patents [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/plant/ USPTO.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also with respect to copyright, the American film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Wharton, "MPAA's Rebel With Cause Fights for Copyright Coin," Variety (August 3, 1992), Vol. 348, No. 2, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Fisher III, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property99/history.html The Growth of Intellectual Property:A History of the Ownership of Ideas in the United States] Eigentumskulturen im Vergleich (Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of the [[Internet]], and particularly distributed search engines like [[Kazaa]] and [[Gnutella]], have represented a challenge for copyright policy. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]], in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against [[copyright infringement]], which the industry calls "piracy". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company [[Napster]], and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based [[digital rights management]] tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the [[EU Copyright Directive|Copyright Directive]]. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the [[Conditional Access Directive]] of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting [[public domain]] works, [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]], or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some [[copyleft]] licenses, like [[GNU GPL 3]], are designed to counter that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html |title=A Quick Guide to GPLv3 |author=Brett Smith |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=2007–2010 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for [[accessibility]] reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal.

In the context of trademarks, this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of "trademark", as exemplified by the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] ratified in 1994, which formalized regulations for IP rights that had been handled by common law, or not at all, in member states. Pursuant to TRIPs, any [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] which is "capable of distinguishing" the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Beckman and Christa Pletcher (2009) [http://ipjournal.law.wfu.edu/files/2010/10/article.10.215.pdf Expanding Global Trademark Regulation] Wake Forest Intellectual Property Law Journal 10(2): 215–239&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017-2018, both the U.S. and the EU Commission simultaneously decided to depart from the [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|OECD BEPS Project]] timetable, which was set up in 2013 to combat IP BEPS tax tools like the above,&lt;ref name="BEPS Background"&gt;{{cite web|title=BEPS Project Background Brief|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/background-brief-inclusive-framework-for-beps-implementation.pdf|publisher=OECD|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launch their own anti-IP BEPS tax regimes:

The departure of the U.S. and EU Commission from the OECD BEPS Project process, is attributed to frustrations with the rise in IP as a key BEPS tax tool, creating intangible assets, which are then turned into royalty payment BEPS schemes (double Irish), and/or [[capital allowance]] BEPS schemes (capital allowances for intangibles).  In contrast, the OECD has spent years developing and advocating intellectual property as a legal and a GAAP accounting concept.&lt;ref name="un1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/09/11/new-un-tax-handbook-sets-lower-income-countries-oecd-beps/|title=New UN tax handbook: Lower-income countries vs OECD BEPS failure|publisher=Tax Justice Network| date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU Commission's [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|€13 billion fine]] of Apple's pre 2015 double Irish IP BEPS tax scheme, is the largest corporate tax fine in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4472500/apple-eu-irish-tax-bill/|title=Apple vs. the E.U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37561">Due to its complexity [[folklore]]  does not have a single definition. However, it can be considered as "the traditional art, literature, knowledge, and practices that are disseminated largely through oral communication and behavioural example".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afsnet.site-ym.com/?page=WhatIsFolklore|title=What Is Folklore? - American Folklore Society|website=afsnet.site-ym.com|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also include traditions, beliefs, worldviews, knowledge and skills (how to build a house, how to treat an illness), and talents (story-telling, songs, plays). All in all, folklore is an important part of group and national identity. As it can be studied as an understanding of how people live, giving an insight into people's daily life, it can have an academic value.

'''Irish folklore''', when mentioned to many people, conjures up images of banshees, fairy stories, leprechauns and people gathering around, sharing stories of a man as strong as 300 men put together. Many tales and legends were passed from generations to generations, so were the way to celebrate important moments such as marriages, deaths, birthday and holidays ([[Christmas]], [[Halloween]] (''Oíche Shamhna''), [[St. Patrick's day|St. Patrick's Day]]) or the way we hand down skills such as making weaved baskets or St. Bridget's crosses. All of the above can be considered as a part of folklore, as it is the study and appreciation of how people lived.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dominican-college.com/other/environment/139-irish-folklore-myth-and-reality|title=Irish Folklore: Myth and Reality|website=dominican-college.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Banshee.jpg|alt=Bunworth Banshee, Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland by Thomas Crofton Croker, 1825|thumb|Bunworth Banshee, Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland by Thomas Crofton Croker, 1825]]
Irish folklore consists of many classics that are repeated to this day. Popular Irish folkltales include the Otherworld (''An Saol Eile)'', which revolves around the idea of supernatural manifestations and beings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62533994|title=The blessed and the damned : sinful women and unbaptised children in Irish folklore|last=1958-|first=O'Connor, Anne,|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=3039105418|location=Oxford|oclc=62533994}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beings appear in many of the folkloristic genres such as ballads, popular song, legends, memorates, belief statements and folkloric material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some famous examples from this include the Irish fairylore and restless souls and spirits around [[Halloween]] such as the [[Banshee]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Banshee is one of the most popular classics to this day, known by many different names (for example, ''Badh'' commonly used in the south of Ireland).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51912602|title=The concept of the goddess|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|others=Billington, Sandra., Aldhouse-Green, Miranda J. (Miranda Jane)|isbn=0415197899|location=London|oclc=51912602}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Banshee is also rumoured to have a connection with certain families, and is said to follow the prominent male members of the family.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Popular opinion is also that she is seen as the ancestress of Irish families and is deeply concerned with the families fortunes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is uncertain whether the Banshee is evil or good.

Other classics include [[leprechaun]]s, [[Fairy|fairies]], [[rainbow]]s, [[Cú Chulainn|Cu Chluain]], [[Children of Lir]], Dullahan (headless horsemen), Pookas, Changelings.

The word folklore in French means “picturesque but without importance or without deep significance”.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locating Irish folklore: tradition, modernity, identity|last=1955-|first=Ó Giolláin, Diarmuid,|date=2000|publisher=Cork University Press|year=|isbn=1859181694|location=Sterling, VA|pages=|oclc=43615310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland the word Folk Lore has deep meaning to its people and brings societies together, it is a word that has ideological significance in this country. In Ireland, folklore can be associated with the countryside, specifically the Irish speaking West, [[Aran Islands]], oral stories, the [[fiddle]], intimate settings. Folklore is also massively tied with traditional Irish music and dance for example the [[Riverdance|river dance]] can be tied to folklore in ways.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Samhain and Beltane are two traditions that are rooted in folklore, and are still in practice today. 

Samhain, (Celtic for “End of Summer") is an ancient Celtic tradition. It marks the end of the lighter half of the world (summer), and the beginning of the darker half (winter).   It is here where it was believed that the division between life and the after life was thinnest.  It was believed that this thinning allowed spirts to move between this world and the other.  The widely practice holiday of Halloween originates from Samhain. 

Another tradition rooted in folklore is Beltane.  Beltane is held on the first day of May.  This tradition is a celebration marking the beginning of summer.  During this tradition rituals were performed to protect both crops and livestock.  Large bonfires were lit serving as protection for grazing cattle.  Today Beltane festivals can be found in both Ireland and Scotland.

== Fairy lore ==
Fairy lore is a body of stories, anecdotes, beliefs and the likes of these that are relating to fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fairy_lore|title=fairy lore {{!}} Definition of fairy lore in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually contains superstitions and stories that were passed down throughout the generations.
[[File:Fairy Trees near Greenan - geograph.org.uk - 962666.jpg|alt=Two green "fairy" trees next to each other in a lush pasture. |thumb|Fairy Trees near Greenan. According to fairy lore, the hawthorn tree, also known as a fairy tree, is said to mark the territory of the fairies.]]
There are different famous superstitions involving fairy lore. These superstitions mention that fairy forts and hawthorn trees, also known as fairy trees, are the places of residency of fairies. To tamper with these sites is seen as hugely disrespectful to the fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://owlcation.com/social-sciences/Irish-FolkloreTraditional-Beliefs-and-Superstitions|title=Irish Folklore: Traditional Beliefs and Superstitions|work=Owlcation|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When tampered with, it could be seen an act of provocation towards these supernatural beings which would result in unexplainable consequences such as sickness, bad luck or even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yourirish.com/folklore/irish-fairy-trees|title=Superstitions &amp; Fairy trees in Ireland|last=Donnelly|first=Dave|date=2016-10-04|work=Your Irish Culture|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These encounters are recorded in Irish fairy tales as well as passed down by word of mouth. The effects of these stories and superstitions are evident, even up to the present day, where even government infrastructure are planned in a way that preserves these sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irelandinpicture.net/2010/04/fairy-tree-that-delayed-motorway-ennis.html|title=The Fairy tree that delayed a motorway.

Fairy stories include "The Field of Boliauns", "The Children Of Lir", "Finn MacCool", "The Fairy Well of Lagnanay" and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pp_SVHuVsFoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=fairies+in+irish+folktales&amp;ots=lqjuEOYLx0&amp;sig=Ftp3LaaP0JMO8QJOOTUvBGmch20&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=fairies%20in%20irish%20folktales&amp;f=false|title=Fairy Folk Tales of Ireland|last=Yeats|first=William Butler|date=1998-03-02|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780684829524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different types of fairies in Irish fairy lore with different abilities and characteristics. These include the famous few such as the leprechaun, banshees, changelings and many others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The origin of these Irish fairies could be dated back to the ancient Celtic beliefs of pagan Gods and supernatural beings.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=nd9R6GQBB_0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore|last=Monaghan|first=Patricia|date=2014-05-14|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438110370|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no  linear path that traces the development of fairy lore in Ireland from its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.celtic-weddingrings.com/fairy-stories/irish-fairies|title=Irish Fairies|website=www.celtic-weddingrings.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish fairy lore has influenced many English authors, such as [[Jonathan Swift]], who wrote [[Gulliver's Travels]] while living in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://owlcation.com/humanities/Forgotten-Irish-Fairies|title=Forgotten Fairies of Irish Folklore|work=Owlcation|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seán Ó Súilleabháin (1903–1996) and the Irish Folklore Commission ==
Ó Súilleabháin was part of the [[Irish Folklore Commission]], ''Béaloideas''. Not long after the foundation of the commission he created two books for the collectors. The first, in 1937, a shorter volume in the Irish Language, ''Láimh-Leabhar Béaloideasa'', mainly used by collectors in the Irish speaking areas. In 1942 he wrote his more well-known volume ''A Handbook of Irish Folklore'' (published 1947). To this day his work serves as a great resource to collectors of Irish folklore and provides a wide outline of the traditions of Irish Folklore.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lysaght|first=Patricia|date=1998|title=Seán Ó Súilleabháin (1903-1996) and the Irish Folklore Commission|jstor=1500217|journal=Western Folklore|volume=57|issue=2/3|pages=137–151|doi=10.2307/1500217}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a booklet of topics, in both Irish and English, in 1937 to be used by teachers and school children in primary schools in the South of Ireland as part of the Schools' Scheme for the collection of folklore (1937-1938).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He focused on the native Gaelic tradition and the tradition of story-tellying. He played particular attention to the stories of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Fionn Mac Cumhail]] and the [[Fianna]], and looked into how stories were told in Irish and in other languages across Europe. His work was and still is very important in the study of Irish Folklore for the masses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Effects of Christianity on Irish folklore ==
When [[History of Christianity in Ireland|Christianity was first brought in Ireland]] during the 5th century by missionaries, they were not able to totally wipe out the pre-existing folklore and beliefs in God-like fairies. But folklore didn’t remain untouched, and the myths and [[Christian Beliefs|Christian beliefs]] were combined such that Irish folklore would “enforce Christian ideals but still remain as a concession to early fairy belief systems”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transceltic.com/irish/changelings-fairies-deities-and-saints-integration-of-irish-christianity-and-fairy-tale-belief|title=Changelings, Fairies, Deities, and Saints: The Integration of Irish Christianity and Fairy Tale Belief {{!}} Transceltic - Home of the Celtic nations|website=www.transceltic.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] altered the importance of some beliefs and define a new place for them in folklore. For example, fairies, who were previously perceived as God, became merely magical, and of much lesser importance. Along with it, a fusion of folklore legends and Christianity was witnessed. One of the major example of this is the existence of legends featuring both [[Saint Patrick]], a central figure in the Irish church, and [[Fairy|fairies]] (for example, “The Colloquy of the Ancients” is a dialogue between [[Saint Patrick]] and the ghost of Caeilte of the Fianna, an ancient clan of Celtic warriors).

All in all, the current Irish folklore shows a strong absorption of Christianity, including its lesson of morality and spiritual beliefs, creating a “singular brand of fairy tale tradition”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== The evolution of Irish folklore ==
Folklore is a part of national identity, and is evolving through time. During the 16th century, [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|the English conquest]] overthrew the traditional political and religious autonomy of the country. [[Great Famine (Ireland)|The Great famine of 1840’s]], and the deaths and emigration it brought, weakened a still powerful Gaelic culture, especially within the rural [[proletariat]], which was at the time the most traditional social grouping. At the time, intellectuals such as [[William Wilde|Sir William Wilde]] expressed concerns on the decay of traditional beliefs:

{{Quote|In the state of things, with depopulation the most terrific which any country ever experienced, on the one hand, and the spread of education, and the introduction of railroads, colleges, industrial and other educational schools, on the other – together with the rapid decay of our Irish bardic annals, the vestige of Pagan rites, and the relics of fairy charms were preserved, - can superstition, or if superstitious belief, can superstitious practices continue to exist?&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;}}

Moreover, in the last decades, capitalism has helped overcoming special spatial barriers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18747380|title=The condition of postmodernity: an enquiry into the origins of cultural change|last=1935-|first=Harvey, David,|date=1990|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631162941|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=18747380}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it easier for cultures to merge into one another (such as the amalgam between [[Samhain]] and [[Halloween]]).

All those events have led to a massive decline of native learned Gaelic traditions and [[Irish language]], and with Irish tradition being mainly an oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://owlcation.com/humanities/Guide-to-Irish-Fairy-Tales|title=A Guide to Irish Folk Tales|work=Owlcation|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has led to a loss of identity and historical continuity, in a similar nature to [[Anomie|Durkheim's anomie]].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Honko describes the current state of the Irish folklore as its “second life”.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Even though there is still a natural existence of folklore within its natural community, folklore material is now being used in other environments, such as marketing (with strategies suggesting tradition and authenticity for goods), movies and TV-shows (''[[The Secret of Kells]]'', mention of the [[Banshee]] are found in tv-shows such as [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|''Supernatural'']], ''[[Teen Wolf]]'' or ''[[Charmed]]''), books (the book series ''[[The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]],'' the novel ''[[American Gods]]''...), contributing to the creation of a new body of Irish folklore.

==Biography==
Hart was born in [[Massett]], [[Haida Gwaii]], [[British Columbia]]. His mother, Joan Hart, is the granddaughter of [[Charles Edenshaw]]. His father was European, allowing Hart to escape the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] that many Haida of his time were sent to. Instead, he grew up with his grandparents and became a fisherman.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt;

Hart discovered his passion for Haida art in high school. He began carving seriously in 1979. Hart first apprenticed with [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]] in 1978 to help construct a set of totem poles. From 1980 to 1984 he became an assistant to [[Bill Reid]] in [[Vancouver]], who by then was too seriously afflicted with [[Parkinson's disease]] to do much of his own carving. He began his work with Reid by putting the finishing details on ''The Raven and the First Man'', a centerpiece of the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]], and he also assisted on Reid's ''[[Spirit of Haida Gwaii|Spirit of Haida Gwaii / The Jade Canoe]]''.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/reid-controversy/|title=Reid controversy|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|first=Jane|last=O'Hara|date=April 28, 2003|accessdate=2014-08-16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart lives in both Vancouver and Haida Gwaii.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt; In Haida Gwaii, he is known as ˀIdansuu, a hereditary chief name that he received in 1999 after it had earlier been held by Charles Edenshaw.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vm"/&gt; As chief he belongs to the Hereditary Chiefs Council of the [[Council of the Haida Nation|Haida Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.haidanation.ca/Pages/governance/hereditarychiefs.html|title=Hereditary Chiefs Council|publisher=[[Council of the Haida Nation]]|accessdate=2014-08-16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Hart was the first Northwest Coast artist to use bronze, beginning in 1982, and he has also made works in silver and gold.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt; In 1988, he supervised the construction of the Haida house in the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/haida/haaat07e.shtml|title=Artists – rebirth: Jim Hart|publisher=[[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]|accessdate=2014-08-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 wood sculpture that Hart considers to be his equivalent of a [[doctoral thesis]], ''Frog Constellation'', depicts two people on the back of a giant frog; it was installed in 2012 on the campus of [[Simon Fraser University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Jim Hart Sculpture Celebrated at SFU|date=May 25, 2012|url=https://www.sfu.ca/brc/news/story/jim-hart-sculpture-celebrated-at-sfu.html|publisher=The Bill Reid Centre for Northwest Coast Art Studies, Simon Fraser University}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dance Screen'', a large wood carving that he began designing in 2009, was installed in 2012 as a temporary exhibit in the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/the_exhibitions/exhibit_hart.html|title=Past Exhibitions: James Hart: The Dance Screen (The Scream Too)|publisher=[[Vancouver Art Gallery]]|year=2012|accessdate=2014-08-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/haida-artist-jim-hart-raises-cedar-masterwork-in-vancouver-1.1379557|title=Haida artist Jim Hart raises cedar masterwork in Vancouver: Massive carving The Dance Screen goes on display at Vancouver Art Gallery|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=January 11, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Hart's works, a totem pole called the ''Respect to Bill Reid Pole'', is part of the outdoor Haida village at the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]].&lt;ref name="vm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/opening-date-set-for-bill-reid-gallery/article594483/|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|title=Opening date set for Bill Reid gallery|first=Marsha|last=Lederman|date=November 14, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A bronze sculpture by Hart, ''The Three Watchmen'', is part of the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], and is installed outside the gallery in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chief James Hart's bronze sculpture ''The Three Watchmen'' installed outside the NGC|publisher=[[National Gallery of Canada]]|date=November 10, 2011|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/about/1236.php}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Mumford was born in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Queens]], New York and graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/instadv/quest/cityascommunity.html |title=City As Community: The Life And Vision Of Lewis Mumford |first=Robert |last=Wojtowicz |journal=Quest |publisher=[[Old Dominion University]] |date=Jan 2001 |volume=4 |issue=1 |accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[City College of New York]] and [[The New School|The New School for Social Research]], but became ill with tuberculosis and never finished his degree. In 1918 he joined the navy to serve in World War I and was assigned as a radio electrician.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/mumfordl|title=Mumford, Lewis|last=Sorensen|first=Lee (ed)|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=Oct 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged in 1919 and became associate editor of ''[[The Dial]]'', an influential [[modernist]] literary journal. He later worked for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' where he wrote architectural criticism and commentary on urban issues.

Mumford's earliest books in the field of literary criticism have had a lasting impact on contemporary American literary criticism. ''The Golden Day'' contributed to a resurgence in scholarly research on the work of 1850s American [[transcendentalist]] authors and ''Herman Melville: A Study of His Life and Vision'' effectively launched a revival in the study of the work of [[Herman Melville]]. Soon after, with the book ''The Brown Decades'', he began to establish himself as an authority in American architecture and urban life, which he interpreted in a social context.

In his early writings on urban life, Mumford was optimistic about human abilities and wrote that the human race would use electricity and [[mass communication]] to build a better world for all humankind. He would later take a more pessimistic stance. His early architectural criticism also helped to bring wider public recognition to the work of [[Henry Hobson Richardson]], [[Louis Sullivan]] and Frank Lloyd Wright.

In 1963, Mumford received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=Oct 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mumford received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumford.albany.edu/mumford/chronology_lm.htm|title=Chronology of Mumford's Life|publisher=Lewis Mumford Center|accessdate=Oct 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Mumford was made an honorary [[British honours system|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE).&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; In 1976, he was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; In 1986, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;

He served as the architectural critic for ''The New Yorker'' magazine for over 30 years. His 1961 book, ''[[The City in History]]'', received the [[National Book Award]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nba1962/&gt;

Lewis Mumford died at the age of 94 at [[Lewis Mumford House|his home]] in [[Amenia (town), New York|Amenia, New York]] on January 26, 1990.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; Nine years later it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. His wife Sophia died in 1997, at age 97.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times 2 May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideas ==

In his book ''The Condition of Man'', published in 1944, Mumford characterized his orientation toward the study of humanity as "organic humanism".  The term is an important one because it sets limits on human possibilities, limits that are aligned with the nature of the human body. Mumford never forgot the importance of air quality, of food availability, of the quality of water, or the comfort of spaces, because all these things had to be respected if people were to thrive. Technology and progress could never become a runaway train in his reasoning, so long as organic humanism was there to act as a brake. Indeed, Mumford considered the human brain from this perspective, characterizing it as hyperactive, a good thing in that it allowed humanity to conquer many of nature's threats, but potentially a bad thing if it were not occupied in ways that stimulated it meaningfully. Mumford's respect for human "nature", that is to say, the natural characteristics of being human, provided him with a platform from which to assess technologies, and technics in general. Thus his criticism and counsel with respect to the city and with respect to the implementation of technology was fundamentally organized around the organic humanism to which he ascribed. It was from the perspective of organic humanism that Mumford eventually launched a critical assessment of [[Marshall McLuhan]], who argued that the technology, not the natural environment, would ultimately shape the nature of humankind, a possibility that Mumford recognized, but only as a nightmare scenario.

Mumford believed that what defined humanity, what set human beings apart from other animals, was not primarily our use of tools (technology) but our use of language (symbols). He was convinced that the sharing of information and ideas amongst participants of primitive societies was completely natural to early humanity, and had obviously been the foundation of society as it became more sophisticated and complex.  He had hopes for a continuation of this process of information "pooling" in the world as humanity moved into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mumford | first = Lewis| title = Enough Energy for Life &amp; The Next Transformation of Man [MIT lecture transcript] | journal = CoEvolution Quarterly| volume = 1| issue = 4| pages = 19–23| publisher = POINT Foundation | location = Sausalito, CA | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford's choice of the word "technics" throughout his work was deliberate. For Mumford, technology is one part of technics. Using the broader definition of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[:wikt:τέχνη#Ancient Greek|tekhne]]'', which means not only technology but also art, skill, and dexterity, technics refers to the interplay of social milieu and technological innovation—the "wishes, habits, ideas, goals" as well as "industrial processes" of a society. As Mumford writes at the beginning of ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'', "other civilizations reached a high degree of technical proficiency without, apparently, being profoundly influenced by the methods and aims of technics."

===Megatechnics===
In ''[[The Myth of the Machine]] Vol II: The Pentagon of Power'' (Chapter 12) (1970), Mumford [[Critique of technology|criticizes the modern trend of technology]], which emphasizes constant, unrestricted expansion, production, and replacement. He contends that these goals work against technical perfection, durability, social efficiency, and overall human satisfaction. Modern technology, which he called "megatechnics", fails to produce lasting, quality products by using devices such as consumer [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[installment plan|installment buying]], non-functioning and defective designs, [[planned obsolescence]], and frequent [[planned obsolescence (business)|superficial "fashion" changes]]. "Without constant enticement by advertising," he writes, "production would slow down and level off to normal replacement demand. Otherwise many products could reach a plateau of efficient design which would call for only minimal changes from year to year."

He uses his own [[refrigerator]] as an example, reporting that it "has been in service for nineteen years, with only a single minor repair: an admirable job. Both automatic refrigerators for daily use and deepfreeze preservation are inventions of permanent value. ... [O]ne can hardly doubt that if biotechnic criteria were heeded, rather than those of market analysts and fashion experts, an equally good product might come forth from Detroit, with an equally long prospect of continued use."

===Biotechnics===
[[File:Mumford3.jpg|thumb|Pentagon of Power picture and a quote from it.]]
Mumford was deeply concerned with the relationship between technics and bioviability.  The latter term, not used by Mumford, characterizes an area's capability to support life up through its levels of complexity.  Before the advent of technology, most areas of the planet were bioviable at some level or other; however, where certain forms of technology advance rapidly, bioviability decreases dramatically.  Slag heaps, poisoned waters, parking lots, and concrete cities, for example, are extremely limited in terms of their bioviability, illustrated in the somewhat startling 1943 novel title ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'', and non-bioviable regions are common to cinema in the form of dystopias (e.g., ''Bladerunner''). Mumford did not believe it was necessary for bioviability to collapse as technics advanced, however, because he held it was possible to create technologies that functioned in an ecologically responsible manner, and he called that sort of technology biotechnics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pentagon of Power'' p.395&lt;/ref&gt; Mumford believed that biotechnic consciousness (and possibly even community) was emerging as a later stage in the evolution of Darwinian thinking about the nature of human life. He believed this was the sort of technics needed to shake off the suicidal drive of "megatechnics." While Mumford recognized an ecological consciousness that traces back to the earliest communities, he regarded emerging biotechnics as a product of neo-Darwinian consciousness, as a post-industrial form of thinking, one that refuses to look away from the mutually-influencing relationship between the state of the living organism and the state of its environment. In Mumford's mind, the society organized around biotechnics would restrain its technology for the sake of that integral relationship.

In Mumford's understanding, the various technologies that arose in the megatechnic context have brought unintended and harmful side effects along with the obvious benefits they have bequeathed to us. He points out, for example, that the development of money (as a technology) created, as a side effect, a context for irrational accumulation of excess because it eliminated the burdensome aspects of object-wealth by making wealth abstract. In those eras when wealth was not abstract, plenitude had functioned as the organizing principle around its acquisition (i.e., wealth, measured in grains, lands, animals, to the point that one is satisfied, but not saddled with it). Money, which allows wealth to be conceived as pure quantity instead of quality, is an example of megatechnics, one which can spiral out of control. If Mumford is right in this conceptualization, historians and economists should be able to trace a relationship between the still-increasing abstraction of wealth and radical transformations with respect to wealth's distribution and role. And, indeed, it does appear that, alongside its many benefits, the movement toward electronic money has stimulated forms of economic stress and exploitation not yet fully understood and not yet come to their conclusion. A technology for distributing resources that was less given to abstract hoarding would be more suitable to a biotechnic conception of living.

Thus Mumford argued that the biotechnic society would not hold to the megatechnic delusion that technology must expand unceasingly, magnifying its own power and would shatter that delusion in order to create and preserve "livability." Rather than the megatechnic pursuit of power, the biotechnic society would pursue what Mumford calls "plenitude"; that is, a homeostatic relationship between resources and needs. This notion of plenitude becomes clearer if we suggest that the biotechnic society would relate to its technology in the manner an animal relates to available food–under circumstances of natural satisfaction, the pursuit of technological advance would not simply continue "for its own sake."

Alongside the limiting effect of satisfaction amidst plenitude, the pursuit of technological advance would also be limited by its potentially negative effects upon the organism. Thus, in a biotechnic society, the quality of air, the quality of food, the quality of water, these would all be significant concerns that could limit any technological ambitions threatening to them. The anticipated negative value of noise, radiation, smog, noxious chemicals, and other technical by-products would significantly constrain the introduction of new technical innovation. In Mumford's words, a biotechnic society would direct itself toward "qualitative richness, amplitude, spaciousness, and freedom from quantitative pressures and crowding. Self-regulation, self-correction, and self-propulsion are as much an integral property of organisms as nutrition, reproduction, growth, and repair." The biotechnic society would pursue balance, wholeness, and completeness; and this is what those individuals in pursuit of biotechnics would do as well.

Mumford's critique of the city and his vision of cities that are organized around the nature of human bodies, so essential to all Mumford's work on city life and urban design, is rooted in an incipient notion of biotechnics: "livability," a notion which Mumford got from his mentor, [[Patrick Geddes]].

Mumford used the term biotechnics in the later sections of ''The Pentagon of Power'', written in 1970. The term sits well alongside his early characterization of "organic humanism," in that biotechnics represent the concrete form of technique that appeals to an organic humanist. When Mumford described biotechnics, automotive and industrial pollution had become dominant technological concerns, along with the fear of nuclear annihilation. Mumford recognized, however, that technology had even earlier produced a plethora of hazards, and that it would do so into the future. For Mumford, human hazards are rooted in a power-oriented technology that does not adequately respect and accommodate the essential nature of humanity. Mumford is stating implicitly, as others would later state explicitly, that contemporary human life understood in its ecological sense is out of balance because the technical parts of its ecology (guns, bombs, cars, drugs) have spiraled out of control, driven by forces peculiar to them rather than constrained by the needs of the species that created them. He believed that biotechnics was the emerging answer and the only hope that could be set out against the problem of megatechnics.  It was an answer, he believed, that was already beginning to assert itself in his time.

It is true that Mumford's writing privileges the term "biotechnics" more than the "biotechnic society." The reason is clear in the last sentence of ''The Pentagon of Power'' where he writes, "for those of us who have thrown off the myth of the machine, the next move is ours: for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically, despite their rusty ancient hinges, as soon as we choose to walk out." Mumford believed that the biotechnic society was a desideratum—one that should guide his contemporaries as they walked out the doors of their megatechnic confines (he also calls them "coffins"). Thus he ends his narrative, as he well understood, at the beginning of another one: the possible revolution that gives rise to a biotechnic society, a quiet revolution, for Mumford, one that would arise from the biotechnic consciousness and actions of individuals. Mumford was an avid reader of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s philosophy of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., he published a critical review of [[Process and Reality]]: "Metaphysics and Art. Review of Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, by Alfred North Whitehead; Essays in Philosophy, edited by Thomas Vernor Smith and William Kelley Wright; The Philosophic Way of Life, by T.V. Smith." ''The New Republic'', December 18, 1929: 117–118, reprinted in Alan Van Wyk and [[Michel Weber]] (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279954/Creativity_and_Its_Discontents._The_Response_to_Whiteheads_Process_and_Reality Creativity and Its Discontents. The Response to Whitehead's Process and Reality]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2009, pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polytechnics versus monotechnics===
A key idea, introduced in ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' (1934) was that technology was twofold:
* ''Polytechnic'', which enlists many different modes of technology, providing a complex framework to solve human problems.
* ''Monotechnic'', which is technology only for its own sake, which oppresses humanity as it moves along its own trajectory.

Mumford commonly criticized modern America's transportation networks as being "monotechnic" in their reliance on cars. [[Automobile]]s become obstacles for other modes of transportation, such as [[walking]], bicycle and [[public transit]], because the roads they use consume so much space and are such a danger to people. Mumford explains that the thousands of maimed and dead each year as a result of automobile accidents are a "ritual sacrifice" the American society makes because of its extreme reliance on highway transport.

===Three epochs of civilization===
Also discussed at length in ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' is Mumford's division of human civilization into three distinct [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s (following concepts originated by Patrick Geddes):
:* ''Eotechnic'' (the [[middle ages]])
:* ''Paleotechnic'' (the time of the [[industrial revolution]]) and
:* ''Neotechnic'' (later, present-day)

===Megamachines===
Mumford also refers to large [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] organizations as ''megamachines''—a machine using humans as its components. These organizations characterize Mumford's [[stage theory]] of civilization. The most recent megamachine manifests itself, according to Mumford, in modern [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] [[nuclear powers]]—Mumford used the examples of the Soviet and United States power complexes represented by the [[Kremlin]] and [[the Pentagon]], respectively. The builders of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], the [[Roman Empire]] and the armies of the [[World War]]s are prior examples.

He explains that meticulous attention to accounting and standardization, and elevation of military leaders to divine status, are spontaneous features of megamachines throughout history. He cites such examples as the repetitive nature of Egyptian paintings which feature enlarged [[pharaoh]]s and public display of enlarged portraits of Communist leaders such as [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]. He also cites the overwhelming prevalence of quantitative accounting records among surviving historical fragments, from [[ancient Egypt]] to [[Nazi Germany]].

Necessary to the construction of these megamachines is an enormous [[bureaucracy]] of humans which act as "servo-units", working without ethical involvement. According to Mumford, technological improvements such as the [[assembly line]], or instant, global, [[wireless]], communication and [[remote control]], can easily weaken the perennial psychological barriers to certain types of questionable actions. An example which he uses is that of [[Adolf Eichmann]], the Nazi official who organized logistics in support of [[the Holocaust]]. Mumford collectively refers to people willing to carry out placidly the extreme goals of these megamachines as "Eichmanns".

===The clock as herald of the Industrial Revolution===

One of the better-known studies of Mumford is of the way the [[Clock#Early mechanical clocks|mechanical clock]] was developed by monks in the [[Middle Ages]] and subsequently adopted by the rest of society. He viewed this device as the key invention of the whole [[Industrial Revolution]], contrary to the common view of the [[steam engine]] holding the prime position, writing: "The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age. ... The clock ... is a piece of power-machinery whose 'product' is seconds and minutes ...."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis. ''Technics and Civilization''. London: Routledge, 1934. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban civilization===
''[[The City in History]]'' won the 1962 U.S. [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref name=nba1962&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1962 "National Book Awards – 1962"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In this influential book Mumford explored the development of urban civilizations. Harshly critical of [[urban sprawl]], Mumford argues that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in western society. While [[pessimist]]ic in tone, Mumford argues that [[urban planning]] should emphasize an organic relationship between people and their living spaces.

Mumford uses the example of the medieval city as the basis for the "ideal city," and claims that the modern city is too close to the Roman city (the sprawling megalopolis) which ended in collapse; if the modern city carries on in the same vein, Mumford argues, then it will meet the same fate as the Roman city.

Mumford wrote critically of [[urban culture]] believing the city is "a product of earth ... a fact of nature ... man's method of expression."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, ''The Culture of Cities,'' 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Mumford recognized the crises facing urban culture, distrustful of the growing finance industry, political structures, fearful that a local community culture was not being fostered by these institutions. Mumford feared "metropolitan finance," urbanisation, politics, and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Mumford wrote: "The physical design of cities and their economic functions are secondary to their relationship to the natural environment and to the spiritual values of human community."&lt;ref&gt;City Reader
 edited by Richard T. LeGates, Frederic Stout, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suburbs====
Suburbia did not escape Mumford's criticism either:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the suburb one might live and die without marring the image of an innocent world, except when some shadow of evil fell over a column in the newspaper. Thus the suburb served as an asylum for the preservation of illusion. Here domesticity could prosper, oblivious of the pervasive regimentation beyond. This was not merely a child-centered environment; it was based on a childish view of the world, in which reality was sacrificed to the pleasure principle.&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis.  ''The City in History: Its Origins, Its Transformations, and Its Prospects'' (New York, 1961), p.464; quoted in {{cite crabgrass}}, pp.155–156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Religion and Spirituality ===
Mumford is also among the first urban planning scholars who paid serious attention to religion in the planning field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manouchehrifar|first=Babak|date=2018-11-08|title=Is Planning 'Secular'?

&lt;blockquote&gt;The segregation of the spiritual life from the practical life is a curse that falls impartially upon both sides of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/246342365|title=Faith for living|last=1895-1990.|first=Mumford, Lewis,|date=1940|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|oclc=246342365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence ==

Mumford's interest in the history of technology and his explanation of  "polytechnics", along with his general philosophical bent, has been an important influence on a number of more recent thinkers concerned that technology serve human beings as broadly and well as possible. Some of these authors—such as [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Witold Rybczynski]], [[Richard Gregg (social philosopher)|Richard Gregg]],&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Richard. ''The Value of Voluntary Simplicity''. Pendle Hill, 1936, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amory Lovins]], [[J. Baldwin]], [[E. F. Schumacher]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], and [[Colin Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Colin. ''Influences: Voices of Creative Dissent''. Green Books, 1991, pp. 106–07.&lt;/ref&gt;—have been intellectuals and persons directly involved with technological development and decisions about the use of technology.

Mumford also had an influence on the American environmental movement, with thinkers like [[Barry Commoner]] and Bookchin being influenced by his ideas on cities, ecology and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Derek. ''Green History'', Routledge, 1994, pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramachandra Guha]] noted his work contains "some of the earliest and finest thinking on [[bioregionalism]], anti-nuclearism, [[biodiversity]], alternate energy paths, ecological urban planning and appropriate technology."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guha, Ramachandra &amp; Martinez-Alier, J. (1997) ''Varieties of Environmentalism: Essays North and South''. London: Earthscan (1997). For other works on Mumford's ecological and environmental thought, see: David Pepper ''Modern Environmentalism'', Routledge, 1996; Max Nicolson, ''The New Environmental Age'', Cambridge University Press, 1989; and BA Minteer, ''The Landscape of Reform: Civic Pragmatism and Environmental Thought in America'' MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford's influence is also evident in the work of some artists including [[Berenice Abbott]]'s photographs of New York City in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Peter. "Becoming Documentary: Berenice Abbott's Photographs, 1925–1939," PhD dissertation, Boston University, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford was an inspiration for [[Ellsworth Toohey]], the antagonist in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Walter (1998). "[http://reason.com/archives/1998/02/01/the-writerly-rand The Writerly Rand]", Reason.com, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Bird''' was born Mary Edith Bird (pronounced Marie) on 24 August 1891 in [[Pietermaritzburg]], [[Colony of Natal|South Africa]] and died in the village where she lived for most of her life, [[Westerham]], Kent, England on 25 August 1979, aged 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=%2BZgk1ES2LzmVWGvKhGthBg&amp;scan=1 |title=FreeBMD Entry Info |website=Freebmd.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She is a descendant of [[Francis Bird]] the sculptor and Colonel Christopher Bird who was Colonial Secretary at Cape Town Castle (who has a famous landmark named after him in [[Kirstenbosch]], South Africa – Colonel Bird's Bath).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanbi.org/gardens/kirstenbosch/virtualtour/kirstenbosch-nbg-colonel-birds-bath |title=Kirstenbosch NBG: Colonel Bird's Bath |website=SANBI.org |date=2015-05-26 |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother brought her children from South Africa to the UK to be educated and Maria attended a Scottish convent. Following school, she studied the [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics]] music and dance method under [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]] in Dessau.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Transcript from interview with Maria Bird's nephew&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Bird helped found BBC Children's Television with her collaborator and partner [[Freda Lingstrom]] with whom she set up Westerham Arts, the production company commissioned by the BBC to produce TV pieces including ''[[The Woodentops (TV series)|The Woodentops]]'' (1955), ''[[Flower Pot Men|Bill and Ben the Flower Pot Men]]'' (1952) and ''[[Andy Pandy]]'' (1950).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10023798/Andy-Pandy-is-almost-deviant.html Andy Pandy is almost deviant], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 29 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Westerham Arts was based in Chartwell Cottage (owned by Bird and Lingstom and subsequently bequeathed to the National Trust). It neighbours the [[Chartwell]] Estate. Maria and Freda built a shed in their garden where their puppet films were made.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
In addition to TV production she was a writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/series/85481-andy-pandy |title=Andy Pandy series by Maria Bird |website=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; narrator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEfnJBArxGg |title=Andy Pandy (Episode 1) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/443746/index.html |title=BFI Screenonline: Woodentops, The (1955–57) |website=Screenonline.org.uk |date=1955-09-09 |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas from '''[[Mathematics]]''' have been used as inspiration for '''[[fiber art]]s''' including [[quilt]] [[quilting|making]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]] and [[weaving]]. A wide range of mathematical concepts have been used as inspiration including [[topology]], [[graph theory]], [[number theory]] and [[algebra]]. Some techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]] are naturally [[geometry|geometrical]]; other kinds of [[textile]] provide a ready means for the colorful [[mathematics and art|physical expression of mathematical concepts]].

==Quilting==
{{main|quilt}}

The [[IEEE Spectrum]] has organized a number of competitions on [[quilt block]] design, and several books have been published on the subject. Notable quiltmakers include Diana Venters and Elaine Ellison, who have written a book on the subject ''Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required''. Examples of mathematical ideas used in the book as the basis of a quilt include the [[golden rectangle]], [[conic section]]s, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s Claw, the [[Koch curve]], the [[Clifford torus]], [[San Gaku]], [[Lorenzo Mascheroni|Mascheroni]]'s [[cardioid]], [[Pythagorean triple]]s, [[spidron]]s, and the six [[trigonometric functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ellison | first1=Elaine | last2=Venters | first2=Diana | isbn=1-55953-317-X | publisher=Key Curriculum | title=Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required | year=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitting and crochet==
[[Image:Cross stitch embroidery.jpg|thumb|[[Cross-stitch]] [[counted-thread embroidery]]]]

Knitted mathematical objects include the [[Platonic solid]]s, [[Klein bottle]]s and [[Boy's surface]].
The [[Lorenz attractor|Lorenz manifold]] and the [[Hyperbolic manifold|hyperbolic plane]] have been crafted using crochet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Henderson | first1 = David | last2 = Taimina | first2 = Daina | author2-link = Daina Taimina | doi = 10.1007/BF03026623 | issue = 2 | journal = [[Mathematical Intelligencer]]

Embroidery techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]]&lt;ref&gt;Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance. ''World Textiles'', Little, Brown, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[cross-stitch]] and some [[canvas work]] methods such as [[Bargello (needlework)]] make use of the natural [[pixel]]s of the weave, lending themselves to geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Barbara.

==Weaving==

[[Ada Dietz]] (1882 &amp;ndash; 1950) was an American [[weaving|weaver]] best known for her 1949 monograph ''Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles'', which defines weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate [[polynomial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Dietz | first = Ada K. | location = Louisville, Kentucky

[[Margaret Greig]] was a mathematician who articulated the mathematics of [[worsted spinning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=International Women in Science |author=Catharine M. C. Haines |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2001 |isbn=9781576070901 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion design==

The silk scarves from DMCK Designs' 2013 collection are all based on Douglas McKenna's [[space-filling curve]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space-Filling Curves|url=https://dmck.us/the-company/space-filling-curves/|publisher=DMCK|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs are either generalized Peano curves, or based on a new space-filling construction technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=McKenna, Douglas |title=The 7 Curve, Carpets, Quilts, and Other Asymmetric, Square-Filling, Threaded Tile Designs |work=Bridges Donostia: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture |url=http://www.bridgesmathart.org/2007/2007-program.html |publisher=The Bridges Organization | date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McKenna |first1=Douglas |title=Designing Symmetric Peano Curve Tiling Patterns with Escher-esque Foreground/Background Ambiguity |work=Bridges Leeuwarden: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture |url=http://www.bridgesmathart.org/2008/Schedule_V9-1.pdf |publisher=The Bridges Organization |accessdate=15 May 2015|date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Issey Miyake]] Fall-Winter 2010–2011 ready-to-wear collection featured designs from a collaboration between fashion designer Dai Fujiwara and mathematician [[William Thurston]]. The designs were inspired by Thurston's [[geometrization conjecture]], the statement that every [[3-manifold]] can be decomposed into pieces with one of eight different uniform geometries, a proof of which had been sketched in 2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]] as part of his proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Barchfield | first = Jenny | date = March 5, 2010 | publisher = [[ABC News]] | title = Fashion and Advanced Mathematics Meet at Miyake | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10017982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Nomoli''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|m|oʊ|l|iː}}) is a carved stone figurine native to [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://africa.si.edu/collections/view/objects/asitem/People$00401633/2/title-asc?t:state:flow=3d318f72-8617-4bde-ba1f-b19ed158e54b |title=National Museum of African Art |website=africa.si.edu |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually made of [[soapstone]], [[limestone]] or [[granite]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=628044&amp;partId=1 |title=nomoli figure |website=British Museum |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Nomoli figurines are among the earliest works of art from [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name="Emory"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carlos.emory.edu/exhibits/show/home/item/8011 |title=Figure, Pomdo or Nomoli · Michael C. Carlos Museum Collections Online |website=carlos.emory.edu |language=en-US |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nomoli figurines and similar stone sculptures are the only known remains of an empire that existed hundreds of years ago in what is [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]] today.

Nomoli figurines are often associated with the [[Mende people|Mende]] people as they are often buried on [[Mende people|Mende]] land. They are used as oracles and for protection.&lt;ref name="Emory" /&gt;

Portuguese explorers recorded the presence of the figurines already in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; 

The Mende and [[Kissi people]] of Sierra Leone put these small statues near their homes and in fields of crops for protection and increased vegetation, as they believe the Nomoli figurines will give them good health, good harvest, and meals to eat.&lt;ref name="Emory" /&gt; 

During the 20th century, Sierra Leonean immigrants brought their [[ancestor]]’s Nomoli figurines with them to the United States as a way to preserve the spiritual powers of the past.

== Characteristics and description ==
Along the coastal region, Nomoli figurines are often carved into a crouching stance with a small object in its hands. Most Nomoli figurines are made out of [[soapstone]], [[limestone]], steatite, and in some cases, [[granite]]. 

Their heads are oblong shaped. Nomoli figurines buried deeper underground tend to be more well preserved than the ones discovered just beneath the surface of the earth.

A '''novelist''' is an [[author]] or [[writer]] of [[novel]]s, though often novelists also write in other [[genre]]s of both [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]. Some novelists are professional novelists, thus make a [[living wage|living]] writing novels and other fiction, while others aspire to support themselves in this way or write as an [[avocation]]. Most novelists struggle to get their [[debut novel]] published, but once published they often continue to be published, although very few become literary celebrities, thus gaining prestige or a considerable income from their work.

Novelists come from a variety of backgrounds and social classes, and frequently this shapes the content of their works. [[Audience reception|Public reception of a novelist's work]], the [[literary criticism]] commenting on it, and the novelists' incorporation of their own experiences into works and characters can lead to the author's personal life and identity being associated with a novel's fictional content. For this reason, the environment within which a novelist works and the reception of their novels by both the public and publishers can be influenced by their demographics or identity; important among these [[Cultural identity|culturally constructed identities]] are [[gender]], [[sexual identity]], [[social class]], [[Race (human classification)|race]] or [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[Religious identity|religion]], and [[place-based identity|an association with place]]. Similarly, some novelists have creative identities derived from their focus on different [[genres of fiction]], such as [[crime novel|crime]], [[romance novel|romance]] or [[historical novel]]s.

While many novelists compose fiction to satisfy personal desires, novelists and commentators often ascribe a particular social responsibility or role to novel writers. Many authors use such moral imperatives to justify different approaches to novel writing, including activism or different approaches to representing reality "truthfully".

==Etymology==
{{see also|Novel#Etymology}}
Novelist is a term derivative from the term "novel"  describing the "writer of novels". The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] recognizes other definitions of novelist, first appearing in the 16th and 17th centuries to refer to either "An innovator (in thought or belief); someone who introduces something new or who favours novelty" or "An inexperienced person; a novice."&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; However, the [[OED]] attributes the primary contemporary meaning of "a writer of novels" as first appearing in the 1633 book "{{not a typo|East-India Colation}}" by C. Farewell citing the passage {{not a typo|"It beeing a pleasant observation (at a distance) to note the order of their Coaches and Carriages..As if (presented to a Novelist) it had bin the spoyles of a Tryumph leading Captive, or a preparation to some sad Execution"}}&lt;ref name = OED&gt;{{cite web| title = novelist, n.| work = OED Online| date = December 2013| publisher = Oxford University Press| accessdate = 11 February 2014 | url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/128768?redirectedFrom=Novelist&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Google Ngrams, the term novelist first appears in the Google Books database in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Novelist&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CNovelist%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bnovelist%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BNovelist%3B%2Cc0 | title = Google Ngrams "Novelist" 1680-2014|accessdate = February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process, publication and profession==
{{further|Self-publishing|Author#Relationship between author and publisher}}
[[File:TheFaulknerPortable.jpg|thumb|250px|William Faulkner's [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood]] Universal Portable typewriter in his office at [[Rowan Oak]], which is now maintained by the [[University of Mississippi]] in [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]] as a museum]]
The difference between professional and amateur novelists often is the author's ability to publish. Many people take up novel writing as a hobby, but the difficulties of completing large scale fictional works of quality prevent the completion of novels. Once authors have completed a novel, they often will try to get it published. The publishing industry requires novels to have accessible profitable markets, thus many novelists will [[self-publish]] to circumvent the editorial control of publishers. [[Self-publishing]] has long been an option for writers, with [[vanity press]]es printing bound books for a fee paid by the writer. In these settings, unlike the more traditional publishing industry, activities usually reserved for a publishing house, like the distribution and promotion of the book, become the author's responsibility. The rise of the Internet and [[electronic book]]s has made self publishing far less expensive and a realistic way for authors to realize income.

Novelists apply a number of different methods to writing their novels, relying on a variety of approaches to inspire creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = Alexandra |last = Alter | issn = 0099-9660
| title = How to Write a Great Novel | work = Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2014-02-15 | date = 2009-11-13 | url = https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703740004574513463106012106
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communities actively encourage amateurs to practice writing novels to develop these unique practices, that vary from author to author. For example, the internet-based group, [[National Novel Writing Month]], encourages people to write 50,000-word novels in the month of November, to give novelists practice completing such works. In the  2010 event, over 200,000 people took part – writing a total of over 2.8 billion words.&lt;ref name="2010stats"&gt;{{cite web|author=Grant, Lindsey |url=http://blog.lettersandlight.org/post/2068578620/the-great-nanowrimo-stats-party |title=The Office of Letters and Light Blog – The Great NaNoWriMo Stats Party |publisher=Blog.lettersandlight.org |date=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age and experience===
{{further|debut novel|juvenilia}}

Novelists don't usually publish their [[first novels]] until later in life. However, many novelists begin writing at a young age. For example, [[Iain Banks]] (1954-2013) began writing at eleven, and at sixteen completed his first novel, "The Hungarian Lift-Jet", about international arms dealers, "in pencil in a larger-than-foolscap log book".&lt;ref&gt;"Doing the Business: Iain Banks", ''The Guardian'', Saturday 7 August 1999. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/aug/07/fiction.iainbanks]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was thirty before he published his first novel, the highly controversial ''[[The Wasp Factory]]'' in 1984. The success of this novel enabled Banks to become a full-time novelist. Often an important writers' [[juvenilia]], even if not published, is prized by scholars because it provides insight into an author's biography and approach to writing; for example, the [[Brontë family]]'s juvenilia that depicts their imaginary world of [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]], currently in the [[British Library]], has provided important information on their development as writers.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brontë Encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|editor1-last=Bernard|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Bernard|editor2-first=Louise|pages=126–127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0NZUTJ_Em8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= GondalPoems&gt;{{cite book|title= Gondal Poems | first = Emily Jane | last = Brontë |year= 1938|publisher= The Shakespeare Head Press| location= Oxford | pages= 5–8|editor= Helen Brown and Joan Mott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= BLPressRelease&gt;{{citation | url= http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/Press-Releases/The-Bront%C3%ABs-secret-science-fiction-stories-4e7.aspx |date=11 May 2011 |title=The Brontës’ secret science fiction stories |publisher=[[British Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, novelists publish as early as their teens. For example, [[Patrick O'Brian]] published his first novel, ''[[Caesar: The Life Story of a Panda-Leopard]]'', at the age of 15, which brought him considerable critical attention.&lt;ref name=kinglrev&gt;{{cite book |title=Patrick O'Brian:A life revealed |last=King |first=Dean |authorlink=Dean King |year=2000 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |location=London |isbn= 0-340-79255-8 |page =50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Barbara Newhall Follett]]'s  ''The House Without Windows'', was accepted and published in 1927 when she was 13 by the [[Alfred A.

For example, though [[Christopher Paolini]]'s ''[[Eragon]]'' (published at age 15), was not a great critical success, but its popularity among readers placed it on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Children's Books Best Seller list]] for 121 weeks.&lt;ref name="bestchildren1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/books/bestseller/0106bestchildren.html |title=New York Times Best Seller List|date=2008-01-06|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-time novelists of any age often find themselves unable to get works published, because of a number of reasons reflecting the inexperience of the author and the economic realities of publishers. Often authors must find advocates in the publishing industry, usually [[literary agents]], to successfully publish their [[debut novel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/10/08/224084404/first-novels-the-romance-of-agents| title =First Novels: The Romance Of Agents| first =Martha| last = Woodroof| publisher = NPR| work = Monkey See|date = October 8, 2013| accessdate = October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes new novelists will [[self-publish]], because publishing houses will not risk the capital needed to market books by an unknown author to the public.&lt;ref name = independent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-big-question-what-should-you-do-if-you-want-to-get-your-first-novel-published-768098.html |title=The Big Question: What should you do if you want to get your first novel published? - Features, Books |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kapur |first=Niraj |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/jan/26/howtosellyourfirstnovel |title=How to sell your debut novel &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the difficulty of successfully writing and publishing first novels, especially at a young age, there are a number of awards for young and first time novelists to highlight exceptional works from new and/or young authors (for examples see [[:Category:Literary awards honouring young writers]] and [[:Category:First book awards]]).

===Income===
[[File:James Patterson.jpg|thumb|Novelist [[James Patterson]], one of the most monetarily successful contemporary novelists, who made $70 million in 2010]]
In contemporary British and American publishing markets, most authors receive only a small monetary advance before publication of their debut novel; in the rare exceptions when a large print run and high volume of sales are anticipated, the advance can be larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kellaway, Kate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/25/fiction.features7 | title=Kate Kellaway: That difficult first novel &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; |work=[[The Observer]] | date=25 March 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once an author has established themselves in print, some authors can make steady income as long as they remain productive as writers. Additionally, many novelists, even published ones, will take on outside work, such as [[Creative writing#Creative writing in academia|teaching creative writing in academic institutions]], or leave novel writing as a secondary hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.themillions.com/2009/10/working-the-double-shift.html| title = Working the Double Shift| first = Emily | last = St. John Mandel| date = October 6, 2009| accessdate = February 15, 2014|work = The Millions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Wayne&gt;{{Cite web | title = The agony of the male novelist |first = Teddy |last = Wayne |date = Jan 18, 2012 &lt;!-- 07:00 PM CST --&gt;  | accessdate = 2014-02-19 | url = http://www.salon.com/2012/01/19/the_agony_of_the_male_novelist/ |journal = Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few novelist become literary celebrities or become very wealthy from sale of their novels alone. Often those authors who are wealthy and successful will produce extremely popular genre fiction. Examples include authors like [[James Patterson]], who was the highest paid author in 2010, making 70 million dollars, topping both other novelists and authors of non-fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Forbes| url = https://www.forbes.com/2010/08/19/patterson-meyer-king-business-media-highest-paid-authors.html| title = The Highest-Paid Authors| first = Dirk| last = Smillie| date = 2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous literary millionaires include popular successes like [[J.

}}
The personal experiences of the novelist will often shape what they write and how readers and critics will interpret their novels. Literary reception has long relied on practices of reading literature through [[biographical criticism]], in which the author's life is presumed to have influence on the topical and thematic concerns of works.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Criticism", ''Writing essays about literature: a guide and style sheet'' (2004), Kelley Griffith, University of North Carolina at Greensborough, Wadsworth Publishing Company , pages 177-178, 400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25111810 Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism]" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; Some veins of criticism use this information about the novelist to derive an understanding of the [[Authorial intent|novelist's intentions]] within his work. However, postmodern literary critics often denounce such an approach; the most notable of these critiques comes from [[Roland Barthes]] who argues in his essay "[[Death of the Author]]" that the author no longer should dictate the reception and meaning derived from their work.

Other, theoretical approaches to [[literary criticism]] attempt to explore the author's unintentional influence over their work; methods like [[psychoanalytic theory]] or [[cultural studies]], presume that the work produced by a novelist represents [[Identity (social science)|fundamental parts of the author's identity]]. [[Milan Kundera]] describes the tensions between the novelist's own identity and the work that the author produces in his essay in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' titled "What is a novelist?"; he says that the novelist's "honesty is bound to the vile stake of his megalomania [...]The work is not simply everything a novelist writes-notebooks, diaries, articles. It is the end result of long labor on an aesthetic project[...]The novelist is the sole master of his work. He is his work."&lt;ref name = Kundera&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kundera| first = Milan| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/09/what-is-a-novelist|title = What is a Novelist? |date = October 9, 2006| accessdate = January 8, 2014|journal = [[The New Yorker]] (Life and Letters section) - subscriber only}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close intimacy of identity with the novelist's work ensures that particular elements, whether for class, gender, sexuality, nationality, race, or place-based identity, will influence the reception of their work.

===Socio-economic class===
{{further|Social novel|Proletarian literature}}

Historically, because of the amount of leisure time and education required to write novels, most novelists have come from the upper or the educated middle classes. However, working men and women began publishing novels in the twentieth century. This includes in Britain [[Walter Greenwood]]'s ''[[Love on the Dole]]'' (1933), from America [[B. Traven]]'s, ''[[The Death Ship]]'' (1926) and [[Agnes Smedley]], ''[[Daughter of Earth]]'' (1929) and from the Soviet Union [[Nikolay Ostrovsky]]'s ''[[How the Steel Was Tempered]]'' (1932). Later, in 1950s Britain, came a group of writers known as the "[[Angry young men]]," which included the novelists [[Alan Sillitoe]] and [[Kingsley Amis]], who came from the working class and who wrote about [[working class culture]].&lt;ref name=nytimesobit&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/books/26sillitoe.html|title=Alan Sillitoe, 'Angry' British Author, Dies at 82|accessdate=5 June 2013|date=26 April 2010|author=Bruce Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/20807/Sir-Kingsley-Amis| work = Encyclopædia Britannica Online| title =Sir Kingsley Amis| accessdate = 5 Feb 2014| date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some novelists deliberately write for a working class audience for political ends, profiling "the working classes and working-class life; perhaps with the intention of making propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon; ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Criticism''. (London: Penguin Books, 1999) p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; Such literature, sometimes called [[proletarian literature]], maybe associated with the political agendas of the [[Communist party]] or left wing sympathizers, and seen as a "device of revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica."Novel." Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British tradition of working class literature, unlike the Russian and American, was not especially inspired by the Communist Party, but had its roots in the [[Chartist movement]], and [[socialism]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hayward, ''Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to ''Trainspotting''. (London: Northcote House, 1997), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===National or place-based identity===
{{see also|National literature}}
Novelists are often classified by their national affiliation, suggesting that novels take on a particular character based on the national identity of the authors. In some literature, national identity shapes the self-definition of many novelists. For example, in [[American literature]], many novelists set out to create the "[[Great American Novel]]", or a novel that defines the American experience in their time. Other novelists engage politically or socially with the identity of other members of their nationality, and thus help define that national identity. For instance, critic Nicola Minott-Ahl describes Victor Hugo's ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' directly helping in the creation of French political and social identity in mid-nineteenth century France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Minott-Ahl| first = Nicola| title =Nation/Building: Hugo’s ''Notre-Dame de Paris''; and the Novelist as Post-Revolutionary Historian|journal = Partial Answers: Journal of Literature and the History of Ideas | volume = 10| number = 2 | year = 2012 | pages = 251–271| doi = 10.1353/pan.2012.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some novelists become intimately linked with a particular place or geographic region and therefore receive a [[Place identity|place-based identity]]. In his discussion of the history of the association of particular novelists with place in [[British literature]], critic D. C. D. Pocock, described the sense of place not developing in that canon until a century after the novel form first solidified at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/622292 | issn = 0020-2754 | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 337–347 | last = Pocock | first = D. C. D. | title = Place and the Novelist | journal = Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers | date = 1981-01-01 | jstor = 622292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often such [[British regional literature]] captures the social and local  character of a particular region in Britain, focussing on specific features, such as dialect, customs, history, and landscape (also called [[British regional literature|local colour]]): "Such a locale is likely to be rural and/or provincial."&lt;ref&gt;J.A Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984, p.560.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hardy]]'s (1840-1928) novels can be described as regional because of the way he makes use of these elements in relation to a part of the West of England, that he names [[Wessex]]. Other British writers that have been characterized as regional novelists, are the [[Brontë sisters]], and writers like [[Mary Webb]] (1881-1927), [[Margiad Evans]] (1909–58) and [[Geraint Goodwin]] (1903–42), who are associate with the [[Welsh border]] region. [[George Eliot]] (1801–86) on the other hand is particularly associated with the rural English Midlands, whereas [[Arnold Bennett]] (1867–1931) is the novelist of the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] in [[Staffordshire]], or the "[[Five Towns]]", (actually six) that now make-up [[Stoke-on-Trent]]. Similarly, novelist and poet [[Walter Scott]]'s (1771-1832) contribution in creating a unified identity for [[Scotland]] and were some of the most popular in all of Europe during the subsequent century. Scott's novels were influential in recreating a Scottish identity that the upper-class British society could embrace.

In American fiction, the concept of [[American literary regionalism]] ensures that many genres of novel associated with particular regions often define the reception of the novelists. For example, in writing [[Western novels]], [[Zane Grey]] has been described as a "place-defining novelist", credited for defining the western frontier in America consciousness at the beginning of the 20th century while becoming linked as an individual to his depiction of that space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| jstor=216063| title = Zane Grey and Images of the American West| first =Kevin S.| last = Blake| journal =Geographical Review| volume = 85| number = 2| date =April 1995| pages = 202–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, novelist such as [[Mark Twain]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Eudora Welty]], and [[Flannery O'Connor]] are often describe as writing within a particular tradition of [[Southern literature]], in which subject matter relevant to the South is associated with their own identities as authors. For example, William Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in [[Yoknapatawpha County]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-bio.html The Nobel Prize in Literature 1949: Biography] ''Nobelprize.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on, and nearly geographically identical to, Lafayette County, of which his hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996, p.346.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the geographical component of Southern literature, certain themes have appeared because of the similar histories of the Southern states in regard to [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], the [[American Civil War]], and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The [[conservative]] culture in the South has also produced a strong focus by novelists from there on the significance of family, religion, community, the use of the [[Southern American English|Southern dialect]], along with a strong sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;
Kate Cochran, review of ''Remapping Southern Literature: Contemporary Southern Writers and the West'' by Robert H. Brinkmeyer. ''College Literature'' Vol. 29, No. 2 (Spring, 2002), pp. 169-171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southern United States|The South]]'s troubled history with [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] issues has also continually concerned its novelists.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Hobson. ''But Now I See: The White Southern Racial Conversion Narrative'', Louisiana State University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latin America]] a literary movement called [[Criollismo]] or costumbrismo was active from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, which is considered equivalent to American literary regionalism. It used a realist style to portray the scenes, language, customs and manners of the country the writer was from, especially the lower and peasant classes, ''criollismo'' led to an original literature based on the continent's natural elements, mostly epic and foundational. It was strongly influenced by the wars of independence from [[Spain]] and also denotes how each country in its own way defines ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'', which in [[Latin America]] refers to locally-born people of Spanish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/index.asp?id_ut=elcriollismo  Criollismo] www.memoriachilena.cl Dirección de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos Copyright 2013© MEMORIA CHILENA ®.

===Gender and sexuality===
{{further|Feminist literary criticism|Women's writing in English}}
Novelists often will be assessed in contemporary criticism based on their gender or treatment of gender. Largely, this has to do with the dominance of men in the publishing situation. [[Literary criticism]], especially since the rise of [[feminist theory]], pays attention to how women, historically, have experienced a very different set of writing expectations based on their gender; for example, the editors of ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'' point out: "Their texts emerge from and intervene in conditions usually very different from those which produced most writing by men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editors = Blain, Virginia, Isobel Grundy, and Patricia Clements, | title = The Feminist Companion to Literature in English| location = New Haven and London| publisher = Yale University Press| date = 1990| pages = viii-ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a question of the subject matter or political stance of a particular author, but of her [[gender]]: her position as a woman within the literary marketplace. However,  the publishing market's orientation to favor the primary reading audience of women may increasingly skew the market towards female novelists; for this reason, novelist [[Teddy Wayne]] argued in a 2012 ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' article titled "The agony of the male novelist" that midlist male novelists are less likely to find success than midlist female novelist, even though men tend to dominate "literary fiction" spaces.&lt;ref name = Wayne/&gt;

The position of women in the literary marketplace can change public conversation about novelists and their place within popular culture, leading to debates over sexism. For example, in 2013, American female novelist [[Amanda Filipacchi]] wrote a New York Times editorial challenging Wikipedia's categorization of American female novelists [[:Category:American women novelists|within a distinct category]], which precipitated a significant amount of press coverage describing  that Wikipedia's approach to categorization as sexism. For her, the public representation of women novelists within another category marginalizes and defines women novelists like herself outside of a field of "American novelists" dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.npr.org/2013/04/29/179850435/what-s-in-a-category-women-novelists-spark-wiki-controversy | title = What's In A Category? 'Women Novelists' Sparks Wiki-Controversy| first = Lynn| last = Neary| date = April 29, 2013| publisher = NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other commentators, discussing the controversy also note that by removing such categories as "Women novelist" or "Lesbian writer" from the description of gendered or sexual minorities, the discover-ability of those authors plummet for other people who share that identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Is Wikipedia's "American Women Novelists" Category Horribly Sexist? Some people seem to thinks so| author = S.E. Smith| publisher = XO Jane| date = April 26, 2013 | accessdate = February 8, 2013|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/in-support-of-an-american-women-novelists-category-on-wikipedia&amp;rct=j&amp;frm=1&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=ZVbTVJTUFI-B8QWz_4L4BQ&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFpC7aeGtKuSJak2SAYytNeIIvlFw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, because of the conversations brought by feminism, examinations of masculine subjects and an author's performance of "maleness" are prominent in critical studies of novels. For example, some academics studying [[Victorian fiction]] spend considerable time examining how masculinity shapes and effects the works, because of its prominence within fiction from the Victorian period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Andrew | last = Dowling| title = Manliness and the Male Novelist in Victorian Literature| publisher =Ashgate Press| year = 2001|isbn = 9780754603801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of novelists by genre}}
Some novelists are categorized by the primary genres of production, sometimes marginalizing the works by authors within the marketplace.
----&gt;

==Genre==
{{further|literary merit|literary fiction|genre fiction}}
Traditionally, the publishing industry has distinguished between "[[literary fiction]]", works lauded as achieving greater [[literary merit]], and "[[genre fiction]]", novels written within the expectations of genres and published as consumer products.&lt;ref name = KWright/&gt; Thus, many novelists become slotted as writers of one or the other.&lt;ref name = KWright/&gt; Novelist [[Kim Wright]], however, notes that both publishers and traditional literary novelist are turning towards genre fiction because of their potential for financial success and their increasingly positive reception amongst critics.&lt;ref name =KWright/&gt; Wright gives examples of authors like [[Justin Cronin]], [[Tom Perrotta]] and [[Colson Whitehead]] all making that transition.&lt;ref name = KWright/&gt;

However, publishing genre novels does not always allow novelist to continue writing outside the genre or within their own interests. In describing the place within the industry, novelist [[Kim Wright]] says that many authors, especially authors who usually write literary fiction, worry about "the danger that genre is a cul-de-sac" where publishers will only publish similar genre fiction from that author because of reader expectations,"and that once a writer turns into it, he’ll never get out."&lt;ref name =KWright&gt;{{cite news| title = Why Are So Many Literary Writers Shifting into Genre?| first = Kim| last = Wright|  work = The Millions| url = http://www.themillions.com/2011/09/why-are-so-many-literary-writers-shifting-into-genre.html| date =September 2, 2011|accessdate = February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, very few authors start in genre fiction and move to more "literary" publications; Wright describes novelists like [[Stephen King]] as the exception rather than the norm.&lt;ref name = KWright/&gt; Other critics and writers defending the merits of genre fiction often point towards King as an example of bridging the gap between popular genres and literary merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Erik|title=Stephen King: You can be popular and good |url = http://www.salon.com/2012/07/06/stephen_king_you_can_be_popular_and_good/ |work=Salon | accessdate = 11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=A Defense of Stephen King, Master of the Decisive Moment |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/a-defense-of-stephen-king-master-of-the-decisive-moment/260187/ |work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role and objective==
{{see also|Art manifesto}}
Both literary critics and novelists question what role novelists play in society and within art. For example,  [[Eudora Welty]] writing in 1965 for  in her essay "Must the Novelist Crusade?" draws a distinction between novelists who report reality by "taking life as it already exists, not to report it, but to make an object, toward the end that the finished work might contain this life inside it, and offer it to the reader" and journalists, whose role is to act as "crusaders" advocating for particular positions, and using their craft as a political tool.&lt;ref name = PBS&gt;{{cite web| title = Must the Novelist Crusade?| publisher = PBS | first =Eudora |last = Welty| year =1965| accessdate = January 7, 2014| origyear = 1965| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/americancollection/ponder/tg_crusade.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, writing in the 1950s, [[Ralph Ellison]] in his essay "Society, Morality, and the Novel", sees the novelist as needing to "re-create reality in the forms which his personal vision assumes as it plays and struggles with the vivid illusory "eidetic-like" imagery left in the mind's eye by the process of social change."&lt;ref name = Ellison/&gt; However, Ellison also describes novelists of the [[Lost Generation]], like [[Ernest Hemingway]], not taking full advantage of the moral weight and influence available to novelists, pointing to Mark Twain and Herman Melville as better examples.&lt;ref name = Ellison&gt;{{cite book| first = Ralph| last = Ellison|chapter = Society, Morality and the Novel"| title = The Collected Essays of Ralph Ellison | editor =John F. Callahan|origyear = 1957| year = 2003| publisher = The Modern Library| pages = 698–729}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of such essays, such as literary critic [[Frank Norris]]'s "Responsibilities of a Novelist", highlight such moral and ethical justifications for their approach to both writing novels and criticizing them.&lt;ref name =RespONovelist&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=7569| last = Davies| first = Jude| title = The Responsibilities of the Novelist |work= The Literary Encyclopedia| date = 20 October 2001| accessdate = 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When defining her description of the role of the modernist novelist in the essay "[[Modern Fiction (essay)|Modern Fiction]]", [[Virginia Woolf]] argues for a representation of life not interested in the exhaustive specific details represented in [[Literary realism|realism]] in favor of representing a "myriad of impressions" created in experience life.&lt;ref name = Woolf/&gt; Her definition made in this essay, and developed in others, helped define the literary movement of [[modernist literature]]. She argues that the novelist should represent "not a series of gig-lamps symmetrically arranged; [rather] life is luminous halo, a semitransparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of the conscious to the end. Is it not the task of the novelist to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit, whatever aberration or complexity it may display, with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible?"&lt;ref name = Woolf&gt;{{Cite book | last = Woolf | first = Virginia |chapter =  Modern Fiction | title = The Common Reader | format = text | accessdate = 2014-03-26 | date = 2004-06-01 | url = http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c/| publisher = EBooks @ Adelaide }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">'''PaperBackSwap''' (PBS) is a club co-founded in 2004 by Richard Pickering and Robert Swarthout of Suwanee and Rome, Georgia, (USA).  Swarthout later left the company to pursue other ventures.  The purpose of PaperBackSwap is to use the [[Internet]] to facilitate the parity trading of books (or "[[book swapping]]") among member [[bibliophiles]] in the [[United States]].  The club also operates sister websites Swap-a-DVD and Swap-a-CD to facilitate parity trading of [[DVD]]s and [[compact disc|CD]]s, respectively.

== Membership requirements/restrictions ==
Membership ranges from zero to $20 per year &lt;ref&gt;https://secure.paperbackswap.com/kiosk/primo_pricing.php&lt;/ref&gt; and is offered to individuals residing at addresses served by the [[United States Postal Service]], including APO and FPO ([[military mail]]) addresses.  Commercial enterprises are prohibited from membership.  Membership is restricted to adults 18 years of age or older.  Membership restrictions are covered in the site privacy statement.

In February 2015 PaperBackSwap began charging a fee for their services.

== Operation ==
A credit system is used to enable members to trade books for credits and credits for books.  Credits may either be purchased, or they may be earned by mailing books which have been requested.  Consequently, a member need not seek another member who desires a parity trade; credits are the [[medium of exchange]].  Both [[paperback]] and [[hardback]] books may be traded, as well as [[audiobook]]s.  Within the PBS system the value of any bound book is always one credit, and the value of an audio book is always two credits.

==Site Fees==
The ''Box-O-Books'' program allows paying members to exchange boxes of books (rather than one at a time) to save on postage and provide variety. PBS offers optional printing of online postage for a small fee.  PBS also sells book accessories and other items bearing the club [[logo]].
In February 2015, membership tiers were introduced. Standard membership is $20 per year, limited membership is $12 per year and the free option is called a la carte. Each tier upgrade offers more wishlist slots and other benefits.

'''Placemaking''' is a multi-faceted approach to the [[urban planning|planning]], design and management of public spaces. Placemaking capitalizes on a local community's assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating public spaces that promote people's health, happiness, and well being. It is political due to the nature of [[place identity]]. Placemaking is both a process and a philosophy that makes use of urban design principles. It can be either official and government led, or community driven grass roots [[tactical urbanism]], such as extending sidewalks with chalk, paint, and planters, or open streets events such as [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]'s [[Ciclovía]]. Good placemaking makes use of underutilized space to enhance the urban experience at the pedestrian scale.

==History==

[[File:Jane Jacobs.jpg|thumb|Mrs. [[Jane Jacobs]], chairman of the Comm. to save the [[West Village]] holds up documentary evidence at press conference at Lions Head Restaurant at Hudson &amp; Charles Sts.]]
The concepts behind placemaking originated in the 1960s, when writers like [[Jane Jacobs]] and [[William H. Whyte]] offered groundbreaking ideas about designing cities that catered to people, not just to cars and shopping centers. Their work focused on the importance of lively neighborhoods and inviting public spaces. Jacobs advocated citizen ownership of streets through the now-famous idea of "eyes on the street." Whyte emphasized essential elements for creating social life in public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pps.org/articles/what_is_placemaking/ |title=What is Placemaking? &amp;#124; Project for Public Spaces |publisher=Pps.org |date=2009-12-31 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term came into use in the 1970s by [[landscape architect]]s, [[architect]]s and [[urban planner]]s to describe the process of creating squares, plazas, parks, streets and waterfronts that will attract people because they are pleasurable or interesting. Landscape often plays an important role in the design process.  The term encourages disciplines involved in designing the built environment to work together in pursuit of qualities that they each alone are unable to achieve.

Bernard Hunt, of HTA Architects noted that: "We have theories, specialisms, regulations, exhortations, demonstration projects. We have planners. We have highway engineers. We have mixed use, mixed tenure, architecture, community architecture, urban design, neighbourhood strategy.  But what seems to have happened is that we have simply lost the art of placemaking; or, put another way, we have lost the simple art of placemaking. We are good at putting up buildings but we are bad at making places."

Jan Gehl has said "First life, then spaces, then buildings – the other way around never works"; and "In a Society becoming steadily more privatized with private homes, cars, computers, offices and shopping centers, the public component of our lives is disappearing. It is more and more important to make the cities inviting, so we can meet our fellow citizens face to face and experience directly through our senses. Public life in good quality public spaces is an important part of a democratic life and a full life."&lt;ref&gt;/http://www.pps.org/reference/jgehl/&lt;/ref&gt;

The writings of poet [[Wendell Berry]] have contributed to an imaginative grasp of place and placemaking, particularly with reference to local ecology and local economy. He writes that, "If what we see and experience, if our country, does not become real in imagination, then it never can become real to us, and we are forever divided from it... Imagination is a particularizing and a local force, native to the ground underfoot."

== Principles ==
According to [[Project for Public Spaces]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pps.org/reference/11steps/|title=Eleven Principles for Creating Great Community Places - Project for Public Spaces|work=Project for Public Spaces|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; successful placemaking is based on eleven basic principles:

=== The Community Knows Best ===

An important aspect of placemaking is taking into account inputs of the people who will be using the public space most.  That is, to say, the community for which the public space is intended.  This is important because members of the community are likely to have useful insights into how the space does - or should - function, as well as a historical perspective of the area, and an understanding of what does and does not matter to other members of the community.[[File:Hallstatt Austria Town Market.jpg|thumb|415x415px|A plaza in Halstatt Austria with an activated public realm.]]

=== Places, Not Designs ===

Placemaking is not just about designing a park of plaza with efficient pedestrian circulation.  It involves taking into account the interrelations between surrounding retailers, vendors, amenities provided, and activities taking place in the space, then fine-tuning the space with landscape changes, additions of seating, etc., to make all of those elements mesh.  The end result should be a cohesive unit that creates greater value for the community than just the sum of its parts.

=== Placemaking is a Group Effort ===

Partners for political, financial, and intellectual backing are crucial to getting a public space improvement project off the ground.  These partners can range from individuals, to private or municipal institutions, to museums, to schools.

=== Make and Act on Observations ===

By observing how a public space is used, it is possible to gain an understanding of what the community does and does not like about it.  This understanding can be used to assess what activities and amenities may be missing from the space.  Even after a public space has been built, observation is key to properly managing it, and evolving it to better suit the community's needs over time.

=== Requires a Vision ===

As with many other types of project, a placemaking project needs a vision to succeed.  This vision should not be the grand design of a single person, but the aggregate conception of the entire community.

=== Requires Patience ===

A placemaking project does not happen overnight.  Do not be discouraged if things do not go exactly as planned at first, or if progress seems slow.

=== Triangulate ===
[[File:La Candelaria, Bogota.jpg|thumb|451x451px|Triangulation is represented between a mural, cafe, and [[Street vending|street vendor]] in Plazoleta del Chorro de Quevedo, located in [[La Candelaria]], [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. ]]
Triangulation, simply put, is the strategic placement of amenities, such that they encourage social interaction, and are used more frequently.  For example, "if a children's reading room in a new library is located so that it is next to a children's playground in a park and a food kiosk is added, more activity will occur than if these facilities were located separately." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Ignore Naysayers ===
Just because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it can't be done.  What it does mean is that there are few people, in either the private or public sectors, who have the job of creating places.

=== Form Supports Function ===
A public space's form factor should be formulated with its intended function(s) in mind.

=== Money Should Not Be an Issue ===
If networking and team building have been executed correctly, public sentiment towards the project should be positive enough to overlook its monetary cost.

=== Placemaking is an Ongoing Process ===
Placemaking is never "done".  Minor tweaks can be made to improve the space's usefulness to its community over time, and regular maintenance/upkeep of facilities and amenities is a fact of life.

== Healthy Placemaking - The Link Between ''Place'' and ''Health'' ==
Both the opportunities available to individuals and the choices made based on those opportunities impact individual, family, and community health. The World Health Organization's definition of health&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title=Health Promotion Glossary|last=|first=|date=1998|website=Health Promotion Glossary|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an appropriate, broad-reaching understanding of health as a "resource for everyday life, not the object of living" and an important frame for discussing the interconnections between ''Place'' and ''Health''.  A 2016 report '''''[https://www.pps.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Healthy-Places-PPS.pdf The Case for Healthy Places],''''' from [[Project for Public Spaces]] and the '''''[https://centerforactivedesign.org/assemblyprojectorientation Assembly Project,]''''' funded by the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]] and focusing on research related to Shaping Space for Civic Life both offer insight into the current evidence base showing how health and wellbeing are impacted by where you live and the opportunities available to you.

== The Arts and Creative Placemaking ==
While the arts and creative expression play a substantial part in establishing a sense of place, economic growth and production must also play an equally large role in creating a successful place. These two factors are not mutually exclusive, as the arts and cultural economic activity made up $729.6 billion (or 4.2%) of the United States GDP in 2014, and employed 4.7 million workers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/regional/arts-and-culture/index.cfm|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis|last=Analysis|first=US Department of Commerce, BEA, Bureau of Economic|website=www.bea.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the arts can be deployed as a powerful tool in the creation or rehabilitation of urban spaces.

Jamie Bennett, executive director of ArtPlace America, has identified the following four tools used by communities while implementing creative placemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Jamie|date=2014|title=Creative Placemaking|url=https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/cdir-10-02-final.pdf|journal=Community Development INVESTMENT REVIEW|volume= 10| issue = 2, 2014|pages=77–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Anchoring:''' When a key arts institution, organization, or building in the area prompts additional foot traffic or regional draw. These anchors can attract additional business, and become a strong source of identity for the neighborhood.
* '''Activating:''' When visual or performing arts are brought into the public realm, it activates the space while creating interest, activity, and engagement. More people and eyes on the street drives curiosity to explore and establishes a sense of safety.
* '''Fixing:''' Taking vacant, underutilized, or blighted spaces in a neighborhood and treating them as an opportunity for new art and design projects. This can change how people think about these spaces and the opportunities that they represent.
* '''Planning''' By using the arts and creative community meeting strategies, stakeholder enthusiasm can be bolstered, resulting in valuable input for community design. Bringing artists into the planning process can upend the familiar and allow participants to mentally "unhook" from their preconceived notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Jonathan|date=2011|title="Strange Spaces: A Rationale for Bringing Art and Artists into the Planning Process."|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1473095210389653|journal=Planning Theory|volume= 10| issue =  3, 2011|pages= 213–238|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community Attachment ==
Great places must do more than meet the basic requirements if they want to foster greater community attachment. A strong sense of attachment can result in residents who are more committed to the growth and success of their community. The [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]] conducted a study measuring community attachment, and found that there 
[[File:ChicagoNow chalk-blog (3822844217).jpg|left|thumb|Community placemaking on the streets of Chicago.|199x199px]]was very little variation in the primary drivers of attachment rates when compared between different cities across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knightfoundation.org/sotc/overall-findings/|title=Overall Findings - Knight Foundation|website=Knight Foundation|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drivers of Attachment ===

* '''Social Offerings''' - Gathering places that foster face-to-face interactions, building trust with others, and an environment where people care for one another. This includes perceptions of a healthy nightlife, an arts and cultural scene, and community events.
* '''Openness''' - How inclusive the community is to a wide range of people and lifestyles. Openness is measured by perception that the place is good for old people, racial and ethnic minorities, families and children, gays and lesbians, college grads looking for work, immigrants, and young adults without children.
* '''Aesthetics''' - The physical beauty of the place. Mostly focusing on the availability of open green space, parks, playgrounds, and recreational trails.

=== Attachment Trends ===

* '''Geography:''' The attachment rates are similar between residents who live within the city, and those who live outside of the city.
* '''Age:''' Older residents (65+) have higher rates of attachment, on average, than younger residents.
* '''Community Tenure:''' Newer residents were the least attached, and those who had lived in the community for 3–5 years were the most attached.
* '''Income:''' Higher income resulted in higher attachment rates, with those households making $75,000 per year or more being the most attached.
* '''Race and Ethnicity:''' Hispanic and non-hispanic white residents had similar levels of attachment, while black residents averaged lower levels of attachment.

== Livable Streetscapes ==
[[File:Incremental Development 300 TP.jpg|thumb|479x479px|A diagram displaying an artists rendering of different examples of placemaking that [[architect]]s and [[Urban planner|planners]] use to enhance pedestrian experiences.]]Streets are the stage for activity of everyday life within a city and they have the most potential to be designed to harness a high-quality sense of place. Effective placemaking in the [[street]]scape lends special attention to the streets livability by representing a sense of security, [[sense of place]], visible employment, variety of transportation options, meaningful interactions between residents, "eyes on the street" as well as "[[social capital]]".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The death and life of great American cities|last=Jacobs|first=Jane|publisher=Random House|year=1961|isbn=0394421590|location=New York|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Chester|last2=Aultman-Hall|first2=Lisa|date=2015-08-20|title=Measuring Urban Streetscapes for Livability: A Review of Approaches|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2015.1065546|journal=The Professional Geographer|volume=68|issue=1|pages=149–158|doi=10.1080/00330124.2015.1065546|issn=0033-0124}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these interactions take place at the ''mesoscale''. Mesoscale is described as the city level of observation between ''macroscale''—being birdseye view—and ''microscale--''being textures and individual elements of the streetscape (streetlamp type, building textures, etc.); in other words, mesoscale is the area observable from a humans eyes, for example: between buildings, including storefronts, sidewalks, street trees, and people. Placemaking for a street takes place at both mesoscale and microscale. To be effective placemakers, it is important that planners, architects, and engineers consider designing in the mesoscale when designing for places that are intended to be livable by [[William H. Whyte|Whyte]]'s standards.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Placemaking tools and practices ===
Tools and practices of placemaking that benefit from utilizing the mesoscale context include:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

*[[Form-based code|Form-Based Codes]]
*[[Infill|Infill Development]]
*[[Urban forestry|Urban Forestry Practices]]&lt;li&gt;[[Civil engineering|Civil Engineering]]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Architecture]]&lt;/li&gt;

== Social Media and Placemaking ==

As society changes to accommodate new technologies, [[urban planner]]s and citizens alike are looking to consult those technologies to enact physical change. One thing that has had a massive impact on western society is the advent of digital technologies, like [[social media]]. Urban decision makers are increasingly looking to plan cities based on feedback from [[Outreach|community engagement]] so as to ensure the development of a durable, livable place. With the invention of niche social technologies, communities have shifted their engagement away from [[Local government|local-government]]-led forums and platforms, to social media groups on websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Nextdoor]] to voice concerns, critiques and desires.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houghton|first=et al|date=2015|title=Urban Acupuncture: Hybrid Social and Technological Practices for Hyperlocal Placemaking|url=|journal=Journal of Urban Technology|volume=22|pages=3–19|via=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sense, these new platforms have become a [[Third place|Third Place]], in reference to [[Ray Oldenburg]]’s term.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41256327|title=The great good place : cafés, coffee shops, bookstores, bars, hair salons, and other hangouts at the heart of a community|last=Ray.|first=Oldenburg,|date=1999|publisher=Marlowe|isbn=1569246815|location=New York|oclc=41256327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Social media tools such as these show promise for the future of placemaking in that they are being used to reclaim, reinvigorate and activate spaces. These online neighborhood and event-centric groups and [[Internet forum|forums]] provide a convenient non-physical space for [[public discourse]] and discussion through digital networked interactions to implement change on a [[Hyperlocal|hyper-local]] level; this theory is sometimes referred to as [[Urban acupuncture|Urban Acupuncture]]. This type of shift towards a more [[Crowdsourcing|crowd-sourced]] planning method can lead to the creation of more relevant and useful and inclusive places with greater sense of place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Background==
In the mid 1990s, the artistic director of the [[Watermill Theatre]], Jill Fraser, offered Edward Hall the opportunity to direct ''[[Othello]]'' – his first full Shakespeare play. Although a success, Hall determined to use the experience to found an all-male Shakespeare company, "mixing a rigorous approach to the text with a modern physical aesthetic".&lt;ref name="Comedy2003"&gt;Theatre programme, Comedy Theatre, London, August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall has set out the rules of his company, “Everyone is paid the same (tiny) wage and if an actor has created a part in a production then they will automatically receive an offer on the next one which they can refuse or take.” The company has seen new members since its start, keeping the group fresh.&lt;ref&gt;Propeller website&lt;/ref&gt;

Propeller has won several theatre awards, including winner of the 1999 Barclays Theatre Award for Best Director (Edward Hall in ''Twelfth Night''), winner of the 2002 Barclays Theatre Awards Best Touring Production for ''Rose Rage'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://oberonbooks.com/shakespeare/midsummer-nights-dream Oberon Books - A Midsummer Night's Dream page] accessed 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; winner of the 2003 TMA Theatres Best Touring Production (''A Midsummer Night's Dream''), winner of 2004 [[Joseph Jefferson Awards|Jeff Award]] for Best Director, subsequent American production (Edward Hall in ''Rose Rage''), winner of 2007 [[Obie Award|OBIE]] Award for ''The Taming of the Shrew''.&lt;ref name="Chelt2009"&gt;Theatre programme, Everyman Cheltenham, June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RAL''' is a [[color|colour]] matching system used in [[Europe]] that is created and administrated by the German RAL gGmbH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imprint|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/footer-navigation/weitere-seiten/imprint.html|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (RAL non-profit LLC), which is a subsidiary of the German RAL Institute. In colloquial speech RAL refers to the RAL Classic system, mainly used for [[varnish]] and [[powder coating]] but nowadays there are reference panels for plastics as well. 
Approved RAL products are provided with a hologram as of early 2013 to make unauthorised versions difficult to produce. Imitations may show different hue and colour when observed under various light sources.

===RAL Classic===
In 1927 the German ''Reichs-Ausschuß für Lieferbedingungen und Gütesicherung'' (Imperial Commission for Delivery Terms and Quality Assurance) invented a collection of forty colours under the name of "RAL 840".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAL Colours history|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/about-ral-colours/ral-colours-history.html|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to that date manufacturers and customers had to exchange samples to describe a tint, whereas from then on they would rely on numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAL Historie|url=https://www.ral-logolizenz.com/fileadmin/lib/pdf/RAL_Historie.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s the numbers were changed uniformly to four digits and the collection was renamed to "RAL 840 R" (R for revised). With tints constantly added to the collection, it was revised again in 1961 and changed to "RAL 840-HR", which consists of 210 colours and is in use to this day. In the 1960s the colours were given supplemental names to avoid confusion in case of transposed digits.

As "RAL 840-HR" covered only matte paint the 1980s saw the invention of "RAL 841-GL" for glossy surfaces, limited to 193 colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The RAL CLASSIC Colour Collection|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/en/PRODUCTS-SHOP/RAL-CLASSIC/|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main criterion for colours in the RAL Classic collection is to be of "paramount interest". Therefore, most of the colours in it are used on warning and [[traffic sign]]s or are dedicated to government agencies and public services (for example: RAL 1004 - Swiss [[Postal Service]], RAL 1021 - Austrian Postal Service, RAL 1032 - German Postal Service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How is the RAL CLASSIC colour collection structured?|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/application-help/faqs/faqs-questions-about-ral-classic.html |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first digit relates to the shade of the colour:

===RAL F9===
This collection, which follows the naming of RAL Classic, was invented in 1961. It is nowadays made up of ten colours (RAL 1039-F9 Sand beige, RAL 1040-F9 Clay beige, RAL 6031-F9 Bronze green, RAL 6040-F9-Light olive, RAL 7050-F9 Camouflage grey, RAL 8027-F9 Leather brown, RAL 8031-F9 Sand brown, RAL 9021-F9 Tar black and RAL 6031-HR Bronze green for non-camouflage applications), used by the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' for [[military camouflage]] coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAL F9|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/en/PRODUCTS-SHOP/RAL-CLASSIC/RAL-F9.html|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does RAL CLASSIC include the camouflage colours of Germany's Armed Forces?|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/application-help/faqs/faqs-questions-about-ral-classic.html|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RAL Design===
In 1993 a new colour matching system was introduced, tailored to the needs of [[architect]]s, [[designer]]s and [[advertising|advertisers]]. It started with 1,688 colours and was revised to 1,625 colours. The colours of RAL Classic and RAL Design do not intersect.

Contrary to the preceding systems, RAL Design features no names and its numbering follows a scheme based on the CIELAB colour space, specifically [[Lab color space#Cylindrical representation: CIELCh or CIEHLC|cylindrical CIEHLC]]. Each colour is represented by seven digits, grouped in a triple and two pairs, representing [[hue]] (000–360 degrees, angle in the CIELab colour wheel), [[lightness]] (same as in ''L''*''a''*''b''*) and [[Colourfulness|chroma]] (relative saturation). The three numeric components of almost all RAL Design colours are multiples of 5, most are even divisible by 10.&lt;ref name="Design"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/application-help/all-ral-colours-names/overview-ral-design-colours.html | title=Overview of all RAL Design colours }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Conversion from RAL Design number tuple to CIELAB
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\text{RAL}_\text{Design} &amp;= \left(h_{ab}^{\circ}, L^{*}, C_{ab}^{*}\right)\\
a^{*} &amp;= C_{ab}^{*}\cdot\cos\left(h_{ab}^{\circ}\right)\\
 b^{*} &amp;= C_{ab}^{*}\cdot\sin\left(h_{ab}^{\circ}\right)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: "RAL 210 50 15" converts to ''L''* = 50, ''a''* = −12.99, ''b''* = −7.5, for instance.

===RAL Effect===
RAL Effect comprises 420 solid colours and, as a particular highlight, seventy metallic colours. It is the first collection from RAL to be based on waterborne paint systems. No use is made of [[heavy metals]] such as lead, cadmium and chromates.

The newly developed, multifunctional double colour fan RAL E 2 underlines the character of RAL Effect. RAL Effect allows eco-efficient colour production for all paint and lacquer producers.

===RAL Digital===
The [[software]] for architects, interior decorators and all those who deal with colours in a creative way. RAL Digital integrates the colours of RAL Classic, RAL Effect and RAL Design into graphics and CAD programs.

=== RAL Colour Feeling ===
"Colour Feeling 09/10" is primarily designed as a professional planning tool for designers, architects, interior designers, interior decorators and painters. It is meant to be a source of inspiration on how to creatively combine the main trend colours for the coming two years. But also general consumers can be inspired by the work book to develop their own ideas and to create their personal colour design.

A '''rasa''' ({{lang-sa|रस}}, {{lang-ml| രാസ്യം}}) literally means "juice, essence or taste".&lt;ref name=mmwrasa&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1899), [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0900/mw__0902.html Rasa], Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Motilal Banarsidass (Originally Published: Oxford)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britrasa/&gt; It connotes a concept in Indian arts about the aesthetic flavour of any visual, literary or musical work that evokes an emotion or feeling in the reader or audience but cannot be described.&lt;ref name=britrasa&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/rasa Rasa: Indian Aesthetic Theory], Encyclopedia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the emotional flavors/essence crafted into the work by the writer and relished by a 'sensitive spectator' or ''sahṛdaya'' or one with positive taste and mind. 

Rasas are created by ''bhavas'':&lt;ref&gt;Farley Richmond. "India" in ''The Cambridge Guide to Asian Theatre''. ed. James R. Brandon ([[Cambridge University Press]], 1993), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; the state of mind.

The ''rasa'' theory is mentioned in Chapter 6 of the ancient [[Sanskrit]] text ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', attributed to [[Bharata Muni]],&lt;ref name=lidovarasa&gt;{{harvnb|Natalia Lidova|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its most complete exposition in drama, songs and other performance arts is found in the works of the Kashmiri [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] philosopher [[Abhinavagupta]] (c. 1000 CE).&lt;ref name=britrasa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=meyer102&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe |title=Approaches to Acting: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KiJn_o4R5MC |year=2005|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-0381-9|pages=73, 102–106, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Rasa'' theory of the ''Natya Shastra'', entertainment is a desired effect of performance arts but not the primary goal, and the primary goal is to transport the individual in the audience into another parallel reality, full of wonder and bliss, where he experiences the essence of his own consciousness, and reflects on spiritual and moral questions.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L.

==History==
The word ''rasa'' appears in ancient [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature. In ''[[Rigveda]]'', it connotes a liquid, an extract and flavor.&lt;ref name="Meyer2005p102"/&gt;{{Refn|group=note|See Rigvedic hymns 1.187.4–5 composed by [[Agastya]], for example. The entire hymn praises liquid extract of foods as the spirit of greats gods, the source of great strength within humans, as Agastya glorifies foods. Sanskrit: तव त्ये पितो '''रसा''' रजांस्यनु विष्ठिताः । दिवि वाता इव श्रिताः ॥४॥ तव त्ये पितो ददतस्तव स्वादिष्ठ ते पितो । प्र स्वाद्मानो '''रसानां''' तुविग्रीवा इवेरते ॥५॥&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurie L. Patton|title=Bringing the Gods to Mind: Mantra and Ritual in Early Indian Sacrifice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSZmbbsg9bEC|year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93088-9|pages=100–101}}; For original text: [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१८७ Rigveda 1.187], Wikisource (in Sanskrit)&lt;/ref&gt;}} In ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', ''rasa'' in many contexts means "taste", and also the sense of "the sap of grain". According to Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe – a professor of Drama, ''rasa'' in the [[Upanishad]]s refers to the "essence, self-luminous consciousness, quintessence" but also "taste" in some contexts.&lt;ref name="Meyer2005p102"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe|title=Approaches to Acting: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KiJn_o4R5MC&amp;pg=PA102 |year=2005|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-0381-9|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|Many Upanishads use the word ''rasa''. For example, the "Ananda Valli" section of the ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'' states, according to Dinkgrafe Daniel Meyer, "rasa is essence par excellence, the universal essence/bliss". ('''रसो''' वै सः । '''रसँ''' ह्येवायं लब्ध्वाऽऽनन्दी भवति ।)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dinkgrafe Daniel Meyer|title=Consciousness, Theatre, Literature and the Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICcrBwAAQBAJ |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-3491-9|page=243}}; For Sanskrit original, see: [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/तैत्तिरीयोपनिषदत्/ब्रह्मानन्दवल्ली तैत्तिरीयोपनिषद ब्रह्मानन्दवल्ली], Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Refn|group=note|The philosophical or mystical meaning of ''rasa'' is common in the ''[[bhasya]]'' or commentaries on [[Principal Upanishads]] of Hinduism. For example, [[Adi Shankara]] comments that ''rasa'' means "bliss as is innate in oneself and manifests itself even in the absence of external stimuli" because bliss is a non-material state that is spiritual, subjective and an intrinsic state of a human being. Happiness, to Shankara, does not depend on others or external material things, it is a state one discovers and reaches within through ''atma-jnana'' (self knowledge).&lt;ref name="Meyer2005p102"/&gt;}} In post-Vedic literature, the word generally connotes "extract, essence, juice or tasty liquid".&lt;ref name=mmwrasa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer2005p102"/&gt;

Rasa in an aesthetic sense is suggested in the Vedic literature, but the oldest surviving manuscripts, with the ''rasa'' theory of [[Hinduism]], are of ''Natya Shastra''. The Aitareya [[Brahmana]] in chapter 6, for example, states:

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Now (he) glorifies the arts,
the arts are refinement of the self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atma]]-samskrti'').
With these the worshipper recreates his self,
that is made of rhythms, meters.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|''Aitareya Brahmana 6.27'' (~1000 BCE)|Translator: Arindam Chakrabarti&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2016p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arindam Chakrabarti|title=The Bloomsbury Research Handbook of Indian Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXFYCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4725-2430-0|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Sanskrit text ''Natya shastra'' presents the ''rasa'' theory in Chapter 6, a text attributed to Bharata Muni.&lt;ref name=lidovarasa/&gt; The text begins its discussion with a [[sutra]] called in Indian aesthetics as the ''rasa sutra'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Narendra Nath Sarma|title=Paṇḍitarāja Jagannātha, the Renowned Sanskrit Poet of Medieval India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vc_eBshVJf8C&amp;pg=PA75 |year=1994|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-393-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
''Rasa'' is produced from a combination of Determinants (''vibhava''), Consequents (''anubhava'') and Transitory States (''vyabhicaribhava'').
|''Natyashastra 6.109'' (~200 BCE–200 CE)|Translator: Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe&lt;ref name="Meyer2005p102"/&gt;}}

According to the ''Natya shastra'', the goals of theatre are to empower aesthetic experience and deliver emotional ''rasa''. The text states that the aim of art is manifold. In many cases, it aims to produce repose and relief for those exhausted with labor, or distraught with grief, or laden with misery, or struck by austere times.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2016p1"/&gt; Yet entertainment is an effect, but not the primary goal of arts according to ''Natya shastra''. The primary goal is to create ''rasa'' so as to lift and transport the spectators, unto the expression of ultimate reality and transcendent values.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe |title=Approaches to Acting: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KiJn_o4R5MC |year=2005|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-0381-9|pages=102–104, 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Abhinavabharati|Abhinavabhāratī]]'' is the most studied commentary on ''Natyasastra'', written by [[Abhinavagupta]] (950–1020 CE), who referred to ''Natyasastra'' also as the ''Natyaveda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Ghosh |first = Manomohan |title = Natyasastra |year = 2002 |isbn =81-7080-076-5 |page =2 note 3|url= https://archive.org/stream/NatyaShastra/natya_shastra_translation_volume_1_-_bharat_muni#page/n87/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Ananda Lal|2004|p=308, 492}} Abhinavagupta's analysis of ''Natyasastra'' is notable for its extensive discussion of aesthetic and ontological questions.{{Sfn|Ananda Lal|2004|p=308, 492}} According to Abhinavagupta, the success of an artistic performance is measured not by the reviews, awards or recognition the production receives, but only when it is performed with skilled precision, devoted faith and pure concentration such that the artist gets the audience emotionally absorbed into the art and immerses the spectator with pure joy of ''rasa'' experience.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=24}}

==Rasa theory==
Although the concept of rasa is fundamental to many forms of [[Indian art]], including [[Dance in India|dance]], [[Indian classical music|music]], musical theatre, [[Cinema of India|cinema]] and [[Indian literature|literature]], the treatment, interpretation, usage and actual performance of a particular rasa differs greatly between different styles and schools of [[abhinaya]], and the huge regional differences even within one style.

=== Experience of rasa (ras-anubhava)===
A rasa is the developed relishable state of a permanent mood, which is called sthayi bhava. This development towards a relishable state results by the interplay on it of attendant emotional conditions which are called Vibhavas, anubhavas and sanchari/ vyabhichari bhavas. The production of aesthetic rasa from bhavas is analogous to the production of tastes/juices of kinds from food with condiments, curries, pastes and spices. This is explained by the quote below:

: 'Vibhavas' means karana or cause. It is of two kinds: Alambana, the personal or human object and substratum, and Uddipana, the excitants. Anubhava, as the name signifies, means the ensuants or effects following the rise of the emotion. vyAbhichArI bhavas are described later in this aspect.

=== Vedic concept ===
The [[Rishi Praskanva]] insists ([[Rig Veda]] I.46.6) that the sources of knowledge, some of which are open and some hidden, they are to be sought and found by the seekers after Truth, these sources are not available everywhere, anywhere and at all times. In this context Rishi [[Agastya]] (Rig Veda I.187.4) stating thus – 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
तव॒ त्ये पि॑तो॒ रसा॒ रजां॒स्यनु॒ विष्ठि॑ताः । &lt;br&gt;
दि॒वि वाता॑ इव श्रि॒ताः ॥
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
reminds the ardent seekers about the six kinds of Rasa or taste which food has but which all tastes cannot be found in one place or item, for these tastes are variously distributed throughout space. Food, in this context, means matter or objects or thoughts, which are all produced effects; effects that are produced owing to various causes. The Rasas are the unique qualities which bring about variety in things created whose source is one and one only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Illumination of Knowledge |author= Ravinder kumar Soni |publisher=GBD Books |page=113 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Illumination_Of_Knowledge.html?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Durga-mudra.png|right|thumb|Raudram rasa of the destructive fury of goddess [[Durga]] in Bharatanatyam]]
[[Bharata Muni]] enunciated the eight Rasas in the ''[[Nātyasāstra]]'', an ancient Sanskrit text of [[dramatic theory]] and other performance arts, written between 200 BC and 200 AD.&lt;ref name=lidovarasa/&gt; In the [[India]]n performing arts, a ''rasa'' is a sentiment or emotion evoked in each member of the audience by the art. The ''Natya Shastra'' mentions six rasa in one section, but in the dedicated section on ''rasa'' it states and discusses eight primary ''rasa''.&lt;ref name="Meyer2005p102"/&gt;{{Sfn|Wallace Dace|1963|pp=249-250}} Each rasa, according to Nātyasāstra, has a presiding deity and a specific colour. There are 4 pairs of rasas. For instance, [[Hāsya]] arises out of [[Sringara]]. The [[Aura (paranormal)|Aura]] of a frightened person is black, and the aura of an angry person is red. [[Bharata Muni]] established the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ghosh |first= Manomohan |title= Natyasastra |year= 2002 |isbn=81-7080-076-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ninth rasa was added by later authors. This addition had to undergo a good deal of struggle between the sixth and the tenth centuries, before it could be accepted by the majority of the Alankarikas, and the expression "''Navarasa''" (the nine rasas), could come into vogue.

*'''{{IAST|Śāntam}}''': Peace or tranquility. deity: [[Vishnu]]. Colour: perpetual white

Shānta-rasa functions as an equal member of the set of rasas, but it is simultaneously distinct as being the most clear form of aesthetic bliss.  Abhinavagupta likens it to the string of a jeweled necklace; while it may not be the most appealing for most people, it is the string that gives form to the necklace, allowing the jewels of the other eight rasas to be relished.  Relishing the rasas and particularly shānta-rasa is hinted as being as-good-as but never-equal-to the bliss of Self-realization experienced by [[yogis]].

== List of bhavas ==
According to the ''nATyashAstra'', bhAvas are of three types: sthAyI, sanchari, sAttvika based on how they are developed or enacted during the aesthetic experience. This is seen in the following passage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
पुनश्च भावान्वक्ष्यामि स्थायिसञ्चारिसत्त्वजान्॥६.१६॥
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some bhAvas are also described as being anubhAva if they arise from some other bhAva.

===Sthayee ===
The ''Natyasastra'' lists eight ''bhavas'' with eight corresponding ''rasas'': 
*''Rati'' (Love)
*''Hasya'' (Mirth)
*''Soka'' (Sorrow)
*''Krodha'' (Anger)
*''Utsaha'' (Energy)
*''Bhaya'' (Terror)
*''Jugupsa'' (Disgust)
*''Vismaya'' (Astonishment)

This list is from the following passage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
रतिहासश्च शोकश्च क्रोधोत्साहौ भयं तथा।&lt;br/&gt;
जुगुप्सा विस्मयश्चेति स्थायिभावाः प्रकीर्तिताः॥६.१७॥
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sanchari===
Sanchari Bhavas are those crossing feelings which are ancillary to a permanent mood.&lt;ref name=ty&gt;C.Ramanujachari and Dr. V. Raghavan. ''The Spiritual Heritage of Tyagaraja''.&lt;/ref&gt; A list of 33 bhAvas are identified therein.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
निर्वेदग्लानिशङ्काख्यास्तथासूया मदः श्रमः।&lt;br/&gt;
आलस्यं चैव दैन्यं च चिन्तामोहः स्मृतिर्धृतिः॥१८॥&lt;br/&gt;
व्रीडा चपलता हर्ष आवेगो जडता तथा।&lt;br/&gt;
गर्वो विषाद औत्सुक्यं निद्रापस्मार एव च॥१९॥&lt;br/&gt;
सुप्तं विबोधोऽमर्षश्चापि अवहित्थं अथोग्रता।&lt;br/&gt;
मतिर्व्याधिस्तथा उन्मादस्तथा मरणमेव च॥२०॥&lt;br/&gt;
त्रासश्चैव वितर्कश्च विज्ञेया व्यभिचारिणः।&lt;br/&gt;
त्रयस्त्रिंशदमी भावाः समाख्यातास्तु नामतः॥२१॥
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===sAtvika===
The sAtvika-bhAvAs themselves are listed below.

&lt;blockquote&gt;स्तम्भः स्वेदोऽथ रोमाञ्चः स्वरभेदोऽथ वेपथुः।&lt;br/&gt;
वैवर्ण्यं अश्रु-प्रलय इत्यष्टौ सात्विकाः स्मृताः॥२२॥&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are explained by [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]] and [[Dhanika]] as below:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"सत्त्वं नाम मनःप्रभवम्। एतदेव समाहितमनस्त्वादुत्पद्यते। " इति भरतः।&lt;br/&gt;
"एतदेवास्य सत्त्वं यत् दुःखितेन प्रहर्षितेन वा अश्रु-रोमाञ्चादयो निवर्त्यन्ते।&lt;br/&gt;
तेन सत्त्वेन  निर्वृत्ता भावाः - सात्त्विकाः भावाः। तद्भावभावनं च भावः।" इति धनिकः।&lt;br/&gt;
"पृथग् भावा भवन्त्यन्येऽनुभावत्वेऽपि सात्त्विकाः।&lt;br/&gt;
सत्त्वादेव समुत्पत्तेस्तच्च तद्भावभावनम्॥" इति धनिकः।&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, physical expression of the feelings of the mind are called sAttvika.

==Role in art==
According to ''Natya shastra'', a ''rasa'' is a synthetic phenomenon and the goal of any creative performance art, oratory, painting or literature.&lt;ref name="Benamou2010p172"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Lavezzoli23&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Lavezzoli|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-1815-9|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace Dace translates the ancient text's explanation of ''rasa'' as "a relish that of an elemental human emotion like love, pity, fear, heroism or mystery, which forms the dominant note of a dramatic piece; this dominant emotion, as tasted by the audience, has a different quality from that which is aroused in real life; rasa may be said to be the original emotion transfigured by aesthetic delight".{{Sfn|Wallace Dace|1963|pp=249-250}}

Rasas are created through a wide range of means, and the ancient Indian texts discuss many such means. For example, one way is through the use of gestures and facial expressions of the actors.&lt;ref&gt;Farley Richmond, "India", in ''The Cambridge Guide to Asian Theatre'', ed. James R. Brandon ([[Cambridge University Press]], 1993), p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; Expressing ''Rasa'' in classical Indian dance form is referred to as '''Rasa-abhinaya'''. 

The theory of rasas forms the [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] underpinning of all Indian classical dance and theatre, such as [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Odissi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Kudiyattam]], and others.{{Sfn|Wallace Dace|1963|pp=249-252}}

In [[Indian classical music]], each ''[[raga]]'' is an inspired creation for a specific mood, where the musician or ensemble creates the ''rasa'' in the listener.&lt;ref name= Lavezzoli23/&gt; However, predominantly all ''ragas'' and musical performances in Hindu traditions aim at one of six ''rasa'', wherein music is a form of painting "love, compassion, peace, heroism, comic or the feeling of wonder" within the listener. Anger, disgust, fear and such emotions are not the subject of ''raga'', but they are part of Indian theories on dramatic arts. Of the six ''rasa'' that are aimed at in Indian music, each has sub-categories. For example, love ''rasa'' in Hindu imagination has many musical flavors, such as erotic love (''sringar'') and spiritual devotional love (''bhakti'').&lt;ref name= Lavezzoli23/&gt;{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=34-42}}

''Rasa'' is a fusion of word and meaning,

It is the truth of poetry,
shining without cessation.
Clear to the heart,
it is yet beyond the words.

In the theories of Indian poetics, ancient scholars state that the effectiveness of a literary composition depends both on what is stated and how it is stated (words, grammar, rhythm), that is the suggested meaning and the experience of ''rasa''.&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2012p295"/&gt; Among the most celebrated in Hindu traditions on the theory of poetics and literary works, are 5th-century [[Bhartṛhari|Bhartrhari]] and the 9th-century Anandavardhana, but the theoretical tradition on integrating ''rasa'' into literary artworks likely goes back to a more ancient period. This is generally discussed under the Indian concepts of ''Dhvani'', ''Sabdatattva'' and ''Sphota''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sebastian Alackapally|title=Being and Meaning: Reality and Language in Bhartṛhari and Heidegger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liCLrmfnKSoC&amp;pg=PA86 |year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1803-3|pages=78–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2012p295"&gt;{{cite book|author= W.S.

The literary work ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' deploys ''rasa'', presenting [[Bhakti]] of [[Krishna]] in aesthetic terms. The rasa it presents is as an emotional relish, a mood, which is called Sthayi Bhava. This development towards a relishable state results by the interplay on it of attendant emotional conditions which are called ''Vibhavas'', ''[[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|Anubhavas]]'' and ''Sanchari Bhavas''. Vibhavas means Karana or cause: it is of two kinds - ''Alambana'', the personal or human object and substratum, and ''Uddipana'', the excitants. Anubhava, as the name signifies, means the ensuants or effects following the rise of the emotion. ''Sanchari Bhavas'' are those crossing feelings which are ancillary to a mood. Later scholars added more emotional states such as the ''Saatvika Bhavas''.&lt;ref name=ty/&gt;

In the Indian theories on sculpture and architecture (''[[Shilpa Shastras]]''), the ''rasa'' theories, in part, drive the forms, shapes, arrangements and expressions in images and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alice Boner|author2=Sadāśiva Rath Śarmā|author3=Bettina Bäumer|title=The essence of form in sacred art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2eKhTXstG4C&amp;pg=PA72 |year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0090-8|pages=72–78, 45–46, 57–58, 115–116, 121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Indian texts on ''Shilpa'' on image carving and making, suggest nine ''rasas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alice Boner|author2=Sadāśiva Rath Śarmā|author3=Bettina Bäumer|title=The essence of form in sacred art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2eKhTXstG4C&amp;pg=PA72 |year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0090-8|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Sense of Adharma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JB3oCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-508341-5|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on cinema==
''Rasa'' has been an important influence on the [[cinema of India]]. [[Satyajit Ray]] has applied the ''Rasa'' method of classical Sanskrit drama to movies, for instance in ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' (1955–1959).&lt;ref name="Cooper 2000 1-4"&gt;{{citation|last=Cooper|first=Darius|title=The Cinema of Satyajit Ray: Between Tradition and Modernity|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-521-62980-2|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindi cinema, it is the theme of the film [[Naya Din Nayi Raat]], where [[Sanjeev Kumar]] played nine characters corresponding to nine ''Rasa''.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

'''''Rear Window''''' is a 1954 American [[Technicolor]] [[mystery film|mystery]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and written by [[John Michael Hayes]] based on [[Cornell Woolrich]]'s 1942 [[short story]] "It Had to Be Murder". Originally released by [[Paramount Pictures]], the film stars [[James Stewart]], [[Grace Kelly]], [[Wendell Corey]], [[Thelma Ritter]], and [[Raymond Burr]]. It was screened at the 1954 [[Venice Film Festival]].

The film is considered by many filmgoers, critics, and scholars to be one of Hitchcock's best&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017289-rear_window/ |title=Rear Window Movie Reviews, Pictures&amp;nbsp;– Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. It received four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and was ranked number 42 on AFI's [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies list]] and number 48 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|the 10th-anniversary edition]], and in 1997 was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] in the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
Recuperating from a broken leg, adventuresome professional photographer L. B. "Jeff" Jefferies (Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair in his [[Greenwich Village]] apartment. His rear window looks out onto a courtyard and several other apartments. During a powerful [[heat wave]], he watches his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool.

He observes a flamboyant dancer he nicknames "Miss Torso"; a single middle-aged woman he calls "Miss Lonelyhearts"; a talented, single, middle-aged composer-pianist; several married couples; a female sculptor; and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.

Jeff's sophisticated, beautiful [[socialite]] girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), visits him regularly, as does his insurance company's nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella wants Jeff to settle down and marry Lisa, but Jeff is reluctant.

One night during a thunderstorm, Jeff hears a woman scream "Don't!" and then the sound of breaking glass. Later, he is awakened by thunder and observes Thorwald leaving his apartment. Thorwald makes repeated late-night trips carrying his sample case. The next morning, Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and then sees Thorwald cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Later, Thorwald ties a large trunk with heavy rope and has moving men haul it away. Jeff discusses all this with Lisa and with Stella.

Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. Jeff explains this to his friend Tom Doyle ([[Wendell Corey]]), a [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] detective, and asks him to do some research. Doyle finds nothing suspicious; apparently, Mrs. Thorwald is upstate, and picked up the trunk herself.

[[File:Rearwindow trailer 1.jpg|thumb|left|267px|[[James Stewart]] as L.B. Jefferies]]

Soon after, a neighbor's dog is found dead with its neck broken. The dog's owner yells across the courtyard, complaining of her neighbors' callous disregard of others. All the neighbors run to their windows to see what is happening, except for Thorwald, whose cigar can be seen glowing as he sits quietly in his dark apartment.

Certain that Thorwald is also guilty of killing the dog, Jeff asks Lisa to slip an accusatory note under his door, so Jeff can watch his reaction when he reads it. Then, as a pretext to get Thorwald out of his apartment, Jeff telephones him and arranges a meeting at a bar. He believes Thorwald buried something incriminating in the courtyard flower bed, and killed the dog to stop it digging there, so when Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella dig up the flowers; they find nothing.

Much to Jeff's amazement and admiration, Lisa then climbs the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and clambers in through an open window. When Thorwald returns and grabs Lisa, Jeff calls the police, who arrive in time to save her by arresting her. Jeff sees Lisa has her hands behind her back, wiggling her finger with Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring on it. Thorwald notices this, and, realizing that she is signaling to someone, he sees Jeff across the courtyard.

Jeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message. Stella heads for the police station to post bail for Lisa. When his phone rings, Jeff assumes it is Doyle, and says that the suspect has left the apartment. When no one answers, Jeff realizes that Thorwald himself had called, and is heading over to confront him. When Thorwald enters, Jeff repeatedly sets off his camera flashbulbs, temporarily blinding him. However, Thorwald grabs Jeff and manages to push him out of the open window, as Jeff is yelling for help. Police officers enter the apartment as he falls to the ground; other officers have run over to break his fall. Thorwald confesses to the police soon afterward.

A few days later, the heat has lifted, and Jeff rests peacefully in his wheelchair, now with casts on both legs. The lonely neighbor is chatting with the pianist in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.

Lisa reclines on the daybed in Jeff's apartment, wearing jeans and apparently reading a book titled ''Beyond the High Himalayas''. As soon as Jeff falls asleep, Lisa puts the book down and happily opens a fashion magazine.

==Production==
The film was shot entirely at Paramount studios, which included an enormous indoor set to replicate a Greenwich Village courtyard. Set designers [[Hal Pereira]] and Joseph MacMillan Johnson spent six weeks building the extremely detailed and complex set, which ended up being the largest of its kind at Paramount. One of the unique features of the set was its massive drainage system, constructed to accommodate the rain sequence in the film. They also built the set around a highly nuanced lighting system which was able to create natural-looking lighting effects for both the day and night scenes. Though the address given in the film is 125 W. Ninth Street in New York's Greenwich Village, the set was actually based on a real courtyard located at 125 [[Christopher Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lumenick|first=Lou|authorlink=Lou Lumenick|title=Inside the real Greenwich Village apartment that inspired ''Rear Window''|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/06/inside-the-real-greenwich-village-apartment-that-inspired-rear-window/|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=21 November 2016|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the meticulous care and detail put into the set, careful attention was also given to sound, including the use of natural sounds and music that would drift across the courtyard and into Jefferies' apartment. At one point, the voice of [[Bing Crosby]] can be heard singing "To See You Is to Love You", originally from the 1952 Paramount film ''[[Road to Bali]]''. Also heard on the soundtrack are versions of songs popularized earlier in the decade by [[Nat King Cole]] ("[[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|Mona Lisa]]", 1950) and [[Dean Martin]] ("[[That's Amore]]", 1952), along with segments from [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s score for [[Jerome Robbins]]' ballet ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'' (1944), [[Richard Rodgers]]' song "[[Lover (song)|Lover]]" (1932), and "''M'appari tutt'amor''" from [[Friedrich von Flotow]]'s opera ''[[Martha (opera)|Martha]]'' (1844), most borrowed from Paramount's music publisher, [[Famous Music]].

Hitchcock used costume designer [[Edith Head]] on all of his Paramount films.

Although veteran Hollywood composer [[Franz Waxman]] is credited with the score for the film, his contributions were limited to the opening and closing titles and the piano tune ("Lisa") written by one of the neighbors, a composer ([[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.|Ross Bagdasarian]]), during the film. This was Waxman's final score for Hitchcock. The director used primarily "diegetic" sounds—sounds arising from the normal life of the characters—throughout the film.&lt;ref&gt;DVD documentary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A "benefit world premiere" for the film, with [[United Nations]] officials and "prominent members of the social and entertainment worlds"&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE6DD113EE53BBC4D53DFBE66838F649EDE A ''Rear Window'' View Seen at the Rivoli], an August 5, 1954, review from ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; in attendance, was held on August 4, 1954, at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City, with proceeds going to the American–Korean Foundation (an aid organization founded soon after the end of the [[Korean War]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=9835 Statement by the President on the fund-raising campaign of the American–Korean Foundation] from a [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and headed by [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], brother of [[President Eisenhower]]).

The movie was released wide on September 1, 1954.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The movie went on to earn an estimated $5.3 million at the [[North America]]n box office in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''Variety Weekly'', January 5, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and is considered one of Hitchcock's finest films. On the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has been universally praised, garnering a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% certified fresh rating]], based on 61 reviews, with the consensus stating that "Hitchcock exerted full potential of suspense in this masterpiece."

Critic [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' attended the benefit premiere, and in his review called the film a "tense and exciting exercise"&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; and Hitchcock a director whose work has a "maximum of build-up to the punch, a maximum of carefully tricked deception and incidents to divert and amuse." Crowther also notes: "Mr. Hitchcock's film is not 'significant.' What it has to say about people and human nature is superficial and glib, but it does expose many facets of the loneliness of city life, and it tacitly demonstrates the impulse of morbid curiosity. The purpose of it is sensation, and that it generally provides in the colorfulness of its detail and in the flood of menace toward the end."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called it "just possibly the second-most entertaining picture (after ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'') ever made by Alfred Hitchcock" and a film in which there is "never an instant&amp;nbsp;... when Director Hitchcock is not in minute and masterly control of his material."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,891018,00.html The New Pictures], an August 2, 1954 review from ''Time'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; The same review did note "occasional studied lapses of taste and, more important, the eerie sense a Hitchcock audience has of reacting in a manner so carefully foreseen as to seem practically foreordained."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "one of Alfred Hitchcock's better thrillers" which "combines technical and artistic skills in a manner that makes this an unusually good piece of murder mystery entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/1954/film/reviews/rear-window-1200417736/ Review of ''Rear Window''], a July 14, 1954 article from ''Variety'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 30 years after the film's initial release, [[Roger Ebert]] reviewed the Universal re-release in October 1983, after Hitchcock's [[Probate|estate was settled]]. He said the film "develops such a clean, uncluttered line from beginning to end that we're drawn through it (and into it) effortlessly. The experience is not so much like watching a movie, as like&amp;nbsp;... well, like spying on your neighbors. Hitchcock traps us right from the first&amp;nbsp;... And because Hitchcock makes us accomplices in Stewart's [[voyeurism]], we're along for the ride. When an enraged man comes bursting through the door to kill Stewart, we can't detach ourselves, because we looked too, and so we share the guilt and in a way we deserve what's coming to him."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19831007/REVIEWS/310070302/1023 1983 Review of ''Rear Window'' re-release] by Roger Ebert&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
In his book, ''Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window"'', [[John Belton]] addresses the underlying issues of [[voyeurism]], that are evident in the film. He asserts "''Rear Window's'' story is "about" spectacle; it explores the fascination with looking and the attraction of that which is being looked at."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Belton |editor1-first=John |last1=Belton |first1=John |author1link=John Belton |title=Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' |chapter=Introduction: Spectacle and Narrative |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=1 |oclc=40675056 |isbn=9780521564236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voyeurism===

John Fawell notes in Dennis Perry's book, ''Hitchcock and Poe: The Legacy of Delight and Terror'', that Hitchcock "recognized that the darkest aspect of voyeurism…is our desire for awful things to happen to people...to make ourselves feel better, and to relieve ourselves of the burden of examining our own lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitchcock and Poe: the Legacy of Delight and Terror|last=Perry|first=Dennis|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2003|isbn=978-0810848221|location=Maryland|pages=135–153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Master of Terror challenges the audience, forcing them to peer through his rear window and become exposed to, as Donald Spoto calls it in his 1976 book ''The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: Fifty Years of His Motion Pictures'', the "social contagion" of acting as voyeur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: Fifty Years of His Motion Pictures|last=Spoto|first=Donald|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.,|year=1976|isbn=978-0385418133|location=Garden City, N.Y.|pages=237–249|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an explicit example of a condemnation of voyeurism, Stella expresses her outrage at Jeffries' voyeuristic habits, saying, "In the old days, they'd put your eyes out with a red hot poker" and "What people ought to do is get outside and look in for a change."

One climactic scene in the film portrays both the positive and negative effects of voyeurism. Driven by curiosity and incessant watching, with Jeffries watching from his window, Lisa sneaks into Thorwald's second-floor apartment, looking for clues, and is apprehended by him. Jeffries is in obvious anxiety and is overcome with panic as he sees Thorwald walk into the apartment and notice the irregular placement of the purse on the bed. Jeffries anxiously jitters in his wheelchair, and grabs his telephoto camera to watch the situation unfold, eventually calling the police because Miss Lonelyhearts is contemplating suicide in the neighboring apartment. Chillingly, Jeffries watches Lisa in Thorwald's apartment rather than keeping an eye on the woman about to commit suicide. Thorwald turns off the lights, shutting off Jeffries' sole means of communication with  and protection of Lisa; Jeffries still pays attention to the pitch-black apartment instead of Miss Lonelyhearts. The tension Jeffries feels is unbearable and acutely distressing as he realizes that he is responsible for Lisa now that he cannot see her. The police go to the Thorwald apartment, the lights flicker on, and any danger coming toward Lisa is temporarily dismissed. Although Lisa is taken to jail, Jeffries is utterly mesmerized by her dauntless actions.

With further analysis, Jeffries' positive evolution understandably would be impossible without voyeurism—or as Robin Wood puts it in his 1989 book ''Hitchcock's Films Revisited'', "the indulging of morbid curiosity and the consequences of that indulgence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitchcock's Films Revisited|last=Wood|first=Robin|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0231126953|location=|pages=100–107|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1997, ''Rear Window'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". By this time, the film interested other directors with its theme of voyeurism, and other reworkings of the film soon followed, which included [[Brian De Palma]]'s 1984 film ''[[Body Double]]'' and [[Phillip Noyce]]'s 1993 film ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]''.

''Rear Window'' was restored by the team of [[Robert A. Harris]] and [[James C. Katz]] for its 1999 limited theatrical re-release (using Technicolor dye-transfer prints for the first time in this title's history) and the Collector's Edition DVD release in 2000.

[[American Film Institute]] included the film as number 42 in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]], number 14 in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills]], number 48 in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]] and number three in [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] (Mysteries).&lt;ref name="AFI's 10 Top 10"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 | date = 2016 | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/category.aspx?cat=5 | accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
Ownership of the copyright in Woolrich's original story was eventually litigated before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Stewart v. Abend]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Stewart v. Abend|volume=495|page=207|pin=|year=1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was copyrighted in 1954 by Patron Inc., a production company set up by Hitchcock and Stewart. As a result, Stewart and Hitchcock's estate became involved in the Supreme Court case, and Sheldon Abend became a producer of [[Rear Window (1998 film)|the 1998 remake]] of ''Rear Window''.

''Rear Window'' is one of several of Hitchcock's films originally released by Paramount Pictures, for which Hitchcock retained the copyright, and which was later acquired by Universal Studios in 1983 from Hitchcock's estate.

==Home media==
On September 4, 2012, Universal Studios Home Entertainment re-released ''Rear Window'' to DVD, as a Region 1 widescreen DVD. This release includes the items available in the 2001 release.

On May 6, 2014, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released ''Rear Window'' to Blu-ray format, with slightly expanded extras.

==In popular culture==
''Rear Window'' has been repeatedly retold, parodied, or referenced.
[[Image:RearMuralPublicArt.jpg||thumb|widthpx|64 years after its release, Rear Window is referenced in [[public art]] commissioned for the [[Treefort Music Fest]] in [[Boise, Idaho]]]]

'''Television'''
* The set of the film was the basis for a comedy sketch on a 2009 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

'''Surrealist automatism''' is a method of art-making in which the artist suppresses conscious control over the making process, allowing the unconscious mind to have great sway. Early 20th-century [[Dada]]ists, such as [[Hans Arp]], made some use of this method through chance operations. [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists, most notably [[André Masson]], adapted to art the [[automatic writing]] method of [[André Breton]] and [[Philippe Soupault]] who composed with it ''[[Les Champs Magnétiques]]'' (The Magnetic Fields) in 1919.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 45-46. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Automatic Message]]'' (1933) was one of Breton's significant theoretical works about automatism.

==Origins==
[[Automatic behavior|Automatism]] has taken on many forms: the automatic writing and [[automatic drawing|drawing]] initially (and still to this day) explored by the surrealists can be compared to similar or parallel phenomena, such as the non-idiomatic improvisation.
"Pure psychic automatism" was how André Breton defined Surrealism, and while the definition has proved capable of significant expansion, automatism remains of prime importance in the movement.

==Automatic drawing and painting==
{{anchor|Automatic drawing}} &lt;!--Automatic drawing redirects here --&gt;
Automatic drawing was pioneered by the English artist [[Austin Osman Spare]] who wrote a chapter, Automatic Drawing as a Means to Art, in his book, ''[[The Book of Pleasure]]'' (1913). Other artists who also practised automatic drawing later include, in France [[André Masson]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Jean Arp]] and [[André Breton]].

The technique of automatic drawing was transferred to [[painting]] (as seen in Miró's paintings which often started out as automatic drawings), and has been adapted to other media; there have even been [[automatism and the computer|automatic "drawings" in computer graphics]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] was also thought to have expressed a type of automatic drawing in his later work, and particularly in his etchings and lithographic suites of the 1960s.

'''Automatic drawing''' (distinguished from [[mediumistic automatism|drawn expression of mediums]]) was developed by the [[surrealist]]s, as a means of expressing the [[subconscious]]. In automatic [[drawing]], the [[hand]] is allowed to move "[[random]]ly" across the paper. In applying [[Randomness|chance]] and accident to mark-making, drawing is to a large extent freed of [[rationality|rational control]]. Hence the drawing produced may be attributed in part to the subconscious and may reveal something of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], which would otherwise be repressed. Examples of automatic drawing were produced by mediums and practitioners of the psychic arts. It was thought by some [[Spiritualist Church|Spiritualists]] to be a spirit control that was producing the drawing while physically taking control of the medium's body.

Most of the surrealists' automatic drawings were [[illusion]]istic, or more precisely, they developed into such drawings when representational forms seemed to suggest themselves. In the 1940s and 1950s the [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] group called [[Les Automatistes]] pursued creative work (chiefly [[painting]]) based on surrealist principles. They abandoned any trace of [[Representation (arts)|representation]] in their use of automatic drawing. This is perhaps a more pure form of automatic drawing since it can be almost entirely involuntary – to develop a representational form requires the [[conscious mind]] to take over the process of drawing, unless it is entirely [[accident]]al and thus incidental. These artists, led by [[Paul-Émile Borduas]], sought to proclaim an entity of [[universal value]]s and ethics proclaimed in their manifesto ''[[Refus Global]]''.

As alluded to above, surrealist artists often found that their use of "automatic drawing" was not entirely automatic, rather it involved some form of conscious intervention to make the image or painting visually acceptable or comprehensible, "...Masson admitted that his 'automatic' imagery involved a two-fold process of unconscious and conscious activity...."&lt;ref&gt;The Surrealists: Revolutionaries in art &amp; writing 1919–1935, Jemma Montagu, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surautomatism==
Some Romanian surrealists invented a number of [[surrealist techniques]] (such as [[cubomania]], [[Surrealist techniques|entoptic graphomania]], and the movement of liquid down a vertical surface) that purported to take automatism to an absurd point, and the name given, "[[surautomatism]]", implies that the methods "go beyond" automatism, but this position is controversial.

==Paul-Emile Borduas==
The notion of automatism is also rooted in the artistic movement of the same name founded by Montreal artist [[Paul-Emile Borduas]] in 1942; himself influenced by the [[Dadaist]] movement as well as André Breton. He, as well as a dozen other artists from Quebec's artistic scene, very much under restrictive and authoritarian rule in that period, signed the ''Global Refusal'' manifesto, in which the artists called upon North American society (specifically in the culturally unique environment of [[Quebec]]), to take notice and act upon the societal evolution projected by these new cultural [[paradigms]] opened by the Automatist movement as well as other influences in the 1940s.

==Contemporary techniques==
The [[computer]], like the [[typewriter]], can be used to produce [[automatic writing]] and [[Surrealist techniques|automatic poetry]]. The practice of automatic drawing, originally performed with pencil or pen and paper, has also been adapted to [[computer mouse|mouse]] and [[computer display|monitor]], and other automatic methods have also been either adapted from non-[[digital media]], or invented specifically for the computer. For instance, filters have been automatically run in some bitmap editor programs such as [[Photoshop]] and [[GIMP]], and computer-controlled brushes have been used to "simulate" automatism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verostko.com/gallery.html Pathway Studio Gallery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sutton Hoo''', near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], [[Suffolk]], is the site of two 6th- and early 7th-century cemeteries. One cemetery contained an undisturbed [[ship burial|ship-burial]], including a wealth of [[Anglo-Saxon art]]efacts of outstanding art-historical and [[archaeological]] significance, most of which are now in the [[British Museum]] in London. The site is in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

Sutton Hoo is of primary importance to [[early middle ages|early medieval]] historians because it sheds light on a period of English history that is on the margin between myth, legend, and historical documentation. Use of the site culminated at a time when [[Rædwald of East Anglia|Rædwald]], the ruler of the [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Angles]], held senior power among the English people and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of Christian rulership in England; it is generally thought most likely that he is the person buried in the ship. The site has been vital in understanding the Anglo-Saxon [[Kingdom of East Anglia]] and the whole early Anglo-Saxon period.

The ship-burial, probably dating from the early 7th century and excavated in 1939, is one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, far-reaching connections, the quality and beauty of its contents, and the profound interest of the burial ritual itself. The initial excavation was privately sponsored by the landowner. When the significance of the find became apparent, national experts took over. Subsequent archaeological campaigns, particularly in the late 1960s and late 1980s, have explored the wider site and many other individual burials. The most significant artefacts from the ship-burial, displayed in the British Museum, are those found in the burial chamber, including a suite of metalwork dress fittings in gold and gems, a ceremonial helmet, shield and sword, a [[lyre]], and many pieces of silver plate from [[Byzantium]]. The ship-burial has, from the time of its discovery, prompted comparisons with the world described in the heroic [[Old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', which is set in [[Geatland|southern Sweden]]. It is in that region, especially at [[Vendel]], that close archaeological parallels to the ship-burial are found, both in its general form and in details of the military equipment contained in the burial.

Although it is the ship-burial that commands the greatest attention from tourists, two separate cemeteries also have rich historical meaning because of their position in relation to the [[River Deben|Deben]] estuary and the [[North Sea]], and their relation to other sites in the immediate neighborhood. Of the two grave fields found at Sutton Hoo, one (the "Sutton Hoo cemetery") had long been known to exist because it consists of a group of approximately 20 [[Anglo-Saxon burial mounds|earthen burial mounds]] that rise slightly above the horizon of the hill-spur when viewed from the opposite bank. The other, called here the "new" burial ground, is situated on a second hill-spur close to the present Exhibition Hall, about 500&amp;nbsp;m upstream of the first. It was discovered and partially explored in 2000 during preliminary work for the construction of the hall. This site also had burials under mounds but was not known because these mounds had long since been flattened by agricultural activity. There is a visitor centre with many original and replica artefacts and a reconstruction of the ship-burial chamber. The burial field can be toured in the summer months and at weekends and school holidays year-round.

== Location ==

[[File:Wicklaw and Ipswich.jpg|thumb|right|The Wicklaw region]]
Sutton Hoo is the name of an area spread along the bank of the River Deben opposite the harbour of the small Suffolk town of [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], about 7&amp;nbsp;miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) from the [[North Sea]], overlooking the tidal [[estuary]] a little below the lowest convenient fording place.{{#tag:ref|A full description of the locality and environment has been produced by [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=1–98}}|group=note}} It formed a path of entry into East Anglia during the [[migration period|period that followed the end of Roman imperial rule]] in the 5th century.{{sfn|West|1998|pp=261–275}}

South of Woodbridge, there are 6th-century burial grounds at [[Rushmere St Andrew|Rushmere]], [[Little Bealings]], and [[Tuddenham St Martin]]{{sfn|West|1998|pp=9–10, 92–93, 99}} and circling Brightwell Heath, the site of mounds that date from the [[Bronze Age]].{{sfn|West|1998|pp=12–13}} There are cemeteries of a similar date at [[Rendlesham]] and [[Ufford, Suffolk|Ufford]].{{sfn|West|1998|pp=91, 100–101}} A ship-burial at [[Snape boat grave|Snape]] is the only one in England that can be compared to the example at Sutton Hoo.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|pp=114–140}}

The territory between the Orwell and the watersheds of the Alde and Deben rivers may have been an early centre of royal power, originally centred upon Rendlesham or Sutton Hoo, and a primary component in the formation of the East Anglian kingdom:{{#tag:ref|Archaeological studies of this region include the East Anglian Kingdom project and, since 1974, the Ipswich Excavation Project, undertaken for [[Suffolk County Council]] and spearheaded by Keith Wade.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}|group=note}} In the early 7th century, Gipeswic (modern [[Ipswich]]) began its growth as a centre for foreign trade,{{sfn|Wade|2001}} [[Botolph]]'s monastery at [[Iken]] was founded by royal grant in 654,{{sfn|West|Scarfe|Cramp|1984}} and [[Bede]] identified Rendlesham as the site of [[Æthelwold of East Anglia|Æthelwold's]] royal dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Ecclesiastica, iii.22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce-Mitford 1974, 73&amp;ndash;113; however Kingston near Woodbridge (nearly opposite Sutton Hoo) is "another possibility" (see Scarfe 1986, 4, 30).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early settlement ==

=== Neolithic and Bronze Age ===

There is evidence that Sutton Hoo was occupied during the [[Neolithic]] period, {{circa}} 3000 BCE, when woodland in the area was cleared by agriculturalists. They dug small pits that contained [[flint]]-tempered [[earthenware]] pots. Several pits were near to hollows where large trees had been uprooted: the Neolithic farmers may have associated the hollows with the pots.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=94–96}}

During the Bronze Age, when agricultural communities living in Britain were adopting the newly introduced technology of metalworking, timber-framed [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]] were built at Sutton Hoo, with [[wattle and daub]] walling and [[Thatching|thatched]] roofs. The best surviving example contained a ring of upright posts, up to {{convert|30|mm|in}} in diameter, with one pair suggesting an entrance to the south-east. In the central [[hearth]], a [[faience]] bead had been dropped. The farmers who dwelt in this house used decorated [[Beaker culture|Beaker-style]] pottery, cultivated [[barley]], [[oats]], and [[wheat]], and collected [[hazelnut]]s. They dug ditches that marked the surrounding grassland into sections, indicating land ownership. The acidic sandy soil eventually become [[Leaching (agriculture)|leached]] and infertile, and it was likely that for this reason, the settlement was eventually abandoned, to be replaced in the Middle Bronze Age (1500-1000 BCE) by sheep or cattle, which were enclosed by wooden stakes.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=97–99}}

=== Iron Age and Romano-British period ===

During the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], [[iron]] replaced [[copper]] and [[bronze]] as the dominant form of metal used in the British Isles. In the Middle Iron Age (around 500 BCE), people living in the Sutton Hoo area began to grow crops again, dividing the land into small enclosures now known as [[Celtic field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of narrow trenches implies [[grape]] cultivation, whilst in other places, small pockets of dark soil indicate that big [[cabbage]]s may have been grown.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=100}} This cultivation continued into the [[Roman Britain|Romano-British period]], from 43 to around 410. Life for the Britons remained unaffected by the arrival of the Romans. Several artefacts from the period, including a few fragments of pottery and a discarded [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]], have been found. As the peoples of Western Europe were encouraged by the Empire to maximise the use of land for growing crops, the area around Sutton Hoo suffered degradation and soil loss. It was eventually abandoned and became overgrown.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=100}}

== Anglo-Saxon cemetery ==

=== Background ===

{{Further|Burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England|Kingdom of East Anglia}}
[[Image:Williamson p16 3.svg|300px|thumb|right|The kingdom of East Anglia during the early Anglo/Angle-Saxon period, with Sutton Hoo in the south-eastern area near to the coast]]
Following the withdrawal of the Romans from southern Britain after 410, the remaining population slowly adopted the language, customs and beliefs of the Germanic [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]]. Much of the process may have been due to [[cultural appropriation]], as there was a widespread migration into Britain. The people who arrived may have been relatively small in numbers and aggressive toward the local populations they encountered.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=100–101}}

The [[Anglo-Saxons]] developed new cultural traits. Their language developed into Old English, a [[Germanic language]] that was different from the languages previously spoken in Britain, and they were [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagans]], following a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion. Differences in their daily [[material culture]] changed, as they stopped living in roundhouses and constructed rectangular timber homes similar to those found in Denmark and northern Germany. Their jewellery began to exhibit the increasing influence of [[Migration Period Art]] from continental Europe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

During this period, southern Britain became divided up into a number of small independent kingdoms. Several pagan cemeteries from the kingdom of the East Angles have been found, most notably at [[Spong Hill]] and Snape, where a large number of cremations and inhumations were found. Many of the graves were accompanied by [[grave goods]], which included combs, tweezers and [[brooch]]es, as well as weapons. Sacrificed animals had been placed in the graves.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=103–104}}

At the time when the Sutton Hoo cemetery was in use, the River Deben would have formed part of a busy trading and transportation network. A number of settlements grew up along the river, most of which would have been small farmsteads, although it seems likely that there was a larger administrative centre as well, where the local aristocracy held court. Archaeologists have speculated that such a centre may have existed at Rendlesham, [[Melton, Suffolk|Melton]], [[Bromeswell]] or at Sutton Hoo. It has been suggested that the burial mounds used by wealthier families were later appropriated as sites for early churches. In such cases, the mounds would have been destroyed before the churches were constructed.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=107}}

The Sutton Hoo grave field contained about twenty [[Tumulus|barrows]]; it was reserved for people who were buried individually with objects that indicated that they had exceptional wealth or prestige. It was used in this way from around 575 to 625 and contrasts with the Snape cemetery, where the ship-burial and furnished graves were added to a graveyard of buried pots containing cremated ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/exhibit/sutton-hoo-anglo-saxon-ship-burial/gQOPNM9M|title=Sutton Hoo: Anglo-Saxon ship burial - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2017-08-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== The cremations and inhumations, Mounds 17 and 14 ===

[[Image:Sutton Hoo map 2.svg|left|thumb|Mound 17 (orange), Mound 14 (purple), inhumations (green), and cremation graves (blue) at Sutton Hoo]]
[[Martin Carver]] believes that the [[cremation]] burials at Sutton Hoo were "among the earliest" in the cemetery.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=107}} Two were excavated in 1938. Under Mound 3 were the ashes of a man and a horse placed on a wooden trough or dugout [[bier]], a [[Franks|Frankish]] iron-headed [[francisca|throwing-axe]], and imported objects from the eastern [[Mediterranean]], including the lid of a bronze [[ewer]], part of a miniature carved [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] depicting a [[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victory]], and fragments of decorated bone from a [[casket]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=108–110, 112–115, 125–126}} Under Mound 4 was the cremated remains of a man and a woman, with a horse and perhaps also a dog, as well as fragments of bone gaming-pieces.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=124–125, 131}}

In Mounds 5, 6, and 7, Carver found cremations deposited in bronze bowls. In Mound 5 &lt;!-- The man buried in had died from head wounds. --&gt; were found gaming-pieces, small iron shears, a cup, and an [[ivory]] box. Mound 7 also contained gaming-pieces, as well as an iron-bound bucket, a sword-belt fitting and a drinking vessel, together with the remains of horse, cattle, [[red deer]], sheep, and pig that had been burnt with the deceased on a [[pyre]]. Mound 6 contained cremated animals, gaming-pieces, a sword-belt fitting, and a comb. The Mound 18 grave was very damaged, but of similar kind.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=107–110}} Two cremations were found during the 1960s exploration to define the extent of Mound 5, together with two inhumations and a pit with a skull and fragments of decorative [[Foil (metal)|foil]].{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1975|1pp=230–344|Evans|2001|2p=54}} In level areas between the mounds, Carver found three furnished inhumations. One small mound held a child's remains, along with his buckle and miniature spear. A man's grave included two belt buckles and a knife, and that of a woman contained a leather bag, a pin and a [[Chatelaine (chain)|chatelaine]].{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=113–116}}

[[File:Sutton.Hoo.Mound17.JorViking.jpg|thumb|Finds from Mound 17]]
The most impressive of the burials without a chamber is that of a young man who was [[Horse burial|buried with his horse]],&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 92, 133, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; in Mound 17.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', 81&amp;ndash;90, 110&amp;ndash;116, plates III-V.&lt;/ref&gt; The horse would have been sacrificed for the funeral, in a ritual sufficiently standardised to indicate a lack of sentimental attachment to it. Two undisturbed grave-hollows existed side-by-side under the mound. The man's oak [[coffin]] contained his [[Pattern welding|pattern welded]] sword on his right and his sword-belt, wrapped around the blade, which had a bronze buckle with [[garnet]] [[cloisonné]] cellwork, two pyramidal strapmounts and a [[scabbard]]-buckle. By the man's head was a [[firesteel]] and a leather pouch, containing rough garnets and a piece of [[millefiori]] glass. Around the coffin were two spears, a shield, a small [[cauldron]] and a bronze bowl, a pot, an iron-bound bucket and some animal ribs. In the north-west corner of his grave was a [[bridle]], mounted with circular gilt bronze plaques with [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;The analysis of the bridle and mounts is presented by Angela Evans in Carver 2005, 201–281.&lt;/ref&gt; These items are on display at Sutton Hoo.

Inhumation graves of this kind are known from both England and Germanic continental Europe,{{#tag:ref|The example from Eschwege, Niederhonen in the Lower Werra valley, a tributary of the River Weser, is displayed at [[Kassel]] Museum, Germany.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}|group=note}} with most dating from the 6th or early 7th century. In about 1820, an example was excavated at [[Witnesham]].{{sfn|Plunkett|2005|pp=51–53}} There are other examples at [[Lakenheath]] in western Suffolk and in the Snape cemetery:{{sfn|Caruth|Anderson|1999}} Other examples have been inferred from records of the discovery of horse furniture at [[Eye, Suffolk|Eye]] and [[Mildenhall, Suffolk|Mildenhall]].{{sfn|West|1998|pp=31–32, 83–86}}

Although the grave under Mound 14 had been destroyed almost completely by robbing, apparently during a heavy rainstorm, it had contained exceptionally high-quality goods belonging to a woman. These included a chatelaine, a kidney-shaped purse-lid, a bowl, several buckles, a dress-fastener, and the hinges of a casket, all made of silver, and also a fragment of embroidered cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 81&amp;ndash;82, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mound 2 ===

[[File:Sutton Hoo Burial Mound cleaned.jpg|right|thumb|Mound 2 is the only Sutton Hoo [[tumulus]] to have been reconstructed to its estimated original height]]
This important grave, damaged by looters, was probably the source of the many iron ship-[[rivets]] found at Sutton Hoo in 1860. In 1938, when the mound was excavated, iron rivets were found, which enabled the Mound 2 grave to be interpreted as a small boat.&lt;ref&gt;For the original discovery and finds, and their analysis, see Bruce-Mitford 1975, 104&amp;ndash;117, 110&amp;ndash;111.&lt;/ref&gt; Carver's re-investigation revealed that there was a rectangular [[Plank (wood)|plank]]-lined chamber, {{convert|5|m}} long by {{convert|2|m}} wide, sunk below the land surface, with the body and grave-goods laid out in it. A small ship had been placed over this in an east–west alignment, before a large earth mound was raised.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 75&amp;ndash;81, 116&amp;ndash;121.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Analytical chemistry|Chemical analysis]] of the chamber floor has suggested the presence of a body in the south-western corner. The goods found included fragments of a [[Anglo-Saxon glass|blue glass]] cup with a trailed decoration, similar to the recent find from the [[Royal Saxon tomb in Prittlewell|Prittlewell tomb]] in [[Essex]]. There were two gilt-bronze discs with [[Animal style|animal interlace ornament]], a bronze brooch, a silver buckle, and a gold-coated stud from a buckle. Four objects had a special kinship with the Mound 1 finds: the tip of a sword blade showed elaborate [[pattern welding]]; silver-gilt drinking horn-mounts (struck from the same dies as those in Mound 1); and the similarity of two fragments of dragon-like mounts or plaques.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=115–121}} Although the rituals were not identical, the association of the contents of the grave shows a connection between the two burials.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', 79&amp;ndash;81&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The execution burials ===

[[File:Sutton.Hoo.Body.JorViking.jpg|180px|thumb|"Sand body" preserved for museum display]]
The cemetery also contained bodies of people who had died violently, in some cases by [[hanging]] or [[decapitation]]. Often the [[bone]]s had not survived, but the fleshy parts of the bodies had stained the sandy soil: the soil was [[laminate]]d as work progressed, so that the [[Emaciation|emaciated]] figures of the dead could be revealed. Casts were taken of several of these.

The identification and discussion of these burials was led by Carver.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 72&amp;ndash;75 137&amp;ndash;147.&lt;/ref&gt; Two main groups were excavated, with one arranged around Mound 5 and the other situated beyond the barrow cemetery limits in the field to the east. It is thought that a [[gallows]] once stood on Mound 5, in a prominent position near to a significant river-crossing point, and that the graves contained the bodies of criminals, possibly executed from the 8th and 9th centuries onwards.

=== The new grave field ===

In 2000, a Suffolk County Council team excavated the site intended for the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]'s new [[visitor center|visitor centre]], north of Tranmer House, at a point where the ridge of the Deben valley veers westwards to form a [[promontory]]. When the [[topsoil]] was removed, early Anglo-Saxon burials were discovered in one corner, with some possessing high-status objects.&lt;ref&gt;Described by Jon Newman in Carver 2005,483–487.&lt;/ref&gt; The area had first attracted attention with the discovery of part of a 6th-century bronze vessel, of eastern Mediterranean origin, that had probably formed part of a furnished burial. The outer surface of the so-called "Bromewell bucket" was decorated with a [[Syria]]n- or [[Nubia]]n-style [[frieze]], depicting naked warriors in combat with leaping lions, and had an inscription in [[Greek language|Greek]] that translated as "Use this in good health, Master Count, for many happy years."{{sfn|Mango|Mango|Evans|Hughes|1989|p=297}}

In an area near to a former [[rose]] garden, a group of moderate-sized burial mounds was identified. They had long since been levelled, but their position was shown by circular ditches that each enclosed a small deposit indicating the presence of a single burial, probably of unurned human ashes. One burial lay in an irregular [[oval]] pit that contained two vessels, a stamped black earthenware urn of late 6th-century type, and a well-preserved large bronze [[hanging bowl]], with openwork hook escutcheons and a related circular mount at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;See the legend of [[Æthelred of Kent|Saint Æthelred]].&lt;/ref&gt; In another burial, a man had been laid next to his spear and covered with a shield of normal size. The shield bore an ornamented boss-stud and two fine metal mounts, ornamented with a predatory bird and a dragon-like creature.&lt;ref&gt;See Plunkett 2002, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The Vendel-type connections with Mound 1 were significant. --&gt;

=== Mound 1 ===
[[File:Rædwaldes byrgen æt Suþtunho.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Mound 1: posts mark the ends of the ship]]
The ship-burial discovered under Mound 1 in 1939 contained one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, far-reaching connections, the quality and beauty of its contents, and for the profound interest it generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/golden-hoard-sheds-light-on-dark-ages-1792915.html |title=Golden hoard sheds light on Dark Ages - Home News, UK - The Independent |publisher=www.independent.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-03 |first=Arifa |last=Akbar |date=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/the-timeline-of-britain/sutton-hoo.htm |title=AD 700 – Sutton Hoo: Current Archaeology |publisher=www.archaeology.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The burial ====

[[Image:Sutton Hoo map.svg|thumb|left|Mound 1 (in red) within the burial ground (possible burial mounds are coloured grey)]]
[[Image:Sutton Hoo ship-burial model.jpg|thumb|right|Model of the ship's structure as it might have appeared, with chamber area outlined]]
&lt;!-- [[:Image:Sutton.Hoo.Burial.Traedmawr.jpg|Alternate view.]] --&gt;

Although practically none of the original timber survived, the form of the ship was perfectly preserved.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Evans and R. Bruce-Mitford in Bruce-Mitford 1975, 345&amp;ndash;435; Evans 1986, 23&amp;ndash;29. For its context in symbolism, see Crumlin-Pederson 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Stains in the sand had replaced the wood but had preserved many construction details. Nearly all of the iron planking rivets were in their original places. It was possible to survey the original ship, which was found to be {{convert|27|m}} long, pointed at either end with tall rising [[sternpost|stem and stern posts]] and widening to {{convert|4.4|m}} in the beam amidships with an inboard depth of {{convert|1.5|m}} over the [[keel]] line. From the keel board, the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was constructed [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker-fashion]] with nine planks on either side, fastened with rivets. Twenty-six wooden frames strengthened the form. Repairs were visible: this had been a seagoing vessel of excellent craftsmanship, but there was no descending keel. The decking, benches and mast were removed. In the fore and [[aft]] sections, there were [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]]-shaped oar-rests along the [[gunwales]], indicating that there may have been positions for forty oarsmen. The central chamber had timber walls at either end and a roof, which was probably pitched.

The heavy [[oak]] vessel had been hauled from the river up the hill and lowered into a prepared trench, so only the tops of the stem and stern posts rose above the land surface.{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1975|1pp=176–180|Evans|1986|2pp=32–40}} After the addition of the body and the artefacts, an oval mound was constructed, which covered the ship and rose above the horizon at the riverward side of the cemetery.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=144–156}} The view to the river is now obscured by Top Hat Wood, but the mound would have been a visible symbol of power to those using the waterway. This appears to have been the final occasion upon which the Sutton Hoo cemetery was used for its original purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 132&amp;ndash;135. Several mounds remain unexcavated, see p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long afterwards, the roof collapsed violently under the weight of the mound, compressing the ship's contents into a seam of earth.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=488–577}}

==== The body in the ship-burial ====

As a body was not found, there was early speculation that the ship-burial was a [[cenotaph]], but soil analyses conducted in 1967 found [[phosphate]] traces, supporting the view that a body had disappeared in the acidic soil.&lt;ref name=BM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/who_was_buried_at_sutton_hoo.aspx |title=British Museum - Who was buried at Sutton Hoo? |publisher=www.britishmuseum.org |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216030235/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/who_was_buried_at_sutton_hoo.aspx |archivedate=16 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of a platform (or a large coffin) that was about {{convert|9|ft}} long was indicated.&lt;ref&gt;Carver 1998, 188, Ch. 3 n.13.&lt;/ref&gt; An iron-bound wooden bucket, an iron lamp containing [[beeswax]], and a bottle of north continental manufacture were close by. The objects around the body indicate that it lay with the head at the west end of the wooden structure.

Artefacts near the body have been identified as [[regalia]], pointing to its being that of a king.&lt;ref name=Ruffin&gt;{{cite book |url=https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4255&amp;context=gradschool_theses |title=Sutton Hoo: The Body in the Mound - A Thesis |author=Tanya Knight Ruffin |page=43 |publisher=Louisiana State University |date=August 2006 |accessdate=2017-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the suggestions for the occupant are [[List of monarchs of East Anglia|East Anglian kings]] because of the proximity of the [[royal vill]] of [[Rendlesham]].&lt;ref name=Ruffin/&gt; Since 1940, when [[H.M. Chadwick]] first ventured that the ship-burial was probably the grave of [[Rædwald of East Anglia|Rædwald]],&lt;ref&gt;In Phillips et al. 1940, 76&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt; scholarly opinion divided between Raedwald and his son (or step-son) [[Sigeberht of East Anglia|Sigeberht]].&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; The man who was buried under Mound 1 cannot be identified,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=683–717}} but the identification with Rædwald still has widespread scholarly acceptance. But from time to time, other identifications are suggested, including his son [[Eorpwald|Eorpwald of East Anglia]], who succeeded his father in about 624. Rædwald is the most likely of the candidates because of the high quality of the imported and commissioned materials and the resources needed to assemble them, the authority that the gold was intended to convey, the community involvement required to conduct the ritual at a cemetery reserved for an elite, the close proximity of Sutton Hoo to Rendlesham and the probable date horizons.{{#tag:ref|See, e.g., {{harvnb|Campbell|1992}}. Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 22&amp;ndash;23, says Chadwick's identification was "repeatedly endorsed by other scholars for fifty years", and that Raedwald "is still the favourite candidate"; see also pp. 172&amp;ndash;173 and notes.|group=note}}

== The objects in the burial chamber ==
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet reconstructed.jpg|thumb|right|A replica of the Sutton Hoo helmet produced for the British Museum by the [[Royal Armouries]]]]

[[David M. Wilson]] has remarked that the metal artworks found in the Sutton Hoo graves were "work of the highest quality, not only in English but in European terms".{{sfn|Wilson|1984|p=25}}

Sutton Hoo is a cornerstone of the study of art in Britain in the 6th&amp;ndash;9th centuries. George Henderson has described the ship treasures as "the first proven hothouse for the incubation of the [[Insular art|Insular style]]".&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Henderson 2004, 15&amp;ndash;29, quote at p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The gold and garnet fittings show the creative fusion of earlier techniques and motifs by a master [[goldsmith]]. Insular art drew upon Irish, [[Pictish]], Anglo-Saxon, native [[Britons (historic)|British]] and Mediterranean artistic sources: the 7th-century [[Book of Durrow]] owes as much to Pictish sculpture, British [[millefiori]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]] and Anglo-Saxon [[cloisonné]] metalwork as it does to Irish art.{{#tag:ref|See also {{harvnb|Henderson|1987}}; {{harvnb|Henderson|1999|pp=19–53}}, though the Pictish influences are seen by many, including David M. Wilson, as flowing the other way.|group=note}} The Sutton Hoo treasures represent a continuum from pre-Christian royal accumulation of precious objects from diverse cultural sources, through to the art of gospel books, [[shrines]] and [[Liturgy|liturgical]] or dynastic objects.

=== The head area: the helmet, bowls and spoons ===
{{main|Sutton Hoo helmet}}
On the head's left side was placed a "crested" and masked [[Combat helmet|helmet]] wrapped in cloths.{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1978|1pp=138–231|Evans|1986|2pp=46–49}} With its panels of tinned bronze and assembled mounts, the decoration is directly comparable to that found on helmets from the Vendel and [[Valsgärde]] cemeteries of eastern Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce-Mitford 1974, 210&amp;ndash;222; Bruce-Mitford 1986; Evans 1986, 111&amp;ndash;117; Evans 2001. cf Arwidsson 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sutton Hoo helmet differs from the Swedish examples in having an iron skull of a single vaulted shell and has a full face mask, a solid [[neck guard]] and deep cheekpieces. These features have been used to suggest an English origin for the helmet's basic structure; the deep cheekpieces have parallels in the [[Coppergate helmet]], found in [[York]].{{sfn|Evans|1986|p=49}} Although outwardly very like the Swedish examples, the Sutton Hoo helmet is a product of better craftsmanship. Helmets are extremely rare finds. No other such figural plaques were known in England, apart from a fragment from a burial at [[Caenby]], [[Lincolnshire]],{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=206, Fig. 153}} until the 2009 discovery of the [[Staffordshire hoard]], which contained many.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Leahy and Bland 2009, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The helmet rusted in the grave and was shattered into hundreds of tiny fragments when the chamber roof collapsed. Restoration of the helmet thus involved the meticulous identification, grouping and orientation of the surviving fragments before it could be reconstructed.{{#tag:ref|The fragments were used first in 1945–46{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1946|pp=2–4}}{{sfn|Martin-Clarke|1947|p=63 n.19}} by [[Herbert Maryon]] to produce the reconstructed helmet that was displayed at the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951, but were reinterpreted by [[Nigel Williams (conservator)|Nigel Williams]] in 1970–71{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=88}} using materials not previously identified and methods not previously possible. It was from this second reconstruction that a replica helmet has been based.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|pp=198–209}}|group=note}}

To the head's right was placed inverted a nested set of ten silver bowls, probably made in the [[Eastern Empire]] during the sixth century. Beneath them were two silver spoons, possibly from [[Byzantium]], of a type bearing names of the [[Apostles]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|pp=69–146}} One spoon is marked in original [[niello]]ed Greek lettering with the name of PAULOS, "Paul". The other, matching spoon had been modified using lettering conventions of a [[Franks|Frankish]] coin-die cutter, to read SAULOS, "Saul". One theory suggests that the spoons (and possibly also the bowls) were a baptismal gift for the buried person.{{sfnm|Evans|1986|1pp=59–63|Plunkett|2001|2pp=66–71}}

=== The weapons on the right side of the body ===
[[Image:Sutton Hoo (3).JPG|260px|thumb|The Great Buckle]]
On the right of the "body" lay a set of [[wikt:spear|spear]]s, tips uppermost, including three barbed [[angon]]s, with their heads thrust through a handle of the bronze bowl.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=241–272}} Nearby was a wand with a small mount depicting a [[wolf]].{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1978|1pp=394–402|Evans|1986|2pp=92–93}} Closer to the body lay the [[sword]] with a gold and [[garnet cloisonné]] pommel {{convert|85|cm}} long, its pattern welded blade still within its [[scabbard]], with superlative scabbard-bosses of domed cellwork and pyramidal mounts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/sword_from_the_ship-burial_at.aspx British Museum Highlights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021122213/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/sword_from_the_ship-burial_at.aspx |date=21 October 2012 }}, ''Sword from the ship-burial at Sutton Hoo''; Bruce-Mitford 1978, 273&amp;ndash;310; Evans 1986, 42&amp;ndash;44.&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to this and lying toward the body was the sword harness and belt, fitted with a suite of gold mounts and strap-distributors of extremely intricate garnet cellwork ornament.{{sfn|Evans|1986|pp=44–46}}

=== Upper body area: purse, shoulder-clasps and great buckle ===
Together with the sword harness and scabbard mounts, the gold and garnet objects found in the upper body space, which form a co-ordinated ensemble, are among the true wonders of Sutton Hoo. Their artistic and technical quality is quite exceptional.{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1978|1pp=432–625|Evans|1986|2p=109}}

The "great" gold buckle is made in three parts.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce-Mitford 1978, 536&amp;ndash;563; Evans 1986, 8991; Plunkett 2001, 73&amp;ndash;75. It is {{convert|13.2|cm}} long, weighing {{convert|414|g}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The plate is a long ovoid of a meandering but symmetrical outline with densely interwoven and interpenetrating ribbon animals rendered in [[chip-carving]] on the front. The gold surfaces are punched to receive niello detail. The plate is hollow and has a hinged back, forming a secret chamber, possibly for a [[relic]]. Both the tongue-plate and hoop are solid, ornamented, and expertly engineered.
[[Image:Sutton Hoo (5).JPG|260px|thumb|left|The two identical shoulder-clasps]]

Each shoulder-clasp consists of two matching curved halves, hinged upon a long removable chained pin.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=523–535, 584–589}} The surfaces display panels of interlocking stepped garnets and chequer millefiori insets, surrounded by [[interlace (art)|interlaced]] ornament of [[Animal style#Germanic animal style|Germanic Style II]] ribbon animals. The half-round clasp ends contain garnet-work of interlocking [[wild boar]]s with [[filigree]] surrounds. On the underside of the mounts are [[Lug (knob)|lugs]] for attachment to a stiff leather [[cuirass]]. The function of the clasps is to hold together the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner.&lt;ref&gt;Evans 1986, 85&amp;ndash;88. Compare, for instance, the [[Prima Porta]] statue of [[Augustus]].&lt;/ref&gt; The cuirass itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive. No other Anglo-Saxon cuirass clasps are known.

The [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|ornamental purse-lid]], covering a lost leather pouch, hung from the waist-belt.{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1978|1pp=487–522|Evans|1986|2pp=87–88}} The lid consists of a kidney-shaped cellwork frame enclosing a sheet of horn, on which were mounted pairs of exquisite garnet cellwork plaques depicting birds, wolves devouring men (or the ancient motif of the [[Master of Animals]]), geometric motifs and a double panel showing animals with interlaced extremities. The maker derived these images from the ornament of the Swedish-style helmets and shield-mounts. In his work they are transferred into the cellwork medium with dazzling technical and artistic virtuosity.

These are the work of a master-goldsmith who had access to an East Anglian [[Armory (military)|armoury]] containing the objects used as pattern sources. As an ensemble they enabled the patron to appear imperial.{{#tag:ref|That is, in the sense of the ''Imitatio Imperii Romanorum'', not meaning an actual imperial claim.|group=note}}&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Kendrick in Phillips et al. 1940, 28&amp;ndash;30; Bruce-Mitford 1975, 685&amp;ndash;690; Evans 1986, 83&amp;ndash;93; Plunkett 2005, 89&amp;ndash;96.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Sutton hoo (1).JPG|260px|thumb|[[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|Purse-lid]]]]
[[Image:Sutton Hoo (4).JPG|260px|thumb|Ornate gold belt from the treasure]]
The purse contained thirty-seven gold [[shillings]] or [[History of the English penny (c. 600-1066)#The earliest gold coinage: thrymsas|tremisses]], each originating from a different Frankish [[Mint (coin)|mint]]. They were deliberately collected. There were also three blank coins and two small [[ingot]]s.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=578–677}} This has prompted various explanations: possibly like the Roman ''[[obolus]]'' they may have been left to pay the forty ghostly oarsmen in the afterworld, or were a funeral tribute, or an expression of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;See Scarfe 1982, 30&amp;ndash;37 for an attempt to link them to the story of Raedwald.&lt;/ref&gt; They provide the primary evidence for the date of the burial, which was debatably in the third decade of the 7th century.{{sfn|Evans|1986|pp=88–89}}

=== The lower body and 'heaps' areas ===
In the area corresponding to the lower legs of the body were laid out various drinking vessels, including a pair of drinking horns made from the horns of an [[aurochs]], extinct since early mediaeval times.{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|1pp=316–346|Evans|1986|2pp=64–68}} These have matching die-stamped gilt rim mounts and vandykes, of similar workmanship and design to the shield mounts, and exactly similar to the surviving horn vandykes from Mound 2.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=117–118}} In the same area stood a set of maplewood cups with similar rim-mounts and vandykes,{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|1pp=347–360|Evans|1986|2pp=64–68}} and a heap of folded textiles lay on the left side.

A large quantity of material including metal objects and textiles was formed into two folded or packed heaps on the east end of the central wooden structure. This included the extremely rare survival of a long [[Hauberk|coat of ring-mail]], made of alternate rows of welded and riveted iron links,{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1978|1pp=232–240|Evans|1986|2p=41}} two hanging bowls,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|pp=244–262, 282–295}} leather shoes,&lt;ref&gt;See K. East in Bruce-Mitford 1983 (II), 788&amp;ndash;812.&lt;/ref&gt; a cushion stuffed with feathers, folded objects of leather and a wooden platter. At one side of the heaps lay an iron hammer-axe with a long iron handle, possibly a weapon.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983b|pp=833–843}}

On top of the folded heaps was set a fluted silver dish with drop handles, probably made in Italy, with the [[relief]] image of a female head in late Roman style worked into the bowl.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|pp=45–61}} This contained a series of small [[Burl|burr-wood]] cups with rim-mounts, combs of [[antler]], small metal knives, a small silver bowl, and various other small effects (possibly toilet equipment), and including a bone gaming-piece, thought to be the '[[Tafl games|king piece]]' from a set.{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|1pp=151–153|Bruce-Mitford|1983b|2pp=813–832, 853–874|Evans|1986|3pp=57–59, 68–70}} (Traces of bone above the head position have suggested that a gaming-board was possibly set out, as at [[Taplow burial|Taplow]].) Above these was a silver [[Ladle (spoon)|ladle]] with gilt chevron ornament, also of Mediterranean origin.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|pp=146–151}}

Over the whole of this, perched on top of the heaps, or their container, if there was one, lay a very large round silver platter with chased ornament, made in the Eastern Empire circa 500 and bearing the control stamps of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Emperor Anastasius I]] (491&amp;ndash;518).{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|1pp=4–44|Evans|1986|2pp=57–58}} On this plate was deposited a piece of unburnt bone of uncertain derivation.{{sfnm|Phillips|1940|1p=175|Bruce-Mitford|1975|2p=547}}  The assemblage of Mediterranean silverware in the Sutton Hoo grave is unique for this period in Britain and Europe.{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1974|1pp=3–4|Evans|1986|2p=57}}

=== The west and east walls ===

Along the inner west wall (i.e. the head end) at the north-west corner stood a tall iron stand with a grid near the top.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce-Mitford 1978, 403&amp;ndash;431. This has been interpreted as a flambeau or a standard.&lt;/ref&gt; Beside this rested a very large circular shield,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=1–129}} with a central boss, mounted with garnets and with die-pressed plaques of interlaced animal ornament.{{#tag:ref|''Pressblech'' metal foils were impressed in a single operation using a hard die over a softer supporting surface, unlike [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]] work in which the pattern is raised manually.{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=109–114}}|group=note}} The shield front displayed two large emblems with garnet settings, one a composite metal predatory bird and the other a flying dragon. It also bore animal-ornamented sheet strips directly die-linked to examples from the early cemetery at Vendel{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927}} near [[Old Uppsala]] in Sweden.{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1986|Evans|1986|2pp=49–55, 111–119}} A small bell, possibly for an animal, lay nearby.

Along the wall was a long square-sectioned [[whetstone (tool)|whetstone]], tapered at either end and carved with human faces on each side. A ring mount, topped by a bronze antlered stag figurine, was fixed to the upper end, possibly made to resemble a late Roman consular [[sceptre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/sceptre_from_sutton_hoo.aspx British Museum Highlights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018180142/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/sceptre_from_sutton_hoo.aspx |date=18 October 2015 }}, ''Sceptre from the ship-burial at Sutton Hoo''; Bruce-Mitford 1978, 311&amp;ndash;393; Bruce-Mitford 1986; Evans 1986, 83&amp;ndash;5; Plunkett 2001, 71&amp;ndash;73.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the sceptre has generated considerable debate and a number of theories, some of which point to the potential [[Deer in mythology|religious significance of the stag]].&lt;ref name=ANGSAXCAM&gt;Campbell, James. ''The Anglo-Saxons'' (1991) {{ISBN|0-14-014395-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; South of the septre was an iron-bound wooden bucket, one of several in the grave.&lt;ref&gt;The Sutton Hoo tubs and buckets are described by K. East in Bruce-Mitford 1983 (II), 554&amp;ndash;596.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south-west corner was a group of objects which may have been hung up, but when discovered, were compressed together. They included a [[Copt#History|Coptic]] or eastern Mediterranean bronze bowl with drop handles and figures of animals,{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1983b|1pp=732–757|Evans|1986|2p=63}} found below a badly deformed six-stringed Anglo-Saxon lyre in a beaver-skin bag, of a Germanic type found in wealthy Anglo-Saxon and north European graves of this date.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce-Mitford 1974, 188&amp;ndash;197; Bruce-Mitford 1983 (II), 611&amp;ndash;731; Evans 1986, 69&amp;ndash;72. The lyre was at first reconstructed as a single-armed [[harp]] with horizontal [[Resonator|soundbox]].&lt;/ref&gt; Uppermost was a large and exceptionally elaborate three-hooked [[hanging bowl]] of Insular production, with [[Champlevé|champleve]] [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and millefiori mounts showing fine-line spiral ornament and red cross motifs and with an enamelled metal fish mounted to swivel on a pin within the bowl.&lt;ref&gt;T.D.

[[Image:2008-05-17-SuttonHoo Burial.jpg|thumb|right|The recreated burial-ship at Sutton Hoo]]

At the east end of the chamber, near the north corner, stood an iron-bound tub of [[Taxus|yew]] containing a smaller bucket. To the south were two small bronze [[cauldrons]], which were probably hung against the wall. A large carinated bronze cauldron, similar to the example from a chamber-grave at [[Taplow]], with iron mounts and two ring-handles was hung by one handle.&lt;ref&gt;See A.C. Evans in Bruce-Mitford 1983 (II), 480&amp;ndash;510.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby lay an iron chain almost {{convert|3.5|m}} long, of complex ornamental sections and wrought links, for suspending a cauldron from the beams of a large hall. The chain was the product of a British tradition dating back to pre-Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;See V.H. Fenwick in Bruce-Mitford 1983 (II), 511&amp;ndash;553.&lt;/ref&gt; All these items were of a domestic character.

=== Textiles ===
The burial chamber was evidently rich in textiles, represented by many fragments preserved, or by chemicals formed by [[corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;See E. Crowfoot in Bruce-Mitford 1983 (II), 409&amp;ndash;479.&lt;/ref&gt; They included quantities of [[twill]], possibly from [[cloaks]], blankets or hangings, and the remains of cloaks with characteristic long-pile weaving. There appear to have been more exotic coloured hangings or spreads, including some (possibly imported) woven in stepped lozenge patterns using a Syrian technique in which the [[weft]] is looped around the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] to create a textured surface. Two other colour-patterned textiles, near the head and foot of the body area, resemble Scandinavian work of the same period.

A series of excavations in 1881&amp;ndash;83 by [[Hjalmar Stolpe]] revealed 14 graves in the village of Vendel in eastern Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbfRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Hjalmar+Stolpe+vendel+1882&amp;dq=Hjalmar+Stolpe+vendel+1882 |title=Report upon the condition and progress of the U.S. National Museum|author=United States National Museum|page= 606 |publisher=G.P.O.|year= 1892 |accessdate=2010-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the burials were contained in boats up to {{convert|9|m}} long and were furnished with swords, shields, helmets and other items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWYhnTuI2NoC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=vendel+burial+items#v=onepage&amp;q=vendel%20burial%20items&amp;f=false |title=The Scandinavians from the Vendel period to the tenth century|author=Judith Jesch|page= 47 |publisher=Boydell Press|year= 2002|ISBN=0-85115-867-6 |accessdate=2010-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1928, another gravefield containing princely burials was excavated at [[Valsgärde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SaFdpGdjvtoC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=Valsg%C3%A4rde+discovery#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A Beowulf Handbook |author=Robert E. Bjork, John D. Niles|page= 291 |publisher=U of Nebraska Press |year= 1998|ISBN=0-8032-6150-0 |accessdate=2010-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pagan custom of furnished burial may have reached a natural culmination as [[Christianity]] began to make its mark.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|pp=17–35}} The Vendel and Valsgärde graves also included ships, similar artefact groups, and many [[blót|sacrificed animals]].{{sfn|Arrhenius|1983}} Ship-burials for this period are largely confined to eastern Sweden and East Anglia. The earlier mound-burials at Old Uppsala, in the same region, have a more direct bearing on the ''Beowulf'' story, but do not contain ship-burials. The famous [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] ship-burials of [[Norway]] are of a later date.

The inclusion of drinking-horns, lyre, sword and shield, bronze and glass vessels is typical of high-status chamber-graves in England.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Taplow, Broomfield or Prittlewell&lt;/ref&gt; The similar selection and arrangement of the goods in these graves indicates a conformity of household possessions and funeral customs between people of this status, with the Sutton Hoo ship-burial being a uniquely elaborated version, of exceptional quality. Unusually, Sutton Hoo included regalia and instruments of power and had direct Scandinavian connections. A possible explanation for such connections lies in the well-attested northern custom by which the children of leading men were often raised away from home by a distinguished friend or relative.&lt;ref&gt;du Chaillu 1889, II, 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt; A future East Anglian king, whilst being fostered in Sweden, could have acquired high quality objects and made contact with armourers, before returning to East Anglia to rule.

Carver argues that pagan East Anglian rulers would have responded to the growing encroachment of Roman Christendom by employing ever more elaborate cremation rituals, so expressing defiance and independence. The execution victims, if not sacrificed for the ship-burial, perhaps suffered for their dissent from the cult of Christian royalty:{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=137–143}} their executions may coincide in date with the period of [[Mercia]]n hegemony over East Anglia in about 760&amp;ndash;825.{{sfn|Plunkett|2005|p=173}}

=== Connections with ''Beowulf'' ===

''Beowulf'', the Old English [[epic poem]] set in Denmark and Sweden (mostly [[Götaland]]) during the first half of the 6th century, opens with the funeral of great Danish king, [[Skjöldr]] (a.k.a. Scyld Scefing or Shield Sheafson), in a ship laden with treasure and has other descriptions of hoards, including Beowulf's own mound-burial. Its picture of warrior life in the hall of the Danish [[Scylding]] [[norse clans|clan]], with formal mead-drinking, [[minstrel]] recitation to the lyre and the rewarding of valour with gifts, and the description of a helmet, could all be illustrated from the Sutton Hoo finds. The interpretation of each has a bearing on the other,{{sfn|Newton|1993}} and the east Sweden connections with the Sutton Hoo material reinforce this link.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|pp=35–55}}

Sam Newton draws together the Sutton Hoo and ''Beowulf'' links with the Raedwald identification. Using genealogical data, he argues that the Wuffing dynasty derived from the [[Geatish]] house of [[Wulfing]], mentioned in both ''Beowulf'' and the poem ''[[Widsith]]''. Possibly the oral materials from which ''Beowulf'' was assembled belonged to East Anglian royal tradition, and they and the ship-burial took shape together as heroic restatements of migration-age origins.{{sfn|Newton|1993}}

Christopher Brooke in ''The Saxon &amp; Norman Kings'' [1963] - chapter III - gives copious notes regarding ''Beowulf'' and the Sutton Hoo treasure and relates the life of the chiefs in the literary work with the 1939 discovery of the ship-burial.

== Excavations ==

=== Prior to 1939 ===
[[File:1860-11-24 - The Ipswich Journal - Sutton Hoo notice.png|thumb|right|Notice in the 24 November 1860 edition of The Ipswich Journal]]
In medieval times the westerly end of the mound was dug away and a boundary ditch was laid out. Therefore, when looters dug into the apparent centre during the sixteenth century, they missed the real centre: nor could they have foreseen that the deposit lay very deep in the belly of a buried ship, well below the level of the land surface.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=147}}

In the 16th century, a pit, dated by bottle shards left at the bottom, was dug into Mound 1, narrowly missing the burial.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=147}} The area was explored extensively during the 19th century, when a small viewing platform was constructed,{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=148–153}} but no useful records were made. In 1860 it was reported that nearly two [[bushel]]s of iron screw bolts, presumably ship rivets, had been found at the recent opening of a mound and that it was hoped to open others.{{sfn|The Ipswich Journal|1860}}{{sfn|Hoppitt|1985}}

=== Basil Brown and Charles Phillips: 1938–1939 ===
{{Further|Edith Pretty|Basil Brown}}
In 1910, a mansion with fifteen bedrooms was built a short distance from the mounds and in 1926 the mansion and its arable land was purchased by Colonel Frank Pretty, a retired military officer who had recently married. In 1934, Pretty died, leaving a widow, [[Edith Pretty]], and young son, Robert Dempster Pretty.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 3&amp;ndash;4, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Following her bereavement, Mrs Pretty became interested in [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], a religion that placed belief in the idea that the spirits of the deceased could be contacted.

Mrs Pretty in 1937 decided to organise an excavation of the mounds.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=4}} Through the [[Ipswich Museum]], she obtained the services of [[Basil Brown]], a self-taught Suffolk archaeologist who had taken up full-time investigations of Roman sites for the museum.&lt;ref&gt;ODNB, Basil John Wait Brown. Brown's diaries of the 1938 and 1939 excavations are published in Bruce-Mitford 1974, 141&amp;ndash;169.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1938, Pretty took him to the site, offered him accommodation and a wage of 30 shillings a week, and suggested that he start digging at Mound 1.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=4–5}} Because it had been disturbed by earlier grave diggers, Brown, in consultation with the Ipswich Museum, decided instead to open three smaller mounds (2, 3 and 4). These only revealed fragmented artefacts, as the mounds had been robbed of valuable items.{{sfnm|Bruce-Mitford|1975|1pp=100–131|Markham|2002|2pp=12–14}} In Mound 2 he found iron ship-rivets and a disturbed chamber burial that contained unusual fragments of metal and glass artefacts. At first it was undecided as to whether they were Early Anglo-Saxon or [[Viking Age|Viking]] objects.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=100–136}} The Ipswich Museum then became involved with the excavations:{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=7}} all the finds became part of the museum's collection.

In May 1939, Brown began work on Mound 1, helped by Pretty's gardener John (Jack) Jacobs, her gamekeeper William Spooner and another estate worker Bert Fuller.{{sfn|Evans|1986}} (Jacobs lived with his wife and their three children at Sutton Hoo House.) They drove a trench from the east end and on the third day discovered an iron rivet which Brown identified as a ship's rivet.&lt;ref&gt;John Jacobs described what he and Basil Brown found in a short recorded commentary which can be heard on the aural history earpieces at Sutton Hoo National Trust Exhibition Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours others were found still in position. The colossal size of the find became apparent. After several weeks of patiently removing earth from the ship's hull, they reached the burial chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Descriptions of the excavation are given as follows: Bruce-Mitford 1975, 156&amp;ndash;222; Carver ''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 9&amp;ndash;11; Markham 2002. Bob Markham's published narrative is based on unpublished correspondence of Basil Brown and others held by the British Museum, the Ipswich Museum, and the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SHIP MED.jpg|thumb|right|A ghost image of the buried ship was revealed during excavations in 1939. Still from a film made by H. J. Phillips, brother of Charles Phillips.]]
The following month, [[Charles Phillips (archaeologist)|Charles Phillips]] of [[Cambridge University]] heard rumours of a ship discovery. He was taken to Sutton Hoo by Mr Maynard, the Ipswich Museum curator, and was staggered by what he saw. Within a short time, following discussions with the Ipswich Museum, the British Museum, the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]], and Office of Works, Phillips had taken over responsibility for the excavation of the burial chamber. Initially, Phillips and the British Museum instructed Brown to cease excavating until they could get their team assembled, but he continued working, something which may have saved the site from being looted by treasure hunters.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=12}} Phillips' team included [[W.F. Grimes]] and [[O. G. S. Crawford|O.G.S. Crawford]] of the [[Ordnance Survey]], [[Peggy Piggott|Peggy]] and [[Stuart Piggott]], and other friends and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Phillips's diary of the excavation (Carver''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 11&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive photography of the ship excavation was made by [[Mercie Lack]] and Barbara Wagstaff.

The need for secrecy and various vested interests led to confrontation between Phillips and the Ipswich Museum. In 1935&amp;ndash;6 Phillips and his friend [[Grahame Clark]] had taken control of the society. The curator, Mr Maynard then turned his attention to developing Brown's work for the museum. Phillips, who was hostile toward the museum's honorary president, Reid Moir, F.R.S., had now reappeared, and he deliberately excluded Moir and Maynard from the new discovery at Sutton Hoo.{{sfnm|Clark|1985|Phillips|1987|2pp=70–80|Plunkett|1998|3pp=182, 189|Markham|2002|4pp=8–9, 31–35}} After Ipswich Museum prematurely announced the discovery, reporters attempted to access the site, so Mrs Pretty paid for two policemen to guard the site 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, ''Sutton Hoo'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The finds, having been packed and removed to London, were brought back for a [[treasure trove]] inquest held that autumn at [[Sutton, Suffolk|Sutton]] village hall, where it was decided that since the treasure was buried without the intention to recover it, it was the property of Mrs Pretty as landowner.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=718–731}} Pretty decided to bequeath the treasure as a gift to the nation, so that the meaning and excitement of her discovery could be shared by everyone.{{sfn|Markham|2002|pp=50–54}}

When [[Second World War|World War II]] broke out in September 1939, the grave-goods were put in storage. Sutton Hoo was used as a training ground for military vehicles.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=25–26}} Phillips and colleagues produced important publications in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1940; Phillips et al., 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rupert Bruce-Mitford: 1965–1971 ===

Following Britain's victory in 1945, the Sutton Hoo artefacts were removed from storage. A team, led by Rupert Bruce-Mitford, from the British Museum's Department of British and Medieval Antiquities, determined their nature and helped to reconstruct and replicate the sceptre and helmet.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=26–31}} They also oversaw the conservation of the artefacts, to protect them and enable them to be viewed by the public.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=32}}

From analysing the data collected in 1938-39, Bruce-Mitford concluded that there were still unanswered questions. As a result of his interest in excavating previously unexplored areas of the Sutton Hoo site, a second archaeological investigation was organised. In 1965, a British Museum team began work, continuing until 1971. The ship impression was re-exposed and found to have suffered some damage, not having been back-filled after excavation in 1939. Nevertheless, it remained sufficiently intact for a [[plaster cast]] to be taken and a [[fiberglass]] shape produced. The decision was then made to destroy the impression in order to excavate underneath. The mound was later restored to its pre-1939 appearance. The team also determined the limits of Mound 5 and investigated evidence of prehistoric activity on the original land-surface.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=230–344}} They scientifically analysed and reconstructed some of the finds.

The three volumes of Bruce-Mitford's definitive text, ''The Sutton Hoo Ship-Burial'', were published in 1975, 1978 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Four physical volumes; Carver ''Sutton Hoo'', pp. 41, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Martin Carver: 1983–1992 ===
[[File:The Sandman - geograph.org.uk - 1000294.jpg|thumb|right|Recent excavations revealed a figure that had been rolled into a shallow grave]]
[[Image:Sutton Hoo Exhibition Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Sutton Hoo Exhibition Hall with [[Sutton Hoo Helmet (sculpture)|helmet sculpture]] by  [[Rick Kirby]]]]

In 1978 a committee was formed in order to mount a third, and even larger excavation at Sutton Hoo. Backed by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], the committee proposed an investigation to be led by [[Philip Rahtz]] from the [[Department of Archaeology at the University of York|University of York]] and Rupert Bruce-Mitford,{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=43}} but the British Museum's reservations led to the committee deciding to collaborate with the [[Ashmolean Museum]]. The committee recognised that much had changed in archaeology since the early 1970s. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives']] [[privatisation]] policies signalled a decrease in state support for such projects, whilst the emergence of [[post-processualism]] in [[archaeological theory]] moved many archaeologists toward focussing on concepts such as social change. The Ashmolean's involvement convinced the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries to help fund the project. In 1982, Martin Carver from the University of York was appointed to run the excavation, with a research design aimed at exploring "the politics, social organisation and ideology" of Sutton Hoo.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=45–47}} Despite opposition by those who considered that funds available could be better used for [[rescue archaeology]], in 1983 the project went ahead.

Carver believed in restoring the overgrown site, much of which was riddled with rabbit warrens.{{sfn|Carver|1998|pp=48–49}} After the site was surveyed using new techniques, the topsoil was stripped across an area that included Mounds 2, 5, 6, 7, 17 and 18. A new map of soil patterns and intrusions was produced that showed that the mounds had been sited in relation to prehistoric and Roman enclosure patterns. Anglo-Saxon graves of execution victims were found which were determined to be younger than the primary mounds. Mound 2 was re-explored and afterwards rebuilt. Mound 17, a previously undisturbed burial, was found to contain a young man, his weapons and goods, and a separate grave for a horse. A substantial part of the gravefield was left unexcavated for the benefit of future investigators and as yet unknown scientific methods.{{sfn|Carver|2005}}

The ship-burial treasure was presented to the nation by the owner, Mrs Pretty, and was at the time the largest gift made to the British Museum by a living donor.{{sfn|Carver|1998|p=22}} The principal items are now permanently on display at the British Museum. A display of the original finds excavated in 1938 from Mounds 2, 3 and 4, and replicas of the most important items from Mound 1, can be seen at the [[Ipswich Museum]].

In the 1990s, the Sutton Hoo site, including Sutton Hoo House, was given to the National Trust by the Trustees of the Annie Tranmer Trust. At Sutton Hoo's visitor centre and Exhibition Hall, the newly found hanging bowl and the Bromeswell Bucket, finds from the equestrian grave, and a recreation of the burial chamber and its contents can be seen.

The 2001 Visitor Centre was designed by [[van Heyningen and Haward Architects]] for the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. Their work included the overall planning of the estate, the design of an exhibition hall and visitor facilities, car parking and the restoration of the Edwardian house to provide additional facilities.{{sfn|Dawson|2002}}

The £5m visitor centre was opened in March 2002 by Nobel laureate [[Seamus Heaney]] who had published a [[Beowulf#Translations|translation of ''Beowulf'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Maev|title=Sutton Hoo lays out its treasures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/14/education.museums|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=The Guardian|date=14 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Concept of the Political''''' (German: ''Der Begriff des Politischen'') is a 1932 book by the German philosopher and jurist [[Carl Schmitt]], in which the author examines the fundamental nature of the "political" and its place in the modern world.  

The book was an elaboration of a journal article of the same title ("'''The Concept of the Political'''"), published in 1927.&lt;ref name=S27&gt;Carl Schmitt (1927), "The Concept of the Political", ''Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik'', '''58'''(1), pp. 1–33. Cf. George Schwab, 'Introduction', in Carl Schmitt, ''The Concept of the Political'', University of Chicago Press, 2007, p. 5 n. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
For Schmitt, the political is reducible to the existential distinction between friend and enemy. &lt;ref&gt;Edward Fairhead, 'Carl Schmitt’s politics in the age of drone strikes: examining the Schmittian texture of Obama’s enemy' (2017), ''Journal for Cultural Research'', available at: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14797585.2017.1410991&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt attacks the "liberal-neutralist" and "utopian" notions that politics can be removed of all warlike, agonistic energy, arguing conflict existed as embedded in existence itself, likewise constituting an ineradicable trait of anthropological human nature. Schmitt attempts to substantiate his ideas by referencing the declared ''anthropological pessimism'' of "realistic" Catholic (and Christian) theology. The anti-perfectibilist [[pessimism]] of Traditional Catholic theology Schmitt considers esoterically relevant to the inner ontological being of politics and political activity in the contemporary world, modern people subconsciously secularizing theological intellectual ideas and concerns. Schmitt criticizes political "radicals" as basically ignorant, deluded, pseudo-messianic in mentality, and oblivious to the stark, hard knowledge of unveiled human nature, its ''esse'', encoded in ancient theology, wherein [[Original Sin]] held central, axial place, intertwining his own ideas of meta-politics with a reformulated "metaphysics of evil".&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt;

==Publication history==
''The Concept of the Political'' was first published in 1932 by Duncker &amp; Humblot (Munich). It was an elaboration of a journal article of the same title, published in 1927.&lt;ref name=S27/&gt; The 1932 version has significant, and controversial, revisions. However, it is likely that these revisions were made in response to the reaction of [[Leo Strauss]].&lt;ref name="Meier"&gt;Meier, Heinrich. ''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: The Hidden Dialogue''. University of Chicago Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dance II''''' by [[Henri Matisse]] is a [[triptych]] [[mural]] (15 ft high by 45 ft long) in the [[Barnes Foundation]]. It was created in 1932&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/05/16/whats-so-special-about-the-barnes-collection/ ''New Barnes Building Opens, Why People are Upset'']&lt;/ref&gt; at the request of [[Albert C. Barnes]] after he met Matisse in the United  States. Barnes was an art enthusiast and long-time collector of Matisse's works, and agreed to pay Matisse a total of $30,000 for the mural, which was expected to take a year.&lt;ref name=flam&gt;Flam, Jack, ''Matisse: The Dance'', National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural was to be placed above three arches spanning the windows of the main hall of Barnes' gallery. In Nice, France, Matisse executed the mural on canvas provided by Barnes, as opposed to working on site. This was an unusual approach for such a work, but the patron had offered him complete artistic freedom, and working onsite would in any event have been impractical. 

For Matisse, the project proved to be beset with difficulties, and would end up taking him two years, leaving him physically and emotionally drained. He was also profoundly disappointed to be told on installation that Barnes had no intention of exhibiting the work to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master'', Penguin Books, London, 2006 at 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Matisse was delighted with the work itself. In a 1933 letter to his son, Matisse wrote about the installation at the Barnes Foundation: "It has a splendour that one can't imagine unless one sees it -- because both the whole ceiling and its arched vaults come alive through radiation and the main effect continues right down to the floor...I am profoundly tired but very pleased. When I saw the canvas put in place, it was detached from me and became part of the building."&lt;ref name=flam/&gt;

Some commentators consider that ''The Dance II'' mural was pivotal in enabling Matisse to return to the most essential sources of his art.&lt;ref name=flam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bois, Y-A, “The Shift”, in Turner and Benjamin, eds, Matisse, Brisbane: QAG 1995 at 98&lt;/ref&gt; For Matisse, the work highlighted aspects such as simplicity, flattening, the emphasis on colour and the use of paper cut-outs which would all go on to play an important role in his later artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;"Strange encounters", in www.artinsociety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damage during world tour==
During a 1993 hearing in the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Orphan's Court art conservator Paul R. Himmelstein argued that ''The Dance II'' suffered significant damages during a controversial world tour of highlights from the Barnes Foundation's collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=John|title=Art Held Hostage: The Battle Over the Barnes Collection|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre''' (commonly known as '''The Muny''') is an [[amphitheatre]] located in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. The theatre seats 11,000 people with approximately 1,500 free seats in the last nine rows that are available on a first come, first served basis.&lt;ref&gt;https://muny.org/free-seats/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Muny seasons run every year from mid-June to mid-August. It is run by a [[nonprofit organization]]. The current president and chief executive is Dennis M. Reagan. The current artistic director &amp; executive producer is Mike Isaacson.

==History==
[[File:Stage of Municipal Theater St Louis 1923.jpg|thumb|left|The Muny in 1923]]
In 1914, [[Luther Ely Smith]] began staging [[procession|pageant]]-[[masque]]s on Art Hill in Forest Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/jeff/historyculture/upload/luther_ely_smith.pdf Luther Ely Smith: Founder of a Memorial - nps.gov - Retrieve January 12, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1916, a grassy area between two oak trees on the present site of The Muny was chosen for a production of ''[[As You Like It]]'' produced by [[Margaret Anglin]] and starring [[Sydney Greenstreet]] with a local cast of "1,000 St. Louis folk dancers and folk singers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060413175911/http://www.muny.org/history.html "Our Historic Theatre"], Muny, Retrieved January 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, the Convention Board of the St. Louis Advertising Club was looking for an entertainment feature for its thirteenth annual convention, which was to take place June 3, 1917. Mayor [[Henry Kiel]], attorney Guy Golterman, and Parks Commissioner Nelson Cunliff stepped in and, in forty-nine days (not counting seven lost to rain), created the first municipally owned outdoor theatre in the United States. On June 5, 1917, the opera ''[[Aida]]'' was presented on what would become the Muny stage.

In 1919, the new theatre received a name: St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre, or "The Muny" for short. The first show under the Muny banner was ''[[Robin_Hood_(comic_opera)|Robin Hood]]'', which opened on June 16, 1919, and featured Mayor Kiel as [[Richard I of England|King Richard]]. Concerts were performed here prior to the opening of [[Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre (Maryland Heights, Missouri)|Riverport Amphitheatre]] in 1991.

[[File:1932 Stage of Municipal Theater St Louis The Last Waltz.jpg|thumb|left|Stage in 1932]]
In 1930, the stage was equipped with a turntable for performance purposes. It was reconstructed in 1997 due to dilapidation.  In 1994, The Muny's Board of Directors founded the Muny Kids, a select group of performers between the ages of 7 to 13 who traveled around St. Louis performing, and in the summer gave preview shows prior to the production. In 1998, the Muny Teens group was formed for the same purpose, featuring teen performers between the ages of 14 to 18.

The Chairman of the Board of the Muny in 2005-2006 was [[William H. T. Bush]] (younger brother of former President [[George H. W. Bush]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bushodonnell.com/capitalpartners/whtbush.htm Bush O'Donnell Capital Partners, LLC: Principals: William H.T.

Jones.

===Past seasons===
For a complete listing of all productions since the first season in 1919, see [[List of The Muny repertory]].

==Production==
The Muny produces all of its musicals (typically seven) in the season and operates only in the summer. During the winter, a full-time staff of fewer than twenty people prepare for the next summer season. During the season itself, the summer staff expands to include more than 500 people in various positions. All shows are rehearsed within the course of eleven days, with two technical rehearsals (one costumed, one not) being held in the two to three days before the show's opening. Shows run from Monday to Sunday, although there have been exceptions to this, particularly in recent years, when each season has had at least one production with an extended run.

==Comparison to other outdoor theatres==
[[File:Muny 2017.jpg|thumb|right|The Muny in 2017]]
The Muny website claims it is the "nation's oldest and largest outdoor musical theatre."&lt;ref&gt;[http://muny.org The Muny&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous [[amphitheatre]]s/outdoor theatres that have a larger capacity area; however, The Muny houses the largest number of seats. There is no lawn seating inside The Muny. In addition, The Muny is the largest to host only Broadway-style musical theatre.

The next largest seat capacity theatre in the United States is the [[San Manuel Amphitheater]] in California, housing 10,900 seats.

For a list of other amphitheatres see: [[List of contemporary amphitheatres]].

==Celebrities==
Since its beginning, The Muny has featured hundreds of big names in theatre, television and film on its stage, drawing inevitably huge crowds.

A history of the celebrities who have performed at The Muny, including a cast listing, can be found on The Muny's website.

==Future seasons==
During one of the last productions each summer season, survey forms are handed out to audience members. On this survey, audience members are asked to select their top seven choices from a long list of show titles.  The choices change each year, depending on which titles are available and what shows have not been produced for a number of years. The survey results contribute to (though are just one of many determining factors in deciding) show choices for upcoming seasons. In the past, The Muny chiefly operated on a five-year cycle in which a title could not be produced again until five seasons had passed{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Over the past two decades, ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'', ''[[West Side Story]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' have been the most popular titles, each receiving four productions since 1990. The 2012 Muny season was announced in October 2011, a significant shift from the typical Muny practice of officially announcing the upcoming summer season in the preceding January or February of the same year.

[[File:The Ride of the Valkyrs.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Ride of the Valkyrs'' (1909) by [[ John Charles Dollman]]]]

In [[Norse mythology]], a '''valkyrie''' ({{IPAc-en|v|æ|l|ˈ|k|ɪər|i|,_|-|ˈ|k|aɪ|r|i|,_|v|ɑː|l|-|,_|ˈ|v|æ|l|k|ər|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/valkyrie "Valkyrie"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|valkyrja}} "chooser of the slain") is one of a host of female figures who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live. Selecting among half of those who die in battle (the other half go to the goddess [[Freyja]]'s afterlife field {{lang|non|[[Fólkvangr]]}}), the valkyries bring their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, [[Valhalla]], ruled over by the god [[Odin]]. There, the deceased warriors become {{lang|non|[[einherjar]]}} ([[Old Norse]] "single (or once) fighters"&lt;ref name=ORCHARD36LINDOW104&gt;Orchard (1997:36) and Lindow (2001:104).&lt;/ref&gt;). When the {{lang|non|einherjar}} are not preparing for the events of [[Ragnarök]], the valkyries bear them [[mead]]. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by [[raven]]s and sometimes connected to [[swan]]s or [[horse]]s.

Valkyries are attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' (a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources), the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the {{lang|non|[[Heimskringla]]}} (both by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) and the {{lang|non|[[Njáls saga]]}} (one of the [[Sagas of Icelanders]]), all written—or compiled—in the 13th century. They appear throughout the poetry of [[skald]]s, in a 14th-century [[magical formula|charm]], and in various [[runic inscriptions]].

The [[Old English]] [[cognate]] terms {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} appear in several Old English manuscripts, and scholars have explored whether the terms appear in Old English by way of Norse influence, or reflect a tradition also native among the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pagans]]. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries, the [[Norns]], and the {{lang|non|[[dís]]ir}}, all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate. Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of works of art, musical works, comic books, video games and poetry.

==Etymology==
The word ''valkyrie'' derives from [[Old Norse]] ''{{linktext|valkyrja|lang=non}}'' (plural {{lang|non|valkyrjur}}), which is composed of two words: the noun ''{{linktext|valr|lang=non}}'' (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb ''{{linktext|kjósa|lang=non}}'' (meaning "to choose"). Together, they mean 'chooser of the slain'. The Old Norse {{lang|non|valkyrja}} is cognate to [[Old English]] ''{{linktext|wælcyrge|lang=ang}}''.&lt;ref name="BYOCK142-143"&gt;Byock (2005:142–143).&lt;/ref&gt; From the Old English and Old Norse forms, [[philology|philologist]] [[Vladimir Orel]] reconstructs the [[Proto-Germanic]] form {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/walakuzjǭ|wala-kuzjōn]]}}.&lt;ref name="OREL-442"&gt;Orel (2003:442).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term may have been borrowed into Old English from Old Norse: see discussion in the [[#Old English attestations|Old English attestations]] section below.

Other terms for valkyries in Old Norse sources include {{lang|non|óskmey}} ("wish maid"), appearing in the poem {{lang|non|[[Oddrúnargrátr]]}} and  {{lang|non|Óðins [[wikt:mey|meyjar]]}} ("[[Odin]]'s maids"), appearing in the {{lang|non|[[Nafnaþulur]]}}. {{lang|non|Óskmey}} may be related to the [[List of names of Odin|Odinic name {{lang|non|Óski|nocat=y}}]] (roughly meaning "wish fulfiller"), referring to the fact that Odin receives slain warriors in Valhalla.&lt;ref name="SIMEK254+349"&gt;Simek (2007:254 and 349).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Norse attestations==

===''Poetic Edda''===
Valkyries are mentioned or appear in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Völundarkviða]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'' and ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''.

====''Völuspá'' and ''Grímnismál''====
[[File:Hild, Thrud and Hløkk by Frølich.jpg|thumb|The valkyries Hildr, Þrúðr and Hlökk bearing ale in Valhalla (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
In stanza 30 of the poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', a [[völva]] (a travelling [[seeress]] in Norse society) tells Odin that "she saw" valkyries coming from far away who are ready to ride to "the realm of the gods". The völva follows this with a list of six valkyries: [[Skuld]] (Old Norse, possibly "debt" or "future") who "bore a shield", [[Skögul]] ("shaker"), [[Gunnr]] ("war"), [[Hildr]] ("battle"), [[Göndul]] ("[[wand]]-wielder") and [[Geirskögul]] ("Spear-Skögul"). Afterwards, the völva tells him she has listed the "ladies of the War Lord, ready to ride, valkyries, over the earth".&lt;ref name="DRONKE15ORCHARD193-195"&gt;Dronke (1997:15). Valkyrie name etymologies from Orchard (1995:193–195).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', Odin (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]]''), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young [[Agnarr Geirröðsson|Agnar]] that he wishes that the valkyries [[Hrist]] ("shaker") and [[Mist (valkyrie)|Mist]] ("cloud") would "bear him a [drinking] [[drinking horn|horn]]", then provides a list of 11 more valkyries who he says "bear [[ale]] to the [[einherjar]]"; [[Skeggjöld]] ("axe-age"), Skögul, Hildr, [[Þrúðr]] ("power"), [[Hlökk]] ("noise", or "battle"), [[Herfjötur]] ("host-fetter"), [[Göll]] ("tumult"), [[Geirahöð]] ("spear-fight"), [[Randgríð]] ("shield-truce"), [[Ráðgríð]] ("council-truce") and [[Reginleif]] ("power-truce").&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON57ORCHARD193-195"&gt;Larrington (1999:57). Valkyrie name etymologies from Orchard (1995:193–195).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Völundarkviða''====
[[File:Walkyrien by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Walkyrien'' (c. 1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]
A prose introduction in the poem ''[[Völundarkviða]]'' relates that the brothers [[Slagfiðr]], [[Agilaz|Egil]] and [[Wayland Smith|Völund]] dwelt in a house sited in a location called Úlfdalir ("wolf dales"). There, early one morning, the brothers find three women spinning linen on the shore of the lake Úlfsjár ("wolf lake"), and "near them were their swan's garments; they were valkyries". Two daughters of King Hlödvér are named [[Hlaðguðr svanhvít]] ("swan-white") and [[Hervör alvitr]] (possibly meaning "all-wise" or "strange creature"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD83"&gt;Orchard (1997:83).&lt;/ref&gt;); the third, daughter of [[Kjárr]] of [[Valland]], is named [[Alruna|Ölrún]] (possibly meaning "[[beer]] [[runic alphabet|rune]]"&lt;ref name="SIMEK251"&gt;Simek (2007:251).&lt;/ref&gt;). The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them—Egil takes Ölrún, Slagfiðr takes Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund takes Hervör alvitr. They live together for seven winters, until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return. Egil goes off in snow-shoes to look for Ölrún, Slagfiðr goes searching for Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund sits in Úlfdalir.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON102"&gt;Larrington (1999:102).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar''====
[[File:ValkyrieOnHorse.jpg|thumb|''Valkyrie'' (1908) by [[Stephan Sinding]] located in [[Churchillparken|Churchill Park]] at [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Kastellet]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark]]
In the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', a prose narrative says that an unnamed and silent young man, the son of the Norwegian King Hjörvarðr and Sigrlinn of Sváfaland, witnesses nine valkyries riding by while sitting atop a [[Tumulus#Scandinavia|burial mound]]. He finds one particularly striking; this valkyrie is detailed later in a prose narrative as [[Sváfa|Sváva]], King Eylimi's daughter, who "often protected him in battles". The valkyrie speaks to the unnamed man, and gives him the name ''[[Helge (name)|Helgi]]'' (meaning "the [[hallow|holy]] one"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD81"&gt;Orchard (1997:81).&lt;/ref&gt;). The previously silent Helgi speaks; he refers to the valkyrie as "bright-face lady", and asks her what gift he will receive with the [[Germanic name|name]] she has bestowed upon him, but he will not accept it if he cannot have her as well. The valkyrie tells him she knows of a hoard of swords in Sigarsholm, and that one of them is of particular importance, which she describes in detail.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON125"&gt;Larrington (1999:125).&lt;/ref&gt; Further into the poem, Atli [[flyting|flytes]] with the female [[jötunn]] [[Hrímgerðr]]. While flyting with Atli, Hrímgerðr says that she had seen 27 valkyries around Helgi, yet one particularly fair valkyrie led the band:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[[Numbers in Germanic paganism|Three times nine girls]], but one girl rode ahead,
:white-skinned under her helmet;
:the horses were trembling, from their manes
:dew fell into the deep valleys,
:hail in the high woods;
:good fortune comes to men from there;
:all that I saw was hateful to me.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON128"&gt;Larrington (1999:128).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After Hrímgerðr is turned to stone by the daylight, a prose narrative continues that Helgi, who is now king, goes to Sváva's father—King Eylimi—and asks for his daughter. Helgi and Sváva are betrothed and love one another dearly. Sváva stays at home with King Eylimi, and Helgi goes raiding, and to this the narrative adds that Sváva "was a valkyrie just as before".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON129"&gt;Larrington (1999:129).&lt;/ref&gt; The poem continues, and, among various other events, Helgi dies from a wound received in battle. A narrative at the end of the poem says that Helgi and his valkyrie wife Sváva "are said to be reincarnated".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON130-131"&gt;Larrington (1999:130–131).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hundingsbana I''====
[[File:Helgi Hundingsbane and Sigrún by Robert Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Helgi Hundingsbane]] and Sigrún (1919) by [[Robert Engels]]]]
In the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', the hero [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] sits in the corpse-strewn battlefield of Logafjöll. A light shines from the [[fell]], and from that light strike bolts of lightning. Flying through the sky, helmeted valkyries appear. Their waist-length [[Mail (armour)|mail armour]] is drenched in blood; their spears shine brightly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Then light shone from Logafell,
:and from that radiance there came bolts of lightning;
:wearing helmets at Himingvani [came the valkyries].
:Their byrnies were drenched in blood;
:and rays shone from their spears.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON116"&gt;Larrington (1999:116).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the stanza that follows, Helgi asks the valkyries (who he refers to as "southern goddesses") if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie [[Sigrún]] ("victory-[[runic alphabet|rune]]"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD194"&gt;Orchard (1997:194).&lt;/ref&gt;), informs him from her horse that her father [[Högni]] has betrothed her to [[Höðbroddr]], the son of king [[Granmar]] of the [[Nibelung|Hniflung]] clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON116-117"&gt;Larrington (1999:116–117).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the poem, the hero [[Sinfjötli]] [[flyting|flyts]] with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was "a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries", adding that all of the einherjar "had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON119"&gt;Larrington (1999:119).&lt;/ref&gt; Further in the poem, the phrase "the valkyrie's airy sea" is used for "[[mist]]".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON120"&gt;Larrington (1999:120).&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the poem, valkyries again descend from the sky, this time to protect Helgi amid the battle at Frekastein. After the battle, all the valkyries fly away but Sigrún and wolves (referred to as "the [[troll]]-woman's mount") consume corpses:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Helmeted valkyries came down from the sky
:—the noise of spears grew loud—they protected the prince;
:then said Sigrun—the wound-giving valkyries flew,
:the [[troll]]-woman's mount was feasting on the fodder of ravens:&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON121"&gt;Larrington (1999:121).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The battle won, Sigrún tells Helgi that he will become a great ruler and pledges herself to him.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON122"&gt;Larrington (1999:122).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hundingsbana II''====
[[File:Helgi und Sigrun by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|''Helgi und Sigrun'' (1901) by [[Johannes Gehrts]]]]
At the beginning of the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'', a prose narrative says that King [[Sigmund]] (son of [[Völsung]]) and his wife [[Borghild]] (of Brálund) have a son named Helgi, who they named for Helgi Hjörvarðsson (the antagonist of the earlier ''Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar'').&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON132"&gt;Larrington (1999:132).&lt;/ref&gt; After Helgi has killed King Hunding in stanza 4, a prose narrative says that Helgi escapes, consumes the raw meat of cattle he has slaughtered on a beach, and encounters Sigrún. Sigrún, daughter of King Högni, is "a valkyrie and rode through air and sea", and she is the valkyrie Sváva reincarnated.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON133"&gt;Larrington (1999:133).&lt;/ref&gt; In stanza 7, Sigrún uses the phrase "fed the [[goose|gosling]] of Gunn's sisters". Gunnr and her sisters are valkyries, and these goslings are [[raven]]s, who feed on the corpses left on the battlefield by warriors.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON133+281"&gt;Larrington (1999:133 and 281).&lt;/ref&gt;

After stanza 18, a prose narrative relates that Helgi and his immense fleet of ships are heading to Frekastein, but encounter a great storm. Lightning strikes one of the ships. The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air, among whom they recognise Sigrún. The storm abates, and the fleets arrive safely at land.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON135"&gt;Larrington (1999:135).&lt;/ref&gt; Helgi dies in battle, yet returns to visit Sigrún from Valhalla once in a burial mound, and at the end of the poem, a prose epilogue explains that Sigrún later dies of grief. The epilogue details that "there was a belief in the pagan religion, which we now reckon [is] an old wives' tale, that people could be reincarnated" and that "Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn" as another Helgi and valkyrie couple; Helgi as Helgi Haddingjaskaði and Sigrún as the daughter of [[Halfdan]]; the valkyrie [[Kára]]. The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the (now lost) work ''[[Káruljóð]]''.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON141"&gt;Larrington (1999:141).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Sigrdrífumál''====
[[File:Ring48.jpg|upright|thumb|The valkyrie [[Sigrdrífa]] says a [[Norse paganism|pagan Norse]] prayer in ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''. Illustration (1911) by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]
In the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'', the hero [[Sigurd]] rides up to Hindarfell and heads south towards "the land of the [[Franks]]". On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light, "as if fire were burning, which blazed up to the sky". Sigurd approaches it, and there he sees a ''skjaldborg'' with a banner flying overhead. Sigurd enters the ''skjaldborg'', and sees a warrior lying there—asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees the face of a woman. The woman's [[corslet]] is so tight that it seems to have grown into the woman's body. Sigurd uses his sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.&lt;ref name="THORPE180"&gt;Thorpe (1907:180).&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman wakes, sits up, looks at Sigurd, and the two converse in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a [[drinking horn|horn]] of [[mead]] to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen [[prayer]] in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named [[Sigrdrífa]] and that she is a valkyrie.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON166-167"&gt;Larrington (1999:166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative relates that Sigrdrífa explains to Sigurd that there were two kings fighting one another. Odin had promised one of these—Hjalmgunnar—victory in battle, yet she had "brought down" Hjalmgunnar in battle. Odin pricked her with a sleeping-thorn in consequence, told her she would never again "fight victoriously in battle", and condemned her to marriage. In response, Sigrdrífa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a man who knew fear. Sigurd asks Sigrdrífa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds. The poem continues in verse, where Sigrdrífa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing [[runic alphabet|runes]], mystic wisdom, and prophecy.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON167"&gt;Larrington (1999:167).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
[[File:Valkyrie (1834-1835) by H. W. Bissen.jpg|thumb|''Valkyrie'' (1835) by [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]]]]
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], valkyries are first mentioned in chapter 36 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] informs [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) of the activities of the valkyries and mentions a few goddesses. High says "there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla. They bring drink and see to the table and the ale cups." Following this, High gives a stanza from the poem ''Grímnismál'' that contains a list of valkyries. High says "these women are called valkyries, and they are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory". High adds that [[Gunnr]] ("war"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD194"/&gt;), [[Róta]], and Skuld—the last of the three he refers to as "the youngest [[norns|norn]]"—"always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle".&lt;ref name="BYOCK44-45"&gt;Byock (2005:44–45).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 49, High describes that when Odin and his wife [[Frigg]] arrived at the funeral of their slain son [[Baldr]], with them came the valkyries and also [[Hugin and Munin|Odin's ravens]].&lt;ref name="BYOCK67"&gt;Byock (2005:67).&lt;/ref&gt;

References to valkyries appear throughout the book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', which provides information about skaldic poetry. In chapter 2, a quote is given from the work ''[[Húsdrápa]]'' by the 10th century skald [[Úlfr Uggason]]. In the poem, Úlfr describes mythological scenes depicted in a newly built hall, including valkyries and ravens accompanying Odin at Baldr's funeral feast:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:There I perceive valkyries and ravens,
:accompanying the wise victory-tree [Odin]
:to the drink of the holy offering [Baldr's funeral feast]
:Within have appeared these motifs.&lt;ref name="FAULKES68"&gt;Faulkes (1995:68).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Further in chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem ''[[Eiríksmál]]'' is provided (see the ''Fagrskinna'' section below for more detail about the poem and another translation):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:What sort of dream is that, Odin?
:I dreamed I rose up before dawn
:to clear up Val-hall for slain people.
:I aroused the Einheriar,
:bade them get up to strew the benches,
:clean the beer-cups,
:the valkyries to serve wine
:for the arrival of a prince.&lt;ref name="FAULKES69"&gt;Faulkes (1995:69).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In chapter 31, poetic terms for referring to a woman are given, including "[a] woman is also referred to in terms of all Asyniur or valkyries or norns or ''dísir''".&lt;ref name="FAULKES94"&gt;Faulkes (1995:94).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 41, while the hero [[Sigurd]] is riding his horse [[Grani]], he encounters a building on a mountain. Within this building Sigurd finds a sleeping woman wearing a helmet and a [[Mail (armour)|coat of mail]]. Sigurd cuts the mail from her, and she awakes. She tells him her name is Hildr, and "she is known as [[Brynhildr]], and was a valkyrie".&lt;ref name="FAULKES102"&gt;Faulkes (1995:102).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 48, poetic terms for "battle" include "weather of weapons or shields, or of Odin or valkyrie or war-kings or their clash or noise", followed by examples of compositions by various [[skald]]s that have used the name of valkyries in said manner ([[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]] uses "Skögul's din" for "battlefield", [[Bersi Skáldtorfuson]] uses "Gunnr's fire" for "sword" and "Hlökk's snow" for "battle", [[Einarr Skúlason]] uses "Hildr's sail" for "shield" and "Göndul's crushing wind" for "battle" and [[Einarr Helgason|Einarr skálaglamm]] uses "Göndul's din"). Chapter 49 gives similar information when referring to weapons and armor (though the term "death-maidens"—Old Norse ''valmeyjar''—instead of "valkyries" is used here), with further examples.&lt;ref name="FAULKES117-119"&gt;Faulkes (1995:117–119).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 57, within a list of names of [[ásynjur]] (and after alternate names for the goddess [[Freyja]] are provided), a further section contains a list of "Odin's maids"; valkyries: Hildr, Göndul, Hlökk, Mist, Skögul. And then an additional four names; Hrund, [[Eir]], Hrist and Skuld. The section adds that "they are called norns who shape necessity".&lt;ref name="FAULKES157"&gt;Faulkes (1995:157).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manuscripts of the feature ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' section of ''Skáldskaparmál'' contain an extended list of 29 valkyrie names (listed as the "valkyries of [[List of names of Odin|Viðrir]]"—a name of Odin). The first stanza lists: Hrist, Mist, Herja, Hlökk, Geiravör, Göll, Hjörþrimul, Guðr, Herfjötra, Skuld, Geirönul, Skögul and Randgníð. The second stanza lists: Ráðgríðr, Göndul, Svipul, Geirskögul, Hildr, Skeggöld, Hrund, Geirdriful, Randgríðr, Þrúðr, Reginleif, Sveið, Þögn, Hjalmþrimul, Þrima and Skalmöld.&lt;ref name="JÓNSSON678"&gt;Jónsson (1973:678).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hrafnsmál''===
[[File:Valkyrie and raven.jpg|thumb|A valkyrie speaks with a raven in a wood-engraving by [[Joseph Swain (engraver)|Joseph Swain]] after [[Frederick Sandys]], 1862]]
The fragmentary skaldic poem ''[[Hrafnsmál]]'' (generally accepted as authored by 9th century Norwegian skald [[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]]) features a conversation between a valkyrie and a raven, largely consisting of the life and deeds of [[Harald I of Norway]]. The poem begins with a request for silence among noblemen so that the skald may tell the deeds of Harald Fairhair. The narrator states that they once overheard a "high-minded", "golden-haired" and "white-armed" maiden speaking with a "glossy-beaked raven". The valkyrie considers herself wise, understands the speech of birds, is further described as having a white-throat and sparkling eyes, and she takes no pleasure in men:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Wise thought her the valkyrie; were welcome never
:men to the bright-eyed one, her who the birds' speech knew well.
: Greeted the light-lashed maiden, the lily-throated woman,
:The [[ymir|hymir]]'s-skull-cleaver as on cliff he was perching.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The valkyrie, previously described as fair and beautiful, then speaks to the gore-drenched and corpse-reeking raven:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:"How is it, ye ravens—whence are ye come now
:with beaks all gory, at break of morning?
:Carrion-reek ye carry, and your claws are bloody.
:Were ye near, at night-time, where ye knew of corpses?"&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER54"&gt;Hollander (1980:54).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The black raven shakes himself, and he responds that he and the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER54-57"&gt;Hollander (1980:54–57).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Njáls saga''===
[[File:Henry De Groux001.jpg|thumb|''Ride of the Valkyries'' (around 1890) by [[Henry De Groux]]]]
In chapter 157 of ''[[Njáls saga]]'', a man named Dörruð witnesses 12 people riding together to a stone hut on [[Good Friday]] in [[Caithness]]. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, and that they have set up a particular [[loom]]; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]], a sword is the [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]], and the [[reel]]s are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called ''[[Darraðarljóð]]'', which Dörruð memorizes.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER66"&gt;Hollander (1980:66).&lt;/ref&gt;

The song consists of 11 stanzas, and within it the valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] (fought outside [[Dublin]] in 1014 [[Common Era|CE]]). Of the 12 valkyries weaving, six have their names given in the song: Hildr, [[Hjörþrimul]], [[Sanngriðr]], [[Svipul]], [[Guðr]] and Göndul. Stanza 9 of the song reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Now awful it is to be without,
:as blood-red rack races overhead;
:is the welkin gory with warriors' blood
:as we valkyries war-songs chanted.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER68"&gt;Hollander (1980:68).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the end of the poem, the valkyries sing "start we swiftly with steeds unsaddled—hence to battle with brandished swords!"&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER68/&gt; The prose narrative picks up again, and says that the valkyries tear their loom down and into pieces. Each valkyrie holds on to what she has in her hands. Dörruð leaves the chink in the wall and heads home, and the women mount their horses and ride away; six to the south and six to the north.&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER66/&gt;

===''Heimskringla''===
[[File:The Valkyrie's Vigil.jpg|thumb|''The Valkyrie's Vigil'' (1906) by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
At the end of the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' saga ''[[Hákonar saga góða]]'', the poem ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' by the 10th century [[skald]] [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]] is presented. The saga relates that king [[Haakon I of Norway]] died in battle, and although he is Christian, he requests that since he has died "among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you". The saga relates that shortly after Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North [[Hordaland]]. Haakon was buried there in a large burial mound in full armour and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, "words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla". The poem ''Hákonarmál'' is then provided.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER124-125"&gt;Hollander (2007:124–125).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hákonarmál'', Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to "choose among the kings' kinsmen" and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the [[kenning]] "Skögul's-stormblast" for "battle". Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that "groweth now the gods' following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads". Haakon hears "what the valkyries said", and the valkyries are described as sitting "high-hearted on horseback", wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER125"&gt;Hollander (2007:125).&lt;/ref&gt; A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''Hákon said:''
:"Why didst Geirskogul grudge us victory?
:though worthy we were for the gods to grant it?"
:''Skogul said:''
:"'Tis owing to us that the issue was won
: and your foemen fled."&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER126"&gt;Hollander (2007:126).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the "green homes of the godheads" to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf [[Fenrir]].&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER126-127"&gt;Hollander (2007:126–127).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fagrskinna''===
[[File:Heimdallr and valkyries by Frølich.jpg|thumb|An illustration of valkyries encountering the god [[Heimdallr]] as they carry a dead man to Valhalla (1906) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
[[File:Walhall by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Valhalla'' (1905) by Emil Doepler]]
In chapter 8 of ''[[Fagrskinna]]'', a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband [[Eric Bloodaxe]], [[Gunnhild Mother of Kings]] had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as ''[[Eiríksmál]]''. It describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse ''Óðinn''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'What kind of a dream is it,' said Óðinn,
:in which just before daybreak,
:I thought I cleared Valhǫll,
:for coming of slain men?
:I waked the Einherjar,
:bade valkyries rise up,
:to strew the bench,
:and scour the beakers,

:wine to carry,
:as for a king's coming,
:here to me I expect
:heroes' coming from the world,
:certain great ones,
:so glad is my heart.&lt;ref name="FINLAY58"&gt;Finlay (2004:58).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The god [[Bragi]] asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes [[Sigmund]] and [[Sinfjötli]] to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.&lt;ref name="FINLAY59"&gt;Finlay (2004:59).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ragnhild Tregagás charm===
A [[Witch-hunt|witchcraft trial]] held in 1324 in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], records a spell used by the accused [[Ragnhild Tregagás]] to end the marriage of her former lover, a man named Bárd. The charm contains a mention of the valkyrie [[Göndul]] being "sent out":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:I send out from me the spirits of (the valkyrie) Gondul.
:May the first bite you in the back.
:May the second bite you in the breast.
:May the third turn hate and envy upon you.&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"&gt;MacLeod (2006:37).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Old English attestations==
[[File:Sermo Lupi.jpg|thumb|A page from {{lang|la|[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]}}]]
The Old English {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} appear several times in Old English manuscripts, generally to translate foreign concepts into Old English. In the sermon {{lang|la|[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]}}, written by [[Wulfstan II]], {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} is used, and considered to appear as word for a human "sorceress".&lt;ref name="NORTH106"&gt;North (1997:106).&lt;/ref&gt; An early 11th-century manuscript of Aldhelm's {{lang|la|De laudis virginitatis}} (Oxford, Bodleian library, Digby 146) [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] {{lang|la|ueneris}} with {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} (with {{lang|ang|gydene}} meaning "goddess"). {{lang|ang|Wælcyrge}} is used to translate the names of the [[Classical mythology|classical]] [[Erinyes|furies]] in two manuscripts ([[Cotton Cleopatra]] A. iii, and the older ''Corpus Glossary''). In the manuscript Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} is also used to gloss the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]]. A description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army appears as {{lang|ang|wonn wælceaseg}} (meaning "dark one choosing the slain"). Scholarly theories debate whether these attestations point to an indigenous belief among the Anglo-Saxons shared with the Norse, or if they were a result of later Norse influence (see section below).&lt;ref name="NORTH106"/&gt;

==Archaeological record==

===Female figures and cup and horn-bearers===
[[File:Valkyrie on horse and giving valkyrie.jpg|thumb|Viking Age jewellery thought to depict valkyries. On the left of the photograph is a female mounted on horseback with a 'winged' cavalry spear clamped under her leg and a sword in her hand. The mounted female is being greeted by another female figure who is carrying a shield. On the right of the photograph is one of numerous female silver figures usually described in museums and books as valkyries (right)]]
[[Viking Age]] stylized silver amulets depicting women wearing long gowns, their hair pulled back and knotted into a ponytail, sometimes bearing [[drinking horn]]s, have been discovered throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir.&lt;ref name="SILVERFIGURES"&gt;Orchard (1997:172) and Lindow (2001:96).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because "they were thought to have protective powers".&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"/&gt;

The [[Tjängvide image stone]] from the Baltic island of [[Gotland]], Sweden features a rider on an eight-legged horse, which may be Odin's eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]], being greeted by a female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla.&lt;ref name="LINDOW276"&gt;Lindow (2001:276).&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th century [[runestone]] [[Sigurd stones#U 1163|U 1163]] features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.&lt;ref name="WESSEN621"&gt;Wessén &amp; Jansson (1953–58:621).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a small figure dated at around 800 AD was discovered in [[Hårby]], [[Denmark]] by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over the top of her dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that "there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin's valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700".&lt;ref name="KENNEDY-2013"&gt;Kennedy (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Runic inscriptions===
[[File:Rökstenen.jpg|thumb|The [[Rök Runestone]]]]
Specific valkyries are mentioned on two [[runestones]]; the early 9th century [[Rök Runestone]] in [[Östergötland]], [[Sweden]], and the 10th-century [[Karlevi Runestone]] on the island of [[Öland]], [[Sweden]], which mentions the valkyrie [[Þrúðr]].&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"/&gt; On the Rök Runestone, a [[kenning]] is employed that involves a valkyrie riding a wolf as her steed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:That we tell the twelfth, where the horse of the Valkyrie [literally "the horse of [[Gunnr]]"] sees food on the battlefield, where twenty kings are lying.&lt;ref name="ANDRÉN11"&gt;Andrén (2006:11).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the [[Bryggen inscriptions]] found in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], is the "valkyrie stick" from the late 14th century. The stick features a [[Runic alphabet|runic inscription]] intended as a charm. The inscription says that "I cut cure-runes", and also "help-runes", once against [[elf|elves]], twice against [[trolls]], thrice against [[jötunn|thurs]] and then a mention of a valkyrie occurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Against the harmful ''skag''-valkyrie,
:so that she never shall, though she never would –
:evil woman! – injure (?) your life.&lt;ref name="MACLEOD34-35"&gt;MacLeod (2006:34–35).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is followed by "I send you, I look at you, wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and ''jöluns'' wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ... (that you) love me as yourself." According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription "seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon the recipient of the charm rather than the baleful valkyrie", and they posit the final line appears "to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman".&lt;ref name="MACLEOD34-37"&gt;MacLeod (2006:34–37).&lt;/ref&gt;

MacLeod and Mees state that the opening lines of the charm correspond to the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''Sigrdrífumál'', where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa provides runic advice, and that the meaning of the term ''skag'' is unclear, but a cognate exists in ''Helgakviða Hundingsbana I'' where Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been a "''skass''-valkyrie". MacLeod and Mees believe the word means something like "supernatural sending", and that this points to a connection to the Ragnhild Tregagás charm, where a valkyrie is also "sent forth".&lt;ref name=MACLEOD34-37/&gt;

==Valkyrie names==
{{main|List of valkyrie names}}
The Old Norse poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Darraðarljóð]]'' and the ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' section of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as ''[[Sigrún]]'' (who is attested in the poems ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'' and ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]''). Many valkyrie names emphasize associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear—a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON96"&gt;Davidson (1988:96).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars propose that the names of the valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather descriptive of the traits and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the descriptive creations of [[skalds]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON+SIMEK"&gt;Examples include Davidson (1988:96–97) and Simek (2007:349).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some valkyrie names may be descriptive of the roles and abilities of the valkyries. The valkyrie name ''[[Herja]]'' has been theorised as pointing to a connection to the name of the goddess ''[[Hariasa]]'', who is attested from a stone from 187 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK143AND131"&gt;Simek (2007:143). For Hariasa, Simek (2007:131).&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''[[Herfjötur]]'' has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters.&lt;ref name="SIMEK142"&gt;Simek (2007:142).&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''[[Svipul]]'' may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over [[wyrd|wyrd or ørlog]]—a [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] concept of [[Destiny|fate]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK308"&gt;Simek (2007:308).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Old English {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and Old English charms===
[[File:Sutton Hoo Burial Mound.jpg|thumb|An Anglo-Saxon [[tumulus|burial mound]] at [[Sutton Hoo]] in [[Suffolk]], [[England]]]]
Richard North says that the description of a raven flying over the [[Egypt]]ian army (glossed as {{lang|ang|wonn wælceaseg}}) may have been directly influenced by the Old Norse concept of Valhalla, the usage of {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} in {{lang|la|De laudibus virginitatis}} may represent a loan or loan-translation of Old Norse {{lang|non|valkyrja}}, but the Cotton Cleopatra A. iii and the ''Corpus Glossary'' instances "appear to show an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] conception of {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} that was independent of contemporary [[Scandinavia]]n influence".&lt;ref name=NORTH106/&gt;

Two [[Old English literature|Old English]] charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an Anglo-Saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie-like female beings; {{lang|ang|[[Wið færstice]]}}, a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch, and ''[[For a Swarm of Bees]]'', a charm to keep [[honey bee]]s from [[swarming (honey bee)|swarming]]. In {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}}, a sudden pain is attributed to a small, "shrieking" spear thrown with supernatural strength ({{lang|ang|mægen}}) by "fierce" loudly flying "mighty women" ({{lang|ang|mihtigan wif}}) who have ridden over a burial mound:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;They were loud, yes, loud,
when they rode over the (burial) mound;
they were fierce when they rode across the land.
Shield yourself now, you can survive this strife.
Out, little spear, if there is one here within.
It stood under/behind lime-wood (i.e. a shield), under a light-coloured/light-weight shield,
where those mighty women marshalled their powers, and they send shrieking spears.&lt;ref name="HALL1-2"&gt;Hall (2007:1–2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theories have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries.&lt;ref name="GREENFIELD257"&gt;Greenfield (1996:257).&lt;/ref&gt; Richard North says that "though it is not clear what the poet takes these women to be, their female sex, riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in England as a female being analogous to the later Norse {{lang|non|valkyrjur}}."&lt;ref name="NORTH105"&gt;North (1997:105).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] theorizes that {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}} was originally a battle spell that had, over time, been reduced to evoke "a prosaic stitch in the side".&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON63"&gt;Davidson (1990:63).&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of ''For a Swarm of Bees'', the swarming bees are referred to as "victory-women" (Old English {{lang|ang|sigewif}}):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Settle down, victory-women,
never be wild and fly to the woods.
Be as mindful of my welfare,
as is each man of eating and of home.&lt;ref name="GREENFIELD256"&gt;Greenfield (1996:256).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "victory women" has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries. This theory is not universally accepted, and the reference has also been theorised as a simple metaphor for the "victorious sword" (the stinging) of the bees.&lt;ref name=GREENFIELD256/&gt;

===Merseburg Incantation, fetters, {{lang|non|dísir}}, {{lang|non|idisi}} and norns===
[[File:Idise by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Idise'' (1905) by Emil Doepler]]
[[File:The Dises by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''The Dises'' (1909) by [[Dorothy Hardy]]]]

One of the two [[Old High German]] [[Merseburg Incantations]] call upon female beings—''[[Idisi]]''—to bind and hamper an army. The incantation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Once the Idisi sat, sat here and there,
some bound fetters, some hampered the army,
some untied fetters:
Escape from the fetters, flee from the enemies.&lt;ref name="SIMEK171"&gt;Simek (2007:171).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Idisi'' mentioned in the incantation are generally considered to be valkyries. Rudolf Simek says that "these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie, as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology" and points to a connection with the valkyrie name {{lang|non|[[Herfjötur]]}} (Old Norse "army-fetter").&lt;ref name=SIMEK171/&gt; Hilda R. Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}} charm and theorises a similar role for them both.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSON63/&gt;

Simek says that the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] term ''Idisi'' ({{lang-osx|idis}}, {{lang-goh|itis}}, {{lang-ang|ides}}) refers to a "dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin {{lang|la|[[matres and Matrones|matrona]]}}" and that a link to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] term {{lang|non|dísir}} is reasonable to assume, yet not undisputed. In addition, the place name [[Idistaviso|Idisiaviso]] (meaning "plain of the Idisi") where forces commanded by [[Arminius]] fought those commanded by [[Germanicus]] at the [[Battle of the Weser River]] in 16 AD. Simek points to a connection between the name ''Idisiaviso'', the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations and valkyries.&lt;ref name="SIMEK171"/&gt;

Regarding the {{lang|non|dísir}}, Simek states that Old Norse {{lang|non|dís}} appears commonly as simply a term for "woman", just as Old High German {{lang|goh|itis}}, Old Saxon {{lang|osx|idis}} and Old English {{lang|ang|ides}}, and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, "several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the {{lang|non|dísir}} were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in {{lang|non|[[Guðrúnarkviða]]}} I 19 the valkyries are even called {{lang|non|Herjans dísir}} "Odin's {{lang|non|dísir}}". The {{lang|non|dísir}} are explicitly called dead women in {{lang|non|[[Atlamál]]}} 28 and a secondary belief that the {{lang|non|dísir}} were the souls of dead women (see {{lang|non|[[fylgja|fylgjur]]}}) also underlies the {{lang|non|[[landdísir]]}} of [[Scandinavian folklore|Icelandic folklore]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK61-62"&gt;Simek (2007:61–62).&lt;/ref&gt; Simek says that "as the function of the [[Matres and Matrones|matrons]] was also extremely varied—fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses—the belief in the {{lang|non|dísir}}, like the belief in the valkyries, norns and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses."&lt;ref name=SIMEK61-62/&gt;

[[Jacob Grimm]] states that, though the norns and valkyries are similar in nature, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Grimm states that a {{lang|non|dís}} can be both norn and a valkyrie, "but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum [fate], they sit on their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs ''ride'' to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods".&lt;ref name="GRIMM421"&gt;Grimm (1882:421).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and development===
[[File:Die Nornen (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Norns'' (1889) by [[Johannes Gehrts]]]]

Various theories have been proposed about the origins and development of the valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as "demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged", and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred "when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior's paradise". Simek says that this original concept was "superseded by the [[Shieldmaiden|shield girls]]—Irish female warriors who lived on like the ''einherjar'' in Valhall." Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin, and that this connection existed in an earlier role as "demons of death". Simek states that due to the shift of concept, the valkyries became popular figures in [[Poetic Edda#Heroic lays|heroic poetry]], and during this transition were stripped of their "demonic characteristics and became more human, and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [...]." Simek says that the majority of the names of the valkyries point to a warlike function, that most of [[List of valkyrie names in Norse mythology|valkyrie names]] do not appear to be very old, and that the names "mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk-belief."&lt;ref name="SIMEK349"/&gt;

MacLeod and Mees theorise that "the role of the corpse-choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later Norse mythology with that of the [[Norns]], the supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny [...]."&lt;ref name="MACLEOD39"&gt;MacLeod (2006:39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] says that, regarding valkyries, "evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers, in which several conceptions can be discerned. We recognise something akin to Norns, spirits who decide destinies of men; to the [[Völva|seeresses]], who could protect men in battle with their spells; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families, bringing luck to youth under their protection; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men, for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the [[Black Sea]]". She adds that there may also be a memory in this of a "priestess of the god of war, women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle."&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON61"&gt;Davidson (1990:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson places emphasis on the fact that ''valkyrie'' literally means "chooser of the slain". She compares Wulfstan's mention of a "chooser of the slain" in his ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos'' sermon, which appears among "a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers", to "all the other classes whom he [Wulfstan] mentions", and concludes as those "are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well." Davidson points out that [[Arab]] traveller [[Ibn Fadlan]]'s detailed account of a 10th-century [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] ship funeral on the [[Volga River]] features an "old [[Huns|Hunnish]] woman, massive and grim to look upon" (who Fadlan refers to as the "Angel of Death") who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that "it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god "chose" his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war." Davidson says that it appears that from "early times" the [[Germanic peoples]] "believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain."&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON61-62"&gt;Davidson (1990:61–62).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freyja and Fólkvangr===
[[File:Freya by C. E. Doepler.jpg|thumb|left|''Freya'' (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]]]]
The goddess [[Freyja]] and her afterlife field [[Fólkvangr]], where she receives half of the slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in ''Gylfaginning'' where it is said of Freyja "whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain", and interprets ''Fólkvangr'' as "the field of the Warriors". Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is [[Sessrumnir]] (which she translates as "filled with many seats"), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. Näsström comments that "still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'."&lt;ref name="NÄSSTRÖM61"&gt;Näsström (1999:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegfried Andres Dobat comments that "in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar {{Sic}} and the dísir."&lt;ref name="DOBAT186"&gt;Dobat (2006:186).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern art==
[[File:Jugend-magazine-valkyrie-rheingold-advertisement-I.jpg|thumb|upright|A valkyrie examines a bottle of [[Söhnlein]]'s "Rheingold" [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|sekt]] in a 1901 [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] advertisement]]
Valkyries have been the subjects of various poems, works of art and musical works. In poetry, valkyries appear in "''Die Walküren''{{-"}} by H. Heine (appearing in ''Romanzero'', 1847), "''Die Walküren''{{-"}} (1864) by H. v. Linge, and "''Sköldmon''{{-"}} (appearing in ''Gömda Land'', 1904).&lt;ref name="SIMEK349"&gt;Simek (2007:349).&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art depicting valkyries include ''Die Walküren'' (sketch, 1818) by J. G. Sandberg, ''Reitende Walküre'' ([[fresco]]), previously located in [[Munich]] palace but now destroyed, 1865–66 by M. Echter, ''Valkyrien'' and ''Valkyriens død'' (paintings, both from 1860), ''Walkürenritt'' ([[etching]], 1871) by A. Welti, ''Walkürenritt'' ([[woodcut]], 1871) by T. Pixis, ''Walkürenritt'' (1872) by A. Becker (reproduced in 1873 with the same title by A. v. Heyde), ''Die Walkyren'' ([[charcoal]], 1880) and ''Walkyren wählen und wecken die gefallenen Helden (Einherier), um sie vom Schlachtfield nach Walhall zu geleiten'' (painting, 1882) and ''Walkyrenschlacht'' (oil painting, 1884) by K. Ehrenberg, ''Walkürenritt'' (oil painting, 1888, and etching, 1890) by A. Welti, ''Walküre'' (statue) by H. Günther, ''Walkürenritt'' (oil painting) by H. Hendrich, ''Walkürenritt'' (painting) by F. Leeke, ''Einherier'' (painting, from around 1900), by K. Dielitz, ''The Ride of the Valkyries'' (painting, from around 1900) by J. C. Dollman, ''Valkyrie'' (statue, 1910) and ''Walhalla-freeze'' (located in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], [[Copenhagen]], 1886–87), ''Walkyrien'' (print, 1915) by A. Kolb, and ''Valkyrier'' (drawing, 1925) by E. Hansen.&lt;ref name="SIMEK349-350"&gt;Simek (2007:349–350).&lt;/ref&gt;
