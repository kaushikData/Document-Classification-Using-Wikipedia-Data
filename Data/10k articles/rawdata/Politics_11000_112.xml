'''Americanization''' is the process of an [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant to the United States]] becoming a person who shares American values, beliefs and customs by [[Assimilation (sociology)#Immigration|assimilating]] into American society. This process typically involves learning the [[American English|English language]] and adjusting to [[American culture]], values and customs.

The '''Americanization movement''' was a nationwide organized effort in the 1910s to bring millions of recent immigrants into the American cultural system.  30+ states passed laws requiring Americanization programs; in hundreds of cities the chamber of commerce organized classes in English language and American civics; many factories cooperated.  Over 3000 school boards, especially in the Northeast and Midwest, operated after-school and Saturday classes.  Labor unions, especially the coal miners, ([[United Mine Workers of America]]) helped their members take out citizenship papers.  In the cities, the [[YMCA]] and [[YWCA]] were especially active, as were organization of descendants of the founding generation such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]].  The movement climaxed during [[World War I]], as eligible young immigrant men were drafted into the Army, and the nation made every effort to integrate the European ethnic groups into the national identity.&lt;ref&gt;John F. McClymer, ''War and Welfare: Social Engineering in America, 1890–1925,'' (1980), pp. 79, 105–52&lt;/ref&gt; During the movement of immigrants to America in the 1990s, Americanization was pushed on immigrants, except by one organization, the [[International Institute of Northwest Indiana|International Institute]].

As a form of [[cultural assimilation]], the movement stands in contrast to later ideas of [[multiculturalism]].  Americanization efforts during this time period went beyond education and English learning, into active and sometimes coercive suppression of "foreign" cultural elements.  The movement has been criticized as [[xenophobic]] and prejudiced against Southern Europeans, though [[anti-German sentiment]] also became widespread after the U.S. declared war on Germany.

== Background ==
The initial stages of immigrant Americanization began in the 1830s. Prior to 1820, foreign [[immigration to the United States]] was predominantly from the [[British Isles]]. There were other ethnic groups present, such as the French, Swedes and Germans in Colonial times, but comparably, these ethnic groups were a minuscule fraction of the whole. Soon after 1820, for the first time, there began a substantial Irish and German migration to the United States. Up until 1885, immigrants were overwhelmingly Northwestern European (90% in that year) which brought a similar culture to that already existing in the U.S. maintaining stability within their bubble of natives and newcomers. By 1905, a major shift had occurred, and three-fourths of these newcomers were born in Southern and Eastern Europe. Their religion was mainly [[Roman Catholic]], [[Greek-Catholic|Greek Catholic]] and [[Jews|Jewish]]; Americanization became more difficult because of the notable contrasts of customs, habits, and ideals to those of Northern and Western European immigrants.{{example needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 1910, there were about 13,000,000 foreign-born and 33,000,000 residents of a foreign origin living in the United States. About 3,000,000 of the foreign-born over ten years of age were unable to speak English and about 1,650,000 were unable to read or write in any language. Close to half of the foreign-born populace were males of voting age; but only 4 out of every 1,000 of them were being educated to learn English and about American citizenship. In total, about five million people in the United States were unable to speak English, and of those two million were illiterate. [[World War I]] (which started in 1914) and the years immediately following represented a turning point in the Americanization process.&lt;ref name="barret" /&gt; In 1910, 34% of foreign males of draft age were unable to speak English; about half a million of the registered alien male draftees were unable to understand military orders given in English. At the same time, more immigrants displaced by the war began arriving.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

A number of Americans feared the growing presence of immigrants in the country posed a sufficient threat to the political order. Americans' awareness of and attitudes towards immigrants and their foreign relations changed dramatically with America's increasing role in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Americans' views towards immigrants were growing more negative, fearful, and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]], the United States resorted to programs of forced Americanization, as well as the immigration restriction acts of the 1920s, including the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], primarily focused on restricting immigration from Southern and Southeastern Europe, in addition, to heavily restrict immigration of Africans, and a complete ban on immigration of Arabs and Asians. At the same time, a new positive outlook of a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralist]] society began to progress.{{huh|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Origins==
The term "Americanization" was brought into general use during the organization of "Americanization Day" celebrations in a number of cities for July 4, 1915. Interest in the process of assimilation had been increasing for many years before such programs were designated "Americanization." The publication of a report of the [[United States Immigration Commission]] in 1911 marked the culmination of an attempt to formulate a constructive national policy toward immigration and naturalization and was the basis of many of the programs adopted afterwards.&lt;ref name=colliers&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Americanization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Americanization Committee was established in May, 1915, with aid from the Committee for Immigration in America in the pursuit to bring all American citizens together as one to celebrate common rights as Americans, wherever born. The committee was so effective that it turned into a powerful organization, dealing with many aspects of American society, such as governmental departments, schools, courts, churches, women's clubs, institutions, and groups as units of co-operation. This Committee was responsible for the standardization of Americanization work and methods, stimulating immigrant thought, interest and activity. Their many experiments were later incorporated into governmental, educational, and business systems of the country. Its services and publications were free.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the period of mass immigration, the main target group of Americanization projects included Jews and Catholics and from southern and southeastern Europe. Churches, unions, and  charities attempted to Americanize the new immigrants both formally through structured programs and informally at work through the environment created by management. Americanization also suggests a broader process that includes the everyday struggle of immigrants to understand their new environment and how they invent ways to cope with it.&lt;ref name="barret"&gt;James R. Barrett, "Americanization From The Bottom Up: Immigration and the Remaking of the Working Class in the United States, 1880–1930." ''Journal of American History'' (1998) 79#3 pp. 996–1020. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2080796 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

"During the late nineteenth Century, skilled Germans, British, Irish and native-born male workers built strong craft unions and settle into comfortable communities. Through their craft unions, churches, fraternal organizations, and other institutions, they created their own cultural worlds, ones that often left little room for newcomers."&lt;ref name="barret" /&gt;

Private agencies also gave high priority to Americanization projects.  The [[Ford Motor Company]] had an especially well-publicized program. Among the religious groups carrying on systematic programs of work among immigrants were most of the larger Protestant denominations, the [[National Catholic War Council]], the [[Y.M.C.A.]], the [[Y.W.C.A.]], the [[Knights of Colombus]], and the [[Y.M.H.A.]] Extensive campaigns were also conducted by od stock patriotic  organizations such as the [[National Security League]], the [[Sons of the American Revolution|Sons]] and [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], and the [[Colonial Dames of America]]. The [[United States Chamber of Commerce|National Chamber of Commerce]] and hundreds of city chambers also did systematic work. Public libraries also embraced Americanization as a patriotic duty during and after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[General Federation of Women's Clubs|National Federation of Women's Clubs]] and the [[National Council of Jewish Women]] also adopted definite and comprehensive programs of work.&lt;ref name=colliers/&gt;  The organizations assisted newcomers with naturalization papers, helped reunite families, provided interpreters, warned about fraudulent offers, provided access to lawyers, and provided information about employment.&lt;ref&gt;Paula M. Kane, ''Separatism and Subculture: Boston Catholicism, 1900–1920'' (2001) pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath the target populations learned English and adopted American life styles in speech, clothing and recreation.  They clung to their historic religions. They not only retained their traditional cuisines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Jensen Wallach|title=How America Eats: A Social History of U.S. Food and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mnuSNvXeqLAC&amp;pg=PA179|year=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=179–80|isbn=9781442208742}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also introduced the wider American public to the taste for pizza, [[bagel]]s and [[taco]]s.  Historian Vincent Cannato adds: "From sports and food to movies and music, they haven’t just contributed to the culture, they have helped redefine it."&lt;ref&gt;Vincent J. Cannato  "How America became Italian," [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-america-became-italian/2015/10/09/4c93b1be-6ddd-11e5-9bfe-e59f5e244f92_story.html ''Washington Post'' Oct 9, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social workers generally supported the Americanization movement, but not all of them. [[Edith Terry Bremer]] strongly opposed Americanization programs before the war and wrote that Americanization stimulated fear and hate. She then served as a special agent for the United States Immigration Commission  Bremer was concerned that the existing public and private agencies serving immigrants largely ignored women so she made her most important contribution by establishing the first International Institute in New York City as a YMCA experiment in December, 1910.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Notable American Women|last = Sicherman|first = Barbara|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = 105–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
Interest in the foreign born in the United States was quickened by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914. Although the United States remained neutral until April 1917, the war in Europe cast attention on the many recent immigrants in the United States.  Of special concern was the issue of their political loyalty, whether to the United States or to their mother country, and the long-term tension regarding assimilation into American society.

Numerous agencies became active, such as the Councils of National Defense, the [[United States Department of the Interior]], the [[Food Administration]] and other federal agencies charged with the task of uniting the people of the United States in support of the war aims of the government.&lt;ref name=colliers/&gt; The National Americanization Committee (NAC) was by far the most important private organization in the movement. It was directed by [[Frances Kellor]]. Second in importance was the Committee for Immigrants in America, which helped fund the Division of Immigrant Education in the federal [[Bureau of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;McClymer, ''War and Welfare'' pp. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt; While John Foster Carr, a publisher and propagandist for Americanization, was convinced that the American public library was the most effective Americanization force. He joined the American Library Association on 1913, with the hope that American libraries would use his publications in their Americanization work with immigrants. A year later he founded the Immigrant Publication Society of New York, which published his guidebooks for immigrants as well as handbooks and pamphlets on Americanization topics for librarians and social workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Frederic C. Howe]], Commissioner at [[Ellis Island]], asked mayors nationwide to make July 4, 1915, Americanization night in their communities.

===Impact of war===
Millions of recently arrived immigrants who had originally intended to return to the mother country were unable to return to Europe because of the war from [[World War I|1914 to 1919]]. The great majority decided to stay permanently in America, and foreign language use declined dramatically as they switched to English. Instead of resisting Americanization they welcomed it, often signing up for English classes and using their savings to buy homes and bring over other family members.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Archdeacon, ''Becoming American'' (1984) pp. 115, 186–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Kellor, speaking for the NAC in 1916, proposed to combine efficiency and patriotism in her Americanization programs. It would be more efficient, she argued, once the factory workers could all understand English and therefore better understand orders and avoid accidents. Once Americanized, they would grasp American industrial ideals and be open to American influences and not subject only to strike agitators or foreign propagandists.  The result, she argued, would transform indifferent and ignorant residents into understanding voters, to make their homes into American homes, and to establish American standards of living throughout the ethnic communities. Ultimately she argued it would, "unite foreign-born and native alike in enthusiastic loyalty to our national ideals of liberty and justice."&lt;ref&gt;McClymer, ''War and Welfare,'' pp. 112–13&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s===
After World War I, the emphasis on Americanization programs was gradually shifted from emergency propaganda to a long-time educational program, when a study of conditions in the draft army made by the [[United States Surgeon General]]'s office showed that 18% to 42% of the men in army camps were unable to read a newspaper or to write a letter home, and that in the Northern and Midwestern United States these illiterates were almost entirely foreign born. Indications were that barriers to any understanding of U.S. aims and interests were even more marked than this among the older men and the women in the foreign colonies of the U.S. Hundreds of Americanization agencies sprang up overnight.&lt;ref name="colliers"/&gt;

===Late 20th century===
After the 1970s proponents of [[multiculturalism]] began attacking Americanization programs as coercive and not respectful of immigrant culture. A major debate today is on whether speaking English is an essential component of being American.

== Irish ==
The Irish were the most influential ethnic group regarding the initial waves of immigration to the United States and of Americanization. Newly arrived immigrants in American cities had a hard time avoiding the Irish. There was no way around the Irish for the newcomers, as the Irish were present in every aspect of American working-class society. Between 1840 and 1890, more than 3,000,000 Irish immigrants had entered the United States, and by 1900, about 5,000,000 of their first and second generations were settled in. There were more Irish living in the United States than in Ireland. [[Irish Americans]] played a major role in the newcomer's Americanization. In other words, identity in the United States emerged from dynamic relationships among ethnic groups, as well as from particular groups' own distinct history and traditions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newer ethnic groups were not directly assimilated to the American cultural mainstream, but rather, there was a gradual process of acculturation, where newcomer immigrants acculturated to a new way of life, learning new skills and habits through their unique experiences. This form of Americanization was a process carried out partially through force and coercion, that occurred in settlement houses, night school classes, and corporate programs, where these working-class immigrants were pressed to learn [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] values. "A key to understanding the multi-ethnic American city is that most immigrants came to understand their new world less through such formal programs, than through informal contacts with the Irish and other experienced working-class Americans of diverse ethnic backgrounds in the streets, churches, and theaters."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"Inside the labor movement, the Catholic Church, and the political organizations of many working-class communities, the Irish occupied vital positions as Americanizers of later groups."&lt;ref name="barret" /&gt;

From the beginning days of foreign immigration to the United States all the way to present day America, immigrant Americanization is a very complex, 150-year process of gradual acculturation. The notion that Americanization is an easy, simple, one way process is inaccurate. The main reason behind this is that people tend to hold on to their cultures.

"The Irish who competed with African Americans for unskilled work and who were themselves labeled as "white niggers" espoused racism as part of their self-definition, as did other immigrant groups. European Americans quickly learned that the worst thing one could be in this Promised Land was "colored," and they distanced themselves as best they could from this pariah population."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By the late nineteenth century, racism was genuinely rooted in the world views of many workers and was passed on to newcomer immigrants, expediting the process of class unity.&lt;ref name="barret" /&gt;

==Jews==

[[Jacob Schiff]] played a major role as a leader of the [[History of the Jews in the United States|American Jewish community]] in the late 19th century.  At a time of increasing demand for immigration restriction, Schiff supported and worked for Jewish Americanization. A Reform Jew, he backed the creation of the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary of America. He took a stand favoring a modified form of Zionism, reversing his earlier opposition. Above all, Schiff believed that American Jewry could live in both the Jewish and American worlds, creating a balance that made possible an enduring American Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Evyatar Friesel, "Jacob H. Schiff and the Leadership of the American Jewish Community. ''Jewish Social Studies'' 2002 8(2–3): 61–72. {{issn|0021-6704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Council of Jewish Women|National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW)]], founded in Chicago in 1893, had the goals of philanthropy and the [[Americanization]] of Jewish immigrants. Responding to the plight of Jewish women and girls from Eastern Europe, the NCJW created its Department of Immigrant Aid to assist and protect female immigrants from the time of their arrival at Ellis Island until their settlement at their final destination. The NCJW's Americanization program included assisting immigrants with housing, health, and employment problems, leading them to organizations where women could begin to socialize, and conducting English classes while helping them maintain a strong Jewish identity. The council, pluralistic rather than conformist, continued its Americanization efforts and fought against restrictive immigration laws after World War I. At the forefront of its activities was the religious education of Jewish girls, who were ignored by the Orthodox community.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Korelitz, "'A Magnificent Piece of Work': the Americanization Work of the National Council of Jewish Women." ''American Jewish History'' 1995 83(2): 177–203.&lt;/ref&gt; Americanization did not mean giving up traditional ethnic foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Seltzer|title=The Americanization of the Jews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxwUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA259|year=1995|publisher=NYU Press|page=259|isbn=9780814780008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italians==
World War I closed off most new arrivals and departures from Italy.  The [[Italian American]] community supported the American war effort, sending tens of thousands of young men into the armed forces, as others took jobs in war factories. Buying war bonds became patriotic, and use of English surged as the community supported the Americanization campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher M. Sterba, ''Good Americans: Italian and Jewish immigrants during the First World War'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s the Little Italies had stabilized and grew richer, as workers gained skills and entrepreneurs opened restaurants, groceries, construction firms and other small businesses. With few new arrivals, there was less Italian and more English spoken, especially by the younger generation.&lt;ref name=Nelli545560&gt;Humbert S. Nelli, "Italians," in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) 545–60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cajuns==
The French-speaking [[Cajun]]s of southern [[Louisiana]] were not immigrants—they arrived before the American Revolution in an isolated area that allowed little contact with other groups. The Cajuns were forcefully Anglicized in the 20th century. Children were punished in school for using French; they were called names like "swamp rat" and "bougalie", forced to write lines ("I will not speak French in school"), made to kneel on kernels of corn, and slapped with rulers.&lt;ref name="Shane Bernard 2000 18"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3s3jJ4tAA68C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=Cajun+French+banned+education#v=onepage&amp;q=Cajun%20French%20banned%20education&amp;f=false |author=Shane Bernard |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2000 |title=The Cajuns: Americanization of a People |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 May 2013|isbn=9781604734966 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} French was also banned as a medium of education in 1912.&lt;ref name="Shane Bernard 2000 18"/&gt;{{rp|18}} English also gained more prestige than [[Cajun French]] due to the spread of English-language movies, newspapers and radio into [[Acadiana]].&lt;ref name="Shane Bernard 2000 18"/&gt;{{rp|20}} Wartime military service broke the crust of traditionalism for younger men, while automobiles and the highway system allowed easy movement to Anglo cities. Prosperity and consumer culture, and a host of other influences have effaced much of the linguistic and cultural uniqueness of the Cajuns.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Bernard, ''The Cajuns: Americanization of a People'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poles==
The study of [[Polish-Americans|Polish immigrants to the United States]], ''[[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]]'' (1918–1920), became the landmark first study of this process.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-175-177"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zygmunt Dulczewski|title=Florian Znaniecki: życie i dzieło|year=1984|publisher=Wydawnictwo Poznańskie|isbn=978-83-210-0482-2|language=Polish|pages=175–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mexicans ==
Ethnic [[Mexicans]] are one of the largest groups of people in the United States of America. Early on, both Mexican migrants and [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-Americans]] were actively trying to become a part of the Anglo-American society. One of the examples of Americanization is found through Mexican and Mexican-American youth. From the 1910s and onward there has been a big focus put onto the youth in California. There were, and still are, stereotypes of the youth ranging from [[illegal aliens]] to trouble makers. One of the first steps to get rid of these stereotypes was through Americanization with the help of education, promoted by the [[Nativism (politics)|Nativists]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, George J''..

In Merton E. Hill’s “The Development of an Americanization Program,” Hill states that “the public must be aroused to a realization of the great and immediate need of making provision for educational, vocational, and sanitation programs that will result in…promoting the use of the English language, the right American customs, and the best possible standards of American life.”&lt;ref&gt;Vargas, Zaragosa.

Barbara, 1999.
&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to integrate Ethnic Mexican youth into American society so they would become truly American in the public’s view. This Americanization took over the people’s Mexican culture and made labeled “outwardly Mexican” culture as un-American.

The Americanization efforts were also passed on through the home. From the point of view of Anglo-Americans, the best way to change the youth was through the help of mothers. Mothers were one of the preferred vessels of the Americanization of Mexicans because they were the ones that spent more time in the home and they could pass on their learned American values to the youth. In order to Americanize the mothers, they were taught through the help of the Home Teacher Act of 1915. With this act, teachers were allowed to enter the homes of Mexicans in California and teach the women how to be American and to pass on values to their children.&lt;ref&gt;''The Home Teacher: The Act, with a Working Plan and Forty Lessons in English''. The Commission of Immigration and Housing in California, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the mothers, another effort that was made to Americanize the youth was to Americanize young Mexican girls. Young girls were starting to be taught in schools about different American values and customs through activities such as sewing, budgeting, and motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Peal Idelia. ''Americanization through Homemaking.'' Department of Americanization and Homemaking, Covina City Elementary School. Library of Congress, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; The same idea for educating young girls was the reason that they were educating mothers, the girls would grow up to be mothers and have an influence on the lives of Mexican Americans in and outside the household.

Education was the main focus of the Americanization efforts. Soon, it became engraved in the minds of Mexican-Americans that the best way to become a part of American society was through leaving their own Mexican culture behind. Throughout the southwest, new organizations were being created to fully integrate Mexican-Americans into society. One example is the [[League of United Latin American Citizens|League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)]], which only United States Citizens were allowed to join. Found in a LULAC pamphlet is the phrase “We believe that education is the foundation for the cultural grown and development of this nation and that we are obligated to protect and promote the education of our people in accordance with the best American principles and standards,”&lt;ref&gt;''League of United Latin American Citizens. History of LULAC: founded February 17, 1929'', pamphlet, Date Unknown, University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History. Web. 20 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; showing the organization’s dedication to Americanization. Through organizations that supported Americanization being created before [[World War II]], there came a larger divide between Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans.

The people benefitting from the integrative policies were the Mexican-Americans and they actively tried to separate themselves from Mexicans. Most of the Mexican-Americans involved in the organizations were from the middle class, causing an even larger separation of the people. Leading up to [[World War II]], there were more tactics being used to bring the people in America together. One of the policies that emerged was the [[Good Neighbor policy|Good Neighbor Policy]] in which the United States promoted the idea that everyone in the Americas should be united. This brought forth the idea that everyone was considered American and people should treat one another with respect. Through the Good Neighbor Policy another large Americanization tactic emerged: joining the war effort during World War II.

During World War II, many Mexican Americans began to join different units, some integrated and others [[Racial segregation|segregated]]. To their content, during the War Mexican-American soldiers were being treated by the Anglo-Americans as one of their own in their units. In others, there was still discrimination that occurred, especially once the soldiers returned home. The efforts to Americanize were not as prominent as some people began to see that even though they were fully American they were not going to stop being treated as foreign in their own country.

Prucha, ''Americanizing the American Indians: Writings by the "Friends of the Indians," 1880–1900.'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on other countries==
The term [[Americanization]] has been used since 1907 for the American impact on other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel E.

=== Early precursors ===
[[File:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|[[Diggers|The Diggers]] are often seen as the first practicing anarchists, having held common ownership over land and resources around the time of the [[English Civil War]]]][[File:New Voyages to North America (1703).png|thumb|left|[[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Lahontan's]] 1703 novel documented the author's experiences with various indigenous American tribes and cultures. The novel explores various [[agrarian socialist]] societies and how they were able to provide property for all their inhabitants through collective ownership. The recurring theme of these many cultures were their non-hierarchial structure, early egalitarian styles of living, and how [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] played a significant role in maintaining health]][[File:Sylvain Marechal.jpg|thumb|
[[Sylvain Maréchal]], 18th-century atheist philosopher and whose [[egalitarian]] beliefs pre-staged ideological developments of anarchism and [[utopian socialism]]]]

Anarchist communist currents appeared during the [[English Civil War]] and the [[French Revolution]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively. [[Gerrard Winstanley]], who was part of the radical [[Diggers]] movement in [[England]], wrote in his 1649 pamphlet, ''The New Law of Righteousness'', that there "shall be no buying or selling, no fairs nor markets, but the whole earth shall be a common treasury for every man," and "there shall be none Lord over others, but every one shall be a Lord of himself".&lt;ref&gt; "The first Adam is the wisdom and power
of flesh broke out and sate down in the chair of rule and dominion, in one part of mankind over another. And this is the beginner of particular interest, buying and selling the earth from one particular hand to another, saying, This is mine, upholding this particular propriety by a law of government of his own making, and thereby restraining other fellow creatures from seeking nourishment from their mother earth. So that though a man was bred up in a Land, yet he must not worke for himself where he would sit down. But from Adam; that is, for such a one that had bought part of the Land, or came to it by inheritance of his deceased parents, and called it his own Land: So that he that had no Land, was to work for those for small wages, that called the Land theirs; and thereby some are lifted up into the chair of tyranny, and others trod under the foot-stool of misery, as if the earth were
made for a few, no for all men". Gerrard Winstanley (1649). [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A66687.0001.001?view=toc ''The New Law of Righteousness].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham-2005"&gt;Robert Graham, ''Anarchism - A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas - Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', Black Rose Books, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Diggers themselves resisted tyranny of the ruling class and of kings, instead operating in a cooperative fashion in order to get work done, manage supplies, and increase economic productivity. Due to the communes established by the Diggers being free from private property, along with economic exchange (as all items, goods and services were held collectively), their communes could be called early, functioning [[communist]] societies, spread out across the rural lands of [[England]].

Prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]], common ownership of land and property was much more prevalent across the European continent, but the Diggers were set apart by their struggle against monarchical rule. They sprung up by means of [[workers' self-management]] after the fall of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

In 1703, [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Louis Armand, Baron de Lahontan]] wrote the novel [[New Voyages to North America|''New Voyages to North America'']] where he outlined how indigenous communities of the North American continent cooperated and organised. The author found the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] societies and communities of [[pre-colonial]] North America to be nothing like the [[monarchical]], unequal states of [[Europe]], both in their economic structure and lack of any state. He wrote that the life natives lived was "anarchy", this being the first usage of the term to mean something other than chaos.&lt;ref&gt;"This I only mention by the bye, in this my Preface to the Reader,
whom I pray the Heavens to Crown with Profperity, in preferving
him from having any bufinefs to adjufl with mofi of the Miniflers
of State, and Priefts; for let them be never fo faulty, they'll flill be
faid to be in the right, till fuch time as '''Anarchy''' be introduc'd amongft
us, as well as the Americans, among whom the forrycfl fellow thinks
himfelf a better Man, than a Chancellor of France. Thefe People
are happy in being fcreen'd from the tricks and fliifts of Miniflers,
who are always Maflers where-ever they come. I envy the fiate of a poor Savage, who tramples upon Laws, and pays Homage to no
Scepter. I wish I could fpend the reft of my Life in his Hutt, and
fo be no longer expos'd to the chagrin of bending the knee to a fet of Men, that facrifice the publick good to their private intereft, and are
born to plague honeft Men". Louis Armand, Baron de Lahontan (1703). [[New Voyages to North America|''New Voyages to North America.'']] Library of the University of Illinois. ''Preface,'' p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that there were no priests, courts, laws, police, ministers of state, and no distinction of property, no way to differentiate rich from poor, as they were all equal and thriving cooperatively.&lt;ref&gt;"The vogue of the baron's book was immediate and widespread,
and must have soon replenished his slender purse. In
simple sentences, easily read and comprehended by the masses,
Their Lahontan recounted not only his own adventures, 
and the important events that occurred beneath
his eyes in the much-talked-of region of New France, but
drew a picture of the simple delights of life in the wilderness, more graphic than had yet been presented to the European
world. His idyllic account of manners and customs among
the savages who dwelt in the heart of the American forest, or whose rude huts of bark or skin or matted reeds nestled by
the banks of its far-reaching waterways, was a picture which
fascinated the "average reader" in that romantic age, eager
to learn of new lands and strange peoples. In the pages of
Lahontan the child of nature was depicted as a creature of
rare beauty of form, a rational being thinking deep thoughts on great subjects, but freed from the trammels and frets of
civilization, bound by none of its restrictions, obedient only
to the will and caprice of his own nature. In this American
Arcady were no courts, laws, police, ministers of An American state, or other hampering paraphernalia of government;
each man was a law unto himself, and did what
seemed good in his own eyes. Here were no monks and
priests, with their strictures and asceticisms, but a natural,
sweetly-reasonable religion. Here no vulgar love of money

Aboriginal marriage was no fettering life-covenant,
but an arrangement pleasing the convenience of the contracting
parties. Man, innocent and unadorned, passed his life in the pleasures of the chase, warring only in the cause of the
nation, scorning the supposititious benefits of civilization, and
free from its diseases, misery, sycophancy, and oppression.

During the French Revolution, [[Sylvain Maréchal]], in his ''Manifesto of the Equals'' (1796), demanded "the communal enjoyment of the fruits of the earth" and looked forward to the disappearance of "the revolting distinction of rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed".&lt;ref&gt;"The Agrarian law, or the partitioning of land, was the spontaneous demand of some unprincipled soldiers, of some towns moved more by their instinct than by reason. We lean towards something more sublime and more just: the common good or the community of property! No more individual property in land: the land belongs to no one. We demand, we want, the common enjoyment of the fruits of the land: the fruits belong to all". Sylvain Maréchal (1796). [https://www.marxists.org/history/france/revolution/conspiracy-equals/1796/manifesto.htm ''Manifesto of the Equals''.] [[Marxists Internet Archive|Marxist Internet Archive.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham-2005"/&gt; Maréchal was critical not only of the unequal distribution of property, but how religion would often be used to justify evangelical immorality. He viewed the link between religion and what later came to be known as capitalism (though not in his time) as two sides of the same corrupted coin. He had once said, "Do not be afraid of your God - be afraid of yourself. You are the creator of your own troubles and joys. Heaven and hell are in your own soul".

Sylvain Maréchal was personally involved with [[Conspiracy of the Equals|the Conspiracy of the Equals]], a failed attempt at overthrowing the monarchy of France and establishing a stateless, agrarian socialist utopia. He worked with [[Gracchus Babeuf]] in not only writing about what an anarchist country might look like, but how it will be achieved. The two of them were friends, though didn't always see eye to eye, particularly with Maréchal's statement on equality being more important than the arts.

=== Joseph Déjacque and the Revolutions of 1848 ===
{{main|Joseph Déjacque}}
An early anarchist communist was [[Joseph Déjacque]], the first person to describe himself as "[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]".&lt;ref name="Dejacque"&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Proudhon]], he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature".&lt;ref name="Graham-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"l'Echange", article in ''Le Libertaire'' no 6, September 21, 1858, New York. [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/libertaire/n06/lib01.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the anarchist historian [[Max Nettlau]], the first use of the term [[libertarian communism]] was in November 1880, when a French anarchist congress employed it to more clearly identify its doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0-900384-89-1 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French anarchist journalist [[Sébastien Faure]], later founder and editor of the four-volume ''Anarchist Encyclopedia,'' started the weekly paper ''Le Libertaire'' (''The Libertarian'') in 1895.&lt;ref name="Nettlau 1996 162"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0-900384-89-1 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Déjacque "rejected [[Blanquism]], which was based on a division between the 'disciples of the great people's Architect' and 'the people, or vulgar herd,' and was equally opposed to all the variants of social republicanism, to the dictatorship of one man and to 'the dictatorship of the little prodigies of the proletariat.' With regard to the last of these, he wrote that: 'a dictatorial committee composed of workers is certainly the most conceited and incompetent, and hence the most anti-revolutionary, thing that can be found [...] (It is better to have doubtful enemies in power than dubious friends)'. He saw 'anarchic initiative,' 'reasoned will' and 'the autonomy of each' as the conditions for the social revolution of the proletariat, the first expression of which had been the barricades of June 1848 (see [[Revolutions of 1848]]). In Déjacque's view, a government resulting from an insurrection remains a reactionary fetter on the free initiative of the proletariat. Or rather, such free initiative can only arise and develop by the masses ridding themselves of the 'authoritarian prejudices' by means of which the state reproduces itself in its primary function of representation and delegation. Déjacque wrote that: 'By government I understand all delegation, all power outside the people,' for which must be substituted, in a process whereby politics is transcended, the 'people in direct possession of their sovereignty,' or the 'organised commune.' For Déjacque, the communist anarchist utopia would fulfil the function of inciting each proletarian to explore his or her own human potentialities, in addition to correcting the ignorance of the proletarians concerning 'social science.'"&lt;ref name="Alain Pengam"/&gt;

[[File:Carlo Cafiero.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Carlo Cafiero]]]]
The [[collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchists]] advocated remuneration for the type and amount of labor adhering to the principle "to each according to deeds";&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. The Wages System. 1920. Also available [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/kropotkin-peter/1920/wage.htm here]; quote: "Such, in a few words, is the organization which the Collectivists desire ... their principles are: collective property in the instruments of labor and remuneration of each worker according to the time spent in productive toil, taking into account the productiveness of his work."&lt;/ref&gt; but held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need. As [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s associate, [[James Guillaume]], put it in his essay, ''Ideas on Social Organization'' (1876): "When [...] production comes to outstrip consumption ... everyone will draw what he needs from the abundant social reserve of commodities, without fear of depletion; and the moral sentiment which will be more highly developed among free and equal workers will prevent, or greatly reduce, abuse and waste."&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm Ideas on Social Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist communism as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the [[First International]] by [[Carlo Cafiero]], [[Emilio Covelli]], [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Andrea Costa]] and other ex [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] Republicans.&lt;ref name="Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111-113"/&gt; The collectivist anarchists sought to collectivize ownership of the means of production while retaining payment proportional to the amount and kind of labor of each individual, but the anarcho-communists sought to extend the concept of collective ownership to the products of labor as well. While both groups argued against capitalism, the anarchist communists departed from Proudhon and Bakunin, who maintained that individuals have a right to the product of their individual labor and to be remunerated for their particular contribution to production. But, Errico Malatesta stated that "instead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common. In this way each will give to society all that his strength permits until enough is produced for every one; and each will take all that he needs, limiting his needs only in those things of which there is not yet plenty for every one".&lt;ref&gt;Malatesta, Errico. A Talk About Anarchist Communism Between Two Workers. Also available at: http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_Archives/malatesta/MalatestaATAC.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ErricoMalatesta.gif|thumb|200px|left|[[Errico Malatesta]]]]
Cafiero explains in ''Anarchy and Communism'' (1880) that [[private property]] in the product of labor will lead to unequal accumulation of capital and therefore the reappearance of social classes and their antagonisms; and thus the resurrection of the state: "If we preserve the individual appropriation of the products of labour, we would be forced to preserve money, leaving more or less accumulation of wealth according to more or less merit rather than need of individuals".&lt;ref name="Graham-2005"/&gt; At the Florence Conference of the Italian Federation of the International in 1876, held in a forest outside [[Florence]] due to police activity, they declared the principles of anarcho-communism, beginning with: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Italian Federation considers the collective property of the products of labour as the necessary complement to the collectivist programme, the aid of all for the satisfaction of the needs of each being the only rule of production and consumption which corresponds to the principle of solidarity. The federal congress at Florence has eloquently demonstrated the opinion of the Italian International on this point...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above report was made in an article by Malatesta and Cafiero in the Swiss [[Jura Federation]]'s bulletin later that year.

=== Peter Kropotkin ===
{{main|Peter Kropotkin}}
[[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921), often seen as the most important theorist of anarchist communism, outlined his economic ideas in ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' and ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]''. Kropotkin felt that cooperation is more beneficial than competition, arguing in his major scientific work ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' that this was well-illustrated in nature. He advocated the abolition of [[private property]] (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]) through the "expropriation of the whole of social wealth" by the people themselves,&lt;ref name="Kropotkin-Words-99"&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin]], ''Words of a Rebel'', p99.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the economy to be co-ordinated through a horizontal network of voluntary associations&lt;ref name="Kropotkin-Conquest-145"&gt;Peter Kropotkin, ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', p145.&lt;/ref&gt; where goods are distributed according to the physical needs of the individual, rather than according to labor.&lt;ref name="Shatz-1995-xvi"&gt;Marshall Shatz, Introduction to Kropotkin: The Conquest of Bread and Other Writings, Cambridge University Press 1995, p. xvi "Anarchist communism called for the socialization not only of production but of the distribution of goods: the community would supply the subsistence requirements of each individual member free of charge, and the criterion, 'to each according to his labor' would be superseded by the criterion 'to each according to his needs.'"&lt;/ref&gt; He further argued that these "needs," as society progressed, would not merely be physical needs but "[a]s soon as his material wants are satisfied, other needs, of an artistic character, will thrust themselves forward the more ardently. Aims of life vary with each and every individual; and the more society is civilized, the more will individuality be developed, and the more will desires be varied."&lt;ref name="Kropotkin-Conquest-Ch9"&gt;Peter Kropotkin, ''The Conquest of Bread'' [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/conquest/ch9.html Chapter IX The Need For Luxury]&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that in anarcho-communism "houses, fields, and factories will no longer be [[private property]], and that they will belong to the commune or the nation and money, wages, and trade would be abolished".&lt;ref name="Kropotkin-Conquest-Ch13"&gt;Kropotkin, Peter [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/conquest/ch13.html Chapter 13 ''The Collectivist Wages System'' from ''The Conquest of Bread''], G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York and London, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Kropotkin]]]]
Individuals and groups would use and control whatever resources they needed, as the aim of anarchist communism was to place "the product reaped or manufactured at the disposal of all, leaving to each the liberty to consume them as he pleases in his own home".&lt;ref&gt;''The Place of Anarchism in the Evolution of Socialist Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the expropriation of [[private property]] into [[the commons]] or [[public goods]] (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]) to ensure that everyone would have access to what they needed without being forced to sell their labour to get it: {{quotation|We do not want to rob any one of his coat, but we wish to give to the workers all those things the lack of which makes them fall an easy prey to the exploiter, and we will do our utmost that none shall lack aught, that not a single man shall be forced to sell the strength of his right arm to obtain a bare subsistence for himself and his babes. This is what we mean when we talk of Expropriation...|Peter Kropotkin, ''The Conquest of Bread''&lt;ref name="Kropotkin-Conquest-Ch4"&gt;Kropotkin, Peter [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu:16080/Anarchist_archives/kropotkin/conquest/ch4.html The Conquest Of Bread Chapter IV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301222450/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu:16080/Anarchist_archives/kropotkin/conquest/ch4.html |date=2007-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He said that a "peasant who is in possession of just the amount of land he can cultivate" and "a family inhabiting a house which affords them just enough space [...] considered necessary for that number of people" and the [[artisan]] "working with their own tools or handloom" would not be interfered with,&lt;ref name="Kropotkin-Act-104-05"&gt;Kropotkin ''Act for yourselves.'' N. Walter and H. Becker, eds. (London: Freedom Press 1985) [pp. 104–5]&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that "[t]he landlord owes his riches to the poverty of the peasants, and the wealth of the capitalist comes from the same source".&lt;ref name="Kropotkin-Act-104-05"/&gt;

In summation, Kropotkin described an anarchist communist economy as functioning like this: {{quotation|Imagine a society, comprising a few million inhabitants, engaged in agriculture and a great variety of industries—Paris, for example, with the Department of Seine-et-Oise. Suppose that in this society all children learn to work with their hands as well as with their brains. Admit that all adults... bind themselves to work 5 hours a day from the age of twenty or twenty-two to forty-five or fifty, and that they follow occupations they have chosen in any one branch of human work considered necessary. Such a society could in return guarantee well-being to all its members; that is to say, a more substantial well-being than that enjoyed to-day by the middle classes. And, moreover, each worker belonging to this society would have at his disposal at least 5 hours a day which he could devote to science, art, and individual needs which do not come under the category of necessities, but will probably do so later on, when man's productivity will have augmented, and those objects will no longer appear luxurious or inaccessible.|Peter Kropotkin, ''The Conquest of Bread''&lt;ref name="Kropotkin-Conquest-Ch8"&gt;Kropotkin, Peter [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/conquest/ch8.html The Conquest Of Bread Chapter VIII, Ways and Means]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Organizationalism vs. insurrectionarism and expansion ===
{{main|Insurrectionary anarchism}}
In 1876, at the Berne conference of the [[International Workingmen's Association]], the Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] argued that the revolution "consists more of deeds than words", and that [[propaganda by the deed|action was the most effective form of propaganda]]. In the bulletin of the [[Jura Federation]] he declared "the Italian federation believes that the insurrectional fact, destined to affirm socialist principles by deed, is the most efficacious means of propaganda".&lt;ref name="propaganda"&gt;[http://struggle.ws/ws98/ws55_prop_deed.html "Propaganda by the deed" by [[Workers Solidarity]] No 55 published in October 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

As anarcho-communism emerged in the mid-19th century it had an intense debate with [[Bakuninist]] [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]] and as such within the anarchist movement over participation in [[syndicalism]] and the workers movement as well as on other issues.&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090312022528/http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm "Anarchist-Communism" by Alain Pengam]: "This inability to break definitively with collectivism in all its forms also exhibited itself over the question of the workers' movement, which divided anarchist-communism into a number of tendencies."&lt;/ref&gt; So "In the theory of the revolution" of anarcho-communism as elaborated by [[Peter Kropotkin]] and others "it is the risen people who are the real agent and not the working class organised in the enterprise (the cells of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]) and seeking to assert itself as labour power, as a more 'rational' industrial body or social brain (manager) than the employers".&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"/&gt;

[[File:Lugi Gallean2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Luigi Galleani]] influential anarchist advocate of [[insurrectionary anarchism]]]]
So "between 1880 and 1890"&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"/&gt; with the "perspective of an [[immanent]] revolution",&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"/&gt; who was "opposed to the official workers' movement, which was then in the process of formation (general [[Social democracy|Social Democratisation]]). They were opposed not only to political (statist) struggles but also to strikes which put forward wage or other claims, or which were organised by trade unions."&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"/&gt; But "While they were not opposed to strikes as such, they were opposed to trade unions and the struggle for the [[eight-hour day]]. This anti-reformist tendency was accompanied by an anti-organisational tendency, and its partisans declared themselves in favour of agitation amongst the unemployed for the expropriation of foodstuffs and other articles, for the expropriatory strike and, in some cases, for '[[individual recuperation]]' or acts of terrorism."&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"/&gt;

Even after [[Peter Kropotkin]] and others overcame their initial reservations and decided to enter [[labor union]]s,&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"/&gt; there remained "the anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists, who in France were grouped around [[Sebastien Faure]]'s ''Le Libertaire''. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal '[[Confiscation|expropriation]]s'."&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"/&gt; [[Illegalism]] as a practice emerged and within it "[t]he acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("[[propaganda by the deed]]") and the anarchist burglars ("[[individual reappropriation]]") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary, invitations to revolt."&lt;ref name="illegalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm |title="The "illegalists" by Doug Imrie.

Proponents and activists of these tactics among others included [[Johann Most]], [[Luigi Galleani]], [[Victor Serge]], [[Giuseppe Ciancabilla]], and [[Severino Di Giovanni]]. The Italian [[Giuseppe Ciancabilla]] (1872–1904) wrote in "Against organization" that "we don't want tactical programs, and consequently we don't want organization. Having established the aim, the goal to which we hold, we leave every anarchist free to choose from the means that his sense, his education, his temperament, his fighting spirit suggest to him as best. We don't form fixed programs and we don't form small or great parties. But we come together spontaneously, and not with permanent criteria, according to momentary affinities for a specific purpose, and we constantly change these groups as soon as the purpose for which we had associated ceases to be, and other aims and needs arise and develop in us and push us to seek new collaborators, people who think as we do in the specific circumstance."&lt;ref name="ciancabilla"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Giuseppe_Ciancabilla__Against_organization.html "Against organization" by Giuseppe Ciancabilla] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128191408/http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Giuseppe_Ciancabilla__Against_organization.html |date=November 28, 2010 }}. Retrieved 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1880s, anarcho-communism was already present in the United States as can be seen in the publication of the journal ''Freedom: A Revolutionary Anarchist-Communist Monthly'' by [[Lucy Parsons]] and Lizzy Holmes.&lt;ref name="lucyparsons.org"&gt;[http://lucyparsons.org/biography-iww.php "Lucy Parsons: Woman Of Will"] at the [[Lucy Parsons Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Parsons debated in her time in the US with fellow anarcho-communist [[Emma Goldman]] over issues of [[Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|free love]] and feminism.&lt;ref name="lucyparsons.org"/&gt; Another anarcho-communist journal later appeared in the US called ''[[Free Society|The Firebrand]]''. Most anarchist publications in the US were in Yiddish, German, or Russian, but ''Free Society'' was published in English, permitting the dissemination of anarchist communist thought to English-speaking populations in the US.&lt;ref name="Goldman-MSF-551"&gt;"''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century." ''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909'', p.551.&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time these American anarcho-communist sectors entered in debate with the [[individualist anarchist]] group around [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;"Tucker and other individualist anarchists argued in the pages of ''Liberty'' that anarchist communism was a misnomer because communism implied state authority and true anarchists were against all forms of authority, even the authority of small groups. To individualist anarchists, communistic anarchism, with its ideals of “to each according to need, from each according to ability,” necessarily implied authority over others, because it did not privilege individual liberty as the highest virtue. But for anarchist communist, who saw economic freedom as central, individual liberty without food and shelter seemed impossible. Unlike the individualist tradition, whose ideas had had years of exposure through the English language anarchist press in America with the publication of ''[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]'' from 1872 to 1893 and [[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]] from 1881 to 1908, communistic anarchism had not been advocated in any detail."[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jessica-moran-the-firebrand-and-the-forging-of-a-new-anarchism-anarchist-communism-and-free-lov#toc2 "The Firebrand and the Forging of a New Anarchism: Anarchist Communism and Free Love" by Jessica Moran]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1888 Berkman left for the [[United States]] from his native Russia.&lt;ref name=Avrich202&gt;Avrich, ''Anarchist Portraits'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his arrival in [[New York City]], Berkman became an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] through his involvement with groups that had formed to campaign to free the men convicted of the 1886 [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket bombing]].&lt;ref name=Pateman3&gt;Pateman, p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt; He as well as Emma Goldman soon came under the influence of [[Johann Most]], the best-known anarchist in the United States; and an advocate of [[propaganda of the deed]]—''attentat'', or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt.&lt;ref name=Walter7&gt;Walter, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newell, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Berkman became a typesetter for Most's newspaper ''[[Freiheit (1879)|Freiheit]]''.&lt;ref name=Pateman3/&gt;

According to anarchist historian [[Max Nettlau]], the first use of the term "libertarian communism" was in November 1880, when a French anarchist congress employed it to more clearly identify its doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0-900384-89-1 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French anarchist journalist [[Sébastien Faure]] started the weekly paper ''Le Libertaire'' (''The Libertarian'') in 1895.&lt;ref name="Nettlau 1996 162"/&gt;

=== Methods of Organising: Platformism vs Synthesism ===
{{main|Anarchism in Russia|Free Territory|Platformism|Synthesis anarchism}}
[[File:Machno.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Nestor Makhno]]]]

In [[Ukraine]] the anarcho-communist guerrilla leader [[Nestor Makhno]] led an independent anarchist army in [[Ukraine]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. A commander of the peasant ''[[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]'', also known as the ''Anarchist Black Army'', Makhno led a [[guerrilla]] campaign opposing both the Bolshevik "Reds" and monarchist "Whites". The revolutionary autonomous movement of which he was a part made various tactical military pacts while fighting various forces of reaction and organizing the [[Free Territory]] of [[Ukraine]], an [[list of anarchist communities|anarchist society]], committed to resisting state authority, whether [[Capitalist state|capitalist]] or [[Bolshevik]].&lt;ref&gt;Yekelchyk 2007, p 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OIHMW163"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Charles Townshend |author2=John Bourne |author3=Jeremy Black |title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Modern War|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|year=1997|pages=|isbn=0-19-820427-2|oclc=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After successfully repelling Austro-Hungarian, White, and Ukrainian Nationalist forces, the Makhnovists militia forces and anarchist communist territories in the Ukraine were eventually crushed by Bolshevik military forces.

In the [[Mexican Revolution]] the [[Mexican Liberal Party]] was established and during the early 1910s it led  a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in [[Baja California]] with the leadership of anarcho-communist [[Ricardo Flores Magón]].&lt;ref name="sandiegohistory.org"&gt;[http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/99winter/magonista.htm "The Magonista Revolt in Baja California Capitalist Conspiracy or Rebelion de los Pobres?" by Lawrence D. Taylor]&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin's ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', which Flores Magón considered a kind of anarchist bible, served as basis for the short-lived revolutionary communes in [[Baja California]] during the "Magónista" Revolt of 1911&lt;ref name="sandiegohistory.org"/&gt; During the Mexican Revolution Emiliano Zapata and his army and allies, including [[Pancho Villa]], fought for agrarian reform in Mexico. Specifically, they wanted to establish [[communal]] [[land rights]] for Mexico's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population, which had mostly lost its land to the wealthy elite of European descent. Zapata was partly influenced by Ricardo Flores Magón. The influence of Flores Magón on Zapata can be seen in the Zapatistas' [[Plan de Ayala]], but even more noticeably in their slogan (this slogan was never used by Zapata) "''Tierra y libertad''" or "land and liberty", the title and maxim of Flores Magón's most famous work. Zapata's introduction to anarchism came via a local schoolteacher, Otilio Montaño Sánchez – later a general in Zapata's army, executed on May 17, 1917 – who exposed Zapata to the works of [[Peter Kropotkin]] and Flores Magón at the same time as Zapata was observing and beginning to participate in the struggles of the peasants for the land.

A group of exiled [[Russian anarchists]] attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. They wrote the ''Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists'' which was written in 1926 by ''[[Dielo Truda]]'' ("Workers' Cause"). The pamphlet is an analysis of the basic anarchist beliefs, a vision of an anarchist society, and recommendations as to how an anarchist organization should be structured. The four main principles by which an anarchist organization should operate, according to the ''Platform'', are ideological unity, tactical unity, [[collective action]], and [[federalism]]. The platform argues that "We have vital need of an organization which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement".

The Platform attracted strong criticism from many sectors on the anarchist movement of the time including some of the most influential anarchists such as [[Voline]], [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Camillo Berneri]], [[Max Nettlau]], [[Alexander Berkman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inspiracy.com/black/wooden.html "Wooden shoes or platform shoes? on the organizational platform of the libertarian communists"] by [[Bob Black]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Gregori Maximoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=— George Carlin |url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3%20 |title=J.3.4 Why do many anarchists oppose the "Platform"? on An Anarchist FAQ |publisher=Infoshop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007160139/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |archivedate=7 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malatesta, after initially opposing the Platform, later came to agreement with the Platform confirming that the original difference of opinion was due to linguistic confusion: "I find myself more or less in agreement with their way of conceiving the anarchist organisation (being very far from the authoritarian spirit which the "Platform" seemed to reveal) and I confirm my belief that behind the linguistic differences really lie identical positions."&lt;ref&gt;Malatesta, [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/mal_rep3.htm On Collective Responsibility]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fauresebastien police.jpg|thumb|[[Sébastien Faure]], French anarcho-communist proponent of [[synthesis anarchism]]]]
Two texts were made by the anarchist communists [[Sébastien Faure]] and [[Volin]] as responses to the Platform, each proposing different models, are the basis for what became known as the organisation of synthesis, or simply "[[Synthesis anarchism|synthesism]]".&lt;ref name="anarkismo.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/article/15329 |title="Especifismo and Synthesis/ Synthesism" by Felipe Corrêa |publisher=Anarkismo.net |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voline]] published in 1924 a paper calling for "the anarchist synthesis" and was also the author of the article in [[Sébastien Faure]]'s ''Encyclopedie Anarchiste'' on the same topic.&lt;ref name="infoshop.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=— Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin |url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |title="J.3.2 What are "synthesis" federations?" in An Anarchist FAQ |publisher=Infoshop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007160139/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |archivedate=7 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose behind the synthesis was that the anarchist movement in most countries was divided into three main tendencies: [[communist anarchism]], [[anarcho-syndicalism]], and [[individualist anarchism]]&lt;ref name="infoshop.org"/&gt; and so such an organization could contain anarchists of this 3 tendencies very well. Faure in his text "Anarchist synthesis" has the view that "these currents were not contradictory but complementary, each having a role within anarchism: [[anarcho-syndicalism]] as the strength of the mass organisations and the best way for the practice of anarchism; [[libertarian communism]] as a proposed future society based on the distribution of the fruits of labour according to the needs of each one; [[anarcho-individualism]] as a negation of oppression and affirming the individual right to development of the individual, seeking to please them in every way.&lt;ref name="anarkismo.net"/&gt; The Dielo Truda platform in Spain also met with strong criticism. Miguel Jimenez, a founding member of the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] (FAI), summarized this as follows: too much influence in it of [[marxism]], it erroneously divided and reduced anarchists between individualist anarchists and anarcho-communist sections, and it wanted to unify the anarchist movement along the lines of the anarcho-communists. He saw anarchism as more complex than that, that anarchist tendencies are not mutually exclusive as the platformists saw it and that both individualist and communist views could accommodate anarchosyndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Jiménez evitó ahondar demasiado en sus críticas hacia la naturaleza abiertamente marxista de algunas partes de la Plataforma, limitándose a aludir a la crítica de Santillán en La Protesta, que afirmaba que los rusos no habían sido el único grupo responsable de permitir la infiltración de las ideas marxistas, lo que iba claramente dirigido a los sindicalistas de España17. Jiménez aceptó que la Plataforma había sido un intento encomiable de resolver el eterno problema de la desunión dentro de las filas anarquistas, pero consideraba que el programa ruso tenía sus defectos. La Plataforma se basaba en una premisa errónea sobre la naturaleza de las tendencias dentro del movimiento anarquista: dividía a los anarquistas en dos grupos diferentes, individualistas y comunistas, y con ello rechazaba la influencia de los primeros y proponía la unificación del movimiento anarquista en torno a la ideas de los segundos. Jiménez afirmaba que la realidad era mucho más compleja: esas diferentes tendencias dentro del movimiento anarquista no eran contradictorias ni excluyentes. Por ejemplo, era posible encontrar elementos en ambos grupos que apoyaran las tácticas del anarcosindicalismo. Por tanto, rechazaba el principal argumento de los plataformistas según el cual las diferentes tendencias se excluían entre sí."

The main goal there was conciling anarcho-communism with anarcho-syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Debido a sus contactos e influencia con el movimiento del exilio español, la propuesta de Faure arraigó más en los círculos españoles que la Plataforma, y fue publicada en las prensas libertarias tanto en España como en Bélgica25. En esencia, Faure intentaba reunir a la familia anarquista sin imponer la rígida estructura que proponía la Plataforma, y en España se aceptó así. Opuesta a la situación de Francia, en España la influencia del anarquismo individualista no fue un motivo serio de ruptura. Aunque las ideas de ciertos individualistas como Han Ryner y Émile Armand tuvieron cierto impacto sobre el anarquismo español, afectaron sólo a aspectos como el sexo y el amor libre."[http://www.acracia.org/Acracia/La_busqueda_de_la_unidad_anarquista.html Jason Garner.

Gruppo Comunista Anarchico di Firenze held that the during early twentieth century, the terms ''libertarian communism'' and ''anarchist communism'' became synonymous within the international anarchist movement as a result of the close connection they had in Spain (see [[Anarchism in Spain]]) (with ''libertarian communism'' becoming the prevalent term).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdca.it/fdcaen/historical/vault/ancom-libcom.htm "Anarchist Communism &amp; Libertarian Communism"] by Gruppo Comunista Anarchico di Firenze. from "L'informatore di parte", No. 4, October 1979, quarterly journal of the Gruppo Comunista Anarchico di Firenze, on Libcom.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extensive application of anarcho-communist ideas (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), happened in the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]]&lt;ref name="Spain 1936"/&gt; In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Beevor|year=2006|page=46|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-84832-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.&lt;ref name='Bolloten 1984, p.54'&gt;{{cite book | last = Bolloten | first = Burnett | authorlink = Burnett Bolloten | title = The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | date = 1984-11-15 | location = | page =1107 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-8078-1906-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bolloten | first = Burnett | authorlink = Burnett Bolloten | title = The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | date = 1984-11-15 | location = | page =1107 | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-8078-1906-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the [[Soviet Union]]. The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' [[social revolution]] that began during the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] and more broadly [[libertarian socialist]] organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily [[Catalonia]], [[Anarchist Aragon|Aragon]], [[Andalusia]], and parts of [[Levante, Spain|the Levante]]. Much of [[Spain's economy]] was put under worker control; in [[anarchist]] strongholds like [[Catalonia]], the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] influence, as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied party actively resisted attempts at [[collectivization]] enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, [[Agriculture|agrarian]] areas became collectivised and run as [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] [[commune (intentional community)|communes]].

=== Post-war years ===
Anarcho-communism entered into internal debates once again over the issue of organization in the post-World War II era. Founded in October 1935 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina (FACA, Federación Anarco-Comunista Argentina) in 1955 renamed itself as the [[Argentine Libertarian Federation]]. The [[Fédération Anarchiste]] (FA) was founded in Paris on December 2, 1945, and elected the platformist anarcho-communist George Fontenis as its first secretary the next year. It was composed of a majority of activists from the former FA (which supported [[Voline]]'s [[Synthesis anarchism|Synthesis]]) and some members of the former Union Anarchiste, which supported the CNT-FAI support to the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War, as well as some young Resistants. On 1950 a clandestin group formed within the FA called Organisation Pensée Bataille (OPB) led by George Fontenis.&lt;ref name="public.federation-anarchiste.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014916/http://public.federation-anarchiste.org/IMG/pdf/Cedric_Guerin_Histoire_du_mvt_libertaire_1950_1970.pdf Cédric Guérin. "Pensée et action des anarchistes en France : 1950-1970"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manifesto of Libertarian Communism'' was written in 1953 by Georges Fontenis for the ''Federation Communiste Libertaire'' of France. It is one of the key texts of the anarchist-communist current known as [[platformism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/manifesto-of-libertarian-communism-georges-fontenis "Manifesto of Libertarian Communism"] by Georges Fontenis, on [[Libcom.org]]&lt;/ref&gt; The OPB pushed for a move which saw the FA change its name into the Fédération Communiste Libertaire (FCL) after the 1953 Congress in Paris, while an article in ''Le Libertaire'' indicated the end of the cooperation with the French [[Surrealist]] Group led by [[André Breton]]. The new decision making process was founded on [[unanimity]]: each person has a right of veto on the orientations of the federation. The FCL published the same year the ''Manifeste du communisme libertaire''. Several groups quit the FCL in December 1955, disagreeing with the decision to present "revolutionary candidates" to the legislative elections. On August 15–20, 1954, the Ve intercontinental plenum of the CNT took place. A group called Entente anarchiste appeared which was formed of militants who didn't like the new ideological orientation that the OPB was giving the FCL seeing it was authoritarian and almost marxist.&lt;ref&gt;"Si la critique de la déviation autoritaire de la FA est le principal fait de ralliement, on peut ressentir dès le premier numéro un état d'esprit qui va longtemps coller à la peau des anarchistes français. Cet état d'esprit se caractérise ainsi sous une double forme : d'une part un rejet inconditionnel de l'ennemi marxiste, d'autre part des questions sur le rôle des anciens et de l'évolution idéologique de l'anarchisme. C'est Fernand Robert qui attaque le premier : "Le LIB est devenu un journal marxiste. En continuant à le soutenir, tout en reconnaissant qu'il ne nous plaît pas, vous faîtes une mauvaise action contre votre idéal anarchiste. Vous donnez la main à vos ennemis dans la pensée. Même si la FA disparaît, même si le LIB disparaît, l'anarchie y gagnera. Le marxisme ne représente plus rien. Il faut le mettre bas ; je pense la même chose des dirigeants actuels de la FA. L'ennemi se glisse partout." Cédric Guérin.

This move alienated some members of the FCL and thus produced the end of the organization.&lt;ref name="public.federation-anarchiste.org"/&gt; A group of militants who didn't agree with the FA turning into FCL reorganized a new Federation Anarchiste which was established on December, 1953.&lt;ref name="public.federation-anarchiste.org"/&gt; This included those who formed ''L'Entente anarchiste'' who joined the new FA and then dissolved L'Entente. The new base principles of the FA were written by the individualist anarchist [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and the non-platformist anarcho-communist [[Maurice Joyeux]] which established an organization with a plurality of tendencies and autonomy of groups organized around [[Synthesist anarchism|synthesist principles]].&lt;ref name="public.federation-anarchiste.org"/&gt; According to historian Cédric Guérin, "the unconditional rejection of [[Marxism]] became from that moment onwards an identity element of the new Federation Anarchiste" and this was motivated in a big part after the previous conflict with George Fontenis and his OPB.&lt;ref name="public.federation-anarchiste.org"/&gt;


In Italy the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] was founded in 1945 in [[Carrara]]. It adopted an "Associative Pact" and the "Anarchist Program" of Errico Malatesta. It decided to publish the weekly ''[[Umanità Nova]]'' retaking the name of the journal published by [[Errico Malatesta]]. Inside the FAI, the Anarchist Groups of Proletarian Action (GAAP) was founded, led by Pier Carlo Masini, which "proposed a Libertarian Party with an anarchist theory and practice adapted to the new economic, political and social reality of post-war Italy, with an internationalist outlook and effective presence in the workplaces [...] The GAAP allied themselves with the similar development within the [[Anarchism in France|French Anarchist movement]]" as led by George Fontenis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/history/articles/1923-1998-pier-carlo-masini Masini, Pier Carlo, 1923-1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Another tendency which didn't identify either with the more classical FAI or with the GAAP started to emerge as local groups. These groups emphasized [[direct action]], informal [[affinity group]]s and [[Expropriative anarchism|expropriation]] for financing anarchist activity.&lt;ref name="hommodolars.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hommodolars.org/web/spip.php?article2594 |title="Vivir la Anarquía .Artículo en solidaridad con Alfredo Bonanno y Christos Stratigopoulos" |access-date=2015-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828111008/http://www.hommodolars.org/web/spip.php?article2594 |archive-date=2015-08-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From within these groups the influential [[insurrectionary anarchist]] [[Alfredo Maria Bonanno]] will emerge influenced by the practice of the Spanish exiled anarchist José Lluis Facerías.&lt;ref name="hommodolars.org"/&gt; In the early seventies a [[platformist]] tendency emerged within the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] which argued for more strategic coherence and social insertion in the workers movement while rejecting the [[Synthesist anarchism|syntesist]] "Associative Pact" of [[Errico Malatesta|Malatesta]] which the FAI adhered to. These groups started organizing themselves outside the FAI in organizations such as O.R.A. from [[Liguria]] which organized a Congress attended by 250 delegates of grupos from 60 locations. This movement was influential in the ''[[Autonomism#Italian autonomism|autonomia]]'' movements of the seventies. They published ''Fronte Libertario'' della lotta di classe in [[Bologna]] and ''Comunismo libertario'' from [[Modena]].&lt;ref name="almeralia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eljorobado.enlucha.info/bicicleta/bicicleta/ciclo/01/17.htm |title=Autonomía de las luchas y movimiento anárquico.

The [[International of Anarchist Federations]] (IAF/IFA) was founded during an international anarchist conference in [[Carrara]] in 1968 by the three existing European anarchist federations of France ([[Fédération Anarchiste]]), Italy ([[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]]) and Spain ([[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]]) as well as the [[Bulgaria]]n federation in French exile. These organizations were also inspired on synthesist principles.&lt;ref name="infoshop.org"/&gt;

=== Contemporary times ===
''[[Libertarian Communism (journal)|Libertarian Communism]]'' was a [[socialist]] [[academic journal|journal]] founded in 1974 and produced in part by members of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;"papers relating to Libertarian Communism (a splinter group of the SPGB) including journals and miscellaneous correspondence, 1970–1980 (1 box)"[[Socialist Party of Great Britain|"Socialist Party of Great Britain" at Archives Hub at the Great Research Centre]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Synthesis anarchism|synthesist]] [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] and the [[Platformism|platformist]] [[Federation of Anarchist Communists]] continue existing today in Italy but [[insurrectionary anarchism]] continues to be relevant as the recent establishment of the [[Informal Anarchist Federation]] shows.

In the seventies in France the [[Fédération Anarchiste]] evolved into a joining of the principles of both [[synthesis anarchism]] and [[platformism]]&lt;ref name="public.federation-anarchiste.org"/&gt; but later the platformist organizations [[Libertarian Communist Organization (France)]] in 1976 and [[Alternative libertaire]] in 1991 appeared with this last one existing until today alongside the synthesist [[Fédération Anarchiste]]. In recent times platformist organisations founded the now-defunct [[International Libertarian Solidarity]] network and its successor, the Anarkismo network; which is run collaboratively by roughly 30 platformist organisations around the world.

On the other hand, contemporary insurrectionary anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti-organizational anarcho-communism&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php "Say you want an insurrection" by [[Crimethinc]]]&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[illegalism]]".&lt;ref name="joeblack"&gt;[http://www.ainfos.ca/06/jul/ainfos00232.html "Anarchism, insurrections and insurrectionalism" by Joe Black] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206162459/http://www.ainfos.ca/06/jul/ainfos00232.html |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Some insurrectionists see precedents in the propaganda of the deed carried out by Nineteenth-century assassins and the illegalism associated with Jules Bonnot and his fellow bank robbers.

== Economic theory ==
The abolition of money, prices, and [[wage labor]] is central to anarchist communism. With distribution of wealth being based on self-determined needs, people would be free to engage in whatever activities they found most fulfilling and would no longer have to engage in work for which they have neither the temperament nor the aptitude.&lt;ref name="BrownWork"/&gt;

Anarchist communists argue that there is no valid way of measuring the value of any one person's economic contributions because all wealth is a common product of current and preceding generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Berkman]]. ''What Is Communist Anarchism?'' [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alexander_Berkman__What_Is_Communist_Anarchism_.html#toc24]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one could not measure the value of a factory worker's daily production without taking into account how transportation, food, water, shelter, relaxation, machine efficiency, emotional mood etc. contributed to their production. To truly give numerical economic value to anything, an overwhelming amount of externalities and contributing factors would need to be taken into account&amp;nbsp;– especially current or past labor contributing to the ability to utilize future labor. As Kropotkin put it: "No distinction can be drawn between the work of each man. Measuring the work by its results leads us to absurdity; dividing and measuring them by hours spent on the work also leads us to absurdity. One thing remains: put the needs above the works, and first of all recognize the right to live, and later on, to the comforts of life, for all those who take their share in production.."&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. "The Collectivist Wage System". The Conquest of Bread, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York and London, 1906, Chapter 13, Section 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La conquête du pain.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by [[Peter Kropotkin]], influential work which presents the economic vision of anarcho-communism]]
Communist anarchism shares many traits with [[collectivist anarchism]], but the two are distinct. Collectivist anarchism believes in collective ownership while communist anarchism negates the entire concept of ownership in favor of the concept of usage.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berkman. ''[[Now and After|What is Anarchism?]]'', p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, the abstract relationship of "landlord" and "tenant" would no longer exist, as such titles are held to occur under conditional legal coercion and are not absolutely necessary to occupy buildings or spaces ([[intellectual property]] rights would also cease, since they are a form of [[private property]]). In addition to believing rent and other fees are exploitative, anarcho-communists feel these are arbitrary pressures inducing people to carry out unrelated functions. For example, they question why one should have to work for 'X hours' a day to merely live somewhere. So instead of working conditionally for the sake of the wage earned, they believe in working directly for the objective at hand.&lt;ref name="BrownWork"/&gt;

== Philosophical debates ==
=== Motivation ===
Anarchist communists reject the claim that wage labor is necessary because people are lazy and selfish by "human nature". They often point out that even the so-called "idle rich" sometimes find useful things to do despite having all their needs satisfied by the labour of others. Anarcho-communists generally do not agree with the belief in a pre-set "human nature", arguing that human culture and behavior is very largely determined by [[socialization]] and the [[mode of production]]. Many anarchist communists, like Peter Kropotkin, also believe that human evolutionary tendency is for humans to cooperate with each other for mutual benefit and survival instead of existing as lone competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kropotkin ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution]]'' [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/mutaidcontents.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom, work and leisure ===
Anarchist communists support communism as a means for ensuring the greatest freedom and well-being for everyone, rather than only the wealthy and powerful. In this sense, anarchist communism is a profoundly [[egalitarian]] philosophy.

Anarchist communism as an anarchist philosophy is against hierarchy in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;"...whatever else may be said, this much is for sure: the welfare of humanity, which the future can and will bring, lies in communism. It excludes in logical ways all authority and servitude, and therefore equals anarchy." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Johann_Most__Anarchist_Communism.html "Anarchist Communism" by [[Johann Most]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communists do not think that anyone has the right to be anyone else's master, or 'boss' as this is a concept of capitalism and the state and implies authority over the individual. Some contemporary anarchist communists and advocates of [[post-left anarchy]], such as [[Bob Black]], [[refusal of work|reject the concept of work]] altogether in favor of turning necessary subsistence tasks into voluntary free play.&lt;ref name="BrownWork" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bob Black |url=http://deoxy.org/endwork.htm |title=The Abolition Of Work |publisher=Deoxy.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920104353/http://deoxy.org/endwork.htm |archivedate=20 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Kropotkin]] said that the main authoritarian mistakes in communist experiments of the past were their being based on "religious enthusiasm"&lt;ref&gt;"nearly all communities were founded by an almost religious wave of enthusiasm. People were asked to become "pioneers of humanity;" to submit to the dictates of a punctilious morality, to become quite regenerated by Communist life, to give all their time, hours of work and of leisure, to the community, to live entirely for the community. This meant acting simply like monks and to demand — without any necessity — men to be what they are not."[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Communism_and_Anarchy.html Peter Kropotkin. "Communism and Anarchy"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the desire to live "as a family"&lt;ref&gt;"The second mistake lay in the desire to manage the community after the model of a family, to make it "the great family" They lived all in the same house and were thus forced to continuously meet the same "brethren and sisters." It is already difficult often for two real brothers to live together in the same house, and family life is not always harmonious; so it was a fundamental error to impose on all the "great family" instead of trying, on the contrary, to guarantee as much freedom and home life to each individual." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Communism_and_Anarchy.html Peter Kropotkin. "Communism and Anarchy"]&lt;/ref&gt; where the individual had to "submit to the dictates of a punctilious morality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Communism_and_Anarchy.html |title=Peter Kropotkin |publisher=Theanarchistlibrary.org |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him anarcho-communism should be based on the right of free association and disassociation for individuals and groups and on significantly lowering the number of hours each individual dedicates to necessary labor.&lt;ref name="canda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Communism_and_Anarchy.html|first1=Peter|last1=Kropotkin|authorlink=Peter Kropotkin|title=Communism and Anarchy|access-date=2016-09-18|date=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "to recognise a variety of occupations as the basis of all progress and to organise in such a way that man may be absolutely free during his leisure time, whilst he may also vary his work, a change for which his early education and instruction will have prepared him—this can easily be put in practice in a Communist society—this, again, means the emancipation of the individual, who will find doors open in every direction for his complete development".&lt;ref name="BrownWork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="canda"/&gt;

=== Individualism and collectivism ===
Some anarcho-communists (and [[collectivist anarchists]] as well) reject "individualism" and "collectivism" as illusory concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A.2 What does anarchism stand for?|url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/intro/faq/sp001547/secA2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that individuals sacrificing themselves for the "greater", or being ruled by the "community" or "society", is not possible because society is composed of individuals rather than being a cohesive unit separate from the individual, and argue that collective control over the individual is tyrannical and thus antithetical to anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;The Place of Anarchism in the Evolution of Socialist Thought, pp 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt, argue that: "The anarchists did not [...] identify freedom with the right of everybody to do exactly what one pleased but with a social order in which collective effort and responsibilities—that is to say, obligations—would provide the material basis and social nexus in which individual freedom could exist." They argued that "genuine freedom and individuality could only exist in a free society" and that in contrast to "misanthropic bourgeois individualism" anarchism was based in "a deep love of freedom, understood as a social product, a deep respect for human rights, a profound celebration of humankind and its potential and a commitment to a form of society where a 'true individuality' was irrevocably linked to 'the highest communist socieability'".&lt;ref name="BrownWork" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael and van der Walt, Lucien. [[Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol 1)]]. I. AK Press, 2009, Page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Egoist philosophical positions]] are important in anarcho-communist [[insurrectionary anarchism]]. In the early 20th century the Italian [[individualist anarchist]] [[Renzo Novatore]] advocated both revolution and anarcho-communism when he said "revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy. To create new ethical values. To create new aesthetic values. To communalize material wealth. To individualize spiritual wealth."&lt;ref name="creativenothing"/&gt; From [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Stirnerist]] positions he also disrespected private property when he said that "[o]nly ethical and spiritual wealth" was "invulnerable. This is the true property of individuals. The rest no! The rest is vulnerable! And all that is vulnerable will be violated!"&lt;ref name="creativenothing"/&gt; This can also be seen in the contemporary writings of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], as can be seen in the work of Wolfi Landstreicher, [[Alfredo Bonanno]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alfredo_M._Bonanno__The_Theory_of_the_Individual__Stirner_s_Savage_Thought.html |title=The Theory of the Individual: Stirner's Savage Thought |publisher=Theanarchistlibrary.org |date=1998-08-20 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ai ferri corti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Anonymous__At_Daggers_Drawn_with_the_Existent__its_Defenders_and_its_False_Critics.html |title="At Daggers Drawn with the Existent, its Defenders and its False Critics" by anonymous |publisher=Theanarchistlibrary.org |date=1905-12-11 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Post-left anarchy|Post-left]] anarcho-communist [[Bob Black]], after analysing [[Insurrectionary anarchism|insurrectionary]] anarcho-communist [[Luigi Galleani]]'s view on anarcho-communism, went as far as saying that "communism is the final fulfillment of [[individualism]] [...] The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both [...] Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of 'emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,' [...] You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a 'method of individualization.' It aims to combine the greatest individual development with the greatest communal unity."&lt;ref name="BrownWork" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bob_Black__Nightmares_of_Reason.html#toc22 Bob Black, ''Nightmares of Reason''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the article by [[Max Baginski]] called "Stirner: The Ego and His Own", published in the American anarchist magazine ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'', there is the following affirmation: "Modern Communists are more individualistic than Stirner. To them, not merely religion, morality, family and State are spooks, but property also is no more than a spook, in whose name the individual is enslaved—and how enslaved! The individuality is nowadays held in far stronger bondage by property, than by the combined power of State, religion and morality [...] The prime condition is that the individual should not be forced to humiliate and lower himself for the sake of property and subsistence. Communism thus creates a basis for the liberty and Eigenheit of the individual. I am a Communist because I am an Individualist. Fully as heartily the Communists concur with Stirner when he puts the word take in place of demand—that leads to the dissolution of [[private property]], to expropriation. Individualism and Communism go hand in hand."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/goldman/ME/mev2n3.html#142 Max Baginski. "Stirner: The Ego and His Own" on ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]''. Vol. 2. No. 3 MAY, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property ===
Anarchist communists counter the capitalist conception that communal property can only be maintained by force and that such a position is neither fixed in nature&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. ''Mutual Aid''.&lt;/ref&gt; nor unchangeable in practice, citing numerous examples of communal behavior occurring naturally even within capitalist systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Ward]]. ''Anarchism in Action''.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communists call for the abolition of [[private property]] while maintaining respect for [[personal property]]. As such the prominent anarcho-communist [[Alexander Berkman]] maintained that "The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use. Thus, your watch is your own, but the watch factory belongs to the people. Land, machinery, and all other public utilities will be collective property, neither to be bought nor sold. Actual use will be considered the only title-not to ownership but to possession. The organization of the coal miners, for example, will be in charge of the coal mines, not as owners but as the operating agency. Similarly will the railroad brotherhoods run the railroads, and so on. Collective possession, cooperatively managed in the interests of the community, will take the place of personal ownership privately conducted for profit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Berkman]]. "[[Now and After|What Is Communist Anarchism?]]" [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alexander_Berkman__What_Is_Communist_Anarchism_.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between anarchist [[communism]] and [[Marxism|Marxist communism]] is who the product of the worker's labor belongs to. Both ideologies believe that the product of labor does not belong to the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist]] due to it being produced by the worker and not the employer, however, there are slight differences between the opinions taken by anarchist communist Peter Kropotkin and [[Karl Marx]]. Marx stated that the product of the worker's labor belongs to the worker due to it being produced by the worker. In contrast, Kropotkin believed that the product of the worker's labor belongs to the community as a whole. Kropotkin argued that this was the case because the worker relied on the previous work of untold millions in to even begin his particular form of labor, and therefore, his work should belong to the community, since he benefited from the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/913790063|title=The Conquest of Bread|last=Priestland|first=David|others=Kropotkin, Peter|year=2015|isbn=9780141396118|edition=This edition, using the 1913 text, first published in Penguin Classics in 2015|location=London|pages=Introduction|oclc=913790063}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/913790063|title=The Conquest of Bread|last=Kropotkin|first=Petr Alekseevich|publisher=Penguin Classics|others=Priestland, David,|year=2015|isbn=9780141396118|edition=This edition, using the 1913 text, first published in Penguin Classics in 2015|location=London|oclc=913790063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Libertarian socialism|Philosophies}}

=== The commune as an economic democracy ===
Anarcho-communism has been critical of a simple call for worker's ownership of workplaces and their administration as cooperatives. While not at odds with syndicalism as a tactic, it opposes the vision of [[anarcho-syndicalism]] as a theory, which sees a post-capitalist economy being made up of federations of industrial syndicates.

Instead, anarcho-communism proposes that the future society be organised territorially through free communes (localities), instead of industrially through workers' unions (syndicates). Each commune is perceived as an integrated political-economic unit, removing the distinction between work and community, as well as existing as part of a wider communal-confederation made up of other such autonomous communes, linked together via voluntary contractual agreements. This is seen as overcoming the economic-centrism of more "workerist" forms of socialism which focus on the workplace alone as a site of struggle.

[[Murray Bookchin]] has put it this way: &lt;blockquote&gt; But what of the [[Revolutionary syndicalism|syndicalist]] ideal of "collectivized" self-managed enterprises that are coordinated by like occupations on a national level and coordinated geographically by "collectives" on a local level? [...] Here, the traditional socialist criticism of this syndicalist form of economic management is not without its point: the corporate or private capitalist, "worker-controlled" or not—ironically, a technique in the repertoire of industrial management that is coming very much into vogue today as "workplace democracy" and "employee ownership" and constitutes no threat whatever to private property and capitalism [...] In any case, "economic democracy" has not simply meant "workplace democracy" and "employee ownership."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many workers, in fact, would like to get away from their factories if they could and find more creative artisanal types of work, not simply "participate" in "planning" their own misery. What "[[economic democracy]]" meant in its profoundest sense was free, "democratic" access to the means of life, the counterpart of political democracy, that is, the guarantee of freedom from material want. It is a dirty bourgeois trick, in which many radicals unknowingly participate, that "economic democracy" has been re-interpreted as "employee ownership" and "workplace democracy" and has come to mean workers' "participation" in profit sharing and industrial management rather than freedom from the tyranny of the factory, rationalized labor, and "planned production," which is usually exploitative production with the complicity of the workers.&lt;ref name="Bookchin"&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/municipalization-murray-bookchin "Municipalization: Community Ownership of the Economy" by] [[Murray Bookchin]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such: &lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas the syndicalist alternative re-privatizes the economy into "self-managed" collectives and opens the way to their degeneration into traditional forms of private property—whether "collectively" owned or not—libertarian municipalism politicizes the economy and dissolves it into the civic domain. Neither factory or land appear as separate interests within the communal collective. Nor can workers, farmers, technicians, engineers, professionals, and the like perpetuate their vocational identities as separate interests that exist apart from the citizen body in face-to-face assemblies. "Property" is integrated into the commune as a material constituent of its libertarian institutional framework, indeed as a part of a larger whole that is controlled by the citizen body in assembly as citizens—not as vocationally oriented interest groups.&lt;ref name="Bookchin"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word "communism" in anarcho-communism should thus be taken to refer to a polity of communes as well as an economy of the [[commons]].

=== The revolution and the transition ===
For [[platformist]] anarcho-communist Wayne Price:&lt;blockquote&gt;Today's proposals for [[Parecon]], in which workers are rewarded for the intensity and duration of their labor in a cooperative economy, would fit into Bakunin's or Marx's concept of a transitory, beginning, phase, of a free society [...] Kropotkin rejected the two-phase approach of the Marxists and the anarchist-collectivists. Instead he proposed that a revolutionary society should "transform itself immediately into a communist society, that is, should go immediately into what Marx had regarded as the [[Communism#Marxism|"more advanced", completed, phase of communism]]. Kropotkin and those who agreed with him called themselves "anarchist-communists" (or "communist anarchists"), although they continued to regard themselves as a part of the broader socialist movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wayne_Price__What_is_Anarchist_Communism_.html "What is Anarchist Communism?" by Wayne Price]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Leninists believe that without a transitional period of state control (their interpretation of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]), it would be impossible for any revolution to maintain the momentum or cohesion to defend the new society against external and internal threats. [[Friedrich Engels]] noted: "Without a previous social revolution the abolition of the state is nonsense; the abolition of capital is in itself the social revolution and involves a change in the whole method of production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/archive/marx/works/1872/letters/72_01_24.htm |title=Letter from Engels to Theodore Cuno |year=1872 |publisher=Friedrich Engels |accessdate=2009-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926050119/http://eprints.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/archive/marx/works/1872/letters/72_01_24.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, such quotations have been interpreted by Anarcho-communists supportive of Marx and Engels to suggest the abolition of capitalism and the state simultaneously, not the creation of a new state. Anarchists reject the Marxist–Leninist model of the "dictatorship of the proletariat," arguing that any revolutionary minority taking over state power would be just as authoritarian as the ruling class in capitalism to defend the new state, and would eventually constitute itself as a new ruling class. As an extension of this, Anarcho-communists counter-argue that decentralized, stateless collective federations are sufficient to give both power to workers and preserve personal freedom and point to the fact that no socialist state has ever showed signs of "withering away". Again, the Spanish Revolution is cited as an example of successful anarchist military mobilization, albeit one crushed by superior forces.

=== Free association of communes as opposed to the nation-state ===
Anarcho-communism calls for a [[Federalism#Federalism as the Anarchist Mode of Political Organization|confederal]] form in relationships of mutual aid and [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]] between communes as an alternative to the [[centralism]] of the [[nation-state]]. Peter Kropotkin thus suggested: &lt;blockquote&gt;Representative government has accomplished its historical mission; it has given a mortal blow to court-rule; and by its debates it has awakened public interest in public questions. But to see in it the government of the future socialist society is to commit a gross error. Each economic phase of life implies its own political phase; and it is impossible to touch the very basis of the present economic life—private property—without a corresponding change in the very basis of the political organization. Life already shows in which direction the change will be made. Not in increasing the powers of the State, but in resorting to free organization and free federation in all those branches which are now considered as attributes of the State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-anarchist-communism-its-basis-and-principles Peter Kropotkin. "Anarchist Communism: Its Basis and Principles"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such: &lt;blockquote&gt;[N]o community can hope to achieve economic autarchy, nor should it try to do so unless it wishes to become self-enclosed and parochial, not only "self-sufficient". Hence the confederation of communes "the Commune of communes" is reworked economically as well as politically into a shared universe of publicly managed resources. The management of the economy, precisely because it is a public activity, does not degenerate into privatized interactions between enterprises; rather it develops into confederalized interactions between municipalities. That is to say, the very elements of societal interaction are expanded from real or potential privatized components to institutionally real public components. Confederation becomes a public project by definition, not only because of shared needs and resources. If there is any way to avoid the emergence of the city-state, not to speak of self-serving bourgeois "cooperatives," it is through a municipalization of political life that is so complete that politics embraces not only what we call the public sphere but material means of life as well.&lt;ref name="Bookchin"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Example societies through history ==
=== Early examples ===
There have been several attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, at creating other anarchist-communist societies throughout much of the world. Anarchist-communists and some [[green anarchists]] (especially [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivists]]) argue that [[hunter-gatherer]] [[tribe]]s, like families, were early forms of anarchist-communism due to their egalitarian nature.
[[File:the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal were said to be inhabited by wolf-headed people.jpg|thumb|The [[Andaman Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] were said to be inhabited by wolf-headed people, who were depicted in a “book of wonders” produced in Paris in the early 15th century. Such manuscripts, commissioned by wealthy patrons, presented tales of distant lands for the entertainment of their readers]]
Both an ancient and modern day example of anarcho-communism being utilised by an isolated population would be by the hunter-gatherers of [[North Sentinel Island]]. North Sentinel Island is one of the [[Andaman Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]], occupied by the [[Sentinelese|Sentinelese tribe]] who've inhabited the island for a least 60,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/know-how-60000-year-old-human-tribe-of-secluded-north-sentinel-island-behaves-with-outsiders/as62566496.cms Know how 60,000 year-old human tribe of secluded North Sentinel Island behaves with outsiders] (November, 2018). [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel timestravel].&lt;/ref&gt; They practice a kind of [[primitive communism]], where all property is held collectively by the community, and there exists no hierarchy between different members of the group. The workers, both male and female, control the means of production, as all materials found and collected go toward building small-scale structures for housing and storing of items. Though geographically close to the [[Indian Subcontinent]], the [[Indian government]] doesn't disturb them, as they remain ungoverned. If North Sentinel Island could be called a country, it would be the last remaining anarchist country on the planet.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pandya|first=Vishvajit|date=2009|title=Through Lens and Text: Constructions of a 'Stone Age' Tribe in the Andaman Islands|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40646218|journal=History Workshop Journal|issue=67|pages=173–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Andaman Islands were often said to be inhabited by various tribes and factions, including humanoid wolves in clothing. These claims originate from [[French literature|French fiction]], written to create curiosity for places people of [[Europe]] had never travelled. 

[[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] communities have also been described as having anarcho-communist characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Hinson, E. Glenn. ''The Early Church: Origins to the Dawn of the Middle Ages'', (1996) pp 42–3&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Seaver Billings described "[[Jesuism|Jesusism]]" as a combination of anarchism and communism.&lt;ref name=Billings&gt;{{cite book |author=Frank S.

=== Gift economies and commons-based organising ===
{{see also|Gift economy|Digital commons (economics)}}
In anthropology and the social sciences, a gift economy (or gift culture) is a mode of exchange where valuable [[goods and services]] are regularly given without any explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards (i.e. no formal ''[[quid pro quo]]'' exists).&lt;ref name="Cheal "&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheal |first=David J |title=The Gift Economy |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1988|pages=1–19|isbn=0415006414|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o-wNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Cheal,+David+J.+%27The+Gift+Economy%27|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, voluntary and recurring gift exchange circulates and redistributes wealth throughout a community, and serves to build societal ties and obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Bollier, David. "The Stubborn Vitality of the Gift Economy." Silent Theft: The Private Plunder of Our Common Wealth. First Printing ed. New York: Routledge, 2002. 38–39. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to a [[barter economy]] or a [[market economy]], social norms and custom governs gift exchange, rather than an explicit exchange of goods or services for [[money]] or some other [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="R. Kranton"&gt;R. Kranton: ''Reciprocal exchange: a self-sustaining system'', American Economic Review, V. 86 (1996), Issue 4 (September), pp. 830–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Klallam people at Port Townsend.jpg|thumb|left|Watercolor by [[James G. Swan]] depicting the [[Klallam]] people of chief [[Chetzemoka]] at [[Port Townsend]], with one of Chetzemoka's wives distributing [[potlatch]]]]
Traditional societies dominated by [[gift exchange]] were small in scale and geographically remote from each other. As states formed to regulate trade and commerce within their boundaries, market exchange came to dominate. Nonetheless, the practice of [[gift exchange]] continues to play an important role in modern society.&lt;ref name="Lewis Hyde"&gt;''Lewis Hyde: The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property''&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent example is scientific research, which can be described as a gift economy.&lt;ref name="Warren Hagstrom"&gt;Hagstrom, Warren (1982). "Gift giving as an organizing principle in science". In Barry Barnes and David Edge. Science in Context: Readings in the Sociology of Science.

The expansion of the Internet has witnessed a resurgence of the gift economy, especially in the technology sector. Engineers, scientists and software developers create [[open-source software]] projects. The [[Linux kernel]] and the [[GNU]] operating system are prototypical examples for the gift economy's prominence in the technology sector and its active role in instating the use of [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software]] and [[copyleft]] licenses, which allow free reuse of software and knowledge. Other examples include: [[file-sharing]], [[the commons]], [[open access]]. Anarchist scholar [[Uri Gordon]] has said that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"the collaborative development of [[free software]] like the [[Linux]] operating system and applications such as [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] clearly approximate an informational anarchist communism. Moreover, for anarchists it is precisely the logic of [[expropriation]] and [[Copyright infringement|electronic piracy]] that enables a radical political extension of the cultural ideals of the free manipulation, circulation and use of information associated with the "[[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] ethic" (Himanen 2001). The space of illegality created by [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P (peer-to-peer) file-sharing]] opens up the possibility, not only of the open circulation of freely-given information and software as it is on the Internet today, but also of conscious copyright violation. The Internet, then, enables not only communist relations around information, but also the militant contamination and erosion of non-communist regimes of knowledge—a technological "weapon" to equalise access to information, eating away at intellectual property rights by rendering them unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/uri-gordon-anarchism-and-political-theory-contemporary-problems Uri Gordon. ''Anarchism and Political Theory: Contemporary Problems'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The interest in such economic forms goes back to [[Peter Kropotkin]], who saw in the hunter-gatherer tribes he had visited the paradigm of "[[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]]".&lt;ref name="Mutual Aid 2005"&gt;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1955 paperback (reprinted 2005), includes Kropotkin's 1914 preface, Foreword and Bibliography by Ashley Montagu, and The Struggle for Existence, by Thomas H. Huxley ed.). Boston: Extending Horizons Books, Porter Sargent Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87558-024-6}}. Project Gutenberg e-text, Project LibriVox audiobook&lt;/ref&gt; anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] in his 2011 book ''[[Debt: The First 5000 Years]]'' argues that with the advent of the great [[Axial Age]] civilizations, the nexus between coinage and the calculability of economic values was concomitant with the disrupt of what Graeber calls "human economies," as found among the [[Iroquois]], [[Celts]], [[Inuit]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Nuer people|Nuer]], and the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] among other groups which, according to Graeber, held a radically different conception of debt and social relations, based on the radical incalculability of human life and the constant creation and recreation of social bonds through gifts, marriages and general sociability. The author postulates the growth of a "military-coinage-slave complex" around this time, through which mercenary armies looted cities and human beings were cut from their social context to work as slaves in Greece, Rome and elsewhere in the Eurasian continent. The extreme violence of the period marked by the rise of great empires in China, India and the Mediterranean was, in this way, connected with the advent of large-scale slavery and the use of coins to pay soldiers, together with the obligation enforced by the State for its subjects to pay its taxes in currency. This was also the same time that the great religions spread out and the general questions of philosophical enquiry emerged on world history—many of those directly related, as in Plato's Republic, with the nature of debt and its relation to ethics.

=== Korean Anarchist Movement ===
The Korean Anarchist Movement in [[Korea]] led by [[Kim Jwa Jin]] briefly [[Korean People's Association in Manchuria|brought]] anarcho-communism to Korea. The success was short-lived and much less widespread than the anarchism in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/worldwidemovements/koreahis.html|title=Korean Anarchism History|website=dwardmac.pitzer.edu|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban communities ===


[[Trumbullplex]], as an example of an [[anarchist]] community, operates to serve the common good through sheltering residents within a neighbourhood of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. This allows individuals who've previously gone into debt by means of rent to escape their economic burdens and join a democratic commune. The commune has served as a hangout for young members of the locality, alongside a place intended for teamwork and cooperative decision making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2016/06/09/detroit-sides-anarchists-over-developer-land-bid/85562778/ Detroit sides with anarchists over developer in land bid] (June, 2016). [[Detroit Free Press|Detroit Free Press.]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is often accompanied by music of the [[punk rock]] genre and frequent parties and celebrations thrown by Trumbullplex members. The commune has existed since 1993. Its current ideology, the same as its founding ideology, was to establish a settlement based on principles of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] and the absance of hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metrotimes.com/the-scene/archives/2018/08/21/trumbullplex-turns-25-and-were-all-invited-to-celebrate Trumbullplex turns 25 and we're all invited to celebrate] (August, 2018).

=== Give-away shops ===
[[Give-away shops]], free shops, or free stores, are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to [[charity shop]]s, with mostly second-hand items—only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a [[book]], a piece of furniture, a garment or a [[household]] item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out–type policy (swap shops). The free store is a form of constructive [[direct action]] that provides a shopping alternative to a [[monetary]] framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy. The anarchist [[1960s counterculture|1960s countercultural]] group The Diggers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA112 |accessdate=2011-12-28 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lytle|first=Mark Hamilton|title=America's Uncivil Wars: The Sixties Era from Elvis to the Fall of Richard Nixon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w3iBwAAQBAJ|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-029184-6|pages=213, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]]&lt;ref name="Digger Archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="American Experience doc"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Gail Dolgin]]; Vicente Franco|date=2007|title=American Experience: The Summer of Love|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/love/index.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although free stores have not been uncommon in the United States since the 1960s, the [[freegan]] movement has inspired the establishment of more free stores. Today the idea is kept alive by the new generations of [[social centres]], anarchists and environmentalists who view the idea as an intriguing way to raise awareness about [[consumer culture]] and to promote the [[reuse]] of commodities.

Rajiv Gandhi was campaigning for the upcoming elections in southern states of India. On 21 May, after successfully campaigning in Visakhapatnam, his next stop was Sriperumbudur, [[Tamil Nadu]]. About two hours after arriving in [[Madras]] (now Chennai), Rajiv Gandhi was driven by motorcade in a white [[Hindustan Ambassador|Ambassador car]] to [[Sriperumbudur]], stopping along the way at a few other election campaigning venues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/22/world/assassination-india-rajiv-gandhi-assassinated-bombing-campaign-stop-india-puts.html?scp=2&amp;sq=rajiv%20gandhi%20crossette&amp;st=cse "Assassination in India; Rajiv Gandhi is assassinated in bombing at campaign stop"], by Barbara Crossette, ''The New York Times'', May 22, 1991.

Along the way, he was [[garland]]ed by many well-wishers, Congress party workers and school children. The assassin, Dhanu, approached and greeted him.

===Security lapses===
The Supreme Court held that LTTE's decision of eliminating Rajiv was prompted by his interview to Sunday magazine (August 21–28, 1990), where he said he would send the IPKF to disarm LTTE if he came back to power again. Rajiv also defended the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka accord in the same interview. The LTTE decision to kill him was perhaps aimed at preventing him from coming to power again. Thereafter, the Justice J S Verma Commission was formed to look into the security lapses that led to the killing.

The final report, submitted in June 1992, concluded that the security arrangements for the former PM were adequate but that the local Congress party leaders disrupted and broke these arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Tejas|title=Rajiv assassination mystery unsolved|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/showcolumns.aspx?id=COLEN20070012787|work=Article|publisher=NDTV.com|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[P. V. Narasimha Rao|Narasimha Rao]] government initially rejected ''Verma’''s findings but later accepted it under pressure. However, no action was taken on the recommendations of the Commission.

Despite no action, the findings throw up vital questions that have been consistently raised by political analysts. Sources have indicated that Rajiv was time and again informed that there was a threat to his life and that he should not travel to Tamil Nadu. In fact, the then governor of Tamil Nadu Bhism Narayan Singh, broke his official protocol and twice warned Rajiv about the threat to his life if he visited the state.

Dr Subramanian Swamy said in his book, ''Sri Lanka in Crisis: India's Options (2007)'', that an LTTE delegation had met Rajiv Gandhi on March 5, 1991. Another delegation met him around March 14, 1991 at New Delhi.

Journalist Ram Bahadur Rai wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The message conveyed to Rajiv Gandhi by both these delegations was that there was no threat to his life and that he can travel to Tamil Nadu without fearing for his life. I did a series of articles after his assassination that pointed out how, after these meetings, Rajiv became complacent about his security and broke security rules in more than 40 rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Tejas|title=Rajiv assassination mystery unsolved|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/node/5839|work=Article|publisher=Asian Tribune|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Funeral==
Following his assassination, Rajiv Gandhi's mutilated body was airlifted to [[New Delhi]]. From the [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]], which was named after his mother, his body was sent to the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]] in [[New Delhi]] for post-mortem, reconstruction and embalming.&lt;ref name="rajivgandhifuneral"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAZVQqntxY0C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=rajiv+gandhi+body+reconstructed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0N4BXtDiUV&amp;sig=QAz-jjfTgKC6oe |title=Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi&amp;nbsp;— Shashi Ahluwalia, Meenakshi Ahluwalia |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[state funeral]] was held for Rajiv Gandhi on 24 May 1991. His funeral was telecast live nationally and internationally, and was attended by dignitaries from over 60 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishyourarticles.net/knowledge-hub/essay/assassination-of-rajiv-gandhi-and-its-aftermath-essay.html |title=Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and its aftermath |publisher=Knowledge Hub |date=1991-05-21 |accessdate=2013-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430204658/http://www.publishyourarticles.net/knowledge-hub/essay/assassination-of-rajiv-gandhi-and-its-aftermath-essay.html |archive-date=2013-04-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated on the banks of the river [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]], near the cremation spot of his [[Indira Gandhi|mother]], [[Sanjay Gandhi|brother]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru|grandfather]]. Today, the site where he was cremated is known as ''[[Raj Ghat|Veer Bhumi]]''.

==Investigation==
Immediately after the assassination, the [[Chandra Shekhar|Chandrasekhar]] government handed the investigation over to CBI on May 22, 1991. The agency created a Special Investigation Team (SIT) under [[D. R. Karthikeyan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesnacademy.ac.in/board-of-governors-karthikeyan.html D.R.Karthikeyan]&lt;/ref&gt; to determine who was responsible for the assassination. The SIT probe confirmed the role of LTTE in the assassination,&lt;ref name=sit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Subramanian|first1=T.S|title=A mystery solved|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1611/16111060.htm|website=www.frontline.in|publisher=Frontline|accessdate=10 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was upheld by the Supreme Court of India.&lt;ref name=raj&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keerthana|first1=R|title=Rajiv’s death – a revisit|url=http://www.thehindu.com/in-school/rajivs-death-a-revisit/article5814423.ece|accessdate=10 Aug 2014|publisher=The Hindu|date=21 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interim report of Justice Milap Chand Jain, looking into the conspiracy angle to the assassination, indicted the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] for colluding with the LTTE. The report concluded that DMK provided sanctuary to the LTTE, which made it easy for the rebels to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi.&lt;ref name=raj/&gt;

The Commission report stated that the year 1989 signified "the perpetuation of the general political trend of indulging the Tamil militants on Indian soil and tolerance of their wide-ranging criminal and anti-national activities". The report also alleged that LTTE leaders in Jaffna were in possession of sensitive coded messages exchanged between the Union government and the state government of DMK. "There is evidence to show that, during this period, some of the most vital wireless messages were passed between the LTTE operatives based in Tamil Nadu and Jaffna. These messages, which were decoded later, are directly related to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi," the report stated. The Congress subsequently brought down the United Front (UF) government of I K Gujral after the report was leaked in November 1998. The party also demanded the removal of DMK from the UF government, arguing that it had played a key role in the death of Rajiv Gandhi.

==Perpetrator==
[[File:Thenmozhi Rajaratnam.jpg|thumb|Thenmozhi Rajaratnam]]
The assassination was carried out by Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, also known as Dhanu&lt;!-- As her date of birth is disputed, please add a citation if you want to add a date of birth to this article --&gt;. She was a member of the Sri Lankan separatist group [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (Tamil Tigers).

==Supreme Court judgment==
As per the [[Supreme Court of India]] judgment, by [[K. T. Thomas (Justice)|Judge K. T. Thomas]], the killing was carried out due to personal animosity of the LTTE chief [[Prabhakaran]] towards [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. Additionally, the Rajiv Gandhi administration had antagonised other Tamil militant organisations like [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] for reversing the military coup in Maldives back in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cbi.nic.in/dop/judgements/thomas.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102222525/http://cbi.nic.in/dop/judgements/thomas.pdf |archive-date=2011-11-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judgement further cites the death of [[Thileepan]] in a hunger strike and the suicide by 12 LTTE cadres in a vessel in October 1987.
The judgment while convicting the accused, four of them to death and others to various jail terms, states that absolutely no evidence existed that any one of the conspirators ever desired the death of any Indian other than Rajiv Gandhi, though several people were killed. Judge Wadhwa further states there is nothing on record to show that the intention to kill Rajiv Gandhi was to overawe the Government. Hence it was held that it was not a terrorist act under TADA (Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1611/16111030.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Out of the TADA net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbi.nic.in/judgements/thomas.pdf |title=Death Reference Case No. (@ D.NO.1151 OF 1998) |publisher=Cbi.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Thomas further states that conspiracy was hatched in stages commencing from 1987 and that it spanned several years. The Special Investigation team of India's premier special investigation agency [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] was not able to pinpoint when the decision to kill Rajiv Gandhi was taken.&lt;ref name=cbi /&gt;

==Trial==
The trial was conducted under the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act]] (TADA). On January 28, 1998, the designated TADA court in [[Chennai]] gave death sentences to all the 26 accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-tracing-the-trial/453154-3.html |title=Rajiv Gandhi assassination case: tracing the trial - IBNLive |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/nation/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-timeline.html |title=Rajiv Gandhi assassination Timeline |publisher=Dailypioneer.com |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a storm in India. Legal experts were stunned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Bhavna Vij  |author2=Swati Chaturvedi |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19980130/03050184.html|title=Legal luminaries divided on death verdict in Rajiv assassination case|publisher=The Indian Express|date=1998-01-30|accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Human rights groups protested as the trial did not meet the standards of a free trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA200222000?open&amp;of=ENG-IND India: The Prevention of Terrorism Bill. Past abuses revisited | Amnesty International] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203190256/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA200222000?open&amp;of=ENG-IND |date=December 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was held behind closed doors, in camera courts, and the identity of witnesses was not disclosed.  Ms A. Athirai, an accused, was only 17 years old when she was arrested.

Under TADA an accused can appeal only to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]. Appeal to the [[Madras High Court|High Court]] is not allowed as in normal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/saran/lanka/3298.html |title=Human Rights Bulletin on Srfati Lanka |publisher=Derechos.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confessions given by the accused to the Superintendent of Police are taken as evidence against the accused under TADA. Under TADA the accused could be convicted on the basis of evidence that would have been insufficient for conviction by an ordinary court under normal Indian law. In the Rajiv Gandhi case, confessions by the accused formed a major part of the evidence in the judgement against them which they later claimed was taken under duress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbi.nic.in/Judgements/wadwa.htm |accessdate=August 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122000734/http://cbi.nic.in/Judgements/wadwa.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]], only four of the accused were sentenced to death and the others to various jail terms. S Nalini Sriharan is the lone surviving member of the five-member squad behind the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and is serving life imprisonment. Arrested on June 14, 1991, she was sentenced to death, along with the other 25 accused. However, the court confirmed that the death sentence was given to only four of the convicts, including Nalini, on May 11, 1999. Nalini, who was a close friend of an LTTE operative known as V Sriharan alias Murugan, another convict in the case who had been sentenced to death, later gave birth to a girl, Harithra Murugan in prison. Upon the intervention of Rajiv Gandhi's widow and Congress president [[Sonia Gandhi]], who petitioned for clemency for the sake of Nalini's daughter in 2000, the death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Nalini was treated as a class 'A' convict from September 10, 1999 till the privilege was withdrawn in May 2010 after a mobile phone was allegedly recovered from her cell during a surprise check. She "regrets" the killing of the former Prime Minister and claims that the real conspirators have not been booked yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=PTI|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-08-03/india/27901060_1_rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-nalini-sriharan-suicide-bomber |title=I regret Rajiv Gandhi's assassination: Nalini|publisher=The Times of India|date=2008-08-03 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=IANS |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_my-sins-washed-away-says-nalini-sriharan_1159967 |title=My sins washed away, says Nalini Sriharan|publisher=DNA India|date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President of India rejected the clemency pleas of Murugan and two others on death row, T Suthendraraja alias Santhan and A G Perarivalan alias Arivu in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=TNN |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-11/india/30141652_1_vellore-prison-nalini-sriharan-puzhal-prison |title=Nalini meets hubby on death row|publisher=The Times of India|date=2011-09-11 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The execution of the three convicts was scheduled for September 9, 2011.

In 2010, Nalini had moved the [[Madras High Court]] seeking release as she had served more than 20 years in prison. She argued that even life convicts were released after 14 years.

==Controversies==
In a report published on 30 October 2012 in [http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_ib-hid-crucial-video-on-rajiv-gandhi-murder-book_1757684 DNA], K Ragothaman, former chief investigator of the CBI, talks about his new book ''[http://www.milligazette.com/news/4494-buy-a-copy-of-conspiracy-to-kill-rajiv-gandhi-from-the-cbi-files Conspiracy to Kill Rajiv Gandhi: From the CBI Files]'' and tells the reporter that while the CBI had started a preliminary inquiry in which MK Narayanan, former West Bengal Governor and former Intelligence Bureau director,  was named a suspect in hiding evidence, the case was buried by the CBI SIT Chief, D.R. Karthikeyan.

In an interview in 2017, Judge K.T.Thomas had said that "there were “serious flaws in the CBI’s investigation in case, particularly related to the seizure of Rs 40 lakh in cash from the convicts, which led him to believe that the probe exposed “an unpardonable flaw” in the “Indian criminal justice system”.

==Jain Commission and other reports==
In the Jain report, various people and agencies are named as suspected of having been involved in the murder of Rajiv Gandhi. Among them, the cleric [[Chandraswami]] was suspected of involvement, including financing the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_print.asp?id=266715 outlookindia.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015094247/http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_print.asp?id=266715 |date=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980711/19250694.html |title=Probe Chandraswami's role in Rajiv case - Jain report |publisher=Expressindia.com |date=1987-09-23 |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec112004/i2.asp |accessdate=August 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228043145/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/Dec112004/i2.asp |archivedate=December 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the accused, Ranganath, said Chandraswami was the godfather who financed the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19990514/ige14006.html |title=Chandraswami had a hand in the plot |publisher=Expressindia.com |date=1999-05-14 |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sikh Militants were also suspected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-today.com/jain/vol3/chap2.html Jain Commission Report Chapter Ii] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111503/http://www.india-today.com/jain/vol3/chap2.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-today.com/jain/vol3/chap8.html Jain Commission Report Chapter Viii] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815221832/http://www.india-today.com/jain/vol3/chap8.html |date=August 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The interim report of the [[Jain Commission]] created a storm when it accused Muthu and the Tamils of a role in the assassination, leading to Congress withdrawing its support for the [[I. K. Gujral]] government and fresh elections in 1998.  Also other strong LTTE sympathizers [[Vaiko]] with [[Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|MDMK]] and [[Thol. Thirumavalavan]] with [[Dalit Panthers of India|VCK]] have supported Congress under Sonia Gandhi in the past. Vaiko left the UPA alliance before the [[Indian general election, 2009|2009 election]], partly due to the Sri Lankan issue. In the 2001 Norway peace talks, Prabhakaran told the press that the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was a sorrowful event.
In 2006, LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingham told the Indian television channel [[NDTV]] that the killing was a "great tragedy, a monumental historical tragedy which we deeply regret".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=70062 We deeply regret Rajiv's death: LTTE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513024836/http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=70062 |date=May 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Blockbusting''' is a business process of U.S. [[real estate agent]]s and building developers to convince [[White Americans|white]] property owners to sell their house at low prices, which they do by promoting fear in those house owners that racial minorities will soon be moving into the neighborhood. The agents then sell those same houses at much higher prices to [[African Americans|black]] families desperate to escape the overcrowded ghettos.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein"&gt;James M Rubenstein (2014).

All rights reserved ]''. {{ISBN|1-56639-147-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockbusting became possible after the legislative and judicial dismantling of legally protected racially segregated real estate practices after [[World War II]]. By the 1980s it largely disappeared as a business practice, after changes in law and the real estate market.&lt;ref name="Mehlhorn"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dmitri Mehlhorn|authorlink= |title=A Requiem for Blockbusting: Law, Economics, and Race-Based Real Estate Speculation|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=67|issue=|pages=1145–1161|publisher= |location= |date=December 1998|url= |doi= |id= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
From 1900-1970, around 6 million African-Americans from the rural [[Southern United States]] moved to industrial and urban cities in [[Northern United States|Northern]] and [[Western United States]] during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] in effort to avoid the [[Jim Crow laws]], violence, bigotry, and limited opportunities in the South. Resettlement to these cities peaked during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] as northern and western cities recruited tens of thousands of blacks and whites including those from the South to work in the war industry and shipyards. As a result of this influx of black residents, racial and class antagonisms heightened across the urban United States, in part due to the over-crowding of cities. As American soldiers returned home in the aftermath of World War I and World War II, they struggled to find adequate housing and jobs in the cities that they left.

White homeowners in many U.S. cities regarded blacks as a social and economic threat to their neighborhoods. If blacks moved into a neighborhoods, home values in that neighborhood would decrease. As white homeowners took great pride in their homes and often viewed them as their life's investment, they feared that allowing one black family to move into their neighborhood would ruin their life investments. To prevent their neighborhoods from becoming racially mixed, many cities kept their neighborhoods segregated with local [[zoning]] laws. Such laws required non-white and white ethnic groups to reside in geographically defined areas of the town or city, preventing them from moving to areas inhabited by non-whites.

This belief was substantiated by both racism and legislation. In 1934, the [[National Housing Act of 1934|National Housing Act]] was signed into law by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], establishing the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA). The FHA was commissioned by the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create "residential security maps" to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments in each surveyed city. These maps marked neighborhoods by quality from ‘A’ to ‘D’, with ‘A’ being the nicest neighborhoods and ‘D’ being the worst. Every neighborhood with some black population was given a ‘D’ rating and residents of those areas were refused loans. This practice, called [[redlining]], gave whites an economic incentive to keep blacks out of their communities.

The areas that non-whites were allowed to live in were [[Decline of Detroit#Racism in Housing|substandard]]. This was in part due to the over-crowding, which was exacerbated by the Great Migration. Often, several families were crowded into one unit. Because non-whites were confined to these small areas of the city, landlords were able to exploit their residents by charging high rents and ignoring repairs.

In 1917, in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] voided the racial residency [[Statute|statutes]] that forbade blacks from living in white neighborhoods. The court ruled that the statutes violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].[[Blockbusting#cite note-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] However, whites found a loophole in this case by using racially [[Restrictive covenant|restrictive covenants]] in [[Deed|deeds]], and real estate businesses informally applied them to prevent the sale of houses to Black Americans in White neighborhoods. To thwart the Supreme Court's ''Buchanan v. Warley'' prohibition of such legal business racism, state courts interpreted the covenants as a [[contract]] between private persons, outside the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, in the ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' case in 1948, the Supreme Court ruled that the Amendment's Equal Protection Clause outlawed the states' legal enforcement of racially restrictive covenants in state courts.[[Blockbusting#cite note-5|&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] In this event, decades of segregation practices were annulled, which had compelled blacks to live in over-crowded and over-priced [[Ghetto|ghettos]]. Freed by the Supreme Court from the legal restrictions, it became possible for non-whites to buy homes that had previously been reserved for white residents.

Generally, "blockbusting" denotes the real estate and building development business practices yielding double profits from anti-black racism. Real estate companies used deceitful tactics to make white homeowners think that their neighborhood was being “invaded” by non-white residents&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;, which in turn would encourage them to quickly sell their houses at below-market prices. The companies then sold that property to blacks who were desperate to escape inner-city ghettos at higher-than-market prices.

Due to redlining, African-Americans usually did not qualify for [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] from banks and [[Savings and loan association|savings and loan associations]]. Instead, they resorted to [[Land contract|land installment contracts]] at above market rates to buy a house. The harsh terms of these contracts often led to foreclosure, so these houses had a high turnover rate. With blockbusting, real estate companies legally profited firstly from the [[arbitrage]] (the difference between the discounted price paid to frightened white sellers and the artificially high price paid by black buyers), secondly from the commissions resulting from increased real estate sales, and thirdly from their higher than market [[financing]] of the house sales to blacks.[[Blockbusting#cite note-Mehlhorn-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The documentary ''[[Revolution '67]]'' (2007) examines the blockbusting practiced in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in the 1960s.

==Methods==
The term ''blockbusting'' might have originated in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where real estate companies and building developers used ''[[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]''. Those were non-white people hired to deceive the white residents of a neighborhood into believing that black people were moving into the neighborhood. The houses that became vacant in that way, enabled accelerated emigration of economically successful racial minority residents to better neighborhoods beyond the [[ghettos]]. The white residents were encouraged to quickly sell (at a loss) and emigrate to generally more racially homogeneous [[suburbs]]. Blockbusting was most prevalent on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] and [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of Chicago, and also was heavily practiced in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] and in the [[West Oak Lane]] neighborhood of Northwest Philadelphia.

The tactics included:

* hiring black women to be seen pushing baby carriages in white neighborhoods, so encouraging white fear of devalued property
* hiring black youth to stage street brawls in front of white homes to generate feelings of an unsafe atmosphere 
* selling a house to a black family in a middle-class white neighborhood to provoke [[white flight]], before the community's properties decline considerably
* selling white neighborhood houses to black families, and afterwards placing real estate agent business cards in the neighbors' mailboxes, and saturating the neighborhood area with fliers offering quick cash for houses
* developers buying houses and dwelling buildings, and leaving them unoccupied to make the neighborhood appear abandoned{{snd}}like a [[ghetto]] or a [[slum]]
Such practices can be described as [[psychological manipulation]] that usually frightened the remaining white residents into selling at a loss.

Blockbusting was very common and very profitable. For example, by 1962, when blockbusting had been practiced for some fifteen years, the city of Chicago had more than 100 real estate companies that had been, on average, "changing" two to three blocks a week for years.&lt;ref name="Mehlhorn"/&gt;

==Reactions==
In 1962, "blockbusting"{{snd}}real estate profiteering{{snd}}was nationally exposed by ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' with the article "Confessions of a Block-Buster", wherein the author detailed the practices, emphasizing the profit gained from frightening white people to sell at a loss, in order to quickly resettle in racially segregated "better neighborhoods".&lt;ref name="Mehlhorn"/&gt; In response to political pressure from the cheated sellers and buyers, states and cities legally restricted door-to-door real estate solicitation, the posting of "FOR SALE" signs, and authorized government licensing agencies to investigate the blockbusting complaints of buyers and sellers, and to revoke the real estate sales licenses of blockbusters.&lt;ref name="Mehlhorn"/&gt; Likewise, other states' legislation allowed [[lawsuit]]s against real estate companies and brokers who cheated buyers and sellers with [[fraud]]ulent representations of declining property values, changing racial and ethnic neighborhood populations, increasing crime, and the "worsening" of schools, because of race mixing.&lt;ref name="Mehlhorn"/&gt;

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Fair Housing Act of 1968]] established federal [[cause of action|causes of action]] against blockbusting, including illegal real estate broker claims that blacks, Hispanics, ''et al.'' had or were going to move into a neighborhood, and so devalue the properties. The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] was charged with the task of administering and enforcing this law.  In the case of ''[[Jones v. Mayer|Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.]]'' (1968), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] authorized the federal government's prohibiting racial discrimination in private housing markets.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jones v. Mayer|Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.]]'', 392 U.S. 409 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; It thereby allowed black American legal [[cause of action|claims]] to rescind the usurious land contracts (featuring over-priced houses and higher-than-market mortgage interest rates), as a discriminatory real estate business practice illegal under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], thus greatly reducing the profitability of blockbusting. Nevertheless, the said regulatory and statutory remedies against blockbusting were challenged in court; thus, towns cannot prohibit an owner's placing a "FOR SALE" sign before his house, in order to reduce blockbusting. In the case of ''[[Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro]]'' (1977), the Supreme Court ruled that such prohibitions infringe [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro]]'', 431 U.S. 85 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by the 1980s, as evidence of blockbusting practices disappeared, states and cities began rescinding statutes restricting blockbusting.

==Popular culture==
The serious-comic television series ''[[All in the Family]]'' (1971–79), featured "The Blockbuster", a 1971 episode about the practice, illustrating some real estate blockbusting techniques.

In the 2011 historical fantasy novel ''Redwood and Wildfire'' author Andrea Hairston depicts actors being hired for blockbusting in Chicago, as well as the sense of betrayal experienced by others when they realized some black people were getting rich by participating in these exploitative schemes.

'''Border controls''' are measures taken by a [[country]] or a bloc of countries to monitor its [[border]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://definitions.uslegal.com/b/border-control/]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to regulate the movement of people, animals and goods.

==History==
[[File:Indian Passport Information page Censored New.jpg|thumb|200px|Example of a passport, the travel document most commonly required to clear border controls.]]
States and rulers have always regarded the ability to determine who enters or remains in their territories as a key test of their sovereignty, but prior to [[World War I]], border controls were only sporadically implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Economic Consequences of the Peace |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |authorlink=John Maynard Keynes |year=1920 |publisher=Harcourt Brace |location=New York|chapter=II Europe Before the War|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15776/15776-h/15776-h.htm#CHAPTER_II }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, for example, the boundaries between rival countries and centres of power were largely symbolic or consisted of amorphous borderlands, ‘marches’ and ‘debatable lands’ of indeterminate or contested status and the real ‘borders’ consisted of the fortified walls that surrounded towns and cities, where the authorities could exclude undesirable or incompatible people at the gates, from vagrants, beggars and the ‘wandering poor’, to ‘masterless women’, lepers, Gypsies or Jews&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historytoday.com/matt-carr/beyond-border]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept of a travel document such as a passport needed to clear border controls in the modern sense has been traced back to the reign of [[Henry V of England]], as a means of helping his subjects prove who they were in foreign lands. The earliest reference to these documents is found in a [[Safe Conducts Act 1414|1414 Act of Parliament]].&lt;ref name="brief history"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/nov/17/travelnews A brief history of the passport] - The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7634744.stm |title=Analysis: The first ID cards |accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= | publisher =BBC |date= 2008-09-25 | first=Dominic | last=Casciani}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1540, granting travel documents in England became a role of the [[Privy Council of England]], and it was around this time that the term "passport" was used. In 1794, issuing British passports became the job of the Office of the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name="brief history"/&gt; The 1548 Imperial Diet of Augsburg required the public to hold imperial documents for travel, at the risk of permanent exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Torpey]], « Le contrôle des passeports et la liberté de circulation. Le cas de l'Allemagne au XIXe siècle », Genèses, 1998, n° 1, pp. 53-76&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, European governments introduced border passport requirements for security reasons, and to control the emigration of people with useful skills. These controls remained in place after the war, becoming a standard, though controversial, procedure. British tourists of the 1920s complained, especially about attached photographs and physical descriptions, which they considered led to a "nasty dehumanisation".&lt;ref&gt;Marrus, Michael, ''The Unwanted: European Refugees in the Twentieth Century''.  New York: Oxford University Press (1985), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest systematic attempts of a modern nation state to implement border controls to restrict entry of particular groups was the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882 ({{lang-zh|1882年美国排华法案}}) in America. This act aimed to implement discriminatory immigration controls on East Asians. The strict and racist border control policies had a negative impact not only on the Chinese alone but also on whites and other races as well which lasted for about thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tian|first=Kelly|date=|title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and Its Impact on North American Society|url=http://www.kon.org/urc/v9/tian.html|journal=|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American economy suffered a great loss as a result of this Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tian|first=Kelly|date=|title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and Its Impact on North American Society|url=http://www.kon.org/urc/v9/tian.html|journal=|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was a sign of injustice and unfair treatment to the Chinese workers because the jobs they engaged in were mostly menial jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodenner|first=Chris|date=February 6, 2013|title=Chinese Exclusion Act; Issues and Controversies in American History|url=http://www.ndhs.org/s/1012/images/editor_documents/library/issues_and_controversies_in_american_history_-_chinese_exclusion_act.pdf?sessionid=7aa0a591-8d60-4578-ba02-e7cfe36e74ab&amp;cc=1|journal=|volume=|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similarly discriminatory approach to border control was taken in Canada through the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1885]] ({{lang-zh|1885年華人移民法案}}), imposing what came to be called the [[Chinese head tax in Canada|Chinese head tax]] ({{lang-zh|人頭稅}}).

Decolonisation during the twentieth century saw the emergence of mass emigration from nations in the [[Global South]], thus leading former colonial occupiers to introduce stricter border controls. &lt;ref name=newint&gt;[https://newint.org/features/1991/09/05/simply]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom this process took place in stages, with British nationality law eventually shifting from recognising all [[Commonwealth citizens]] as British subjects to today’s complex [[British nationality law]] which distinguishes between British citizens, modern [[British Subjects]], [[British Overseas Citizens]], and [[British National (Overseas)|overseas nationals]], with each non-standard category created as a result of attempts to balance border control and the need to mitigate [[statelessness]]. This aspect of the rise of border control in the 20th century has proven controversial. The British Nationality Law 1981 has been criticised by experts,{{efn|For example, [[Ann Dummett]], an activist for racial equality, criticised the legislation, saying that "there is no indication at all in our nationality law of ethnic origin being a criterion. But the purpose of the law since 1981, and the manner in which it is implemented, make sure that ethnic origin is in fact and in practice a deciding factor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2006/oct/eu-meijers-cttee-vis-proposal.pdf], Letter to Franco FRATTINI, Standing committee of experts on international immigration, refugee and criminal law. Date: 25 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Ms Dummett also said that ''the 1981 Nationality Act in effect gave full British citizenship to a group of whom at least 96% are white people, and the other, less favourable forms of British nationality to groups who are at least 98% non-white&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.britishhongkong.com/main/2009/01/latest-letter-to-the-houses-of-parliament-lack-of-basic-human-rights-in-the-borders-citizenship-and-immigration-bill/ Lack of basic human rights in the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill, BritishHongKong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911063159/http://www.britishhongkong.com/main/2009/01/latest-letter-to-the-houses-of-parliament-lack-of-basic-human-rights-in-the-borders-citizenship-and-immigration-bill/ |date=2011-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} as well as by the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] of the [[United Nations]],{{efn|In March 1996, there was a submission to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of United Nations. The committee criticised the arrangements of the BN(O) nationality under "Principal subjects of concern": ''The Government's statement that South Asian residents of Hong Kong are granted some form of British nationality, whether that of a British National Overseas (BNO) or a British Overseas Citizen (BOC), so that no resident of Hong Kong would be left stateless following the transfer of sovereignty is noted with interest. It is, however, a matter of concern that such status does not grant the bearer the right of abode in the United Kingdom and contrasts with the full citizenship status conferred upon a predominantly white population living in another dependent territory. It is noted that most of the persons holding BNO or BOC status are Asians and that judgements on applications for citizenship appear to vary according to the country of origin, which leads to the assumption that this practice reveals elements of racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/5ff3d725d136a1fcc12563e0003dbc08?Opendocument Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination : United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 28/03/96.]&lt;/ref&gt;}} on the grounds that the different classes of British nationality it created are, in fact, closely related to the ethnic origins of their holders.

The creation of British Nationality (Overseas) ({{lang-zh|英國國民（海外）}}) status, for instance, (with fewer privileges than British citizen status) was met with criticism from many Hong Kong residents who felt that British citizenship would have been more appropriate in light of the "moral debt" owed to them by the UK.{{efn|For example, the legislative councilor [[Henrietta Ip Man-Hing|Dr Henrietta Ip]] criticised the idea of British National (Overseas) and again urged the UK Parliament, to grant full British citizenship to Hong Kong's British nationals in the council meeting held on 5 July 1989, saying that "we were born and live under British rule on British land.... It is therefore... our right to ask that you should give us back a place of abode so that we can continue to live under British rule on British land if we so wish.... I represent most of all those who live here to firmly request and demand you to grant us the right to full British citizenship so that we can, if we so wish, live in the [[United Kingdom]], our Motherland... I say to you that the right of abode in the United Kingdom is the best and the only definitive guarantee....'' With your failure to give us such a guarantee, reluctant as I may, I must advise the people of Hong Kong, and urgently now, each to seek for themselves a home of last resort even if they have to leave to do so''. I do so because, as a legislator, my duty is with the people first and the stability and prosperity of [[Hong Kong]] second, although the two are so interdependent on each other...."}}{{efn|The legislation is sometimes compared with [[Macau]], a former colony of [[Portugal]], where many residents of Chinese descent were granted right of abode in Portugal when Macau was still under colonial rule. They were not deprived of their right of abode after the [[transfer of sovereignty of Macau]] in 1999, their [[Portuguese passport]]s and citizenship are valid and inheritable, and it turned out that many of them still choose to stay in Macau.}} Some British politicians{{efn|Then [[Shadow Home Secretary]], [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], said in a letter to the then [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]] dated 30 January 1997 that a claim that British National (Overseas) status amounts to British nationality "is pure [[sophistry]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=48962 "Labour call for British citizenship for Hong Kong ethnic Asians"], ''PR Newswire Europe Ltd.'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and magazines{{efn|''[[The Economist]]'' also wrote critically in an article published on 3 July 1997 that "the failure to offer citizenship to most of Hong Kong’s residents was shameful", and "it was the height of cynicism to hand 6m people over to a regime of proven brutality without allowing them any means to move elsewhere." The article commented that the real reason that the new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] still refused to give full British citizenship to other British Dependent Territories Citizens in around 1997 - because the United Kingdom was waiting until Hong Kong had been disposed of - "would be seen as highly cynical", as [[Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean|Baroness Symons]], a [[Foreign Office]] minister, has conceded.&lt;ref&gt;"Britain’s colonial obligations", ''[[The Economist]]'', 3 July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;}} also criticised the creation of BN(O) status.

Ethnic tensions created during colonial occupation also resulted in discriminatory policies being adopted in newly independent African nations, such as Uganda under [[Idi Amin]] which banned [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asians from Uganda]], thus creating a mass exodus of the (largely Gujarati&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/international/story/19790515-hopes-soar-among-ugandan-asians-as-idi-amin-dictatorial-regime-falls-822011-2014-02-28|title=Hopes soar among Ugandan Asians as Idi Amin's dictatorial regime falls|date=February 28, 2014|first=K|last=Srinivas|publisher=[[India Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujaratis-survived-Idi-Amin-fuelled-East-Africas-economy/articleshow/3625352.cms|title=Gujaratis survived Idi Amin, fuelled East Africa’s economy|date=October 22, 2008|first1=Ashish|last1=Vashi|first2=Ankur|last2=Jain|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Asian community of Uganda. Such ethnically driven border control policies took forms ranging from anti-Asian sentiment in East Africa to [[Apartheid]] policies in South Africa and Namibia (then known as [[Southwest Africa]] under South African rule) which creates [[bantustan]]s{{efn|Bantustans within the borders of South Africa were classified as "self-governing" or "independent" and theoretically had some sovereign powers. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no economic infrastructure worth mentioning and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa. Throughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. Nevertheless, internal organisations of many countries, as well as the South African government, lobbied for their recognition. For example, upon the foundation of Transkei, the [[Swiss-South African Association]] encouraged the Swiss government to recognise the new state. In 1976, leading up to a [[United States House of Representatives]] resolution urging the President to not recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill. While the bill fell short of its needed two-thirds vote, a simple majority of lawmakers nevertheless supported the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pitterman |first=Shelly |authorlink= |title=A Fine Face for Apartheid |website=Southern Africa Perspectives |publisher= |date= |url=http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-E84-84-al.sff.document.af000020.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals.}} and [[pass laws]]{{efn|In South Africa, pass laws were designed to segregate the population,  manage urbanisation, and allocate migrant labour. Also known as the natives law, pass laws severely limited the movements of not only blacks, but other peoples as well (e.g. Asians) by requiring them to carry pass books when outside their homelands or designated areas. Before the 1950s, this legislation largely applied to African men, and attempts to apply it to women in the 1910s and 1950s were met with significant protests. Pass laws would be one of the dominant features of the country's [[apartheid]] system, until it was effectively ended in 1986.

It was replaced in 1945 by the Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act, which imposed "influx control" on black men, and also set up guidelines for removing people deemed to be living idle lives from urban areas.

==Aspects==
There are multiple aspects of border control.

===Quarantine===
[[File:Insignia of China Inspection and Quarantine 2012 (2).jpg|200|thumb|Quarantine operations deployed by mainland Chinese border control.]]
{{main|Quarantine}}

Quarantine policies exist to control the spread of disease. When applied as a component of border control, such policies focus primarily on mitigating the entry of infected individuals, plants, or animals into a country.&lt;ref&gt;Champion P.D.; Hofstra D.E.; Clayton J.S.(2007) Border control for potential aquatic weeds. Stage 3. Weed risk assessment. ''Science for Conservation 271''. p. 41. Department of Conservation, New Zealand. [http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/science-and-technical/sfc271.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customs===
[[Image:Ports of Auckland Customs Boundary.jpg|thumb|right|Southern edge (customs border) of Captain Cook wharf, [[Ports of Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. An [[electric fence]] is  faintly visible behind the historical fence]]

{{main|Customs}}

Each country has its own laws and regulations for the [[international trade|import]] and [[export]] of goods into and out of a country, which its customs authority enforces. The import or export of some goods may be restricted or forbidden, in which case customs controls enforce such policies.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 1992"&gt;
Chowdhury, F. L. (1992) Evasion of Customs Duty in Bangladesh, unpublished MBA dissertation submitted to Monash University, Australia.
&lt;/ref&gt; Customs enforcement at borders can also entail collecting [[excise tax]] and preventing the smuggling of dangerous or illegal goods. A [[customs duty]] is a [[tariff]] or [[tax]] on the importation (usually) or exportation (unusually) of goods.

In many countries, border controls for arriving passengers at many international airports and some road crossings are separated into red and green channels in order to prioritise customs enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dual-Channel System (Customs Clearance)|url = http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=98#red-or-green|website = Ica.gov.sg|accessdate = 2015-09-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150906070322/http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=98#red-or-green#red-or-green|archive-date = 2015-09-06|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toll.no/upload/Dokumenter/brosjyrer_veiledere/Reisende_ENG.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319202853/http://www.toll.no/upload/Dokumenter/brosjyrer_veiledere/Reisende_ENG.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 March 2009|title=Wayback Machine|date=19 March 2009|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the European Union’s common customs area, airports may operate additional blue channels for passengers arriving from within that area. For such passengers, border control may focus specifically on prohibited items and other goods that are not covered by the common policy. [[Bag tag|Luggage tags]] for checked luggage travelling within the EU are green-edged so they may be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_controls/baggage_controls/index_en.htm#exit|title=EUROPA - Taxation and Customs Union / Baggage controls|publisher=Ec.europa.eu|date=2007-02-21|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/images/etiquette_verte.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328205916/http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/images/etiquette_verte.gif |archive-date=2007-03-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most EU member states, travellers coming from other EU countries within the [[Schengen Area]] ({{lang-de|Schengen-Raum}}; {{lang-fr|l'Espace Schengen}}) can use the green lane, although airports outside the Schengen Area or with frequent flights arriving from jurisdictions within Schengen but outside the European Union may use blue channels for convenience and efficiency.

====Customs area====
A customs area is an area designated for storage of commercial goods that have not cleared border controls for customs purposes. It is surrounded by a customs border. Commercial goods not yet cleared through customs are often stored in a type of customs area known as a [[bonded warehouse]], until processed or re-exported.&lt;ref name="ANTW"&gt;[http://www.haven.antwerpen.be/html/17_FAQ/page_FAQ_00.html Port of Antwerp FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030517113119/http://www.haven.antwerpen.be/html/17_FAQ/page_FAQ_00.html |date=2003-05-17 }} (from the official website of the [[Port of Antwerp]]. Accessed 2008-06-16.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaicustoms.gov.in/note2001/PN003_2001.htm Public Notice No. 03 /2001] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828071637/http://www.chennaicustoms.gov.in/note2001/PN003_2001.htm |date=2008-08-28 }} (from the 'Office of the Commissioner of Customs', Customs House, [[Chennai]], [[India]]. Retrieved 2007-10-12)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Port]]s authorised to handle international cargo generally include recognised bonded warehouses.

For the purpose of [[customs duties]], goods within the customs area are treated as being outside the country. This allows easy [[transshipment]] to a third country without customs authorities being involved.&lt;ref name="ANTW"/&gt; For this reason, customs areas are usually carefully controlled and fenced to prevent [[smuggling]]. However, the area is still territorially part of the country, so the goods within the area are subject to other local laws (for example [[drug laws]] and [[biosecurity]] regulations), and thus may be searched, [[Search and seizure|impounded]] or turned back.

The term is also sometimes used to define an area (usually composed of several countries) which form a [[customs union]], a [[customs territory]], or to describe the area at airports and ports where travellers are checked through customs.

====Duty-free shops====
[[File:Pyongyang airport.JPG|thumb|120px|Duty Free Shop at [[Pyongyang Sunan International Airport]]]]
{{main|Duty-free shop}}
Common at international airports and occasionally at seaports or land crossings, duty-free shops sell products tax-free to customers who have cleared exit border controls prior to boarding an international flight and, in some airports, to passengers arriving from overseas. Most countries impose limits on how much of each type of duty-free goods, may be purchased by each passenger. The airport with the most duty-free sales is [[Seoul Incheon Airport]] ({{lang-ko|인천국제공항}}), with US$1.85 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://www.trbusiness.com/regional-news/asia-pacific/incheon-airport-duty-free-sales-hit-us2bn-in-2016/114119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubai International Airport ({{lang-ar|مطار دبي الدولي}}; {{lang-hi|दुबई अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय विमानक्षेत्र}}) is second, recording transactions worth $1.82 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/sectors/retail/dubai-duty-free-sales-drop-on-currency-fluctuations-1.1956773|title=Dubai Duty Free sales drop on currency fluctuations|last=Reporter|first=Cleofe Maceda, Senior Web|date=2017-01-05|newspaper=GulfNews|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Border security===

Border security measures are border control policies adopted by a country or group of countries to fight against unauthorised travel or trade across its borders, limit illegal immigration, combat [[transnational crime]], and prevent wanted criminals from travelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dhs.gov/border-security |title=Border Security |website=Department of Homeland Security}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ISR denied stamp.jpg|135px|thumb|As a border security measure, some jurisdictions in the west (such as  Germany and Israel) have historically stamped denied entries on passports. This stamp was issued by Israeli authorities at the [[Taba Border Crossing]] (and misspells the English word "entry").]] 
[[Image:Indo-Bangladeshi Barrier.JPG|thumb|left|300px|The border fence built by India, as seen from near the Hili border station on the Bangladeshi side.]]
[[File:Indo-bangla border.jpg|thumb|India Bangladesh Border fencing from Indian side, captured at a border side in [[North 24 Parganas district]]]]
[[File:Ambassador Bridge crossing.jpg|thumb|Crossing the [[Ambassador bridge]] into Canada]]

In India, border security focuses primarily on the Bangladeshi and Pakistani borders. In order to deter unlawful immigration and drug trafficking&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/indiabangladesh+apossecurityapos+fence/3281357], Channel 4 News, 24 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; from Bangladesh, India is constructing the [[Bangladesh–India border#India–Bangladesh barrier|India-Bangladesh barrier]]. On the Pakistani border, the [[Border Security Force]] aims to prevent the infiltration of Indian territory by terrorists from Pakistan and other countries in the west (Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc.).

American border security focuses primarily on the [[Mexico-United States border|Mexican-American border]] ({{lang-es|La frontera entre los Estados Unidos de América y los Estados Unidos Mexicanos}}). Security along this border is composed of many distinct elements, including physical barriers, patrol routes, lighting, and the deployment of border patrol personnel. President [[Donald Trump]]'s proposal to build [[Mexico–United States barrier|a wall along the border]] was a major feature of his campaign, and he has since attempted to have Congress pay US$18 billion for its cost in the short term. [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democrats]] and members of the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]] who do not support President Trump argue that other measures would be more effective at reducing illegal immigration than building a wall, including border surveillance and an increase in the number of customs agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/politics/trump-border-wall-funding-surveillance.html |title=To Pay for Wall, Trump Would Cut Proven Border Security Measures |last=Nixon |first=Ron |date=2018 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-02-04 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to India's barrier with Bangladesh and the proposed wall between America and Mexico, Iran has constructed a [[Iran–Pakistan border|wall on its frontier with Pakistan]]. The wall aims to reduce unauthorised border crossings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Hungary-Serbia border barrier.jpg|thumb|250px|Hungarian border barrier with Serbia]]

Border security has, over the first two decades of the century, also become a major concern in the  [[Schengen Area]] ({{lang-de|Schengen-Raum}}; {{lang-fr|l'Espace Schengen}}), specifically as a result of the [[European migrant crisis]]. The [[Melilla border fence|walls at Melilla]] and [[Ceuta border fence|at Ceuta]] ({{lang-es|Los Muros de Melilla y Ceuta}}; {{lang-fr|Les Barrières de Melilla et de Ceuta}}) on Spain’s border with Morocco are a part of the trend towards increasing border security in response to an unprecedented rise in both refugees and economic migrants from countries in Sub Saharan Africa. Similar, though less drastic, measures have been taken on the Schengen area’s borders with Turkey in response to the refugee crisis created in Syria by [[terrorism|terrorist organisations]] such as [[Daesh]] ({{lang-ar|داعش}}) and the [[Syrian Free Army]] ({{lang-ar|الجيش السوري الحر|al-Jaysh as-Sūrī al-Ḥurr}}). The creation of European Union’s collective border security organisation, [[Border control#Frontex|Frontex]], is another aspect of the bloc’s growing focus on border security. Within the Schengen Area, border security has become an especially prominent priority for the Hungarian government under right-wing [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/danger-hungary-verge-full-blown-autocracy-viktor-orban-vengeance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-hungary-commentary/commentary-orban-and-the-autocratic-spring-idUSKBN1HK2F2]&lt;/ref&gt; Viktor Orbán. Hungary completed the construction of a 175 kilometre wall between with [[Serbia]] in September 2015 and on the border with Croatia in October 2015 to stop unauthorised border crossings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungary to fence off border with Serbia to stop migrants |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/17/us-hungary-immigration-idUSKBN0OX17I20150617 |date=2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, Hungarian government announced construction of reinforcements of the barrier, which it described as "temporary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-defence/news/reinforcement-of-temporary-security-barrier-starts-on-the-hungarian-serbian-border|title=Reinforcement of temporary border barrier starts on the Hungarian–Serbian border}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, nearly 1,300 migrants were "stuck" on the Serbian side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36753648 Migrant crisis: UN criticises Hungary over border controls].

Another example of border security is the [[Barrier against tunnels along the Israel-Gaza Strip border|Israeli anti-tunnel barrier]] along its border with the [[Gaza Strip]] ({{lang-ar|قطاع غزة}}), a part of the [[State of Palestine]] under the control of [[Hamas]] (a militant group backed by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], a [[Qatar–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict|Qatari-sponsored]] [[Islamism|fundamentalist]] organisation). In order to curtail Hamas’s ability to build tunnels into Israeli-controlled territory, Israel has built a [[slurry wall]]. Similarly, [[Saudi Arabia]] has begun construction of a border barrier or fence between its territory and [[Yemen]] to prevent the unauthorized movement of people and goods. The difference between the countries' economic situations means that many Yemenis head to Saudi Arabia to find work. Saudi Arabia does not have a barrier with its other neighbors in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], whose economies are more similar. In 2006 Saudi Arabia proposed constructing a security fence along the entire length of its 900 kilometre long desert border with Iraq in a multimillion-dollar project to secure the Kingdom's borders in order to improve internal security, control illegal immigration, and bolster its defences against external threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-2126835,00.html/ |title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |website=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2009 it was reported that Saudis will pay $3.5 billion for a security fence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoprod.co.il/main/siteNew/index.php?langId=1&amp;mod=article&amp;action=article&amp;Admin=qwas&amp;stId=275 ]{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined wall and ditch will be 600 miles long and include five layers of fencing, watch towers, [[night-vision]] cameras, and radar cameras and manned by 30,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spencer |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/11344116/Revealed-Saudi-Arabias-Great-Wall-to-keep-out-Isil.html |title=Revealed: Saudi Arabia's 'Great Wall' to keep out Isil |publisher=Telegraph |date=2015-01-14 |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in Europe, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] began erecting a fence on its border with Greece in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Yannis Behrakis.

In 2003, [[Botswana]] began building a 480 kilometre long [[electric fence]] along its border with [[Zimbabwe]]. The official reason for the fence is to stop the spread of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] among livestock. Zimbabweans argue that the height of the fence is clearly intended to keep out people. Botswana has responded that the fence is designed to keep out cattle, and to ensure that entrants have their shoes disinfected at legal border crossings. Botswana also argued that the government continues to encourage legal movement into the country. Zimbabwe was unconvinced, and the barrier remains a source of tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|periodical=BBC News|title=Zimbabwe crisis spills over border|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3582459.stm|last=Phillips|first=Barnaby|date=2004-03-30 | accessdate=January 4, 2010|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Finnish border zone sign on a tree.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Border zone marked on a tree on the [[Finland–Russia border]]: no entry.]]

Border zones are areas near [[border]]s that have special restrictions on movement. Governments may forbid unauthorised entry to or exit from border zones and restrict property ownership in the area. The zones function as [[buffer zone]]s specifically monitored by [[border guard|border patrols]] in order to prevent illegal entry or exit. Restricting entry aids in pinpointing illegal intruders, since by ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' ("no penalty without a law"), any person could be present in the area near the border, and illegal intruders, such as illegal immigrants, smugglers or spies could blend in. However, if all unauthorised presence is forbidden, their mere presence of intruders allows the authorities to arrest them. Border zones between hostile states can be heavily militarised, with [[minefield]]s, barbed wire and [[watchtower]]s. Some border zones are designed to prevent illegal immigration or emigration, and do not have many restrictions but may operate checkpoints to check immigration status. In most places, a [[border vista]] is usually included and/or required. In some nations, movement inside a border zone without a licence is an offence and will result in arrest. No probable cause is required as mere presence inside the zone is an offence, if it is intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.minilex.fi/a/valtionrajarikos-koskee-suomen-rajaa |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609210740/http://www.minilex.fi/a/valtionrajarikos-koskee-suomen-rajaa |archivedate=2016-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with a licence to enter, photography, making fires, and carrying of firearms and hunting are prohibited.

Examples of international border zones are the [[Border Security Zone of Russia]] and the Finnish border zone on the [[Finnish–Russian border]]. There are also intra-country zones such as the [[Cactus Curtain]] surrounding the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in [[Cuba]], the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean Demilitarised Zone]] along the [[North Korea]]-[[South Korea]] demarcation line and the [[Frontier Closed Area]] in [[Hong Kong]], [[China]]. Important historical examples are the [[Wire of Death]] ({{lang-nl|Dodendraad}}; {{lang-de|Grenzhochspannungshindernis}}) set up by [[German Empire|Germany]] to control the [[Belgium–Netherlands border]] and the [[Iron Curtain]] ({{lang-ru|Железный занавес}}), a set of border zones maintained by the [[Soviet Union]] and its satellite states along their borders with Western states. One of the most militarised parts was the [[Inner German border#Restricted zone|restricted zone of the inner German border]]. While initially and officially the zone was for border security, eventually it was engineered to prevent escape from the Soviet sphere into the West. Ultimately, the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]] ({{lang-ru|Восточный блок}}) governments resorted to using lethal countermeasures against those trying to cross the border, such as mined fences and orders to shoot anyone trying to cross into the West. The restrictions on building and habitation made the area a "green corridor", today established as the [[European Green Belt]] ({{lang-de|Das Grüne Band Europa}}; {{lang-fr|La Ceinture verte de l’Europe}}).

In the area stretching inwards from its [[Border control#Internal border controls|internal border]] with the [[Mainland China|mainland]], Hong Kong maintains a [[Frontier Closed Area]] ({{zh|t=邊境禁區}}) [[Exclusion zone|out of bounds]] to those without special authorisation. The area was established in the 1950s when Hong Kong under British occupation as a consequence of the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] ({{lang-zh|南京條約}}) during the [[Opium Wars]], prior to its [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|return to China]] in 1997. The purposes of the area were to prevent illegal immigration and smuggling; smuggling had become prevalent as a consequence of the Korean war. Today, under the [[one country, two systems]] policy, the area continues to be used to curtail unauthorised migration to Hong Kong and the smuggling of goods in either direction.

As a result of the partition of the Korean peninsula by America and the Soviet Union after World War II, and exacerbated by the subsequent [[Korean war]], there is a [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarised Zone]] ([[Korean Language|Korean]] [[Hangul|Chosŏn'gŭl/Hangul]]: 한반도 비무장 지대; [[Hanja]]: 韓半島非武裝地帶) spanning the [[de facto]] border between [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]. The Demilitarised Zone follows the effective boundaries as of the end of the Korean War in 1953. Similarly to the Frontier Closed Area in Hong Kong, this zone and the defence apparatus that exists on both sides of the border serve to curtail unauthorised passage between the two sides. In South Korea, there is an additional fenced-off area between the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone#Civilian Control Line|Civilian Control Line]] and the start of the Demilitarised Zone, further strengthening border security

===Immigration policy===
Immigration policy is the aspect of border control concerning the transit of people into a country, especially those that intend to stay and work in the country. Often, racial or religious bias are tied to immigration policy. [[Tax]]ation, [[tariff]] and [[trade]] rules set out what goods immigrants may bring with them, and what services they may perform while temporarily in the country. [[Investment policy]] sometimes permits wealthy immigrants to invest in businesses in exchange for favourable treatment and eventual naturalisation. [[Agricultural policy]] may make exemptions for migrant farm workers, who typically enter a country only for the harvest season and then return home to a country or region in the [[Global South]] (such as [[Mexico]] or [[Jamaica]] from where America and Canada, respectively, often import temporary agricultural labour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nardep.info/uploads/Brief_FarmWorker.pdf |title=Immigration and Farm Labor in the U.S |publisher=National Agriculture and Rural Development Policy Center |date=May 4, 2013 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of immigration policy is the treatment of [[refugee]]s, more or less helpless or stateless people who throw themselves on the mercy of the state they try to enter, seeking refuge from actual or purported poor treatment in their country of origin. Asylum is sometimes granted to those who face persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.

====Special areas in Europe====
[[Immigration]] policies in special areas in Europe can range from severely limiting migration, as in Greece's [[Mount Athos]] ({{lang-el|Άθως}}), to allowing most types of migration, such as the [[free migration]]{{efn|Uniquely, the archipelago is an [[Visa policy of Svalbard|entirely visa-free zone]] under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/07/200841012024779644.html Immigrants warmly welcomed], [[Al Jazeera]], 4 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which recognises the sovereignty of [[Norway]] over the [[Arctic]] archipelago of [[Svalbard]] but subjects it to certain stipulations and consequently not all Norwegian law applies, including border controls. The treaty regulates the [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarisation]] of the archipelago. The signatories were given equal rights to engage in commercial activities (mainly [[coal mining]]) on the islands. {{asof|2012}}, Norway and [[Russia]] are making use of this right.}} policy in force in [[Svalbard]]. Similar policies are in force for Iran's [[Kish Island|Kish]] ({{lang-fa|کیش}}) and [[Qeshm Island|Qeshm]] ({{lang-fa|قشم}}, {{IPA-fa|ɢeʃm}}) islands, and for Iraqi Kurdistan ({{lang-ku|هه‌رێمی کوردستان|Herêmî Kurdistan}}).

====Diaspora communities====
[[image:OCI JK.jpg|thumb|140px|An OCI booklet exempting its bearer from usual immigration controls in India.]] [[Image:Karta Polaka wzór.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''Karta Polaka'' - specimen document]]

Certain countries adopt immigration policies designed to be favourable towards members of diaspora communities with a connection to the country. For example, the Indian government confers Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) status on foreign citizen of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian origin]] to live and work indefinitely in India. OCI status was introduced in response to demands for [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] by the Indian diaspora, particularly in countries with large populations of Indian origin. It was introduced by ''The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005'' in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI); Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926231018/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 |date=2009-09-26 }}, [http://www.moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&amp;id=m3&amp;idp=35&amp;mainid=23 Diaspora Services: Overseas Citizenship of India Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504131659/http://moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&amp;id=m3&amp;idp=35&amp;mainid=23 |date=2012-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[ASEAN]] region, a large portion of the Singaporean, Malaysian, and Bruneian population hold OCI status. Large OCI communities also exist in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as in many African nations (particularly South Africa, Madagascar, and members of the [[East African Community]]). OCI status exempts holders from immigration controls generally imposed upon others of the same nationality. There was also another called called the [[PIO]] card, but this and the OCI have merged.

Similarly, Poland issues the [[Karta Polaka]] to citizens of certain north-east European countries with Polish ancestry.

A British Ancestry visa is a document issued by the [[United Kingdom]] to [[Commonwealth citizen]]s with a grandparent born in the United Kingdom, [[Channel Islands]] or [[Isle of Man]] who wish to work in the United Kingdom. Similar to OCI status, it exempts members of the country’s diaspora from usual immigration controls. It is used mainly by young Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians and South Africans of [[British diaspora|British descent]] coming to UK to work and as a base to explore Europe.&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/21/nvisa121.xml |title=Britain may abolish ancestry visa |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Philip |last=Johnston |date=21 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326202004/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2008%2F02%2F21%2Fnvisa121.xml |archivedate=March 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations recognise a [[right of return]] for people with ancestry in that country. A notable example of this is the right of [[Sephardi Jews]] to acquire Spanish nationality by virtue of their community’s Spanish origins. Similar exemptions to immigration controls exist for people of Armenian origin seeking to acquire Armenian citizenship. Ghana, similarly, grants an indefinite right to stay in Ghana to members of the [[African diaspora]] regardless of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/ghana-a-place-for-african-americans-to-resettle.html |title=Ghana, a place for African Americans to resettle |last=Dovi |first=Efam |date=11 May 2015 |website=The Africa Report|publisher= |access-date=15 August 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International zones===
An international zone is a type of [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] area not fully subject to any country’s border control policies. The term most commonly refer to the areas of [[international airports]] after exit border controls or before entry border controls. These areas often contain duty-free shopping, but they are not fully extraterritorial. In areas of conflict there may be international zones called green zones that form protective enclaves to keep diplomats safe. Countries in conflict may also have international zones separating each other.

====Examples====
&lt;!--- Please do not add any more examples of international zones unless they are relevant to the topic of border control and help illustrate how border controls function in an international zone. Remember - ultimately, this article is about BORDER CONTROL. ---&gt;
* The international zone in an [[international airport]] is the area where arriving international passengers have not formally entered the country by clearing arrival customs and immigration controls, and departing passengers have formally exited the country by clearing exit immigration control. Transit passengers can take connecting international flights in the international zone without clearing customs and immigration controls, and in most cases do not require a [[travel visa|visa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Former Colleague Aided U.S. In Trapping Ex-C.I.A.

A major exception is the United States, where all passengers arriving on international flights are subject to customs and immigration inspections. Hence, transiting at a U.S. airport require at least a [[C-1 visa|C-1 transit visa]], or a [[Electronic System for Travel Authorization|travel authorisation]] for [[Visa Waiver Program]] (VWP) travellers. A common feature of the international zone is [[duty-free]] shopping for departing and transit passengers. International zones in airports are fully under the jurisdiction of the country where they are located and local laws apply. Persons caught committing an unlawful act (e.g. possession of contraband such as illegal drugs) in the international zone are liable for prosecution.

* [[Dejima]] ({{lang-ja|出島}}) was a port near the Japanese city of Nagasaki ({{lang-ja|長崎市}}) that was ceded to Dutch administration between 1641 and 1854. During the [[Edo period]], it was Japan’s only point of interaction with the outside world. It was a small island, 120 metres by 75 metres,&lt;ref&gt;Ken Vos - The article "Dejima als venster en doorgeefluik" in the catalogue (Brussels, 5 October 1989 - 16 December 1989) of the exhibition Europalia 1989 : "Oranda : De Nederlanden in Japan (1600-1868)&lt;/ref&gt; linked to the mainland by a small bridge, guarded on both sides, and with a gate on the Dutch side. It contained houses for about twenty Dutchmen, warehouses, and accommodation for Japanese officials. For two hundred years, foreign merchants were generally not allowed to cross from Dejima to Nagasaki.  The Japanese were likewise banned from entering Dejima, except interpreters, cooks, carpenters, clerks and 'Women of Pleasure' from the Maruyama teahouses. From the 18th century, there were some exceptions to this rule, especially following the policy of promoting European practical sciences implemented by [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] ({{lang-ja|徳川 吉宗}}). A limited number of Japanese were allowed to stay for longer periods, but they had to report regularly to the Japanese guard post. Once a year the Europeans were allowed to attend the festivities at the Suwa-Shrine under escort. Sometimes physicians such as [[Engelbert Kaempfer]], [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], and [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] were called to high-ranking Japanese patients with the permission of the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''In the context of Commodore Perry's "opening" of Japan in 1853, American naval expedition planners incorporated reference material written by men whose published accounts of Japan were based on first-hand experience.

* The [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] established "international zones" or "control zones" at both ends of the [[Channel Tunnel]] ({{lang-fr|Le tunnel sous la Manche}}), which crosses underneath the [[English Channel]]. British authorities exercise authority within the control zone on the French side, and French authorities exercise authority within the control zone on the UK side. Violations in the control zone are treated as if they occurred within the territory of the adjoining state within that zone, and extradition is not required to remove a violator to the operating state for prosecution. Officers of the adjoining state may carry firearms within the control zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1993/jul/05/channel-tunnel-international|title=Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) Order 1993 (Hansard, 5 July 1993)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific requirements==

The degree of strictness of border controls varies across countries and borders. In some countries, controls may be targeted at the traveller's religion, ethnicity, nationality, or other countries that have been visited. Others may need to be certain the traveller has paid the appropriate fees for their [[visa (document)|visas]] and has future travel planned out of the country. Yet others may concentrate on the contents of the traveler's baggage, and imported goods to ensure nothing is being carried that might bring a [[biosecurity]] risk into the country.

===Border vistas===
{{further|International Boundary Commission}}
[[File:Border vista.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The vista along the [[Canada–United States border]], as seen from a [[Rest area|wayside]] on the [[Alaska Highway]].]]
A border vista or boundary vista is a defined cleared space between two areas of foliage located at an international border intended to provide a clear demarcation line between the two areas. Border vistas are most commonly found along undefended international boundary lines, where border security is not as much of a necessity and a built barrier is undesired, and are a treaty requirement for certain borders. 

The best-known border vista is a six-metre cleared space around unguarded portions of the [[Canada–United States border]] ({{lang-fr|Frontière canado-américaine}}; {{lang-es|Frontera entre Canadá y Estados Unidos}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stacy Schiff|Schiff, Stacy]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/opinion/22schiff.html "Politics Starts at the Border"], ''The New York Times''. 22 July 2007. Accessed 3 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar clearings along the border line are provided for by many international treaties. For example, the 2006 border management treaty [[China–Russia border|between Russia and China]] provides for a 15-metre wide cleared strip along the two nations' border.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosgranitsa.ru/ru/node/3140 Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the management of the Russia-China international border] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709062825/http://www.rosgranitsa.ru/ru/node/3140 |date=2015-07-09 }}, rosgranitsa.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel documents===
{{see also|Travel document|Passport}}

Different countries impose varying travel document regulations and requirements as part of their border control policies and these may vary based on the traveller's mode of transport. For instance, whilst America does not subject passengers departing by land or most boats to any border control, it does require that passengers departing by air hold a valid passport (or certain specific passport-replacing documents). Even though travellers might not require a passport to enter a certain country, they ''will'' require a valid passport booklet (booklet only, U.S. Passport Card not accepted) to depart the United States in order to satisfy the U.S. immigration authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iata.org/publications/timatic/Documents/using_timatic_v3.pdf|title=Page 7 of IATA document accessed 5 December 2015 at|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exemptions to this requirement to hold a valid passport include:

*U.S. Permanent Resident/Resident Alien Card (Form I-551);
*U.S. Military ID Cards when traveling on official orders;
*U.S. Merchant Mariner Card;
*[[NEXUS (frequent traveler program)|NEXUS Card]];
*U.S. Travel Document:
**Refugee Travel Document (Form I-571); or
**Permit to Re-Enter (Form I-327)
*Emergency Travel Document (e.g. Consular Letter) issued by a Foreign Embassy or Consulate specifically for the purpose of travel to the bearer's home country.
*Nationals of Mexico holding one of the following documents:
**(expired) "Matricula Consular"; or
**Birth Certificate with consular registration; or
**Certificate of Nationality issued by a Mexican consulate abroad; or
**Certificate of Military Duty (''Cartilla Militar''); or
**Voter's Certificate (''Credencial IFE'' or ''Credencial para Votar'').

Canada requires any Canadian Permanent Residents entering the country by air to use their [[Canada permanent resident card|Permanent Resident Card]] ({{lang-fr|Carte de résident permanent}}) or a special document authorising their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1050&amp;top=16|title=I am a permanent resident of Canada.

[[File:FRTD.jpg|thumb|90px|Facilitated Rail Transit Document issued in Saint Petersburg for travel to Kaliningrad]]

Other countries, including most countries in Western Europe and China, permit (or in China's case [[Home Return Permit|require]]) citizens to utilise [[national identity cards]] to clear immigration when travelling between adjacent jurisdictions. As a consequence of awkward border situations created by the fall of the Soviet Union, certain former members of the USSR and their neighbours require few or no travel documents for travellers transiting across international boundaries between two points in a single country. For instance, Russia permits vehicles to transit across the [[Saatse Boot]] ({{lang-et|Saatse saabas}}; {{lang-ru|Саатсеский сапог}}) between the Estonian villages of [[Lutepää]] and [[Sesniki]] without any border control provided that they do not stop. Similar provisions are made for the issuance of Facilitated Rail Transit Documents by Schengen Area members ({{lang-de|Schengen-Staaten}}; {{lang-fr|Les États Schengen}}) for travel between Kaliningrad and the Russian mainland.

====Indian Identity Certificate====
The Indian government issues Identity Certificates to members of the large Tibetan exile community. Identity Certificates are generally issued upon request of the Dalai Lama’s Tibetan government in exile based in Dharamsala in northern India. This document is accepted as per most countries border control policies in lieu of a passport, although it is not a machine readable document. When issued to a Tibetan residing in India, it is invariably endorsed as being valid for return to India and therefore exempts the holder from requiring a visa to clear Indian border controls upon re-entry.

====Non-citizen residents====
[[File:United States Travel Document Cover Page.jpg|thumb|120px|The American re-entry permit is a travel document for permanent residents issued on request.]] [[File:2017-us-green-card-specimen.png|thumb|120px|American Green Card issued to all permanent residents.]] [[File:Japan Re-entry Permit 2012.png|thumb|left|120px|Japan re-entry permit issued to Japanese North Koreans and other stateless permanent residents of Japan]]

Some countries issue travel documents to permanent residents (i.e. foreign citizens permitted to reside there indefinitely) or other non-citizens, usually for re-entry but also occasionally valid for international travel. 

The American [[U.S. Re-entry Permit|re-entry permit]] is an example of such a document. Valid for international travel, it is issued to lawful permanent residents temporarily expatriating overseas. Unlike the [[Permanent residence (United States)|”Green Card”]] ({{lang-es|Tarjeta verde}}) issued to all permanent residents, this document is not mandatory. The American “Green Card”, on its own or in conjunction with a passport, is valid for international travel albeit not to the same extent as the re-entry permit. Both documents can be utilised to clear American border controls regardless of the bearers nationality, thus resulting in America not requiring permanent residents to hold a passport from their home country in order to remain lawfully present or to lawfully enter.

Singapore issues national identity cards to permanent residents in the same manner as it does to citizens, but additionally requires any permanent resident travelling abroad to hold a paper re-entry permit and a passport or other travel document from their home country. Singapore permanent residents who are stateless are issued booklet-form [[Singapore Certificate of Identity|Certificates of Identity]] instead of re-entry permits, and may use these in lieu of a passport.

Indonesia issues the [[Paspor Orang Asing]] to its stateless permanent residents, and this document functions similarly to a Singaporean Certificate of Identity.

Non-citizens [[Non-citizen (Latvia)|in Latvia]] and [[Estonian nationality law|in Estonia]] are individuals, primarily of Russian or Ukrainian ethnicity, who are not citizens of Latvia or Estonia but whose families have resided in the area since the Soviet era, and thus have the right to a non-citizen passport issued by the Latvian government as well as other specific rights. Approximately two thirds of them are [[Russians in Latvia|ethnic Russians]], followed by ethnic Belarussians, ethnic Ukrainians, ethnic Poles and ethnic Lithuanians.&lt;ref name="pmlp.gov.lv"&gt;[http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/lv/assets/documents/statistika/01.01.2015/ISVN_Latvija_pec_TTB_VPD.pdf Population of Latvia by ethnicity and nationality; Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs] 2015{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/On_the_Status_of_those_Former_U.S.S.R._Citizens.doc|title=Section 1 and Section 8, Law "On the Status of those Former U.S.S.R.

Hong Kong and Macau issue permanent resident cards to all permanent residents including those without Chinese citizenship. They also issue the [[Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes]] ({{zh|t=香港特別行政區簽證身份書}}) and [[Macao Special Administrative Region Travel Permit|Macau Travel Permit]]({{lang-pt|Título de Viagem da Região Administrativa Especial de Macau}}; {{lang-zh|澳門特別行政區旅行證}}), respectively, to stateless permanent residents and to Chinese citizens temporarily residing in the region holding neither permanent residence of Hong Kong or Macau nor residence status in the mainland. 

Similarly, [[Chōsen-seki|Japanese North Koreans]] ({{lang-ja|朝鮮籍|chōsen-seki}}) are issued a Japan Re-entry Permit ({{lang-ja|再入国許可書}}) for international travel.

Certain jurisdictions permit the use of national identity cards to clear border controls. For instance, when travelling between India and Nepal or Bhutan, Indian citizens may utilise national voter ID cards, ration cards, or [[Aadhar|national identity cards]]. Indian citizens may also obtain identity slips at the Indian consulate in Phuentsholing if they intend to proceed beyond city limits as Phuentsholing, the financial capital of Bhutan, is de facto within India’s visa and customs area. When travelling to India, citizens of Nepal and Bhutan can utilise similar documents. Children may use birth certificates as proof of identity. 

In North America, American citizens may travel using [[United States Passport Card|passport cards]], a form of voluntary identity card issued to American citizens. Children holding American or Canadian citizenship may travel to and from Canada using birth certificates under certain circumstances. In South America, many [[Mercosur]] countries reciprocally permit travel using identity cards.

In western Europe, travel using identity cards is relatively common for citizens of the European Economic Area and adjacent territories. This includes travel to and from Turkey for certain citizens of other countries in western Europe. Within the Schengen Area, there are limited border controls in place and national identity cards may be used to clear them.

====Chinese Travel Document====
[[File:TD PRC.jpg|thumb|120px|Chinese Travel Document]]
The Chinese Government requires certain people to enter the mainland using a [[Chinese Travel Document]] ({{lang-zh|中华旅行证}}). Some cases include:
* The Travel Document is issued to Chinese nationals in situations when it is "inconvenient", "unnecessary", or not permitted to issue a [[People's Republic of China passport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-06/01/content_3133.htm What's the difference between a Travel Document and a Passport?] {{zh icon}} Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chinese nationals residing in [[Mainland China]] who lost their passport while traveling abroad may apply for this document as an emergency passport for returning to China.
* Chinese nationals who are permanent residents of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] intending to enter [[Mainland China]] directly from other countries without a [[Home Return Permit]] ({{lang-zh|港澳居民来往内地通行证}}).
* Residents of the Taiwan area{{efn|name=ROC}} intending to enter [[Mainland China]] or [[Hong Kong]] directly from other countries, who are Chinese Nationals according to Chinese law. Travelling to Hong Kong, however, requires a separate application for a visa-like entry permit.
* Chinese nationals born abroad who acquire Chinese nationality at birth in accordance with the [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]] through ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. The Chinese Travel Document is issued as a Chinese identification and travel document.
* Chinese nationals born in China who do not have a Hukou in China and who have exited China using an exit permit. This could include a person who holds a non Chinese passport.

====Enhanced Driving Licence====
An [[Enhanced Drivers License|Enhanced Driving Licence]] is a document issued by provincial and state authorities in Canada and America that enables its bearer to clear border controls along the border between the two countries. It is not valid for air travel and does not permit its holder to clear border controls at airports. It also serves as a valid driving licence. Certain provinces and states may issue similar enhanced versions of regional identity cards issued to individuals who do not drive.

====Quilantan entry====
A ‘Quilantan’ or ‘Wave Through’ Entry is a phenomenon in American border control law authorising a form of non-standard but legal entry without any inspection of travel documents. It occurs when the border security personnel present at a border crossing choose to summarily admit some number of persons without performing a standard interview or document examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Matter of Graciela QUILANTAN, Respondent |reporter=A095 426 631 |court=Board of Immigration Appeals |date=2010-07-28 |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/07/25/3688.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically this can occur when an official border crossing is busy and an immigration officer waves a car through without first checking all passengers for their travel documents. If an individual can prove that they were waved into the United States in this manner, then they are considered to have entered with inspection despite not having answered any questions or received a passport [[Passport stamp|entry stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Matter of Quilantan helps immigrant |journal=Lexis/Nexis |date=2012-01-17 |last=Kowalski |first=Daniel M. |url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/immigration/b/insidenews/archive/2012/01/17/matter-of-quilantan-helps-immigrant.aspx?Redirected=true |accessdate=2017-12-07 |quote=Because she wasn't trying to sneak across and hadn't been questioned by the immigration officer who waved them into Texas, the court found she had been "inspected and admitted" legally. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition of legal entry does not apply to situations where foreigners entered the United States but have not crossed at a legal, manned border station. Thus it does not provide a path to legal residency for those who have entered into the United State by crossing accidental gaps in the borders around geological formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Matter of Quilantan helps immigrant |journal=Lexis/Nexis |date=2012-01-17 |last=Kowalski |first=Daniel M. |url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/immigration/b/insidenews/archive/2012/01/17/matter-of-quilantan-helps-immigrant.aspx?Redirected=true |accessdate=2017-12-07 |quote=The case doesn't apply to millions of undocumented immigrants who crossed rivers, mountains and deserts, evading U.S. immigration officials. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Border areas====
[[File:Border Crossing Card.jpg|thumb|right|The front of the updated version of the American Border Crossing Card issued to Mexican nationals]]
In certain cases, countries adopt border control policies imposing reduced border controls for frequent travellers intending to remain within a [[border area]]. For example, the relaxed border controls maintained by Bhutan for those not proceeding past Phuentsholing and certain other border cities enable travellers to enter without going through any document check whatsoever. The American [[Border Crossing Card]] ({{lang-es|Tarjeta de cruce fronterizo}}) issued to Mexican nationals enables Mexicans to enter border areas without a passport.{{efn|As a standalone document, the BCC allows Mexican citizens to visit border areas in America when entering by land or sea directly from Mexico for less than 72 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mx.usembassy.gov/visas/domestic-employees/frequently-asked-questions/?_ga=1.54366443.213467364.1464033918 Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; The document also functions as a full B1/B2 visa when presented with a valid Mexican passport.&lt;ref name="BCC1"&gt;[https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1635/~/border-crossing-card---who-can-use-it%3F Border Crossing Card - Who can use it?]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Both America and Bhutan maintain [[Border control#Internal borders|interior checkposts]] to enforce compliance.

Similarly, Schengen states which share an external land border with a non-EU member state are authorised by virtue of the EU Regulation 1931/2006 to conclude or maintain bilateral agreements with neighbouring third countries for the purpose of implementing a [[local border traffic]] ({{lang-de|kleiner Grenzverkehr}}; {{lang-fr|Circulation transfrontalier locale}}) regime.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigendum to Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R1931R%2801%29:EN:NOT OJ L 29, 3 February 2007, p. 3]).&lt;/ref&gt; Such agreements define a [[border area]] on either side of the border, and provide for the issuance of local border traffic permits to residents of the border area. Permits may be used to cross the EU external border within the border area, are not stamped on crossing the border and must display the holder's name and photograph, as well as a statement that its holder is not authorised to move outside the border area and that any abuse shall be subject to penalties.

===Agricultural restrictions===

In certain countries, border control focuses extensively on curtailing and regulating the import of foreign agricultural products. Australian border controls, for example, restrict virtually all food products, certain wooden products and other similar items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agriculture.gov.au/travelling/arriving-in-australia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newzealand.embassy.gov.au/wltn/customsfaq.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/prohibited-and-restricted]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions exist in Canada, America and New Zealand.

===Drugs===
[[File:SingaporeEmbarkationCard.png|thumb|160px|Singapore arrival card warning visitors about the [[Capital punishment for drug trafficking|death penalty for drug trafficking]].]]
Border controls in many countries in the Greater India region prioritise mitigating trade in narcotics. For instance, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia impose mandatory death sentences on individuals caught smuggling restricted substances across their borders. For example, Muhammad Ridzuan Ali was executed in Singapore on 19 May 2017 for drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singaporean drug trafficker executed at Changi Prison for heroin offence|url=http://str.sg/4u3w|accessdate=21 August 2018|work=The Straits Times|date=19 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; India and Malaysia are focusing resources on eliminating drug smuggling from Myanmar and Thailand respectively. The issue stems largely from the high output of dangerous and illegal drugs in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] ({{lang-th|สามเหลี่ยมทองคำ}}; {{lang-hi|स्वर्ण त्रिभुज}}; {{lang-km|តំបន់ត្រីកោណមាស}}; {{lang-lo|ສາມຫຼ່ຽມຄຳ}}; {{lang-zh|金三角}}) as well as in regions further west such as Afghanistan.

A similar problem exists east of the pacific, and has resulted in countries such as Mexico and America tightening border control in response to the northward flow of illegal substances from regions such as Colombia. The [[Mexican Drug War]] ({{Lang-es|guerra contra el narcotráfico en México}}) and similar cartel activity in neighbouring areas has exacerbated the problem.

===Visas===
[[File:Indian Tourist Visa 2016 stamped.jpg|150px|thumb|Example of a tourist visa placed directly inside the travel document of a stateless individual.]] [[File:Singapore visa issued to stateless person.jpg|thumb|135px|left|Multiple entry visa issued to a [[statelessness|stateless]] person, whose lack of nationality is indicated with the code XXA]] [[File:Malaysia ENTRI.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sample of printed out eNTRI slip for Indian and mainland Chinese citizens to clear Malaysian border controls without a visa.]]
[[File:Thai Visa on Arrival.jpg|105px|thumb|left|Visa issued on arrival in Thailand]]

Most countries impose visa requirements on foreign nationals, and depending on the country's border control strategy these can be liberal or restrictive. 

Many countries in the Greater India region have liberalised their visa controls in recent years to encourage transnational business and tourism. For example, [[Visa policy of India|India]], [[Visa policy of Myanmar|Myanmar]], and [[Visa policy of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] have introduced electronic visas to make border control less of a bureaucratic hurdle for business travellers and tourists. [[Visa policy of Malaysia|Malaysia]] has introduced similar eVisa facilities, and has also introduced the eNTRI programme to expedite clearance for Indian citizens and Chinese citizens from the mainland. [[Visa policy of Thailand|Thailand regularly issues]] visas on arrival to many non-exempt visitors at major ports of entry in order to encourage tourism. Indonesia, in recent years, has progressively liberalised [[Visa policy of Indonesia|its visa regime]], no longer requiring visas or on-arrival visas from most nationals, while [[Visa policy of Singapore|Singapore]] has signed visa waiver agreements with many countries in recent years and has introduced electronic visa facilities for Indians, Eastern Europeans, and mainland Chinese. This trend towards visa liberalisation in the Greater India region is part of the broader phenomenon of [[globalisation]] and has been linked to heightened economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/south-east-asia-can-benefit-greatly-from-globalisation-if-countries-work-together-ong|title=Asia can benefit greatly from globalisation if countries work together: Ong Ye Kung|date=4 June 2017|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain countries, predominantly but not exclusively in western Europe and the Americas, issue [[working holiday visa]]s for younger visitors to supplement their travel funds by working minor jobs. These are especially common in members of the European Union such as Austria, and elsewhere in western Europe such as Switzerland and Ukraine.

Saudi Arabia issues a [[Visa policy of Saudi Arabia#Hajj visas|special category visa]] for people on religious pilgrimage. Similar policies are in force in other countries with significant religious sites.

Certain jurisdictions impose special visa requirements on [[journalism|journalists]] in order to curtail the freedom of foreign reporters and news organisations to report on controversial topics. Countries that impose such visas include [[Cuba]], [[Visa policy of China|China]], North Korea, Saudi Arabia, [[Visa policy of the United States#I visa|America]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

In the Philippines, in addition to American visas, nationals of India and China can use several alternative visas to clear border controls. Nationals of China from the mainland travelling as tourists and holding a valid visa issued by Australia, Canada, Japan, America, or a Schengen Area state may enter and stay without a visa for up to 7 days. Nationals of India holding a valid tourist, business or resident visa issued by Australia, Canada, [[Japan]], Singapore, United Kingdom, America, or a Schengen Area state may enter and stay without a visa for up to 14 days. They may enter from any port of entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/article/lifestyle/travel-tourism/now-indians-can-travel-visa-free-to-the-philippines/71394/|title=Business News, India Stock Market, Personal Finance, IPO, Financial News Headlines - The Financial Express|author=|date=|website=www.financialexpress.com|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008203806/http://www.financialexpress.com/article/lifestyle/travel-tourism/now-indians-can-travel-visa-free-to-the-philippines/71394/#|archive-date=2015-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Visa policy of South Korea|South Korea]] lets passengers in transit enter for up to thirty days utilising an American, Australian, Canadian, or Schengen visa.

Bermuda, a part of Britain, has ceased to issue its own visas and instead requires that travellers either clear immigration visa-free in one of the three countries (United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom) to/from which it has direct flights, or hold a visa for one of them.

===Electronic Travel Authorisations===
An Electronic Travel Authorisation or Electronic Travel Authority is a kind of pre-arrival registration, which is not officially classified as a [[Travel visa|visa]], required for foreign travellers to a country who normally do not require a visa under some circumstances. Different from a proper visa which the traveller normally has no recourse if rejected, if an ETA is rejected the traveller can choose to apply for a visa instead. Many countries require individuals who do not require a visa to enter to hold an Electronic Travel Authorisation instead.

==== Sri Lanka ====
{{main|Electronic Travel Authorization (Sri Lanka)}}
Travellers to Sri Lanka must get an Electronic Travel Authorisation ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]]: විද්යුත් සංචාරක අවසර පත්රය; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: மின்னணு சுற்றுலா அங்கீகாரம்) prior to getting a visa on arrival at the entry port, except for a few countries where the ETA is exempted, and for a few countries where a visa must be got in advance. Citizens of India, Pakistan, and other countries in the northwestern part of Asia receive discounted ETAs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/visainfo/fees.jsp#profee]&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Citizens of the following countries in the Arabian peninsula can obtain an Electronic Visa Waiver ({{lang-ar|التنازل عن السفر الالكتروني}}), or EVW, online to enter the United Kingdom:{{efn|A holder of an EVW authorisation can visit and/or study in the UK for up to 6 months without a visa. An EVW is only valid for one entry, and a new EVW must be obtained each time an eligible person wishes to enter the UK to visit and/or study for up to 6 months without a visa. The EVW is valid for visits up to 90 days to Ireland once a holder has cleared immigration in the United Kingdom.}}&lt;ref name="Oman evisa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-electronic-visa-waiver-introduced-for-oman-qatar-and-uae|title=UK electronic visa waiver introduced for Oman, Qatar and UAE - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{flag|Kuwait}}

====Australia====
{{main|Electronic Travel Authority (Australia)}}

Development of the Electronic Travel Authority system commenced in January 1996. It was first implemented in Singapore on a trial basis on 11 September 1996, for holders of Singapore and US passports travelling on Qantas and Singapore Airlines. Implementation of online applications began in June 2001.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet 53 – Australia's Entry System for Visitors|url=http://www.border.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/53entry-system|publisher=Department of Immigration and Border Protection|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy study on an EU Electronic System for travel Authorization (EU ESTA) - Annexes: Introduction of the ETA, eVisitor and eVisa systems|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/docs/pdf/esta_annexes_en.pdf|publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current ETA came into effect on 23 March 2013 replacing older ETAs (subclass 976, 977 and 956) while offering a single authorization for both tourist and business purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for Electronic Travel Authority (subclass 601)|url=http://www.southkorea.embassy.gov.au/seol/FAQ_601.html#Q1|publisher=Australian - Embassy Republic of Korea|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ETA allows the holder to visit Australia for unlimited times, up to 3 months per visit, in a 12-month period for tourism or business purposes. There is no visa application charge but a service charge of AU$20 applies for applications lodged online. At the time of travel to, and entry into, Australia, all holders of an ETA must be free from tuberculosis and must not have any criminal convictions for which the sentence or sentences (whether served or not) total 12 months or more.&lt;ref name=ETA&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Travel Authority (Subclass 601)|url=https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/601-|publisher=Department of Immigration and Border Protection|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hong Kong ====
Indian nationals and Chinese nationals from [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled]] by the Republic of China{{efn|name=ROC}} do not require a visa to enter Hong Kong, but must apply for a pre-arrival registration (PAR) prior to arrival. If not successful, Indian travellers may apply for a visa instead. ROC nationals are eligible only if they were born in Taiwan or entered Hong Kong as an ROC citizen before, otherwise they should instead apply for an entry permit (a de facto visa) to enter Hong Kong using their [[Republic of China passport]] ({{lang-zh|中華民國護照}}). They may alternatively enter Hong Kong using a [[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]] ({{lang-zh|臺灣居民來往大陸通行證}}) issued by mainland Chinese authorities without any additional permit.

====North America====
{{main|Electronic System for Travel Authorization|Electronic Travel Authorization (Canada)}}
East of the Pacific, both America and Canada have introduced electronic travel authorisations. Travellers from visa-free countries entering Canada by air, except [[United States nationality law|American national]]s (including those with and without full citizenship), must obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation ({{lang-fr|Autorisation numérique de voyage}}) prior to arrival but not if arriving by land or sea. Travellers under the American [[Visa Waiver Program]]me ({{lang-es|Programa de Exención de Visa}}) are required to obtain permission through the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation ({{lang-es|Sistema Electrónico de Autorización de Viaje}}) if arriving America by air or cruise but not if entering by land or by ferry, using a passport issued by the Government of Bermuda to a [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]], or if entering as a Canadian citizen.

Travellers from [[Brazil]] normally require a visa to enter Canada, but are eligible to apply for an ETA if they have held a Canadian visa within the 10 years prior to applying, or if they currently hold a valid non-immigrant American visa. Such travellers still may not enter Canada by land or sea without a valid Canadian visa.

===Exit controls===

[[File:Queenston Bridge Canada Passport Bridge.JPG|thumb|130px|Entry stamp at [[Lewiston–Queenston Bridge]], Ontario. Canada only conducts border control and stamps passports upon entry.]]

Whilst most countries implement border controls both at entry and at exit, some jurisdictions do not. For instance, America and Canada do not implement exit controls at land borders and collect exit data on foreign nationals through airlines and through information sharing with neighbouring countries’ entry border controls. These countries consequently don’t issue exit stamps even to travellers who require stamps on entry. At [[Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 4]], there is a mechanism in place for all passengers (not just those residents and pass holders permitted to enter through automated gates) to exit through automated channels, thus not receiving exit stamps. Similarly, Australia and South Korea have eliminated exit stamps even though they continue to implement brief border control checks upon exit for most foreign nationals.

====Exit visas====
Some countries in Europe maintain controversial exit visa systems in addition to regular border controls. For instance, Uzbekistan requires its own citizens to obtain exit visas prior to leaving for countries other than [[Commonwealth of Independent States|fellow CIS]] nations in eastern Europe. Several [[Gulf Cooperation Council|countries in the Arabian peninsula]] require exit visas for foreign workers under the [[Kafala System]] ({{lang-ar|نظام الكفالة|niẓām al-kafāla}} meaning "sponsorship system"). Russia occasionally requires foreigners who overstay to obtain [[Visa policy of Russia#Exit|exit visas]] since one cannot exit Russia without a valid visa. Czechia has a similar policy. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagit.cz/_texty/sb99326.htm Act on the status of aliens in Czech Republic], §20&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a foreign citizen granted a temporary residence permit in Russia needs an exit visa to take a trip abroad (valid for both exit and return). Not all foreign citizens are subject to that requirement. Citizens of Germany, for example, do not require this exit visa.

Certain Asian countries have policies that similarly require certain categories of citizens to seek official authorisation prior to travelling or emigrating. This is usually either as a way to enforce [[conscription|national service]] obligations or to protect migrant workers from travelling to places where they may be abused by employers. Singapore, for instance, operates an Exit Permit scheme in order to enforce the [[National service in Singapore|national service]] obligations of its male citizens and permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Enlistment Act|type= |number= 25|language= |date= 1970|article= 32|articletype= s.|page= |url= http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=DocId%3A%227c7b1aab-8403-4443-b322-0cba08be5d45%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A20161111000000%20TransactionTime%3A20161111000000;rec=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These restrictions vary according to age and status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/Topics/Pages/National-Service-Exit-permit-requirements.aspx|title= National Service: Exit permit requirements|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= |website= ecitizen.gov.sg|access-date= 2018-08-08|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170108045359/http://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/Topics/Pages/National-Service-Exit-permit-requirements.aspx#|archive-date= 2017-01-08|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea and the Taiwan region{{efn|name=ROC}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ris.gov.tw/departure/app/|title=內政部役政署役男線上申請短期出境|website=www.ris.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt; in China have similar policies. India, on the other hand, requires citizens who have not met certain educational requirements (and thus may be targeted by human traffickers or be coerced into [[modern slavery]]) to apply for approval prior to leaving the country and endorses their passports with [[Emigration Act, 1983|”Emigration Check Required”]]. Nepal similarly requires citizens emigrating to the United States on an [[H-1B visa]] to present an exit permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. This document is called a work permit and needs to be presented to immigration to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dol.gov.np/|title=Department of Labour - Government Of Nepal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a bid to increase protection for the large amount of Indian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, and Nepali citizens smuggled through Indian airports to the middle east as underpaid labourers, many Indian airline companies require travellers to obtain an ‘OK to Board’ confirmation sent directly from visa authorities in certain GCC countries directly to the airline and will bar anyone who has not obtained this endorsement from clearing exit immigration.

===Nationality and travel history===
Many nations implement border controls restricting the entry of people of certain nationalities or who have visited certain countries. For instance Georgia refuses entry to holders of passports issued by the Republic of China.&lt;ref name=timatic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.olympicair.com/timatic/webdocsI/countryinfo.html|title=Country information (passport section)|website=[[Timatic]]|publisher=[[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) through [[Olympic Air]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, since April 2017 nationals of Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Iran have been banned from entering the parts of eastern Libya under the control of the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|Tobruk government]] ({{lang-ar|مجلس النواب|Majlis al-Nuwaab}}).&lt;ref name=timatic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/4/11/khalifa-haftar-introduces-a-muslim-ban-in-east-libya|title=Khalifa Haftar introduces a 'Muslim ban' in east Libya|first=Robert|last=Cusack|website=Alaraby.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyanexpress.com/haftar-issues-travel-ban-on-six-muslim-countries-in-eastern-libya/|title=Haftar issues travel ban on six Muslim countries in eastern Libya - Libyan Express - Libya News, Opinion, Analysis and Latest Updates from Libya|date=11 April 2017|website=Libyanexpress.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States does not currently issue new visas to nationals of Iran, North Korea, Libya, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen pursuant to [[Executive Order 13780#Presidential Proclamation 9645|restrictions]] imposed by the [[Trump administration]] ({{lang-es|Administración presidencial de Trump}}).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/us/politics/new-order-bars-almost-all-travel-from-seven-countries.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the American policy, restrictions are conditional and can be lifted if the countries affected meet the required security standards specified by the Trump administration, and [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizens]] of these countries can still enter if they present a passport from a non-designated country. The majority of [[Arab]] countries, as well as Iran and Malaysia, ban Israeli citizens&lt;ref name=timatic/&gt;, however exceptional entry to Malaysia is possible with approval from the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] ({{lang-ms|Kementerian Dalam Negeri}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imi.gov.my/index.php/en/main-services/visa/visa-requirement-by-country|title=Visa requirements by country|publisher=Immigration Department of Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain countries may also restrict entry to those with Israeli stamps or visas in their passports.

[[File:Visa requirements for Taiwanese citizens (6).png|thumb|200px|Map illustrating extra border controls placed on [[National without household registration|passport holders without ID numbers]].]] [[File:ROC National Without Registration Passport Datapage.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Sample ROC passport of nationals with no national ID number.]]

In some cases, border control policies target stateless individuals, or individuals holding nationality statuses without [[right of abode]], including [[National without household registration|individuals with Republic of China (ROC) passports]] ({{lang-zh|無戶籍國民}}) without a national ID, and [[British Subject]]s or [[British Overseas Citizen]]s without [[indefinite leave to remain]] in the United Kingdom. ROC nationals without ID numbers do not, for instance, have access to the American [[Visa Waiver Program]]me, or to visa free access to the Schengen Area or Japan. Other countries, such as India which allows all Chinese nationals to apply for [[Visa policy of India|eVisas]], don’t make such a distinction. Singapore imposes [[Visa policy of Singapore#Assessment Level II Countries|strict controls]] on stateless individuals and refugees, and reduces length of stay for British nationals without right of abode in the United Kingdom, but does not distinguish between ROC passports with and without national ID numbers.

As a result of tension over the [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] ({{lang-hy|Արցախի Հանրապետություն}}) dispute, Azerbaijan currently forbids entry to Armenian citizens as well as to individuals with proof of travel to Artsakh.

==Free travel areas==
Certain neighbouring countries may agree to fully or partially abolish border controls between them. 

===Central America-4 Border Control Agreement===
{{main|Central America-4 Border Control Agreement}}
The Central America-4 Border Control Agreement ({{lang-es|Convenio centroamericano de libre movilidad}}) abolishes border controls for land travel between [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Guatemala]]. However, this does not apply to air travel.

===Commonwealth of Independent States===
{{main|Commonwealth of Independent States}}

The Commonwealth of Independent States ({{lang-rus|Содружество Независимых Государств, СНГ|Sodruzhestvo Nezavisimykh Gosudarstv}}), or CIS, is an organisation composed of former members of the Soviet Union, whose members eliminate many trade and visa related border controls.

====Union State of Russia and Belarus====
{{main|Union State of Russia and Belarus}}

The Union State of Russia and Belarus ({{lang-rus|Сою́зное госуда́рство}}; {{lang-be|Саюзная дзяржава}} ''Sajuznaja dziaržava'') is a supranational union of Russia and Belarus (two CIS members), which eliminates all border controls between the two nations. However, each country continues to maintain its own visa policies, thus resulting in non-citizens of the two countries generally being barred from travelling directly between the two.

===Western Europe===

{{main|Schengen Area|Common Travel Area}}
The two most significant free travel areas in Western Europe are the Schengen area ({{lang-de|Schengen-Raum}}; {{lang-fr|l'Espace Schengen}}), in which very little if any border control is generally visible, and the Common Travel Area ({{lang-ga|Comhlimistéar Taistil}}) (CTA), which partially eliminates such controls for nationals of the United Kingdom and Ireland. Between countries in the [[Schengen Area]] ({{lang-de|Schengen-Raum}}; {{lang-fr|l'Espace Schengen}}), and to an extent within the CTA on the [[British Isles]], internal border control is often virtually unnoticeable, and often only performed by means of random car or train searches in the [[hinterland]], while controls at borders with non-member states may be rather strict.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Greater India===
[[File:Visa policy of Bhutan.png|400px|thumb|Visa policy of Bhutan, showing free movement arrangement between India and Bhutan]]
{{main|1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship|Visa policy of Bhutan}}

India and Nepal maintain a similar arrangement to the CTA and the Union State of Russia and Belarus. Indians and Nepalis aren’t subject to any migration controls in each other’s countries and there are few controls on land travel by citizens across the border.

India and Bhutan also have a similar system. The border between Jaigaon, in the Indian state of West Bengal, and the city of Phuentsholing is essentially open, and although there are internal checkpoints, Indians are allowed to proceed throughout Bhutan with a voter’s ID or an identity slip from the Indian consulate in Phuentsholing. Similarly, Bhutanese passport holders enjoy free movement in India.

Whilst not as liberal as the policies concerning the Indo-Nepalese and Indo-Bhutanese borders, Thailand and Cambodia have begun issuing combined visas to certain categories of tourists applying at specific Thai or Cambodian embassies and consulates in order to enable freer border crossings between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Single-entry-visa-for-Thailand-Cambodia-30196863.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The policy is currently in force for nationals of America and several European (primarily EU and GCC) and Oceanian countries as well as for Indian and Chinese nationals residing in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thaiembassy.sg/announcements/acmecs-single-visa-application-now-opens-for-citizen-of-35-countries-wishing-to-enter-0]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement===
[[File:New_Zealand_Resident_Visa_Stamp_on_Australian_Travel_Document.jpg|130px|thumbnail|A New Zealand  visa stamp issued under Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement on an Australian travel document.]]
The [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] is an arrangement between [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] which allows for the free movement of [[citizens]] of one of these countries to the other. 

The arrangement came into effect in 1973, and allows citizens of each country to reside and work in the other country, with some restrictions. Other details of the arrangement have varied over time. From 1 July 1981, all people entering Australia (including New Zealand citizens) have been required to carry a passport. Since 1 September 1994 Australia has had a universal visa requirement, and to specifically cater for the continued free movement of New Zealanders to Australia the [[Special Category Visa]] was introduced for New Zealanders.

===Gulf Cooperation Council===
Members of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] ({{lang-ar|مجلس التعاون لدول الخليج العربي‎}}), or GCC, allow each other's citizens freedom of movement in an arrangement similar to the CTA and to that between India and Nepal. Such benefits are partially suspended for Qataris as a result of the Saudi-led blocade of the country.

== Expedited border controls ==
Certain countries and trade blocs establish programmes for high-frequency and/or low risk travellers to expedite border controls, subjecting them to lighter or automated checks, or priority border control facilities. In some countries, citizens or residents have access to automated facilities not available to foreigners.

===British Isles===

====United Kingdom====
[[File:Heathrow Terminal 4 ePassport gates.jpg|right|thumb|ePassport gates in [[Heathrow Airport]] (Terminal 4)]]
[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5 ePassport gates.jpg|right|thumb|ePassport gates in [[Heathrow Airport]] (Terminal 5)]]
[[ePassport gates]] are operated by the [[UK Border Force]] and are located at immigration checkpoints in the arrival halls of some airports across the United Kingdom, offering an alternative to using desks staffed by immigration officers. The gates use [[facial recognition technology]] to verify the user's identity by comparing the user's facial features to those recorded in the photograph stored in the chip in their [[biometric passport]].

[[British nationality law|British]] citizens, [[European Economic Area]] citizens and citizens of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], and America as well as Chinese citizens of Hong Kong and the Taiwan area{{efn|name=ROC}} who are enrolled in the Registered Traveller Service,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/registered-traveller]&lt;/ref&gt; can use ePassport gates, provided that they are aged either 18 and over or 12 and over travelling with an adult and holding valid [[biometric passports]].

ePassport gates are available at the following locations:
* [[Birmingham Airport]]
* [[Bristol Airport]]
* [[Cardiff Airport]]
* [[East Midlands Airport]]
* [[Edinburgh Airport]]
* [[St Pancras railway station|Eurostar St Pancras Terminal]]
* [[Brussels-South railway station|Eurostar Brussels-Zuid Terminal]]
* [[Gatwick Airport]] (North and South Terminals)
* [[Glasgow Airport]]
* [[Heathrow Airport]] (Terminals 2, 3, 4  and 5)
* [[London City Airport]]
* [[Luton Airport]]
* [[Manchester Airport]] (Terminals 1, 2 and 3)
* [[Stansted Airport]]

====Republic of Ireland====
The [[Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service]] operates eGates at [[Dublin Airport]] for arrivals at Terminal 1 (Piers 1 and 2) and Terminal 2. They are currently available to citizens of [[Switzerland]] and the [[European Economic Area]] with electronic passports aged 18 or over. There are proposals to extend the service to non-European citizens. Irish  Passport Cards can not be used.

===East Asia===
====China====
[[File:Hkairport echannel.JPG|160px|thumb|e-Channel machines at Hong Kong International Airport]]

{{main|e-Channel}}

The e-Channel ({{lang-zh|自助出入境檢查系統 or e-道}}) is an automated border control facility available at airports in Hong Kong and Macau, and at land borders between the mainland and the Special Administrative Regions. It is open to Chinese citizens with permanent residence in the appropriate regions, and to selected foreign nationals. A similar automated entry system, eGate, exists in Taiwan providing expedited border control for Chinese citizens of Taiwan and other areas controlled by the Republic of China{{efn|name=ROC}} as well as certain classes of residents and frequent visitors. Users simply scan their travel documents at the gate and are passed through for facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=e-Gate|url=http://www.immigration.gov.tw/egate/|website=immigration.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
[[Image:J-VIS gate E.svg|thumb|150px|Automated immigration at [[Narita Airport]]. ]]

Along with the introduction of [[J-BIS]], an "Automated gate" (自動化ゲート) was set up at Terminal 1 and 2 at Narita Airport, Haneda Airport, Chubu Centrair Airport and Kansai Airport.&lt;ref name="his"&gt;[http://www.his-j.com/tyo/corp/btc/news/20071106nrt.html 「成田空港、11/20より自動化ゲート導入」] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225170022/http://www.his-j.com/tyo/corp/btc/news/20071106nrt.html |date=2009-02-25 }} H.I.S.海外出張ニュース&lt;/ref&gt; With this system, when a person enters or leaves the country, rather than having to be processed by an examiner there, a person can use a machine at the gate, thereby making both entry and departure simpler and easier, as well as more convenient.&lt;ref name="moj"&gt;[http://www.moj.go.jp/NYUKAN/nyukan63.html 「自動化ゲートの運用について」] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821030411/http://www.moj.go.jp/NYUKAN/nyukan63.html |date=2008-08-21 }} 法務省入国管理局 2007年11月&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese people with valid passports, foreigners with both valid passports (this includes refugees with valid travel certificates and re-entry permits) and re-entry permits can use this system.&lt;ref name="moj"/&gt;

====South Korea====
South Korea maintains a programme known as the Smart Entry Service ({{lang-ko|스마트 엔트리 서비스}}), open for registration by South Koreans aged 7 or above, citizens from selected countries, foreigners aged 17 or above and holding Korean Alien Registration Card, foreign crew members with multiple-entry visas, and foreigners holding Korea Priority Card issued by Ministry of Justice &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ses.go.kr/ses/SesObjectR_en.ses]&lt;/ref&gt;. Foreign nationalities eligible to register include American citizens enrolled in Global Entry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ses.go.kr/ses/GeApplInfoR_en.ses]&lt;/ref&gt;, Hong Kong SAR passport holders, Macau SAR passport holders, and Taiwanese passport holders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ses.go.kr/ses/NtcCotnDetailR_en.ses?bbsGbCd=BS10&amp;bbsSeq=4&amp;langCd=EN&amp;ntccttSeq=9|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The nationals must not hold Korean Alien Registration Card. For Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan passport holders, they must not use other passports such as People's Republic of China passport, British National (Overseas) passport, and Portuguese passport to be eligible.

===North America===
North America has a range of expedited border control programmes.

====CARIPASS====
{{main|CARIPASS}}
CARIPASS is a voluntary travel card programme that will provide secure and simple border crossings for Caribbean Community ({{lang-fr|Communauté caribéenne }}; {{lang-es|Comunidad del Caribe}}) ([[CARICOM]]) citizens and some legal residents of CARICOM nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/wireStory?id=12305062 Travel News, Tips &amp; Deals - ABC News]&lt;/ref&gt; The CARIPASS initiative is coordinated by the Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (CARICOM IMPACS), and seeks to provide standardised border control facilities within participating Caribbean communities.&lt;ref&gt;CARICOM SECRETARIAT: http://www.caricom.org/jsp/single_market/caripass.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213023423/http://caricom.org/jsp/single_market/caripass.pdf |date=2010-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CARIPASS is accepted as a valid travel document within and between participating member states and will allow cardholders to access automated gate facilities at immigration checkpoints that will use biometric technology to verify the user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caricomimpacs.org CARICOM IMPACS - Implementation Agency for Crime and Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following CARICOM jurisdictions are participating in the programme:&lt;ref&gt;List of CARICOM Member and Associate States http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/member_states.jsp?menu=community}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Antigua and Barbuda]]

====NEXUS and FAST====
{{main|NEXUS (frequent traveler program)|Free and Secure Trade|CANPASS}}
[[Image:NEXUSCard.png|125px|thumb|left|Sample NEXUS card]]
[[Image:NexusLane.JPG|thumb|right|A NEXUS lane at the U.S. side of the [[Ambassador Bridge]].]]
NEXUS is a joint Canadian-American expedited border control programme for low risk travellers holding Canadian or American citizenship or permanent residence. Membership requires approval by Canadian and American authorities and entitles members to dedicated RFID-enabled lanes when crossing the land border. A NEXUS card can also be utilised as a travel document between the two countries and entitles passengers to priority border control facilities in Canada and Global Entry facilities in America.

Free and Secure Trade or FAST ({{lang-fr|Expéditions rapides et sécuritaires ou EXPRES}}; {{lang-es|Expediciones rápidas y seguras}}) is a similar programme for commercial drivers and approved importers, reducing the amount of customs checks conducted at the border and expediting the border control process.

Canadian citizens and Permanent Residents who are approved by Canadian authorities but not by the Americans can join CANPASS, which provides similar border control benefits but solely in Canada.

====Global Entry and SENTRI====
{{main|Global Entry|SENTRI}}

[[File:Global Entry participants.svg|thumb|Countries participating in Global Entry]]

Global Entry ({{lang-es|Entrada Global}}) is an American programme for frequent travellers that enables them to utilise automated border control facilities and priority security screening. In addition to Americans and Permanent Residents, the programme is open to Indian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expedited entry into US for Indian travellers from now on - Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/expedited-entry-into-us-for-indian-travellers-from-now-on/articleshow/59336272.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Singaporean&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/faster-immigration/2908082.html|title=Faster immigration clearance for eligible Singaporeans travelling to US|website=www.channelnewsasia.com|access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and South Korean citizens amongst others.

SENTRI is a similar programme for American and Mexican citizens that additionally allows members to register their cars for expedited land border controls. When entering America across the Canadian border, it can be used as a NEXUS card, but not the other way around.

Global Entry members (as well as NEXUS and SENTRI card holders with a Known Traveller Number) are eligible to use automated Global Entry facilities at certain airports to clear border control more efficiently. Enrolled users must present their [[Machine-readable medium|machine-readable]] [[passport]] or [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residency card]], and submit their fingerprints to establish identity. Users then complete an electronic [[customs declaration]], and are issued a receipt instructing them to either proceed to [[baggage claim]], or to a normal inspection booth for an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/trusted_traveler/global_entry/global_entry_discription.xml |website=CBP |title=How to Use the Kiosk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625090904/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/trusted_traveler/global_entry/global_entry_discription.xml |archivedate=June 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viajero Confiable====
{{main|Viajero Confiable}}

Viajero Confiable is a Mexican programme similar to Global Entry that allows expedited border controls in Mexico.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
[[File:Smartgate Arrivals at Sydney Airport.jpg|180px|thumb|Smartgate Arrivals at Sydney Airport]]
SmartGates located at major Australian airports allow [[Australian passport|Australian ePassport]] holders and [[ePassport]] holders of a number of other countries to clear immigration controls more rapidly, and to enhance travel security by performing passport control checks electronically.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2015/07/new-smartgate-aims-to-decrease-airport-queues.html|title=New SmartGate aims to decrease airport queues}}&lt;/ref&gt; SmartGate uses [[facial recognition technology]] to verify the traveller's identity against the data stored in the chip in their [[biometric passport]], as well as checking against immigration databases. Travellers require a biometric passport to use SmartGate as it uses information from the passport (such as photograph, name and date of birth) and in the respective countries' databases (i.e. banned travellers database) to decide whether to grant entry or departure from Australia or to generate a referral to a customs agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.customs.govt.nz/features/smartgate/howsmartgateworks/Pages/default.aspx|title=New Zealand Customs Service : How does SmartGate work?|website=www.customs.govt.nz|access-date=2018-08-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320124138/http://www.customs.govt.nz/features/smartgate/howsmartgateworks/Pages/default.aspx#|archive-date=2017-03-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These checks would otherwise require manual processing by a human which is time-consuming, costly and potentially error-prone.&lt;ref name="oag.govt.nz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oag.govt.nz/2012/realising-benefits/part5.htm|title=Part 5: Processing passengers faster at airports — Office of the Auditor-General New Zealand|website=www.oag.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, a SmartGate system exists at Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown airports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asmag.com/showpost/21778.aspx |title=Morpho Australasia completes eGate installation in New Zealand airport |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=16 December 2016 |website=asmag |publisher=Messe Frankfurt New Era Business Media Ltd. |access-date=3 July 2018 |quote=Safran Identity &amp; Security, through its subsidiary Morpho Australasia, has completed installing the next generation of eGates into Christchurch Airport.&lt;br /&gt; This installation is part of national upgrade and innovation program for 51 new generation border processing eGates for the New Zealand Customs Service (NZ Customs). The rollout has seen new generation Safran Identity &amp; Security's eGates installed in Auckland, Wellington, Queenstown and now Christchurch airport.}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling holders of biometric passports issued by New Zealand, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States to clear border controls using automated facilities. The system can currently only be used by travellers 12 years of age or older, however a trial is under way that may potentially lower the age of eligibility to use eGate for people with an eligible ePassport from 12 years of age to 10 years of age. New Zealand eGates utilise biometric technology, comparing the picture of your face in your ePassport with the picture it takes of you at the gate in order to confirm your identity. To make sure eGate can do this, travellers must make sure they look as similar to their ePassport photos as possible and remove glasses, scarves and hats that they were not wearing when their passport picture was taken. eGate can handle minor changes in your face, for example if the travellers' weight or hair has changed. Customs, Biosecurity and Immigration officials utilise information provided at eGates, including photos, to clear travellers and their items across New Zealand's border. Biometric information is kept for three months before destruction but other information, including about movements across New Zealand's border is kept indefinitely and handled in accordance with the [[Right to privacy in New Zealand#Privacy Act 1993|Privacy Act 1993]], or as the law authorises. This might include information being used by or shared with other law enforcement or border control authorities.

===Singapore===
Automated border controls exist at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] ({{lang-hi|सिंगापुर चांगी अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय विमानक्षेत्र}}; {{lang-zh|新加坡樟宜机场}}; {{lang-ta|சிங்கப்பூர் சாங்கி வானூர்தி நிலையம்}}; {{lang-ms|Lapangan Terbang Changi Singapura}}; {{lang-ml|സിംഗപ്പൂർ ചാങ്കി വിമാനത്താവളം}}) for Singapore residents and certain foreign nationals with long term passes. Similar facilities exist for motorcyclists at the border crossings with Malaysia.

===APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC)===
[[File:APEC Business Travel Card Member States.svg|thumb|260|right|{{legend|green|Full members of the scheme}}{{legend|lime|Transitional members (United States, Canada)}}]]

{{main|APEC Business Travel Card}}

The APEC Business Travel Card ({{lang-zh|亞太經合組織商務旅遊證}}, {{lang-hi|एपीईसी बिजनेस ट्रैवल कार्ड}}, {{lang-es|Tarjeta de Viajes de Negocios APEC}}) or ABTC, is an expedited border control programme for business travellers from [[APEC]] economies (excluding Canada and America). It provides visa exemptions and access to expedited border control facilities. ABTC holders are eligible for expedited border control at Canadian airports but not for any visa exemptions.

ABTCs are generally issued only to citizens of APEC member countries, however Hong Kong issues them to Permanent Residents who are not Chinese citizens, a category primarily consisting of British, Indian, and Pakistani citizens.

The use of ABTCs in China is restricted as a result of the [[one country, two systems]] ({{lang-zh|一国两制}}) and [[One China Policy|one China]] policies ({{lang-zh|一个中国原则}}). Chinese citizens from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan are required to use special internal travel documents to enter the mainland. Similar restrictions exist on the use of ABTC for Chinese citizens of other regions entering Taiwan. (see: [[Border control#Internal border controls|Internal border controls]]).

==Internal border controls==

===Asia===

Some countries maintain border controls within their own territory. These are not uncommon in some parts of Asia. For example, minority regions in India and China often require special permits (i.e. [[Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958 (India)|Restricted Area Permits, Protected Area Permits]], [[Visa policy of China#Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet Travel Permits, or Alien Travel Permits]]) for foreign nationals to enter in addition to visas where required. In some cases, these restrictions are not limited to foreigners. For instance, certain minority areas of India additionally require Indian citizens to possess an [[Inner Line Permit]] to enter. Similarly, the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] ([[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]]: བོད་རང་སྐྱོང་ལྗོངས།) in China requires Chinese citizens from Taiwan to obtain TTPs and ATPs even though Chinese citizens from the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macau are exempt.

Within China, extensive border controls are maintained for those travelling between the [[Mainland China|mainland]], [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], and [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled by the Republic of China]]{{efn|name=ROC|The area under the definition consists of the island groups of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen|Jinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Mazu]] and [[List of islands of Taiwan|some minor islands]].}}. Foreign nationals need to present their passports or other types of travel documents when travelling between these areas. For Chinese nationals (including those with [[British National (Overseas)]] status), there are special [[travel document|documents]]{{efn|For example, [[Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card]] or [[Macau Identity Card]] and [[Home Return Permit]] are required for Hong Kong or Macau Permanent Residents who are Chinese citizens to cross the border, whilst mainlanders require a two-way permit.}} for travel between these territories. Similar arrangements, in the form of the [[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]] ({{lang-zh| 台湾居民来往大陆通行证}}) issued by mainland authority and [[Exit &amp; Entry Permit|similar permits]] issued by Taiwan authorities exist for travel between Taiwan and territories controlled by the [[People’s Republic of China]]. 

Internal air and rail travel within non-autonomous portions of India and mainland China also generally requires travel documents to be checked by government officials as a form of interior border checkpoint. For such travel within India, Indian citizens may utilise their [[Voter ID (India)|Voter ID]], [[Aadhaar|National Identity Card]], passport, or other proof of Indian citizenship whilst Nepali nationals may present any similar proof of Napali citizenship. Meanwhile, for such travel within mainland China, Chinese nationals from the mainland are required to use their national identity cards.

The most restrictive internal border controls west of the Pacific are in [[North Korea]]. Citizens are not allowed to travel outside their areas of residence without explicit authorisation, and access to the capital city of Pyongyang is heavily restricted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA24/002/2009/en/]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions are imposed on tourists, who are only allowed to leave Pyongyang on government-authorised tours to approved tourist sites.

Another example is the [[Malaysia]]n states of [[Sabah]] ({{lang-ta|சபா}}; {{lang-hi|साबाह राज्य}}; {{lang-zh|沙巴}}) and [[Sarawak]] ({{lang-ta|சரவாக்}}; {{lang-hi|सारावाक}}; {{lang-zh|砂拉越}}), which have maintained their own border controls&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lonelyplanet.com/borneo/visas]&lt;/ref&gt; since joining Malaysia in 1963. 

Meanwhile, in Bhutan, a microstate accessible by road only through India, there are interior border checkposts (primarily on the [[Lateral Road]]) and, additionally, certain areas require [[Visa policy of Bhutan#Restricted areas permit|special permits]] to enter, whilst visitors not proceeding beyond the border city of [[Phuentsholing]] ({{lang-dz|ཕུན་ཚོགས་གླིང་}}) do not need permits to enter for the day (although such visitors are [[de facto]] subject to Indian visa policy since they must proceed through [[Jaigaon]]). Individuals who are not citizens of India, Bangladesh, or the Maldives are not allowed to proceed past Phuentsholing by land and are instead required to arrive by air at the country's [[Paro Airport|sole international airport]] in [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] ({{lang-dz|སྤ་རོ་}}), which has flights from India and other countries in the Greater India region such as Thailand, Singapore, and Nepal.

Internal border controls in the Chinese Special Administrative Regions have also meant that immigrants from the mainland require a [[People's Republic of China Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao|One Way Travel Permit]] ({{lang-zh|单程证}}), the issuance of which is controlled by the mainland government, thus giving that region of China greater control over emigration rather than by Hong Kong or Macau as would be expected of border controls aimed at curtailing immigration.

[[Israeli checkpoint]]s ({{lang-he-n|מחסום}}, ''mahsom'', {{lang-ar|حاجز}}, ''hajez'') also constitute a significant example of internal border controls. Spread throughout the [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the areas of the [[State of Palestine]] under de facto Israeli control, internal checkpoints are a key feature of Israeli and Palestinian life, and Israel’s internal border controls are amongst the most restrictive in the world.

[[Iraq]]'s [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan region]] ({{lang-ku|هه‌رێمی کوردستان}}; {{lang-ar|إقليم كردستان}}) maintains a separate and more liberal visa and customs area from the rest of the country, even allowing [[Visa policy of Iraq|visa free entry]] for Israelis whilst the rest of the country bans them from entering.

===Europe, Russia and Central Asia===

====Schengen Area====
An unusual example of internal border controls pertains to customs enforcement within the Schengen area. Even though borders are generally invisible, the existence of areas within the Schengen area but outside the [[European Union Value Added Tax Area]], as well as jurisdictions such as Andorra which are not officially a part of the Schengen area but can not be accessed without passing through it, has resulted in the existence of sporadic [[Schengen Area#Internal controls|internal border controls]] for customs purposes. Additionally, as per Schengen area rules&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/;jsessionid=TJcLTTkLTbF0zDNTTm0Z2GGMzHlM1QGpWP9mdKGRx6WlrfTlb2GQ!1620842458?uri=CELEX:32006R0562 Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)] See Title III Article 21&lt;/ref&gt;, hotels and other types of commercial accommodation must register all foreign citizens, including citizens of other Schengen states, by requiring the completion of a registration form by their own hand. This does not apply to accompanying spouses and minor children or members of travel groups. In addition, a valid identification document has to be produced to the hotel manager or staff.&lt;ref&gt;Article 45 of the Schengen Convention.&lt;/ref&gt; The Schengen rules do not require any other procedures; thus, the Schengen states are free to regulate further details on the content of the registration forms, and identity documents which are to be produced, and may also require the persons exempted from registration by Schengen laws to be registered. A Schengen state is also permitted to reinstate border controls with another Schengen country for a short period where there is a serious threat to that state's "public policy or internal security" or when the "control of an external border is no longer ensured due to exceptional circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120608-european-union-schengen-border-control-migrants-refugees |title=EU agrees short-term border closures to block migrants |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such risks arise out of foreseeable events, the state in question must notify the European Commission in advance and consult with other Schengen states.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II of the Schengen Borders Code ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R0562:EN:NOT OJ L 105, 13 April 2006, p. 1]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 Malta introduced temporary checks due to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100405/local/border-checks-are-back |title=Border checks are back |newspaper=Times of Malta |date=5 April 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reimposed checks in 2015 in the weeks surrounding the [[CHOGM 2015|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]. In response to the [[European migrant crisis]], several countries set up internal controls.

====Nordic countries====
An example from Europe is the implementation of border controls on travel between [[Svalbard]], which maintains a policy of [[free migration]] as a result of the [[Svalbard Treaty]] ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: Svalbard-traktaten; {{lang-ru|Свальбардский договор}}) and the Schengen Area, which includes the rest of Norway.

The [[Kingdom of Denmark]] also maintains a complex system of subnational countries with autonomous customs policies, since they aren’t within the European Union like the Danish mainland. These are [[Greenland]] ({{lang-kl|Kalaallit Nunaat}}) and the [[Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Føroyar}}). These areas do not maintain strict immigration controls with the Schengen Area, but border controls are sporadically enforced for customs purposes.

====Russia and CIS====
Other examples of effective internal border controls include the [[closed cities]] ({{lang-ru|Закрытое административно-территориальное образование}}) of certain [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] members, [[Visa policy of Turkmenistan#Special permits|areas of Turkmenistan]] that require special permits to enter, [[Visa policy of Tajikistan#Gorno-Badakhshan|restrictions]] on travel to the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]] ({{lang-tg|Вилояти Мухтори Кӯҳистони Бадахшон}}; {{lang-ru|Горно-Бадахшанская автономная область|translit=Gorno-Badahšanskaja avtonomnaja oblastj}}) in Tajikistan.

In addition to the numerous closed cities of Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Federation Country Specific Information – Entry/Exit Requirements for U.S. Citizens|url=http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1006.html#entry_requirements|publisher=Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=18 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003453/http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1006.html#entry_requirements|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of 19 subjects{{efn|

====United Kingdom and Ireland====
Another complex border control situation in Europe pertains to the United Kingdom. Whilst the [[crown dependencies]] are within the [[Common Travel Area]], neither [[Gibraltar]] nor the sovereign British military exclaves of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] are. The former maintains its own [[Visa policies of British Overseas Territories#Gibraltar|border control policies]], thus requiring physical border security at its border with the Schengen Area as well as the implementation of border controls for travellers proceeding directly between Gibraltar and the British mainland. The latter maintains a relatively open border with Southern Cyprus, though not with Northern Cyprus. Consequently, it is a de facto member of the Schengen Area and travel to or from the British mainland requires border controls.

The [[Peace lines|Peace Lines]] in Northern Ireland are a de facto internal border security measure to separate Catholic/Republican communities and Protestant/Unionist communities from each other. They have been in place in some form or another since the end of [[The Troubles]].

===American territories===
[[File:American Samoa Entry Stamp.tif|160px|right|thumbnail|American Samoa entry stamp]]
[[File:Hyder AK.jpg|left|160px|thumb|Hyder, Alaska has no border controls for travellers entering from Canada, and travellers flying between Hyder and other Alaskan cities by seaplane undergo internal border control]]
Multiple types of internal border controls exist in the [[United States of America]]. These include the maintenance of [[Visa policy of the United States#Visa waiver programs of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands|autonomous]] or [[Visa policy of the United States#American Samoa|separate immigration policies]] in each of America’s major territories in the Pacific, i.e. [[Guam]] ({{lang-ch|Guåhån}}), [[American Samoa]] ({{lang-sm|Amelika Sāmoa}}), and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] ({{lang-ch|Sankattan Siha Na Islas Mariånas}}; [[Carolinian language|Refaluwasch or Carolinian]]: ''Commonwealth Téél Falúw kka Efáng llól Marianas''). Each of these territories maintains its own visa exemptions, and there are consequently immigration and customs checks on travel between the these territories and the American mainland.

The US Virgin Islands are a special case, falling within America’s immigration zone but being a customs free territory. As a result, there are no immigration checks between the two but there travellers arriving in Puerto Rico or the American mainland directly from the Virgin Islands are subject to border control for customs inspection. America also maintains [[United States Border Patrol interior checkpoints|interior checkpoints]], similar to those maintained by Bhutan, along its borders with Mexico and Canada, subjecting people to border controls even after they have entered the country. The city of [[Hyder, Alaska]] has also been subject to internal border controls since the United States chose to stop regulating arrivals in Hyder from British Columbia. Since travellers exiting Hyder into British Columbia are subject to Canadian border controls, it is theoretically possible for someone to accidentally enter Hyder from Canada without their travel documents and then to face difficulties since both America and Canada would subject them to border controls that require travel documents.

===Realm of New Zealand===
[[File:Niue passport stamp (entry).png|right|150px|thumbnail|Niue entry stamp issued at [[Hanan International Airport]]]]
{{main|Visa policy of New Zealand}}
{{further|Realm of New Zealand}}

[[Tokelau]], [[Niue]], and the [[Cook Islands]] ([[Cook Islands Māori]]: ''Kūki 'Āirani'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C ''Cook Islands Maori dictionary''] by Jasper Buse &amp; Raututi Taringa, Cook Islands Ministry of Education (1995) page 200&lt;/ref&gt; maintain independent and less restrictive border controls from New Zealand. The [[Cook Islands]] further maintain a separate nationality law. Additionally, border controls for Tokelau are complicated by the fact that the territory is, for the most part, only accessible via [[Samoa]].

==Prescreening border controls==
===The United States of America===
{{main|United States border preclearance}}

The [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] operates border preclearance facilities at a number of ports and airports in foreign territory.  They are staffed and operated by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers. Travelers pass through U.S. [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs]], [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health]], and [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] inspections before boarding their [[aircraft]], [[ship]], or [[train]].  This process is intended to streamline border procedures, reduce congestion at ports of entry, and facilitate travel between the preclearance location and U.S. airports unequipped to handle international travellers.

These facilities are present at the majority of major Canadian airports, as well as selected airports in Bermuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Abu Dhabi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://ph.news.yahoo.com/us-customs-pre-clearance-facility-opens-uae-162934663--sector.html |title = US Customs pre-clearance facility opens in UAE |work = Yahoo!

A preclearance facility is currently being planned at [[Dubai International Airport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://ph.news.yahoo.com/us-border-pre-clearance-facility-planned-dubai-220024656--sector.html |title = US border pre-clearance facility planned in Dubai |work = Yahoo!

Citizens of the Bahamas who enter the USA through either of the two preclearance facilities in that country enjoy an exemption from the general requirement to hold a visa as long as they can sufficiently prove that theydo not have a significant criminal record in either the Bahamas or the USA. All Bahamians applying for admission at a port-of-entry other than the pre-clearance facilities located in [[Nassau International Airport|Nassau]] or [[Freeport International Airport|Freeport International]]  airports are required to be in possession of a valid visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1250/kw/Bahamas%20visa |title=Bahamian citizen document requirements |accessdate=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preclearance facilities are also operated at [[Pacific Central Station]], the Port of Vancouver, and the Port of Victoria in [[British Columbia]], and there are plans to open one at [[Montreal Central Station]] ({{lang-fr|Gare centrale de Montréal}}) in Quebec.

====West Kowloon railway station====
{{Main|West Kowloon railway station#Mainland Port Area}}
A component of the [[Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link]] ({{lang-zh|廣深港高速鐵路}}), West Kowloon Station ({{zh|t=西九龍站}}) will contain a “Mainland Port Area”, essentially enabling passengers and goods to clear mainland Chinese immigration on Hong Kong soil.

====Shenzhen Bay Control Point====

{{main|Shenzhen Bay Control Point}}

The Shenzhen Bay Control Point ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 深圳灣管制站) is a Hong Kong immigration facility co-located with mainland Chinese facilities at [[Shenzhen Bay Port]] ({{zh|s= 深圳湾口岸}}). It is located in the Chinese mainland on land leased from the city of [[Shenzhen]] in [[Guangdong]] province. It essentially enables travellers to clear both mainland and Hong Kong border controls in one place, thus eliminating any need for border control on the Hong Kong side of the [[Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor|Shenzhen Bay Bridge]] ({{lang-zh|深港西部通道}}).

===Singapore and Malaysia===
====Woodlands Train Checkpoint====
Singaporean exit and Malaysian entry preclearance border controls are co-located at the [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]], whilst Malaysian exit controls are located separately at Johor Bahru.

====Johor Bahru - Singapore Rapid Transit====
[[File:MRT map SGJB.svg|200px|thumb|Map of the upcoming Rapid Transit system.]] 
{{main|Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System}}

The upcoming Rapid Transit System ({{lang-ms|Sistem Transit Aliran Johor–Singapura}}) (RTS) connecting Singapore and Johor Bahru will feature border control preclearance both on the Singaporean side and on the Malaysian side. This will enable passengers arriving in Singapore from Malaysia or vice versa to proceed straight to their connecting transport, since the RTS will link to both the Singapore MRT system ([[Thomson-East Coast MRT Line]]) and [[Johor Bahru Sentral railway station|Johor Bahru Sentral]]. Unlike the preclearance systems adopted by the United States and Hong Kong, but similar to the United Kingdom’s juxtaposed controls, this system will mitigate arrival border controls on both sides of the border.&lt;ref name="iskandar"&gt;[http://www.iskandar.asia/insight/iskandar-malaysia-in-the-news/2-uncategorised/145-final-plan-for-singapore-johor-bahru-rapid-transit-system-rts-link-by-end-of-2014.html Final plan for Singapore-Johor Bahru Rapid Transit System (RTS) link by end of 2014&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c%3D2%26id%3D0pt1z213cvn5f2h2t1ti39b4tjkckorbk76uh7r32nykq33d1n |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903033605/http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=0pt1z213cvn5f2h2t1ti39b4tjkckorbk76uh7r32nykq33d1n |archivedate=2014-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Juxtaposed controls}}
====Ferry====
French entry border control for ferries between Dover and Calais or Dunkerque take place at the [[Port of Dover]], whilst French exit and British entry border control takes place at Calais and Dunkerque.

====Rail====
Border control for rail travel between the United Kingdom and the Schengen Area features significant prescreening. This includes customs and immigration prescreening on both sides of the [[Eurotunnel]], and immigration-only prescreening for the [[Eurostar]] between the United Kingdom and stations located in Belgium and France. [[Eurostar]] and [[Eurotunnel]] passengers departing from the Schengen area go through both French or Belgian exit border control and British entry border controls before departures, while passengers departing from the United Kingdom undergo French border controls on British soil.

The following juxtaposed rail border controls are currently in operation:

=== Informal prescreening ===
In some cases countries can introduce controls that functions as border controls but aren't border controls legally and don't need to be performed by government agencies. Normally they are performed and organised by private companies, based on a law that they have to check that passengers don't travel into a specific country if they aren't allowed to. Such controls can take effect in one country based on the law of another country without any formalised border control prescreening agreement in force. Even if they aren't border controls they function as such. The most prominent example is airlines which check passports and visa before passengers are allowed to board the aircraft. Also for some passenger boats such check are performed before boarding.

==Border control organisations==
{{further|Border guard}}
Border controls are usually the responsibility of specialised government organisations. Such agencies may oversee various aspects of border control, such as [[Customs (tax)|customs]], immigration policy, border security, [[quarantine]], and other such aspects. Official designations, jurisdictions and command structures of these agencies vary considerably, and some countries split border control functions across multiple agencies.

===India===
====Border Security Force====
[[File:BSF Logo.svg|167px|thumb|Insignia of the Border Security Force]]

====Direction centrale de la police aux frontières====
{{main|Direction centrale de la police aux frontières}}

The Direction centrale de la police aux frontières (DCPF) is a directorate of the [[National Police (France)|French National Police]] that is responsible for border control at certain border crossing points and border surveillance in some areas in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/List%20of%20national%20services%20responsible%20for%20border%20control.pdf List of national services responsible for border control]&lt;/ref&gt; They work alongside their British counterparts at Calais, and along the Channel Tunnel Rail Link with the [[British Transport Police]]. The DCPF is consequently largely responsible for Schengen Area border controls with the United Kingdom.

====Direction générale des douanes et droits indirects====
Direction générale des douanes et droits indirects (DGDDI), commonly known as ''les douanes'', is a French law enforcement agency responsible for levying indirect taxes, preventing smuggling, surveilling borders and investigating counterfeit money. The agency acts as a [[coast guard]], [[border guard]], sea [[rescue]] organisation and a [[customs]] service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.douane.gouv.fr/page.asp?id=141 Missions of the DGDDI]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, since 1995, the agency has replaced the [[Direction centrale de la police aux frontières|Border Police]] in carrying out [[immigration]] control at smaller [[border checkpoint]]s, in particular at maritime borders and regional airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/customs_bgs_final.pdf |title=Center for the Study of Democracy: Study to identify best practices on the cooperation between border guards and customs administrations working at the external borders of the EU |access-date=2018-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110123/http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/customs_bgs_final.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finnish Border Guard====
The [[Finnish Border Guard]] ({{Lang-fi|Rajavartiolaitos}}; {{Lang-sv|Gränsbevakningsväsendet}}), including the [[coast guard]], is the agency responsible for border control related to persons, including passport control and border patrol. The Border Guard is a paramilitary organization, subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior in administrative issues and to the President of the Republic in issues pertaining to the president's authority as Commander-in-Chief (e.g. officer promotions). The [[Finland-Russia border]] is a controlled external border of the Schengen Area, routinely patrolled and protected by a [[Border control#Border zones|border zone]] enforced by the Border Guard. Finland's borders with [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] are internal Schengen borders with no routine border controls, but the Border Guard maintains personnel in the area owing to its search and rescue (SAR) duties. There are two coast guard districts for patrolling maritime borders. In peacetime, the Border Guard trains [[special forces]] and [[light infantry]] and can be incorporated fully or in part into the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] when required by defence readiness. The Border Guard has police and investigative powers in immigration matters and can independently investigate immigration violations. The Border Guard has search and rescue (SAR) duties, both maritime and inland. The Guard operates SAR helicopters that are often used in inland SAR, in assistance of a local fire and rescue department or other authorities. The Border Guard shares border control duties with Finnish Customs, which inspects arriving goods, and the [[Finnish Police]], which enforces immigration decisions such as removal.

===China===
====Hong Kong====
{{main|Immigration Department (Hong Kong)}}

The Immigration Department of Hong Kong ({{lang-zh|香港入境事務處}}; {{lang-hi|आप्रवासन कार्यालय}}; [[Urdu]]: امیگریشن آفس) is responsible for border controls of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Regions, including [[Border control#Internal border controls|internal controls]] with the rest of China. After the People's Republic of China resumed sovereignty of the territory in July 1997, Hong Kong's immigration system remained largely unchanged from its British predecessor model. In addition, [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|visa-free entry]] acceptance regulations into Hong Kong for passport holders of some 170 countries remain unchanged before and after 1997.

====Macau====
The Immigration Department of Macau ({{lang-zh|澳门入境事務處}}; {{lang-pt|Serviço de Migração}} , under the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau|Public Security Police Force]] ({{lang-zh|治安警察局 }}; {{lang-pt|Corpo de Policia de Segurança Pública de Macau}}), is the government agency responsible for immigration matters, whilst the Public Security Police Force itself is responsible for enforcing immigration laws in Macau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/por/psp_top9_map_sm.html  Serviço de Migração]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mainland====
Border security in [[Mainland China]] are the responsibility of [[China Immigration Inspection]] ({{lang-zh|公安部中国边检}}), a unit of the [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]] ({{lang-zh|中华人民共和国公安部}}). Customs related border controls are largely within the purview of the [[General Administration of Customs]] ({{lang-zh|海关总署}}).

====Areas controlled by the Republic of China====
[[File:ROC-MOI National Immigration Agency entry 20170107.jpg|thumb|160px|National Immigration Agency headquarters.]]
{{main|National Immigration Agency}}

In [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas]] controlled by the Republic of China{{efn|name=ROC}}, the National Immigration Agency ({{lang-zh|內政部移民署}}), a subsidiary organisation of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Republic of China)|Ministry of the Interior]] ({{lang-zh| 內政部}}) is responsible for border control. The agency is headed by the [[Director General]]. The current Director-General is Hsieh Li-kung.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration.gov.tw/immig_eng/aspcode/maina.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency was established in early 2007 and its job includes the care and guidance of new immigrants, exit and entry control, the inspection on [[illegal immigrant]]s, the forcible [[deportation]] of unlawful entrants, and the prevention of [[human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration.gov.tw/immig_eng/aspcode/main10.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The agency also deals with persons from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau who do not hold household registration in the areas controlled by the ROC.

==Immigration law==
{{legal status}}
Immigration law refers to the national [[statute]]s, [[Primary and secondary legislation|regulations]], and [[Precedent|legal precedents]] governing [[immigration]] into and [[deportation]] from a [[country]]. Strictly speaking, it is distinct from other matters such as [[naturalisation]] and [[citizenship]], although they are often conflated. Immigration laws vary around the world, as well as according to the [[Society|social]] and [[political climate]] of the times, as acceptance of immigrants sways from the widely inclusive to the deeply [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]]. Countries frequently maintain laws which regulate both the rights of entry and exit as well as internal rights, such as the duration of stay, [[freedom of movement]], and the right to participate in [[commerce]] or [[government]].

National laws regarding the immigration of citizens of that country are regulated by [[international law]]. The [[United Nations|United Nations']] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] mandates&lt;ref&gt;art 12(4)&lt;/ref&gt; that all countries allow entry to their own citizens.

==Controversies==
Certain border control policies of various countries have been the subject of controversy and public debate.

===Immigrant investor programmes===
{{Main|Immigrant investor programs}}
{{See also|Golden visa}}
Immigrant investor programmes, pejoratively referred to as golden visas, are border control policies designed to attract [[foreign capital]] and [[businessman|business people]] by providing the right of residence and [[citizenship]] in return. These are also known as citizenship-by-investment programmes. While several countries currently offer investors citizenship or residence in return for an economic investment, the concept is relatively new and was only brought to the focus{{clarify|date=August 2018}} around 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cosmopolites: The Coming of the Global Citizen|last=Abrahamian|first=Atossa Araxia|publisher=Columbia Global Reports|year=2015|isbn=978-0-9909763-6-3|location=|pages=70–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/passport-king-christian-kalin-helps-nations-sell-citizenship|title=The Passport King|last=Clenfield|first=Jason|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://skift.com/2015/03/12/the-man-who-helps-countries-turn-investments-into-passports-for-the-rich/|title=The Man Who Helps Countries Turn Investments Into Passports for the Rich|date=2015-03-12|website=Skift|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of such programmes have been traced back to the 1980s when [[tax haven]]s in the Pacific and Caribbean began "cash-for-passport" programmes that facilitated visa-free travel and provided tax advantages.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship, Ayelet Shachar, Chapter 35, Citizenship For Sale?, pg. 794, Oxford University Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1984, [[St Kitts and Nevis]] began its programme which offered not only permanent residency but [[citizenship]] to foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt; Citizenship is for sale to the wealthy, Malta is among states to offer second passports, easing access to the wider EU, FT.com, Vanessa Houlder June 29, 2016,  https://www.ft.com/content/155936ec-2728-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89&lt;/ref&gt; The issuing of golden visas has expanded dramatically during the 21st century, with around 25% of all countries issuing such visas as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;IMF Working Paper, WP/15/93, Too Much of a Good Thing?: Prudent Management of Inflows under Economic Citizenship Programs, by Xin Xu, Ahmed El-Ashram and Judith Gold https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp1593.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics on the issuing of golden visas ares scarce, but the IMF estimated in 2015 that the vast majority of golden visas are issued to Chinese nationals.

Immigrant investor programmes usually have multiple criteria that must be fulfilled for the investment to qualify, often pertaining to job creation, purchasing of real estate, non-refundable contributions or specific targeted industries.&lt;ref name=":zxz"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Residence and Citizenship Handbook|last=Kalin|first=Christian H.|publisher=Ideos Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0992781859|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these programmes are structured to ensure that the investment contributes to the welfare, advancement and economic development of the country in which the applicant wishes to reside or belong to. It is more often more about making an economic contribution than just an investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biznews.com/undictated/2016/06/30/how-to-get-a-second-passport-citizenship-by-investment-is-booming/|title=How to get a second passport: "Citizenship by investment" is booming - BizNews.com|date=2016-06-30|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] [[EB-5 visa]] programme requires overseas applicants to invest a minimum of anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million, depending on the location of project, and requires at least 10 jobs to be either created or preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/eb-5|title=EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these criteria are met, the applicant and their family become eligible for a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. There is an annual cap of 10,000 applications under the EB-5 arrangement. Some countries such as Malta and Cyprus also offer citizenship ("so-called [[Permanent residency#golden passports|golden passports]]") to individuals if they invest a certain sum.&lt;ref&gt;Where is the cheapest place to buy citizenship?, By Kim Gittleson BBC reporter, New York, 4 June 2014, https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27674135&lt;/ref&gt; Greece's Golden Visa Program. The current investment threshold is 250,000 EUR for the purchase or long term lease of property. This arrangement offers a permanent residence permit and free entry to the EU and Schengen Area to aliens, as long as they retain ownership of the investment property. The Malta Individual Investor Programme,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iip.gov.mt/|title=Individual Investor Programme  - Malta|website=iip.gov.mt|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Henley &amp; Partners]] was contracted in 2014 by the [[Government of Malta]] to design and implement, is similarly capped at 1,800 applicants. Applicants are subject to a thorough due diligence process which guarantees that only reputable applicants acquire Maltese citizenship. Moreover, applications from countries where international sanctions apply may not be accepted. Applications from a particular country can also be excluded on the basis of a Government policy decision.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The minimum investment for this programme is $870,000 with a non-refundable contribution of $700,000.&lt;ref name=":zxz" /&gt; [[Portugal Golden Visa|Portugal's golden visa]] was introduced during the [[Great Recession]] in order to help attract investment in the country's housing market. By 2016 the country had issued 2,788 golden visas, of which 80% had gone to Chinese nationals.&lt;ref name="Almeida"&gt;Henrique Almeida, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-20/chinese-property-buyers-stuck-in-portugal-s-golden-visa-limbo Chinese Stuck in Portugal's Visa Limbo], Bloomberg News (January 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of users of such programmes are wealthy Chinese seeking legal security and a better quality of life outside their home country.

The issuing of so-called golden visas has sparked controversy in several countries. A lack of demonstrable economic benefits, and security concerns, have been among the most common criticisms of golden visas. In 2014 the Canadian government suspended their golden visa programme (although, as of 2017, Quebec maintains their own golden visa programme).&lt;ref&gt;Canada kills investor visa popular with Chinese, by Sophia Yan, March 25, 2014: 2:21 AM ET , CNN, [http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/12/news/canada-chinese-immigration/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The golden visas has been criticised by members of the European Parliament for disfavouring{{clarify|date=August 2018}} the concept of citizenship&lt;ref&gt;Buying their way in, Economist 22 November 2014 [https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21633854-schemes-effect-sell-visas-rich-foreigners-come-under-fire-buying-their-way]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 the [[European Parliament]] approved a [[non-binding resolution]] that an EU passport should not have a "price tag".&lt;ref&gt; Malta's golden passport scheme draws fresh criticism, Concerns centre on selection of Jersey consultancy to run operation targeted at the wealthy, FT.com, https://www.ft.com/content/6f98892e-fbf3-11e5-b3f6-11d5706b613b&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discriminatory practices===
Discriminatory border control practices by numerous jurisdictions have attracted controversy.
====America====
Since the implementation of added security measures in the aftermath of the [[9/11|2001 World Trade Centre attacks]], reports of discrimination against people perceived to be Muslim by American border security officers have been prevalent in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/26/how-discrimination-against-muslims-at-airports-actually-hurts-the-fight-against-terrorism/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9dea42870b45]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trump travel ban|travel restrictions]] implemented during the Trump presidency primarily against Muslim majority countries have provoked controversy over whether such measures are a legitimate [[Border control#Border security|Border security]] measure or unethically discriminatory.

====Bhutan====
{{main|Lhotshampa|Bhutanese refugees}}

Starting primarily in the 1990s, the Bhutanese government implemented strict restrictions on Nepali residents and implemented internal border control policies to restrict immigration or return of ethnic Nepalis. This policy shift effectively ended previously liberal immigration policies with regards to Nepalis and counts amongst the most racialised border control policies in Asia.

====Israel====
Border control, both on entry and on exit, at Israeli airports rate passengers' potential threat to security using factors including nationality, ethnicity, and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://securitysolutions.com/news/security_exposing_hostile_intent|title=What can we learn from Ben Gurion Airport in Israel to help push aviation security in the U.S. to the next level?|publisher=Access Control &amp; Security Systems|accessdate=4 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2001/09/12/israelisecurity.htm | title=Israeli-style security might have averted hijackings | accessdate=2007-05-07 | newspaper=USA Today| date=2001-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of discrimination against [[Arabs]], people perceived to be Muslim, and Russian Jews amongst others have been reported in the media&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-my-friends-were-pro-israel-then-they-met-israeli-airport-security-1.5474044]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/abu-ghosh-restaurateur-airport-security-humiliated-my-wife/]&lt;/ref&gt;. Security at Tel Aviv's [[Ben Gurion Airport]] ({{lang-he-n|נמל התעופה הבינלאומי בן גוריון}}; {{lang-ar|مطار بن غوريون الدولي}}) relies on a number of fundamentals, including a heavy focus on what Raphael Ron, former director of security at Ben Gurion, terms the "human factor", which he generalised as "the inescapable fact that [[terrorist attack]]s are carried out by people who can be found and stopped by an effective security methodology."&lt;ref&gt;Cited K. C. Khurana, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESWo4Zl5g1IC&amp;pg=PA271 ''Aviation Management: Global Perspectives,''] [[Global Indian Foundation| Global India Publications]], 2009 p.271&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its focus on this so-called "human factor," Israeli security officers interrogate travellers, [[racial profiling|profiling]] those who appear to be [[Arab]] based on name or physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/09/africa/ME-Israel-Airport-Dance.php|title=Israeli airport security order dancer to prove identity with dance steps|date=September 9, 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080914174321/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/09/africa/ME-Israel-Airport-Dance.php|archive-date=September 14, 2008|access-date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even as Israeli authorities argue that [[racial profiling|racist, ethnic, and religious profiling]] are effective security measures, according to [[Boaz Ganor]], Israel has not undertaken any known empirical studies on the efficacy of the technique of racial profiling.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard E.

===Australian offshore detention centres===
{{main|Pacific Solution|Nauru Regional Processing Centre|Manus Regional Processing Centre}}

Beginning in 2001, Australia implemented border control policies featuring the detention of asylum seekers and economic migrants who arrived unlawfully by boat in nearby islands in the Pacific. These policies are controversial and in 2017 the [[Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea]] declared the detention centre at Manus Island to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/pg/cases/PGSC/2016/13.html  Namah v Pato PGSC 13; SC1497]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tlozek|first1=Eric|last2=Anderson|first2=Stephanie (political reporter)|title=PNG finds detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island illegal|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-26/png-court-rules-asylum-seeker-detention-manus-island-illegal/7360078|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adherence of these policies to international human rights law is a matter of controversy.

===North Korean refugees in China===
{{main|North Korean defectors#China}}

China does not currently recognise North Korean defectors as refugees and subjects them to immediate deportation if caught. The China-DPRK border is fortified and both sides aim to deter refugees from crossing. This aspect of Chinese border control policy has been criticised by human rights organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= 2013 Update "THE LIST" of North Korean Refugees &amp; Humanitarian Workers Seized by Chinese Authorities | website= North Korea Freedom Coalition | date= December 13, 2013 | url= http://www.nkfreedom.org/UploadedDocuments/2013.12.10_THE_LIST_ENGLISH.pdf | accessdate= December 13, 2013 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213141020/http://www.nkfreedom.org/UploadedDocuments/2013.12.10_THE_LIST_ENGLISH.pdf | archivedate= 13 December 2013 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Sign the Petition Calling on China to Stop the Forced Repatriation of North Korean Refugees| website= North Korea Freedom Coalition| date= December 13, 2013| url= http://www.nkfreedom.org/News/Sign-the-Petition-Calling-on-China-to-Stop-Repatriation-of-North-Koreans.aspx| accessdate= December 13, 2013| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213141309/http://www.nkfreedom.org/News/Sign-the-Petition-Calling-on-China-to-Stop-Repatriation-of-North-Koreans.aspx| archivedate= 13 December 2013| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restrictions on Northern Cypriot airspace===
As a result of [[Northern Cyprus]]'s sovereignty dispute with [[Republic of Cyprus|Southern Cyprus]], the South (a member of the [[European Union]]) has imposed restrictions on the North's airports, and pressure from the European Union has resulted in all countries other than Turkey recognising the South's ability to impose a border shutdown on the North, thus negating the right to [[self determination]] of the predominantly Turkish Northern Cypriot population and subjecting their airports to border controls imposed by the predominantly Greek South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffmeister|title=Legal Aspects of the Cyprus Problem: Annan Plan And EU Accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZXbg3ZwvGoC&amp;pg=PA218|year=2006|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-15223-6|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic support and is unable to develop a functioning economy.&lt;ref name=indepuni&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/universities-little-accord-on-the-island-399360.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Universities: Little accord on the island | date=8 November 2007 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brioni Agreement''' or '''Brioni Declaration''' ({{lang-hr|Brijunska deklaracija}}, {{lang-sr|Brionska deklaracija}}, {{lang-sl|Brijonska deklaracija}}) is a document signed by representatives of [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]] and the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] under the political sponsorship of the [[European Community]] (EC) on the [[Brijuni]] Islands on 7 July 1991. The agreement sought to create an environment in which further negotiations on the future of Yugoslavia could take place. However, ultimately it isolated the [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|federal prime minister]] [[Ante Marković]] in his efforts to preserve Yugoslavia, and effectively stopped any form of federal influence over Slovenia. This meant the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) would focus on combat in Croatia, creating a precedent of redrawing international borders and staking the EC's interest in resolving the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav crisis]].

The agreement put an end to hostilities between the JNA and Slovene forces in the [[Ten-Day War]]. Slovenia and Croatia agreed to suspend activities stemming from their 25 June declarations of independence for a period of three months. The document also resolved border control and customs inspection issues regarding Slovenia's borders, resolved [[air-traffic control]] responsibility and mandated an exchange of [[prisoners of war]]. The Brioni Agreement also formed the basis for an [[European Community Monitor Mission|observer mission]] to monitor implementation of the agreement in Slovenia. Eleven days after the agreement was made, the federal government pulled the JNA out of Slovenia. Conversely, the agreement made no mitigating impact on fighting in [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatia]].

==Background==
On 23 June 1991, as [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] prepared to declare their independence during the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the [[European Community]] (EC) foreign ministers decided the EC member states would not extend [[diplomatic recognition]] to the two states. The EC viewed the declarations as unilateral moves and offered assistance in negotiations regarding the future of the [[SFR Yugoslavia]] instead. At the same time, the EC decided to suspend direct talks with Slovenia and Croatia. The move was welcomed by the Yugoslav federal government.&lt;ref name=Ahrens42&gt;{{harvnb|Ahrens|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovenia and [[Independence of Croatia|Croatia declared independence]] on 25 June,&lt;ref name=OShea15/&gt; and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) units began to deploy from its bases in Slovenia the next day. On 27 June, armed conflict broke out as the JNA and the [[Slovenian Ground Force|Territorial Defence Force of Slovenia]] (TDS) began fighting over control of Slovenia's border posts, in what became the [[Ten-Day War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A three-strong EC delegation made three visits to the region in late June and early July to negotiate a political agreement which would facilitate further negotiations. The delegation consisted of the foreign ministers of Luxembourg, as the incumbent holder of the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EC presidency]], and Italy and the Netherlands, as the previous and future holders of that office.&lt;ref name=Ahrens42/&gt; The delegation members were [[Jacques Poos]] (Luxembourg), [[Gianni de Michelis]] (Italy), and [[Hans van den Broek]] (Netherlands). Prior to the delegation's arrival in [[Belgrade]], Poos told reporters that the EC would take charge of the crisis. There, the delegation was met by [[Serbia]]n president [[Slobodan Milošević]] who dismissed the prospect of Croatia leaving the Yugoslav federation because its population contained 600,000 [[Serb]]s.&lt;ref name=OShea15&gt;{{harvnb|O'Shea|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June, Croatia and Slovenia agreed to suspend their declarations of independence to allow time for a negotiated settlement. The EC delegation appeared to make progress when Serbia responded to the move by ceasing their opposition to the appointment of a Croatian member of the federal presidency, [[Stjepan Mesić]], as the body's chairman on 30 June. The appearance of a success was reinforced when the JNA ordered its troops posted in Slovenia to return to their barracks.&lt;ref name=OShea15/&gt; On 1 July, de Michelis was replaced by [[João de Deus Pinheiro]], the Portuguese foreign minister, to maintain the formula of current, former and future EC presidencies comprising the EC delegation as the Netherlands took over the presidency from Luxembourg, while Portugal was scheduled to assume the presidency after the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mesić|2004|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference at Brijuni==
[[File:Hans van den Broek.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hans van den Broek]] headed the EC delegation]]
A further result of the EC delegation's mission were talks attended by representatives of the EC, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia and the Yugoslav government. The talks were held at [[Brijuni]] Islands on 7 July.&lt;ref name=OShea15/&gt; Besides the EC delegation, headed by van den Broek,&lt;ref name=Stokes98&gt;{{harvnb|Stokes|2009|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; five out of eight members of the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|federal presidency]] attended the talks—Mesić, [[Bogić Bogićević]], [[Janez Drnovšek]], [[Branko Kostić]] and [[Vasil Tupurkovski]]. The [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federal prime minister]] [[Ante Marković]] was also present, as were the Yugoslav federal foreign minister [[Budimir Lončar]], interior minister [[Petar Gračanin]] and the deputy defence minister [[Vice Admiral]] [[Stane Brovet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mesić|2004|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia was represented by [[President of Croatia|President]] [[Franjo Tuđman]] while [[President of Slovenia|President]] [[Milan Kučan]] attended on behalf of Slovenia. Serbia was represented by [[Borisav Jović]], a former Serbian member of the federal presidency who had resigned from the position on 15 June, instead of Milošević who refused to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Valentić|2010|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at 8&amp;nbsp;am, the EC delegation held separate talks with Kučan and his assistants, then with Tuđman and his assistants, and finally with Jović. In the afternoon, a plenary meeting was held with the federal, Slovene and Croatian delegations in attendance, while Jović reportedly left dissatisfied with the talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mesić|2004|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement was prepared at the [[Council of the European Union|EC council of ministers]] in [[The Hague]] on 5 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mesić|2004|pp=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of a Joint Declaration, and two annexes detailing the creation of an environment suitable to further political negotiations and guidelines for an observer mission to Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UCDP|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement, which became known as the Brioni Declaration or the Brioni Agreement,&lt;ref name=Ahrens43/&gt; required the JNA and the TDS to return to their bases, and stipulated that Slovene officials were to control Slovenia's borders alone and that both Slovenia and Croatia were to suspend all activities stemming from their declarations of independence for three months.&lt;ref name=Sharp10&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The observer mission set out by the Brioni Agreement materialised as the [[European Community Monitor Mission]] (ECMM) tasked with monitoring the disengagement of the JNA and the TDS in Slovenia,&lt;ref name=Ahrens43&gt;{{harvnb|Ahrens|2007|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia.&lt;ref name=OShea16&gt;{{harvnb|O'Shea|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Even though little was agreed upon and the agreement was later interpreted differently by its signatories, the Brioni Agreement established the EC's interest in the region and the first EC Ministerial [[Conference on Yugoslavia]] was held in The Hague on 10 July.&lt;ref name=OShea16/&gt; The ECMM helped calm several standoffs around military barracks in Slovenia and facilitated negotiations between Slovene authorities and the JNA regarding the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia.&lt;ref name=Ahrens43/&gt; In Croatia, [[Croatian War of Independence|armed combat]] continued and the JNA shelled the city of [[Osijek]] the same evening the agreement was signed.&lt;ref name=OShea16/&gt; The federal presidency ordered the complete withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia on 18 July in response to Slovene actions in breach of the Brioni Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|1995|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ECMM's scope of work was expanded to include Croatia on 1 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miškulin|2010|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-September, the war had escalated as the [[Croatian National Guard]] and police [[Battle of the Barracks|blockaded the JNA barracks]] and the JNA embarked on a [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|campaign against Croatian forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brioni Agreement isolated Marković who tried to preserve the federation, but was ignored by van den Broek who appeared not to comprehend issues presented before him, and the EC delegation tacitly encouraged the dissolution of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=Stokes98/&gt; The agreement diminished the authority of part of the JNA's leadership who fought for the preservation of the Yugoslav federation.&lt;ref name=Woodward169&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|1995|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was also unfavourable for Croatia because it was left to defend against the JNA and Serb forces.&lt;ref name=Sharp10/&gt; By effectively removing Slovenia from influence of the federal authorities, especially the JNA, the agreement fulfilled one of the Serbian nationalists' goals, allowing the redrawing of international borders.&lt;ref name=Woodward169/&gt; [[Sabrina Ramet]] noted that Kučan and Milošević reached an agreement in January 1991 in which Milošević gave his assurances that Slovenia's independence bid would not be opposed by Serbia. In return, Kučan expressed his understanding for Milošević's interest to create a [[Greater Serbia]].&lt;ref name=Stokes98/&gt;

At the time, the EC viewed the agreement as a method of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libal|1997|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts had little to do with the situation on the ground.&lt;ref name=Stokes98/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15312">The '''Cardwell Reforms''' were a series of reforms of the [[British Army]] undertaken by [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell|Edward Cardwell]] between 1868 and 1874 with the support of Liberal prime minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. Gladstone paid little attention to military affairs but he was keen on efficiency. In 1870, he pushed through Parliament major changes in Army organisation. Germany's stunning triumph over France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] proved that the Prussian system of professional soldiers with up-to-date weapons was far superior to the traditional system of gentlemen-soldiers that Britain used.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ensor, ''England, 1870-1914'' (1936) pp. 7-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert V. Tucker, "Army and Society in England 1870-1900: A Reassessment of the Cardwell Reforms." ''Journal of British Studies'' 2#2 (1963): 110-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reforms were not radical; they had been brewing for years and Gladstone seized the moment to enact them. The goal was to centralise the power of the [[War Office]], abolish the [[Purchase of commissions in the British army|purchase of officers' commissions]], and create reserve forces stationed in Britain by establishing short terms of service for enlisted men.&lt;ref&gt;Albert V. Tucker, "Army and Society in England 1870-1900: A Reassessment of the Cardwell Reforms," ''Journal of British Studies'' (1963) 2#2 pp. 110-141 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/175254 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The starting point was a [[Royal Commission]] in 1858, established in the aftermath of the [[Crimean War]], under [[Jonathan Peel]], then Secretary of State for War. In addition to the obvious instances of incompetence and maladministration that had been revealed, it was evident that the provision of an army of only 25,000 in the Crimea had stripped Britain of almost every trained soldier. The lesson was reinforced by the [[Indian Mutiny]], which once again required almost the entire usable British Army to suppress.

The Commission reported in 1862, but few of its lessons were immediately implemented. The main obstacle had been objections by the defunct [[British East India Company]] and its executors, who wished to maintain their own military establishment, and by the "[[Die hard (phrase)|die-hards]]", senior officers who opposed almost any reform on principle. The arch-conservatives among the Army's officers were led by the [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]], [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]], who was [[Queen Victoria]]'s cousin, and:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... almost the last of the typically Hanoverian characters thrown up by the English ruling dynasty, and derived his ideas on drill and discipline from [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Butcher Cumberland]] and the Prussian school of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]." &lt;ref&gt;McElwee, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 2 August 1870, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] voted for 20,000 additional men for the army and two million pounds on a vote of credit. This was followed by one of the most successful military pamphlets to appear in all Victorian England,&lt;ref&gt;Ensor (1936), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''[[The Battle of Dorking]]''. Written by Colonel (later General) Sir [[George Tomkyns Chesney|George Chesney]], head of the [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Indian Civil Engineering College]], it raised the idea that, despite the acts of Parliament during the previous year in regard to the military, Britain faced the possibility of a German invasion.

Edward Cardwell, protégé of Gladstone and Secretary of State for War since 1868, was determined not merely to update the British military but to reform it as well. Both were to be an uphill battle, but the need was great. Even the hard lessons of the Crimea had been dismissed, ignored or forgotten by this time, leaving critical needs unmet.

As [[R. C. K. Ensor]] wrote about that era:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If...[no] criticism had made headway, it was that England had no notion of the art of war. British officers were expected to be gentlemen and sportsmen; but outside the barrack-yard they were...'entirely wanting in military knowledge'. The lack of it was deemed no drawback, since Marlborough's and Wellington's officers got along without it. Only the rise of the Prussian military...availed to shake this complacency." &lt;ref&gt;Ensor (1936), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==First reforms==
Cardwell set about with three initial reforms:
*In 1868, he abolished [[flogging]] and other harsh disciplinary measures in the Army during peace time. This action was opposed by nearly every senior officer, who used the opinions of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|The Duke of Wellington]] to validate their objections. Yet, it was imperative to attract good quality recruits by ensuring the private soldier's life was better than a kind of penal servitude. Flogging was retained as a punishment on active service, on the pretext that extraordinary powers of punishment might be required in the field, until finally abolished in 1880.
*In 1869, troops were withdrawn from self-governing [[colonies]], which were encouraged to raise their own local forces. This scattering of troops over far-flung colonies was likewise a Wellingtonian policy. Its initial motives had been to avoid the traditional British suspicion of a standing army (led by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Whigs]]). The policy was a failure on economic practicality, and also prevented training at any level above that of battalion. By 1871, 26,000 British troops had been withdrawn from overseas territories and returned to [[Great Britain]].
*1870 saw the abolition of [[Bounty (reward)#Recruitment|bounty money]] for recruits, and the setting out of guidelines for the swift discharge of known bad characters from both the army and the navy.

==Army Enlistment Act==
As his first major legislative step towards military reform, Cardwell introduced the [[Army Enlistment (Short Service) Act 1870]],&lt;ref&gt;Ensor (1936), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; which reached the floor of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in late spring, 1870.

From the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] until 1847, men were enlisted for twenty-one years, practically for life (the seven year short service option available during the wars ended when the wars did). Together with the continued existence of flogging, it had given the army its character of a near prison. A shortfall in Army numbers had resulted in the [[Time of Service in the Army Act 1847]], under which enlistment was for ten years, later increased to twelve; but this was still too long. On completion of their enlistment, soldiers had the choice between accepting discharge without pension or signing on for a further ten- or twelve-year term. If they chose the latter, they would be rewarded with two months furlough, another enlistment bounty, and a pension on completion of their term. After many years with no trade other than that of soldiering, more than half of all discharged soldiers chose to re-enlist immediately. Of those who took a voluntary discharge, fully one in five signed on again within six months.

The Army's existing system of enlistment therefore produced an army of experienced or even veteran soldiers, but no class of reserves that could be recalled to serve in case of a national emergency. The lesson of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] was the absolute necessity of a trustworthy [[army reserve]] of well trained men in good health and vigour. Almost every British soldier served more than half his enlistment abroad, most often in [[tropical]] climates, such as [[India]]. After returning to Britain, their physique was seldom good.

Cardwell therefore brought before Parliament the idea of "short service". The Act of 1870 allowed a soldier to choose to spend time in the reserves rather than the regulars and be paid fourpence a day, in return for a short period of training each year and an obligation to serve when called up. Men now enlisted for a maximum term of twelve years. The minimum length of actual service required varied according to branch: seven years for infantry, eight years for line cavalry and artillery, twelve years for the Household Cavalry, three years for the Army Service Corps.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodward, page 116, "Armies of the World 1854-1914", SBN: 399-12252-4, G. P. Putman's Sons New York 1978&lt;/ref&gt; On discharge, a soldier in any corps would now remain with the reserves for the remainder of his twelve-year term.

There was opposition to short-term enlistment both in Parliament and among the Army's senior officers. The Queen is said to have signed the Act into Law "most reluctantly",&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; but the system worked, producing an immediate increase in the army's strength.

==Localisation scheme==
Cardwell then passed the comprehensive [[Regulation of the Forces Act 1871]]. Previously, soldiers had enlisted for General Service, and were liable to be drafted into any regiment regardless of their own preferences, another factor that had made service harsh and unpopular. It had been recognised as early as 1829 by [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...there is a great disinclination on the part of the lower orders to enlist for general service; they like to know that they are to be in a certain regiment, connected, perhaps, with their own county, and their own friends, and with officers who have established a connection with that district. There is a preference frequently on the part of the people for one regiment as opposed to another, and I should think there would be found a great disinclination in men to enlist for general service, and to be liable to be drafted and sent to any corps or station."&lt;ref&gt;McElwee, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, the Army had insisted for years that it could be administered only on the basis of General Service.

Under Cardwell's localisation scheme, the country was divided into 66 Brigade Districts (later renamed Regimental Districts), based on county boundaries and population density. All line infantry [[regiment]]s would now consist of two [[battalion]]s, sharing a [[Regimental depot|depot]] and associated [[Military recruitment|recruiting]] area. One battalion would serve overseas, while the other was stationed at home for training. The [[militia]] of that area then (usually) became the third battalion. There were limitations to the extent that localisation could be implemented. Certain recruiting regions (for example London and much of Ireland) offered more recruits than could be absorbed by the linked regiment. Equally, thinly populated rural areas in some English counties or the Scottish Highlands could not always provide the numbers needed.

The senior twenty-five regiments of the line already consisted of two battalions, but almost all the higher-numbered regiments had only one battalion. Many regiments were linked to produce two-battalion regiments, a complicated internal process involving much debate over regimental traditions and seniority, which was not finally completed until the ensuing [[Childers Reforms]].

==Other reforms==
In addition to his two major pieces of legislation, Cardwell also introduced a number of reforms through [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] or other [[Statutory Instrument]]s.

*An Order of 1871 abolished some little-used disciplinary practices such as branding;
*The [[sale of commissions]] was abolished, as were the [[subaltern (rank)|subaltern]] ranks of cavalry [[Cornet (military rank)|Cornet]] and infantry [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]], replaced with [[Second Lieutenant]]. (In practice, the style "Cornet" is still used for Second Lieutenants in the [[Blues and Royals]] and the [[Queen's Royal Hussars]], and the term "Ensign" is still used by the [[Foot Guards]] regiments, for instance during the ceremony of [[Trooping the Colour]].)
*Units were placed on the same establishment whether serving at home or overseas. (To an extent, this was made possible by steamship transport and the [[Suez Canal]].) Units serving overseas had previously had a larger establishment, to provide for losses to disease or climate, which would be hard to replace, but this left the units at home chronically undermanned as they were stripped of soldiers to bring units departing overseas up to their authorised strength. With the separate establishments removed, the home units could now be used to form an effective [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]].

Cardwell also reformed the administration of the [[War Office]], preventing infighting and bickering between the various departments and abolishing the separate administration of the Reserves and Volunteers. The defence policy of Canada, Australia and New Zealand was devolved to those dominions, and several small garrisons were replaced by locally raised units.

These reforms started to turn British forces into an effective Imperial force. A change of government put Cardwell out of office in 1874, but his reforms stayed in place despite attempts from the Regular Army to abolish them and return to the comfortable and familiar old post-1815 situation.

==Further reforms of the British Army==
*[[Childers reforms|Further reforms]] were undertaken by Secretary of State for War [[Hugh Childers]] in 1881.
*The [[Haldane Reforms]] were made in 1906–1912.

'''Corruption in Jordan''' is a social and economic issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=The World Economic Forum|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordan Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/jordan/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamics ==
Societal interests in [[Jordan]] are generally not channelled through political parties, but through informal networks. [[In-group favoritism|Favouritism]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]] and [[bribery]], as is the use of influence or personal and business connections to gain favours, such as jobs or access to goods and services, are covered by a particular phenomenon known as [[wasta]], the middleman.&lt;ref name=BACP&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordan Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/jordan/show-all.aspx|publisher=[[Business Anti-Corruption Portal]]|accessdate= 14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 59th least corrupt out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been corruption cases involved high-level business and political officials with connections to the [[Hashemites|royal family]].&lt;ref name=BACP/&gt; A business survey, the [[World Economic Forum]]'s [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014, reports that corruption is considered one of the obstacles for doing business in Jordan by business executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=The World Economic Forum|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''counter-protest''' (also spelled '''counterprotest''') is a [[protest]] action which takes place within the proximity of an ideologically opposite protest. The purposes of counter-protests can range from merely voicing opposition to the objective of the other protest to actively drawing attention from nearby media outlets away from the other protest toward the counter-protestors' cause to actively seeking to disrupt the other protest by [[Group conflict|conflict]] of a non-violent or violent nature.

In many countries where protests by various pressure groups are allowed, the nearby law enforcement installation may make it a priority to keep rival protestors as far from each other as to avoid possible physical contact, and legal contention often arises over whether the rival groups possess permits to gather and rally within short distance of each other. Often, rallies can be infiltrated by rival protestors for purposes ranging from distraction, disruption to merely asking critical questions of the leaders of the rally or providing humorous or mocking diversions; the reactions of protestors to counter-protestors within close proximity can often be violent and confrontational.

In some countries, governments can even sponsor counter-protesters who rally against opposition figures and members.

==By country==
===Cuba===
In [[Cuba]], the various state-run organizations can organize violent pro-government rallies known as "mitines de repudio" (repudiation meetings, often sponsored by the [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution|CDR]]) against groups such as [[Ladies in White]] and help in loading the opposition members into police buses directed to a nearby jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2008/0422/p01s07-woam.html ''Cuba arrests Ladies in White''], [[Christian Science Monitor]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Since World War II, protests by allegedly fascist, racist or counter-religious organizations have often been met by anti-racist or anti-fascist groups, many of which are aligned with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Counter-protest activity has been ramped up against anti-Islamist or anti-Muslim organizations since the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States.

===United States===
====Counter-antiwar protests====
Since the announcement of the impending invasion on Iraq in 2003, anti-war protests were met with counter-protests by pro-war and socially-conservative groups such as [[Protest Warrior]].

====Counter-healthcare reform protests====
After [[Barack Obama]] launched an initiative for healthcare reform, protests against government and Congress members by [[Tea Party protests|Tea Party members]] at townhall meetings were met with counter-protests by progressive/liberal activists and pro-labor unionists.

====Counter-protests against the Westboro Baptist Church====
The [[Westboro Baptist Church]], which achieved notoriety for protesting homosexuality at various locations and events at which they were not invited, have been met with various counter-protests, including participation from high school and college students when the church members arrived to protest at their campuses.

A '''development director''' or '''director of development''' is the senior fundraising manager of a [[non-profit organization]], [[company (law)|company]], or [[corporation]]. The position works closely with a [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[treasurer]]. A Director of Development is chiefly responsible for bringing in revenue streams to a non-profit (grants, donations, special events), and a CFO is responsible for the fiscal management of the organization. A CFO is rarely assigned to write grant narratives, but may oversee the budget section of a grant application or a fiscal report for a grant. Some larger organizations (especially those that have large government grants) have a grants manager as well as a grant writer/Director of Development.  A Grants Manager assists the CFO with grant reports and/or grant related accounting. A development director is usually [[Remuneration|remunerated]] for his or her work,&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2008-08-23 
|work=Tony Poderis
|publisher=Non-profit fundraising Resource}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and in best practices for [[nonprofit organization]]s, development directors earn salaries.  Commissions are still considered unethical by professional organizations such as the Grant Professionals Association (GPA) and the [[Association of Fundraising Professionals]] (AFP), but the practice of commission based remuneration is growing, particularly in the current economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grantprofessionals.org/ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of a development director is to develop and implement a strategic plan to raise vital funds for their organization in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.The development director's primary responsibility, however, is to oversee fundraising, rather than to actually raise money. This person may write grants, research foundations and corporations, and oversee or implement other fundraising strategies, but she or he works mostly behind the scenes, establishing a structure for effective fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The development director may also be responsible for additional financial responsibilities, including developing business plans or strategic plans in collaboration with the board for the future of the organization. The development director is usually accountable to the [[Executive Director]], [[Chief Operating Officer]], or CFO. The board often offers suggestions and ideas about how to increase the fundraising, including contacts, and the development director chooses how to implement these ideas to maximize inflow while keeping outflow at a minimum and keeping donors happy. A strong board often has a development/fundraising committee, makes personal donations to the non-profit, and assists with annual campaigns.

The development director has an outreach role in the organization and often fulfills a [[public relations|public affairs]] role in addition to office-based work. Development directors motivate and satisfy donors, board members, staff and even the press. Many Directors of Development assist with communications such a non-profits annual report, development and communications section of website, newsletters, and donor databases.

The structure of a Development Department varies greatly. A Director of Development may or may not have staff reporting to him/her, depending on the size of the organization. Some large non-profits have a development team including a Grant Writer, donor database specialist, Grants Manager, Special Events Coordinator, Communications staff, and Planning Giving staff. In some cases, an Executive Director serves as the lead grant writer of an organization. Some non-profits hire development staff on a part-time or consultant basis, instead of full-time.

Median pay for Development Directors in the U.S. is in the neighborhood of $62,000 annually. Total cash compensation ranges from $40,000 to $100,000; the final number includes potential for approximately $10,000 each from bonuses and profit sharing in exceptional cases. While geography and years of experience impact pay for this group, the organization is the most influential factor. Earnings for this group are mostly affected by the particular organization, followed by the particular city and tenure.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=Payscale Human Resource}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

As the title suggests, the development director is concerned with the growth of the organization. This includes staff, membership, budget, company assets, and all other company resources, to help make the best use of them and maximize the organization's profitability and profile.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Dhimmitude''' —derived from the Arabic ''dhimmi'', which refers to the status of non-Muslim subjects in an Islamic polity— is a [[neologism]] borrowed from the [[French language]] and popularized as a polemical term by the Swiss-Israeli writer [[Bat Ye'or]] in the 1980s and 1990s. 

Bat Ye’or defines it as a permanent status of subjection without protection in which Jews and Christians have allegedly been held under Islamic rule since the eighth century, and that forces them to accept discriminations or "face forced conversion, slavery or death". The term gained traction among Serbian ultra-nationalists during the Balkan wars in the 1990s and is popular among self-proclaimed [[counter-jihad|counter-jihadi]] authors. Scholars though have dismissed it as polemical.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zia-Ebrahimi |first1=Reza |title=When the Elders of Zion relocated to Eurabia: conspiratorial racialization in antisemitism and Islamophobia |journal=Patterns of Prejudice |date=13 July 2018 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1080/0031322X.2018.1493876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed from [[dhimma]] by analogy with ''servitude'' in order to draw an implicit comparison.&lt;ref&gt;''Muslims, multiculturalism and the question of the silent majority'', S. Akbarzadeh, J.M. Roose, Journal of muslim minority affairs, 2011, Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The term was coined in 1982 by the [[President of Lebanon]], [[Bachir Gemayel]], in reference to perceived attempts by the country's Muslim leadership to subordinate the large [[Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanese Christian]] minority. In a speech of September 14, 1982 given at Dayr al-Salib in Lebanon, he said: "Lebanon is our homeland and will remain a homeland for Christians… We want to continue to christen, to celebrate our rites and traditions, our faith and our creed whenever we wish… Henceforth, we refuse to live in any dhimmitude!"&lt;ref&gt;As reprinted in ''Lebanon News'' 8, no. 18 (September 14, 1985), 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "dhimmitude" was introduced into Western discourse by the writer [[Bat Ye'or]] in a French-language article published in the Italian journal ''[[La Rassegna mensile di Israel]]'' in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or, "Terres arabes: terres de 'dhimmitude'", in ''La Cultura Sefardita'', vol. 1, ''La Rassegna mensile di Israel'' 44, no. 1-4, 3rd series (1983): 94-102&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bat Ye'or's use, "dhimmitude" refers to allegations of non-Muslims appeasing and surrendering to [[Muslim]]s and discrimination against non-Muslims in Muslim majority regions.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Sidney H., ''The Decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude, Seventh-Twentieth Century'', International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 30, No. 4. (Nov., 1998), pp. 619-621, {{doi|10.1017/S0020743800052831}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ye'or further popularized the term in her books ''[[The Decline of Eastern Christianity]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bat Ye'or |title=The Decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam. From Jihad to Dhimmitude. Seventh-Twentieth Century |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press/Associated University Presses |location=Madison/Teaneck, NJ |year=1996 |isbn=0-8386-3688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2003 followup ''[[Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bat Ye'or |title=Islam and Dhimmitude. Where Civilizations Collide |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press/Associated University Presses |location=Madison/Teaneck, NJ |year=2003 |isbn=0-8386-3943-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 interview, she claimed to have indirectly inspired Gemayel's use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;"I founded the word dhimmitude and I discussed it with my Lebanese friends [...] My friend spoke about this word to Bashir Gemayel who used it in his last speech before his assassination." in [http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm/frm/98500/sec_id/98500 An Egyptian Jew in Exile: An Interview with Bat Ye’or][http://www.dhimmitude.org/eurabia/An-egyptian-jew-in-exile.pdf], newenglishreview.org, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associations and usage==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Treason]] --&gt;
The associations of the word "dhimmitude" vary between users:
* Bat Ye'or defined dhimmitude as the condition and experience of those who are subject to ''dhimma'', and thus not synonymous to, but rather a subset of the ''dhimma'' phenomenon: "dhimmitude ... represents a behavior dictated by fear (terrorism), pacifism when aggressed, rather than resistance, servility because of cowardice and vulnerability. ... By their peaceful surrender to the Islamic army, they obtained the security for their life, belongings and religion, but they had to accept a condition of inferiority, spoliation and humiliation.  As they were forbidden to possess weapons and give testimony against a Muslim, they were put in a position of vulnerability and humility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rutherford.org/Oldspeak/Articles/Interviews/Bat-Yeor.html|title=John W. Whitehead, An interview with Bat Ye'or. Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis, 5 September 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term plays a key role in the Islamophobic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1177/0306396806066636 | title = You are now entering Eurabia | url=http://rac.sagepub.com/content/48/1/1.abstract|journal = Race &amp; Class | volume = 48 | pages = 1 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; conspiracy theory of [[Eurabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Færseth |first1=John |last2= |first2= |year=2011 |title= Eurabia – ekstremhøyres konspirasjonsteori|journal= Fri Tanke|volume= |issue=3-4 |pages=38 |publisher=Human-Etisk Forbund |doi= |url=http://fritanke.no/filarkiv/pdf/fri_tanke_0311.pdf#page=38 |accessdate=22 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A more recent [[pejorative]] usage variant of "dhimmi" and "dhimmitude" divorces the words from the historical context and applies them to situations where non-Muslims in the West and India are championing Islamic causes above others. "Dhimmi" is treated as analogous to "[[Quisling]]" within this context.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
*[[Sidney H. Griffith]] states that it "has come to express the theoretical, social condition" of non-Muslims "under Muslim rule".&lt;ref name="Griffith"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Church in the Shadow of the Mosque: Christians and Muslims in the World of Islam | publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Sidney H. Griffith | year=2010 | isbn=0691146284}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[Bassam Tibi]], ''dhimmitude'' refers to non-Muslims being "allowed to retain their religious beliefs under certain restrictions".  He describes that status as being inferior and a violation of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=41802396  | title=The Return of the Sacred to Politics as a Constitutional Law The Case of the Shari'atization of Politics in Islamic Civilization | author=Tibi, Bassam | journal=Theoria |date=April 2008 |pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Sidney H. Griffith]], a historian of early Eastern Christianity, dismissed Bat Ye'or's ''dhimmitude'' as "polemical" and "lacking in historical method", while [[Michael Sells]], a scholar of Islamic history and literature, describes the ''dhimmitude'' theory as nothing more than the "falsification" of history by an "ideologue".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Mark R. Cohen]], a leading scholar of the history of Jewish communities of medieval Islam, has criticized the term as misleading and Islamophobic.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Mark R.|authorlink=Mark R. Cohen|title=Muslim Attitudes to Jews and Israel: The Ambivalences of Rejection, Antagonism, Tolerance and Cooperation|year=2011|publisher=[[Sussex Academic Press]]|isbn=1845195272|pages=33–34|editor=Ma'oz, Moshe|chapter=Modern Myths of Muslim Anti-Semitism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Lewis]], Professor Emeritus of [[Middle East|Near Eastern Studies]] at [[Princeton University]], states,
{{quote|If we look at the considerable literature available about the position of Jews in the Islamic world, we find two well-established myths. One is the story of a golden age of equality, of mutual respect and cooperation, especially but not exclusively in Moorish Spain; the other is of “dhimmi”-tude, of subservience and persecution and ill treatment. Both are myths. Like many myths, both contain significant elements of truth, and the historic truth is in its usual place, somewhere in the middle between the extremes.&lt;ref name=bernard_lewis&gt;Bernard Lewis, [https://theamericanscholar.org/the-new-anti-semitism/ 'The New Anti-Semitism'], The American Scholar Journal - Volume 75 No. 1 Winter 2006 pp. 25-36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Fabian Window''' is a stained-glass window depicting the founders of the [[Fabian Society]],&lt;ref&gt; Press release, "A piece of Fabian history unveiled at LSE,"  London School of Economics &amp; Political Science Archives {{cite web |url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2006/FabianWindow.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201152425/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2006/FabianWindow.aspx |archivedate=2011-12-01 |df= }} Last accessed 17 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
designed by [[George Bernard Shaw]].  The window was stolen from [[Beatrice Webb House]] in Dorking in 1978 and reappeared at [[Sotheby's]] in 2005.  It was restored to display in the [[LSE Shaw Library|Shaw Library]] at the [[London School of Economics]] in 2006 at a ceremony presided over by then-Prime-Minister [[Tony Blair]], emphasising [[New Labour]]'s intellectual debt to the Fabians.&lt;ref&gt; Andrew Walker, "Wit, wisdom and windows", BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4944100.stm] Last accessed 23 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
The stained glass window was designed by [[George Bernard Shaw]] in 1910 as a commemoration of the Fabian Society, and shows fellow Society members [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Edward R. Pease]], among others, helping to build 'the new world'. Four Fabians, [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]], [[Graham Wallas]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]] founded the [[London School of Economics]] with the money left to the [[Fabian Society]] by Henry Hutchinson.  Supposedly the decision was made at a breakfast party on 4 August 1894. Artist [[Caroline Townshend]] (cousin of Shaw's wife [[Charlotte Payne-Townshend]] and daughter of Fabian and [[Suffragette]] [[Emily Townshend]]) created the Fabian window, according to Shaw's design in 1910. Also included in the window besides Shaw and Townshend themselves, were other prominent [[Fabians]] such as [[H. G. Wells]], [[Annie Besant]], [[Graham Wallas]], [[Hubert Bland]], [[E. Nesbit|Edith Nesbit]], [[Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier|Sydney Olivier]], [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Leonard Woolf]], and [[Emmeline Pankhurst]].

The window explicitly reflects the goal of the Fabian Society to portray an outward role contrary to its real character, i.e. to use deception in pursuing its ultimate aim. Specifically, a [[Wolf in Sheep's Clothing]] is the image which appears in the shield above the world being wrought in the Fabian mold. This biblical reference comes from the New Testament and a sermon by Jesus warning that false prophets come in sheep's clothing, but are actually ravening wolves. Authors such as G. Edward Griffin, in his book The Creature from Jekyll Island, have given voice to the reality that this shield image highlights the distinguishing feature of the Fabians as compared to the communists, in that the Fabians desire to create a socialist state using subversive tactics, as opposed to the communist method of revolution and violence. 

For whatever reason, Shaw never collected the window from her workshop. The belief is that it remained there until 1947, when Mrs Townsend's niece [[Eva Bourne]], also a stained glass artist, presented it to [[Beatrice Webb House]], [[Holmbury St Mary]], near [[Dorking]]. This was the year the house was formally opened by the [[Webb Memorial Trust]] as a conference and educational venue for the Labour party and the [[Fabian Society]], officially opened by [[Clement Attlee]], who also unveiled the Fabian Window at LSE, having been a former lecturer.

==Theft and recovery==
The window was subsequently stolen from the house in 1978 and surfaced in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], soon after but then disappeared again until it suddenly appeared for sale at [[Sotheby's]] in July 2005. The Webb Memorial Trust re-purchased it and have now loaned it to LSE to sit alongside the painting of LSE founders Sidney and Beatrice Webb by [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicholson]] in the School's Shaw Library.

==Comments==
===Tony Blair===
Tony Blair spoke about the remarkable way the Fabians influenced the Labour party, not just in its creation but also in its economic, political and intellectual development. 'Despite all the very obvious differences in policy and attitude and positioning... a lot of the values that the Fabians and George Bernard Shaw stood for would be very recognisable, at least I hope they would, in today's Labour party. One of the things I think they were best at was being utterly iconoclastic about the traditional thinking that governed our country and indeed constantly, whenever a piece of conventional wisdom came out, they questioned that conventional wisdom in its fundamentals, and did so with remarkable success.'&lt;ref&gt;Press release, "A piece of Fabian history unveiled at LSE,"  London School of Economics &amp; Political Science Archives {{cite web |url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2006/FabianWindow.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201152425/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2006/FabianWindow.aspx |archivedate=2011-12-01 |df= }} Last accessed 17 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
===Howard Davies===
Director of LSE [[Howard Davies (economist)|Howard Davies]] said: 'It is a great honour for the School to have this piece of national heritage on campus. The window will be a visible reminder to students, staff and visitors of the School's historical links with Shaw, the Webbs and other Fabians, whose ideas continue to influence our thinking about society, economics and politics.' &lt;ref&gt;Press release, "A piece of Fabian history unveiled at LSE,"  London School of Economics &amp; Political Science Archives {{cite web |url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2006/FabianWindow.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201152425/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2006/FabianWindow.aspx |archivedate=2011-12-01 |df= }} Last accessed 17 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frictional unemployment''' is the [[unemployment]] that results from time spent between jobs when a worker is [[search theory|searching]] for, or transitioning from one job to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/labor/cwri/help/terms.html|title=Glossary of Terms|website=www.maine.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called '''search unemployment''' and can be  based on the circumstances of the individual.

A person may be looking for job change for better opportunity, services, higher salary and wages etc. It is also that there may be conflict between employer and employees over the inadequate facilities and undersatisfaction leading to voluntary quit from the job. Strikes by trade union or worker is also an example.

==Definitions==
[[Image:US_beveridge_2004_through_fall_2010.gif|thumb|Beveridge curve of vacancy rate and unemployment rate data from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics]]Frictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are [[Heterogeneous agents|heterogeneous]], and a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and demand. Such a mismatch can be related to skills, payment, worktime, location, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other factors. New entrants (such as graduating students) and re-entrants (such as former homemakers) can also suffer a spell of frictional unemployment. Workers as well as employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually not right away; they will invest some time and effort to find a match. This is in fact beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources. However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy suffers, since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment.

Frictional unemployment is related to and compatible with the concept of [[full employment]] because both suggest reasons why full employment is never reached. 

The frictions in the [[labor market]] are sometimes illustrated graphically with a [[Beveridge curve]], a downward-sloping, convex curve that shows a fixed relationship between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other. Changes in the supply of or demand for labor cause movements along this curve. An increase in labor market frictions will shift the curve outwards, and vice versa. A longer term form of frictional unemployment is [[structural unemployment]] which is very similar.

==Examples==
One kind of frictional unemployment is called '''wait unemployment''': it refers to the effects of the existence of some sectors where employed workers are paid more than the [[market clearing|market-clearing]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] wage. Not only does this restrict the amount of employment in the high-wage sector, but it attracts workers from other sectors who ''wait'' to try to get jobs there. The main problem with this theory is that such workers will likely "wait" while having jobs, so that they are not counted as unemployed. In Hollywood, for example, those who are waiting for acting jobs also wait on tables in restaurants for pay (while acting in "Equity Waiver" plays at night for no pay). However, these workers might be seen as [[underemployment|underemployed]] (definition 1).

==Theories==
{{Main|Search theory|Matching theory (macroeconomics)}}

==Solutions==
Policies to reduce frictional unemployment include:
* educational advice;
* information on available jobs and workers;
* combating [[prejudice]] (against certain workers, jobs or locations);
* incentives and regulations (e.g. when the frictionally unemployed receive benefits);
* relocation of industries and services;
* facilities to increase availability and flexibility (e.g. [[daycare center]]s);
* aid or grants to overcome a specific obstacle (e.g. if a handicapped worker is employed);
* reduction of the gap between gross and net wages (e.g. by taxing consumption instead).
* When handing out work permits (to foreigners), i.e. must stay with that company at the same work place address as state on the work permit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3873">'''Gobryas''' ({{lang-grc|Γοβρύας}}; {{lang-peo|𐎥𐎢𐎲𐎽𐎢𐎺}} g-u-b-ru-u-v, reads as ''Gaub(a)ruva''?;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gaubaruva-&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elamite]]: ''Kambarma'') was a common name of several Persian noblemen.

== Gobryas (Cyrus the Great's general)==
This Gobryas is mentioned in the [[Cyropedia]] of [[Xenophon]] as a general who helped in the conquering of [[Babylon]].

The A.K. Grayson translation of the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]] based on that of T.G. Pinches, considers both the names ''Ugbaru'' and ''Gubaru'' found in the latter to be references to this Gobryas. However the names are distinct in the text and refer to two different individuals, the one called ''Gubaru'' being the ruler placed over Babylon thus corresponding to [[Cyaxares II|Cyaxares]] of the [[Cyropedia]] (and the [[Darius the Mede]] of the Bible) not Gobryas. ''Ugbaru'' remains a candidate for Gobryas being described as the ruler of the region of [[Gutium]] dying soon after the conquest of Babylon similarly to Xenophon's portrayal of Gobryas as an elderly "Assyrian" ruler.
According to William H. Shea Ugbaru and Gubaru is the same person, being the ruler placed over Babylon, dying soon after the conquest of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;The Search for Darius the Mede; Journal of the Adventist Theological Society, 12/1 (Spring 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gobryas (the helper of Darius the Great)==
This Gobryas was one of the six helpers of Darius in killing [[Smerdis of Persia|Gaumāta]] in September 522 mentioned by [[Herodotus]]. He was appointed as Darius' lance carrier (arštibara). He is represented on the [[Behistun inscription]] and on Darius' tomb in [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], as &lt;blockquote&gt;''Gobryas from [[Pâtišuvariš]], the lance carrier of king Darius.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pâtišuvariš may be the mountainous region north of [[Alborz]] in northern Iran, probably [[Mazandaran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2666 |publisher=Encyclopaediaislamica.com |title=Pâtišuvariš |language=Persian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104175651/http://encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2666 |archivedate=2010-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ITshomal.com |url=http://www.mazandnume.com/?PNID=V679 |title=پتشخوارگر |publisher=Mazandnume.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 521, he was sent to [[Elam]] to defeat the rebel king [[Full translation of the Behistun Inscription#A new rebellion on Elam (Autumn 521)|Atamaita]]; after this, he served as [[satrap]] of Elam.

Gobryas' family was closely entwined with the family of [[Darius I|Darius the Great]]. Gobryas married the sister of Darius, known variously as Artazostre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kellens |first=J |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v2f6/v2f6a022.html |title=Artazostra |publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Radušdukda. [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], their son, married Darius' daughter [[Artazostre]]. A daughter of Gobryas, from an earlier marriage, was married to Darius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/gi-gr/gobryas/gobryas_2.html |title=Gobryas |publisher=Livius.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gun laws by country}}
'''Gun legislation in Canada''' is largely about licensing and registration of firearms (including [[air guns]] and with a muzzle velocity of 500 or more feet per second and 4.2 foot-pounds of energy&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/air_gun-arme_air-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Handgun]] registration became law in 1934, and [[automatic firearm]]s registration was added in 1951. In 1969, laws classified firearms as "non-restricted", "restricted" and "prohibited". Starting in 1979, individuals who wished to acquire firearms were required to obtain a firearms acquisition certificate (FAC) from their local police agency. From 1995 to 2012, all firearms owners were required to possess a firearms licence (either a PAL, POL, FAC or a minors licence) and all firearms were required to be registered. In April 2012, the requirement to register non-restricted firearms was dropped in every province and territory, except for [[Quebec]]; the requirement for all firearms owners to possess a valid firearms licence remains law.&lt;ref name="Carter2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregg Lee Carter|title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law, 2nd Edition &amp;#91;3 volumes&amp;#93;: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeGJH48PT0kC&amp;pg=PT250|year= 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-38671-8|pages=250–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled against Quebec, entirely eliminating non-restricted registry records.  However, the government of Quebec received a partial copy of the deleted federal firearms registry, and passed Bill 64 to create a Quebec firearms registry.&lt;ref&gt;https://siaf.gouv.qc.ca/accueil.html?L=1&lt;/ref&gt;  Residents have until January 2019 to register all non-restricted firearms within Quebec.

==History of firearm laws in Canada==
Controls on civilian use of firearms date from the early days of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], when [[justices of the peace]] could impose penalties for carrying a [[handgun]] without reasonable cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/pol-leg/pdf/histo_e.pdf|format=PDF|title=History of Firearms Control in Canada: Up to and Including the Firearms Act|accessdate=2011-03-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706182135/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/pol-leg/pdf/histo_e.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments to the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] between the 1890s and the 1970s introduced a series of minor controls on firearms. In the late 1970s, controls of intermediate strength were introduced. In the mid-1990s, significant increases in controls occurred. A 1996 study showed that Canada was in the mid-range of firearm ownership when compared with eight other [[Western world|western nations]]. Nearly 22% of Canadian households had at least one firearm, including 2.3% of households possessing a handgun.&lt;ref&gt;In a study of gun ownership in selected nations, Canada's level of gun ownership (21.8%) was similar to France's (23.8%) and Sweden's (16.6%). Of the eight countries compared, firearm ownership was highest in the United States (48.6%) and lowest in the Netherlands (2%).[http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/jus/J3-8-1997-3-eng.pdf "Firearms in Canada and Eight Other Western Countries: Selected Findings of the 1996 International Crime (Victim) Survey"], Canada Firearms Centre. Accessed: 2014-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2010, the Canadian Firearms Program recorded a total of 1,831,327 valid firearm licences, which is roughly 5.4% of the Canadian population. The four most licensed provinces are [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/facts-faits/index-eng.htm |title=Facts and Figures |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2011-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104165438/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/facts-faits/index-eng.htm |archivedate=2011-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 almost 3% of households in Canada possessed handguns, compared to 18% of U.S. households that possessed handguns.&lt;ref name=icvs&gt;[http://english.wodc.nl/images/ob257_full%20text_tcm45-103353.pdf Criminal Victimisation in International Perspective], by the [[International Crime Victims Survey]]. See Table 18 on page 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 almost 16% of households in Canada possessed firearms of some kind.&lt;ref name=icvs/&gt;

The following is a summary of the history of [[gun control]] laws in Canada:&lt;ref name="hist-firearms"&gt;[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/pol-leg/hist/con-eng.htm  "History of Firearms Control in Canada: Up to and Including the ''Firearms Act''"] Canadian Firearms Centre. Accessed: June 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statscan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/85-002-XIE/0090185-002-XIE.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001194231/http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/85-002-XIE/0090185-002-XIE.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-01 |title=Untitled-4 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The federal Parliament instituted a system of gun control in the North-West Territories in 1885 to hinder the [[Northwest Rebellion]]. Permission in writing from the territorial government was needed to possess any firearm (other than a smooth-bore shotgun), and also ammunition. Possession of a firearm or ammunition without the necessary permit was an offence, and could lead to the forfeiture of the firearm and ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/NWT.pdf The North-West Territories Act]'', R.S.C. 1886, c. 50, s. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  These gun control provisions applied to all of what is now Alberta, Saskatchewan, parts of Manitoba, the current Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.
*The Criminal Code, enacted in 1892, required individuals to have a permit to carry a pistol unless the owner had cause to fear assault or injury. Not until 1935 was it considered an offence to sell a pistol to anyone under 16. Vendors who sold handguns had to keep records, including purchaser's name, the date of sale and a description of the gun.
*In the 1920s, permits became necessary for all firearms newly acquired by foreigners.
*Legislation in 1934 required the registration of handguns with records identifying the owner, the owner's address and the firearm. Registration certificates were issued and records kept by the Commissioner of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) or by other police forces designated by provincial attorneys general.
*In 1947, the offence of "constructive murder" was added to the Criminal Code for offences resulting in death, when the offender carried a firearm. This offence was struck down as unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in a 1987 case called [[R. v. Vaillancourt]].
*Automatic firearms were added to the category of [[firearms]] that had to be registered in 1951. The registry system was centralized under the Commissioner of the RCMP.
*In 1969, [[Bill C-150]] created categories of "non-restricted", "restricted" and "prohibited" firearms. Police were also given preventive powers of search and seizure by judicial warrant if they had grounds to believe that firearms that belonged to an individual endangered the safety of society.
*In 1977, Bill C-51 required firearms acquisition certificates (FACs) to purchase any firearm, and introduced controls on the selling of [[ammunition]]. Applicants were required to pass a basic criminal record check before receiving the FAC.
*In 1991, Bill C-17 was introduced, coming into force between 1992 and 1994. It required FAC applicants to pass a safety course in addition to a thorough background check, and to wait a minimum of 28 days after applying before an FAC could be issued. It also created new Criminal Code offences, new definitions for prohibited and restricted weapons, and new regulations for firearms dealers. It increased penalties for firearm-related crimes. It clearly outlined regulations for firearms storage, handling and transportation.&lt;ref name=RCMP-C17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/pol-leg/hist/con-eng.htm |title=History of Firearms Control in Canada: Up to and Including the Firearms Act |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012-06-09 |website=rcmp-grc.gc.ca |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt;

A major focus of C-17 was the control of military and paramilitary firearms. It created orders prohibiting or restricting most paramilitary rifles and some types of non-sporting ammunition. It prohibited firearms that had been converted to avoid a 1978 prohibition (exempting existing owners), and it prohibited high-capacity magazines for automatic and semi-automatic firearms.&lt;ref name=RCMP-C17 /&gt; (It limited [[handguns]] to ten rounds and most semi-automatic centre-fire rifles to five rounds.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/bulletins/bus-ent/20110323-72-eng.htm |title=Facts and Figures |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2015-05-11 |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1995, the Criminal Code was amended to include Bill C-68, the [[Firearms Act, 1995|Firearms Act]]. It implemented a new central licensing system to replace the FAC system. It also required registration of all firearms and firearm licence holders; banned short-barrelled and small-calibre handguns ("grandfathering" in previous owners); and required a licence to buy ammunition. Most of the bill's provisions came into force in 1998, and the registration of long guns became mandatory in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ccja-acjp.ca/en/c19en.html |title=Bill C-19 - An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Firearms Act |author= |date=February 2012 |website=ccja-acjp.ca |publisher=Canadian Criminal Justice Association |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140307195923/https://www.ccja-acjp.ca/en/c19en.html |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt;

Legislation was upheld by the Supreme Court in [[Reference re Firearms Act]] (2000). The FAC system was replaced with possession-only licences (POLs) and [[possession and acquisition licence]]s (PALs). Referring to Bill C-68, John Dixon, a former advisor to Deputy Minister of Justice John C. Tait, stated that the Firearms Act was part of a policy exercise by the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] so as to appear to be "tougher" on guns than Prime Minister [[Kim Campbell]], and thus defeat her in the 1993 election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowe.ca/Rick/FirearmsLegislation/AGangThatCouldn'tShootStraight.html "A Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight''"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2001, the registration portion of Bill C-68 was implemented. The government asked for all firearms, including long guns (rifles and shotguns), to be registered.
*In 2003, the registration of long guns became mandatory. Failure to register a firearm now results in criminal charges.
*In 2006, although legislation was still in place, the government no longer asked [[long gun]] owners for a registration fee and an amnesty (until May 16, 2011) temporarily protected licensed owners of non-restricted firearms (or those whose licences had expired since January 1, 2004) from prosecution for the possession of unregistered long guns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060517.wguns0517/BNStory/National/home "Tories give long guns a break"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215100316/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060517.wguns0517/BNStory/National/home |date=2009-02-15 }}, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', May 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*In November 2009, Bill C-391 passed second reading in the House of Commons by a vote of 164 to 137. If passed through the entire parliamentary process by the House and Senate, the bill would have abolished the requirement to register non-restricted long guns. While the proposed legislation was a [[private member's bill]], it had the support of the Conservative government. The bill was referred to the House of Commons Committee on Public Safety for further action. However, after several months of hearings, the Opposition majority on the committee recommended that no further action be taken to advance the bill. In September 2010 Bill C-391 failed to pass a third reading.
*On October 25, 2011, Public Safety Minister [[Vic Toews]] introduced a bill to amend the Criminal Code and the Firearms Act, to abolish the long gun registry and destroy all records.
*On February 15, 2012, Bill C-19 passed third reading in the House of Commons; the motion to abolish the long gun registry passed 159 to 130 and Bill C-19 became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bill C-19 is law – Canada’s Long Gun Registration Ends | url=https://nfa.ca/news/bill-c-19-law-%E2%80%93-canada%E2%80%99s-long-gun-registration-ends | date=April 5, 2012 | publisher=[[National Firearms Association]] | accessdate=December 17, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220205102/https://nfa.ca/news/bill-c-19-law-%E2%80%93-canada%E2%80%99s-long-gun-registration-ends | archive-date=December 20, 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bill C-19 (Historical) | url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-1/C-19/ | publisher=''openparliament.ca/'' | accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In October 2014, Public Safety Minister Stephen Blaney and the Conservatives introduced another bill, Bill C-42, also known as the Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act. This legislation reduced required paperwork for the transportation of restricted firearms, held by licensed firearms owners, for certain lawful activities (such as transportation to a shooting range and to gunsmiths or gun shows).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/notice-avis-2015-09-eng.htm#a2]&lt;/ref&gt; It lifted the ban on the [[Swiss Arms Classic Green Carbine]], introduced a six-month "grace period" for firearms licence renewals before an individual might otherwise face criminal charges and abolished the possession-only licence, permitting holders of such licences to enjoy the same full acquisition privileges as a PAL holders. The legislation also implemented mandatory training for all first-time firearms licence applicants. This legislation was passed and enacted in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-2/C-42/|title=Bill C-42 (Historical)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ammoland.com/2015/06/common-sense-firearms-licensing-act/#axzz3zzCnE9K4|title=The 'Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act' Is Now The Law Of The Land In Canada|work=AmmoLand.com Shooting Sports News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ammoland.com/2015/08/harper-government-new-provisions-of-common-sense-gun-licensing-act-coming-to-force/#axzz3zzCnE9K4|title=Harper Government: New Provisions Of Common Sense Gun Licensing Act Coming To Force|work=AmmoLand.com Shooting Sports News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=989079 |title=Archived - The Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act receives Royal Assent - Canada News Centre |publisher=News.gc.ca |date=2015-06-18 |accessdate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the new Liberal government, formed in November 2015, pledged to reverse some of its provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/firearms-groups-apoplectic-after-liberals-promise-new-gun-control-measures|title=Firearms groups apoplectic after Liberals promise new gun control measures|author=Graeme Hamilton|date=7 October 2015|work=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing of firearms owners==
{{Main|Possession and Acquisition Licence}}
[[Image:POL Canada.gif|right|260px|A sample of possession-only licence]]
All licensing and registration is managed by the RCMP's Canadian Firearms Program (CFP), under the Deputy Commissioner Policing Support Services (PSS). In the Canadian system, there are three classes of firearms and firearm licences: non-restricted, restricted and prohibited. Prohibited firearms are not forbidden outright, as the name might imply, but their legal possession and acquisition are dependent upon their registration history and an individual's firearm licence.&lt;ref name=RCMP-Prohibited&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/prohibited-prohibe-eng.htm |title=Prohibited Firearms - Royal Canadian Mounted Police |date=2013-12-03 |website=rcmp-grc.gc.ca |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 1, 1998, the prohibited clause must be grandfathered to acquire or possess prohibited firearms. New prohibited licences are available only at the discretion of the Chief Firearms Officer of the province or the RCMP{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}. See [[#Classification of firearms|Classification of firearms]] below for complete details on prohibited, restricted and non-restricted firearms.

'''Individuals''' who wish to possess or acquire firearms in Canada must have a valid possession-acquisition, or possession-only, licence (PAL/POL); either of these licences allows the licensee to purchase ammunition. The PAL is distributed exclusively by the RCMP and is generally obtained in the following three steps:
# Safety training: To be eligible to receive a PAL, all applicants must successfully complete the Canadian Firearms Safety Course&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/safe_sur/cour-eng.htm |title=Canadian Firearms Safety Course |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2004-02-13 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CFSC) for a non-restricted licence, and the Canadian Restricted Firearms Safety Course&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/safe_sur/cour-res-eng.htm |title=Canadian Restricted Firearms Safety Course |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2004-02-05 |accessdate=2011-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105181345/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/safe_sur/cour-res-eng.htm |archivedate=2011-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CRFSC) for a restricted licence; the non-restricted class is a prerequisite to the restricted licence. Each province/territory's chief firearms officer publishes information on the locations and availability of these courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pub.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/safe_sur/cont-eng.htm |title=CFSC and CRFSC Contact Information |publisher=Pub.rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Applying for a licence: Currently only one type of licence is available to new applicants, the possession-acquisition licence (PAL). People can request a PAL by filling out Form CAFC&amp;nbsp;921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/num-nom/921-eng.htm |title=Form CAFC 921 |author= |date=October 5, 2011 |work= |publisher=RCMP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015071518/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/num-nom/921-eng.htm |archivedate=October 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Security screening: Background checks and reference interviews are performed. All applicants are screened, and a mandatory 28-day waiting period is imposed on first-time applicants, but final approval time may be longer.&lt;ref name="newsinreview.cbclearning.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinreview.cbclearning.ca/wp-content/archives/feb03/PDFs/guns.pdf|title=THE GUN LAW: PRO AND CON|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=May 12, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823054939/http://newsinreview.cbclearning.ca/wp-content/archives/feb03/PDFs/guns.pdf|archivedate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Licences are typically valid for five years and must be renewed prior to expiry to maintain all classes. Once licensed, an individual can apply for a firearm transfer;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/index-eng.htm#f4 |title=Forms |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an authorization to transport (ATT) for restricted firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/pdfs/679-eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Information Sheet: Application for an Authorization to Transport Restricted Firearms and Prohibited Firearms |website=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |accessdate=2016-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085603/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/pdfs/679-eng.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; People may hunt with firearms in Canada only with non-restricted firearms, and this requires an additional "Hunting with Firearms" course.

'''Businesses''', museums and organizations must have a valid firearms business licence to possess, manufacture or sell firearms, restricted or prohibited firearms, prohibited devices, or prohibited ammunition. A licence is not required to possess regular ammunition, but is required to manufacture or sell ammunition. A separate licence is required for each location where the business operates, and each business licence is valid only for the activities specified on the licence.

'''Registering firearms'''.
In order to be legally owned, a restricted or prohibited firearm must be registered in the Canadian Firearms Registry, which stores all data regarding firearms in Canada. To register a firearm into the system, a firearm must first be verified; its identification and classification being confirmed by an authorized verifier working with the RCMP. One must submit a registration application, which can be done online. If the firearm is being transferred from one owner to another the process can be done by telephone. Firearm registration certificates do not expire and do not need to be renewed. The Canadian Firearms Registry Online (CFRO) is accessible to police through CPIC.

Public Agents Firearms Regulations, which took effect on October 31, 2008, require public service agencies to report all firearms in their possession. Agency firearms are those used by employees (i.e. service firearms) while protected firearms are those that have been found or seized or are otherwise being held. The timely reporting and sharing of information about protected firearms is particularly important for police as it will have a significant impact on investigators' efforts to monitor the locations, movement and distribution of illicit firearms in Canada.

==Canadian Firearms Program==
{{main|Canadian Firearms Program}}
There are four major areas within the [[Canadian Firearms Program]], which are managed by the Deputy Commissioner Policing Support Services (PSS):
* Firearms Administration Centre (for licensing, registration, customer service and operations);
* Firearms Investigative and Enforcement Services Directorate (who assist police in countering illegal movement and criminal use of firearms);
* Strategic Integration and Program Management Services (program support policy, research and planning, business management);
* Partnership and Outreach (communications, client/partner and stakeholder relationship)

The CFP offers a wide variety of investigational support services to police:
* Firearms Reference Table (FRT) is a comprehensive firearms database with over 130,000 entries which establishes a systematic, standard method of identifying, describing and classifying firearms.
* Firearms Identification, for questionable firearms
* Firearms Analysis, for potential evidence in crimes
* Tracing of illicit firearms, the Canadian National Firearm Tracing Centre (CNFTC) assists police in tracing illegal firearms
*Investigational support and assistance helps police in preparing, obtaining and executing search warrants, location search and seizure, exhibit identification and organisation and court preparation
* Expert firearms advice and witness provides firearm-related guidance for testimony and court preparation and acts as liaison with partner agencies that can provide these services
* Firearm Case Law Database, firearm-related cases can be researched, and are distributed to investigators
* Crown Attorney Program, working with [[crown attorney]] offices, a network that specializes in firearms investigations
* Firearms Operations and Enforcement Support (FOES), intelligence support to firearm investigators and research that identifies trends and patterns in the criminal use of firearms in Canada.
* Pricing of illicit firearms, a record of firearm "street prices" is maintained and the information is made available to investigators
* Access to specialized firearms information databases, Canadian Firearm Information System (CFIS), Canadian Integrated Ballistic Identification Network (CIBIN) and the Suspect Gun Database
* Training, lectures, conferences, outreach and learning material available across Canada are available on a broad range of topics involving firearms
* Firearms registration information, querying records contained within the Canadian Firearms Registry Online (CFRO)
* Public Agent Firearms Reporting assistance, helping public agents use the Public Agency Web Services (PWS) to report agency and protected firearms and assisting Public Agents understand their obligations under the Public Agents Firearms Regulations

==Laws and regulations==

===Prohibited devices===

*Replica firearms (i.e.: "any device that is designed or intended to exactly resemble, or to resemble with near precision, a firearm, and that itself is not a firearm, but does not include any such device that is designed or intended to exactly resemble, or to resemble with near precision, an antique firearm")
*Suppressors (i.e.: "a device or contrivance designed or intended to muffle or stop the sound or report of a firearm")
*Handgun barrels that are {{convert|105|mm}} and under (excluding barrels of pistols used in international sporting competitions governed by the rules of the International Shooting Union)
*Electrical or mechanical devices designed or adapted to render the trigger mechanism of a semi-automatic firearm to discharge in a fully automatic fashion
*"Any rifle, shotgun or carbine stock of the type known as the "[[bullpup|bull-pup]]" design, being a stock that, when combined with a firearm, reduces the overall length of the firearm such that a substantial part of the reloading action or the magazine-well is located behind the trigger of the firearm when it is held in the normal firing position."&lt;ref name="justice1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-462/FullText.html |title=Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Ammunition Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or Restricted |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e.: only removable stocks are prohibited by this regulation, fixed-stock firearms such as the [[FN P90]] and IWI Tavor are excluded)

===Prohibited ammunition===
* [[Armor-piercing ammunition|Handgun ammunition designed to penetrate body armour]], for example: KTW and THV round, 5.7 × 28&amp;nbsp;mm (excluding sporting rounds such as SS196SR and SS197SR).&lt;ref name="justice1"/&gt;
* Incendiary or explosive ammunition designed for use in or in conjunction with a magazine and does not exceed 15&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref name="justice1"/&gt;
* [[Flechette]] rounds&lt;ref name="justice1"/&gt;

===Magazine capacity===
[[File:PinnedARMag.jpg|thumb|Common AR-15 30 round magazines that have been pinned to 5 rounds]]
Some magazines are prohibited regardless of the class of firearm to which the magazines are attached. As a general rule, under the Criminal Code, the maximum magazine capacity is five rounds for most magazines designed for rifles that shoot [[centerfire ammunition|centre-fire]] in a semi-automatic fashion, or ten rounds for most handgun magazines.

Magazines designed to contain centre-fire cartridges and designed or manufactured for use in a semiautomatic handgun are limited to 10 cartridges. The capacity is measured by the kind of cartridge the magazine was designed to contain. In some cases the magazine will be capable of containing more than 10 rounds of a different calibre; however, that is not relevant in the determination of the maximum permitted capacity.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/bulletins/bus-ent/20110323-72-eng.htm |title=Maximum Permitted Magazine Capacity - Royal Canadian Mounted Police |website=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2015-05-11 |accessdate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum permitted capacity of a magazine is determined by the kind of firearm it is designed or manufactured for and not the kind of firearm that might actually use it. As a consequence, the maximum permitted capacity remains the same regardless of which firearm it might be used in. Example: The [[Marlin Camp Carbine]] chambered for [[.45 ACP]] uses magazines designed and manufactured for the [[M1911 pistol]], therefore the seven- and eight-round capacities are permitted. A similar example is the 10-round capacity magazine for the Rock River Arms LAR-15 pistol, regardless of the kind of firearm it is actually used in.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"/&gt;

Many common magazines are manufactured to hold more rounds than law allows in Canada. These magazines must be permanently altered so they no longer hold more than the number of rounds allowed by law. Acceptable ways to alter a magazine are set out in the Criminal Code Regulations.&lt;ref name="justice1"/&gt;

With the exception of the Ruger BX-25 25 round magazine, there is no limit to the magazine capacity for semi-automatic rim-fire rifles or manually-operated rifles or shotguns (i.e., lever-action, pump-action, or bolt-action).

Additionally, there are a few exclusions on magazine regulations for certain specific firearms.

===Storage===
Non-restricted firearms must be unloaded and either:
* Made inoperable with a secure locking device (such as a trigger lock); or
* Have bolts or bolt-carriers removed; or
* Securely locked in a sturdy container, cabinet or room that cannot be easily broken into
* Except if: (1) in areas where it is legal to fire a gun, non-restricted firearms needed for predator control can temporarily be left unlocked and operable, but they must be kept unloaded and all ammunition must be stored separately, and (2) in wilderness areas, non-restricted firearms can be left unlocked and/or operable, but must be left unloaded (ammunition may be kept nearby).
Restricted firearms must be unloaded and either:
* Made inoperable with a secure locking device (such as a trigger lock) and securely locked in a sturdy container, cabinet or room that cannot be easily broken into; or
* Locked in a vault, safe or room that was built or adapted for storing these types of firearms
* For automatic firearms, the bolt(s) or bolt-carrier(s) must be removed, if removable, and stored in a separate locked room that cannot be easily broken into
Ammunition:
* Having ammunition kept in a location where it is not available for loading the firearm, unless both the firearm and its ammunition are securely locked up is recommended, however is not required.

===Transportation===
* Non-restricted firearms left unattended in a car must be locked in the trunk or in a similar lockable compartment. If the vehicle does not have a trunk or compartment, the firearm must be placed out of sight inside the vehicle and the vehicle must be locked (same rules apply for transport of replica firearms)
* Non-restricted firearms must be: transported unloaded (with the exception of muzzle-loading rifles, which can be transported loaded between hunting sites so long as the firing cap or flint is removed).
* Restricted and prohibited firearms must be: unloaded, made inoperable with a secure locking device, and locked in a sturdy container. Prohibited firearms must also have their bolts or bolt-carriers removed, if removable.

===Display===
Non-restricted firearms must be unloaded and either:
* Made inoperable with a secure locking device (such as a trigger lock); or
* Locked in a sturdy container, cabinet or room that cannot be easily broken into.

Restricted and prohibited firearms must be unloaded and:
* Made inoperable with a secure locking device (such as a trigger lock); and
* Securely attached to something that cannot be moved.
* The bolts or bolt-carriers must be removed, if removable, and stored in a separate locked room that cannot be easily broken into

Ammunition:
* Must not be displayed with a firearm that can discharge it

===Public agents firearms regulations===
When not in use, agency firearms and other controlled items must be:
* Stored in a container, receptacle, vault, safe or room
* That is controlled by the public agency and kept securely locked; or
* In a dwelling place if authorized by the public agency
Other controlled items being stored in a dwelling place must be securely locked in a container or receptacle that cannot be easily broken into, unless the agency has provided other instructions in writing.

By law, a potential customer must be 18 years of age or older to purchase a firearm or legally maintain possession of one. People under the age of 18 but over the age of 12 may procure a minor’s licence, which does not allow them to purchase a firearm but allows them to borrow a firearm unsupervised and purchase ammunition. Children under the age of 12 that are found to need a firearm to hunt or trap may also be awarded the minor's licence. This is generally reserved for children in remote locations, primarily [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal communities]] that engage in subsistence hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/minor-mineur-eng.htm |title=Firearm Users Younger than 18 - Royal Canadian Mounted Police |website=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2015-08-17 |accessdate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registration===
Long gun registration is no longer required after Bill C-19 was passed and made into law. However, it was still required in Quebec until March 27, 2015, when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the destruction of long-gun registry records was within the constitutional power of Parliament to make criminal law, denying the Quebec government's legal challenge and allowing for those records to be destroyed.

The history of the long gun registry:
On January 1, 2001, all firearms in Canada did have to be registered with the [[Canadian Firearms Registry]]. In early 2006, the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] became the largest party in the [[39th Canadian Parliament]], and the [[28th Canadian Ministry|new government]] announced an [[amnesty]] period of one year (later extended by a further year) in which licensed or previously licensed long gun owners would not be punished for not registering their long guns. The legal requirement to register as set forth by law has not been revoked; legislation to revoke the requirement to register long guns was introduced by the government during the 39th Parliament but was not brought to a vote. It was opposed by the Opposition parties who together had a majority of seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. Similar legislation was again brought forward in the form of private member's bill C-391 during the 40th Parliament but was narrowly defeated on September 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=4328798 |title=Private Member's Bill C-391 (40-2) |publisher=Parliament of Canada |date= |accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 41st Parliament the newly formed Conservative majority government again introduced legislation to repeal the requirement to register non-restricted firearms and to destroy the registry database.  Bill C-19 passed both the House and Senate and received royal assent on April 5, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5188309 |title=House Government Bill C-19 (41-1) |publisher= Parliament of Canada |date= |accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repeal of the long gun registry had been a long-standing campaign promise of the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/18/worlddispatch "Gun control in Canadian sights"], ''The Guardian'', September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restricted firearms===
To purchase a handgun or other restricted firearm, a person must have a restricted possession and acquisition licence (RPAL) for restricted firearms.

Canada's federal laws severely restrict the ability of civilians to transport restricted or prohibited (grandfathered) firearms in public. Section 17 of the Firearms Act makes it an offence to possess prohibited or restricted firearms other than at a dwelling-house or authorized location, but there are two exceptions to this prohibition found in sections 19 and 20 of the act.  Section 19 allows for persons to be issued an authorization to transport, or ATT, authorizing the transport of a firearm outside the home for certain purposes, such as for its transfer to a new owner, going to and from a [[Shooting range|range]], a training course, repair shop or gun show, or when the owner wishes to change the address where the firearm is stored. Such firearms must be transported unloaded, equipped with a [[trigger lock]] and stored in secure, locked containers. In rarer cases, section 20 of the act allows individuals to receive an authorization to carry, or ATC, granting permission to carry loaded restricted firearms or (section 12(6)) prohibited handguns on their persons for certain reasons specified in the act. These reasons are as follows: if the person is a licensed trapper and carries the firearm while trapping, if the person is in a remote [[wilderness]] area and needs the firearm for protection against wildlife, if the person's work involves guarding or handling money or other items of substantial value, or if the person's life is in danger and police protection is inadequate to protect him or her. It should be noted that the authorities almost never issue an ATC for the last reason, that is to say, because a person's life is threatened and police protection is inadequate. The vast majority of ATC's issued are to employees of [[Armored car (valuables)|armoured car]] companies to allow carry of a company owned firearm only while working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/who-may-carry-handguns-in-canada-1.1135084|title=Who may carry handguns in Canada?|date=15 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legality of self-defence===
The issue of the legality of self-defence with a firearm in Canada has been the subject of controversy. While self-defence is legal, it is very restricted. The Criminal Code recognizes self-defence with a firearm. The Firearms Act provides a legal framework wherein an individual may acquire, possess and carry a restricted or (a specific class of) prohibited firearm for protection from other individuals when police protection is deemed insufficient.&lt;ref name="atc"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-207/page-1.html Part 1, Section 2: Protection of Life.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310201636/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-207/page-1.html |date=March 10, 2012 }} Authorizations to Carry Restricted Firearms and Certain Handguns Regulations.

While self-defence is rarely considered a legal reason for attaining a PAL, the use of force with a firearm is legal as long as the accused can prove that his or her life was in danger. Sections 34 and 35 of the Criminal Code provide the legal framework of the use of force against intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-14.html#docCont |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of firearms==
{{Main|Possession and Acquisition Licence#Classification of firearms}}
According to licences, firearms are classified into '''prohibited''', '''restricted''' and '''non-restricted''' categories, as defined by Part III of ''Criminal Code (R.S., 1985, c. C-46)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-36.html |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Note: The word "prohibited" is a classification and does not indicate that such firearms are "prohibited" as per the normal use of the word.

'''Prohibited''' firearms include:
* Handguns

==Violent crime, suicide, and accidents in Canada==
Gun control laws are often enacted to control injury and death with target areas broadly classified as violent crime, suicide, and accidental injury. Statistics are often used to demonstrate the need for new legislation, or highlight the successes and failures of existing legislation.

In the year following the introduction of firearms licensing in Canada (1977), the already ongoing decline in murder involving firearms continued, relative to other mechanisms.&lt;ref name = Sproule&amp;Kennett&gt;Sproule, C. &amp; Kennett, D. (January 1988). [https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=109420 Use of Firearms in Canadian Homicides 1972-1982: The Need for Gun Control]. ''Canadian Journal of Criminology'' '''30'''(1):31-37. NCJ 109420. Retrieved on: 2012-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 2003 Canada firearm homicide has declined from 1.15 to 0.5  per 100,000, while other mechanisms declined slightly less (1.85 to 1.23 per 100,000).&lt;ref name = Sproule&amp;Kennett/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2011001/article/11561-eng.htm |title=Homicide in Canada, 2010 |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive review of firearm control legislation found that studies on the effects of the 1977 bill C-51  and bill C-68 from 1995 on firearm homicide rates came to differing conclusions, but generally found that bill C-17 from 1991 was not associated with all of firearm homicides.&lt;ref name="SantaellaTenorioEtAl2016"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Santaella-Tenorio J, Cerdá M, Villaveces A, Galea S|title=What Do We Know About the Association Between Firearm Legislation and Firearm-Related Injuries?|journal=Epidemiol Rev|date=10 February 2016|volume=38|issue=1|pages=140–57|doi=10.1093/epirev/mxv012|pmid=26905895|url=https://academic.oup.com/epirev/article/doi/10.1093/epirev/mxv012/2754868/What-Do-We-Know-About-the-Association-Between|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, shooting and stabbing represent the two most common mechanisms for homicide in Canada, each accounting for approximately 30% of murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/legal01-eng.htm|title=Homicides by method|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=December 1, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114232837/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/legal01-eng.htm|archivedate=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidental death, of any kind, is rare, claiming 27.9 people per 100,000 in 2000. Of these, firearms accidents account for 0.3% (0.1 per 100,000), ranking below the 37% for transportation (10.2 per 100,000), 28% for unspecified (7.7 per 100,000), 18% for falls (5.1 per 100,000), and 11% for poisoning (3.1 per 100,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/84F0209XIE/2000000/t001_en.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20080116045132/http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/84F0209XIE/2000000/t001_en.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-01-16 |title=Mortality, summary list of causes: Tables |publisher=Statcan.ca |date=2006-03-01 |accessdate=2011-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two studies by Leenaars and Lester using national data from 1969 to 1985 find that bill C-51 was associated with a reduced accidental death rate from firearms.&lt;ref name="SantaellaTenorioEtAl2016"/&gt;

Although firearms laws are officially controlled by the federal government, which should create identical conditions across the country, the role of provincial governments in implementing those laws complicates this matter. As prescribed in the constitution, provinces are free to opt out&lt;ref name="Criminal Code"&gt;''[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-1.html#h-2 Criminal Code] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829061147/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-1.html#h-2 |date=August 29, 2011 }}'', R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 2, definition of "Attorney General'.&lt;/ref&gt; and administer any federal program provincially.  Currently half of the provinces allow the federal government to administer the Firearms Act, and the other half choose to administer it provincially (see [[Canadian Firearms Program#Organization|CFP]] for more information).

Charges under the Criminal Code can be prosecuted only by a provincial attorney general.  With the exception of offences in the three federal territories and certain national security offences, the federal attorney general does not prosecute offences under the Criminal Code.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code"/&gt;  However, the federal attorney general can prosecute offences under other federal statutes, such as the Firearms Act.  Since both the Criminal Code and the Firearms Act contain offences relating to firearms, the nature of the charge will determine which attorney general is responsible for prosecuting the offence.   For reasons of cost or public opinion, nine provinces except [[Quebec]], have refused to prosecute people for social regulation charges, such as many under the Firearms Act, page 43{{vague|date=April 2014}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/411866/Crown_Counsel_policy_manual.pdf |title=Crown Counsel Policy Manual |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0227/ppom/PDF/Firearms.pdf |title=New Brunswick AG Policy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/justice/prosecutions/policy/pdf/prosecution_firearms_registration_offences.pdf |title=MB AG Policy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, since [[Canadian Firearms Program#Provincial|CFOs]] are responsible for issuing [[authorization to transport]] and [[authorization to carry]], firearms' regulation procedures differ between provinces.

Some provinces allow municipalities to regulate the use of firearms within their boundaries. For example, in [[British Columbia]], under section 8(5) of the Community Charter, municipal councils can "regulate and prohibit in relation to the discharge of firearms". Similar laws are also in effect in [[Alberta]] and [[Nova Scotia]] (Municipal Government Act), [[Ontario]] and [[Manitoba]] (Municipal Act), [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] (Municipalities Act), [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] (City of St. John's Act, R.S.N. 1990 c. C-17) and [[Quebec]] (Municipal Code of Québec) but not in [[Saskatchewan]].  In Saskatchewan, discharge of firearms is typically considered within the provincial wildlife statutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publications.gov.sk.ca/details.cfm?p=30785&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been significant criticism levelled at Canadian gun laws, particularly regarding safe storage requirements. While the Firearms Act has simple language, jurisprudence of what meets that standard causes ambiguity.  Generally,  vaults, safes, secured rooms, and solid front locking cabinets are all technically acceptable storage containers.

'''Honorary whites''' is a term that was used by the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] regime of [[South Africa]] to grant almost all of the rights and privileges of [[White South African|whites]] to those who would otherwise been treated as non-whites. This was made on a case by case basis to select individuals but also to groups of people, most notably [[East Asians|East Asians]] who were ascribed as honorary whites. [[Japanese people in South Africa|Japanese]], [[Koreans in South Africa|Koreans]] and [[Taiwanese Hans|Taiwanese]] were granted this honorary white status, and later on the [[Chinese South Africans|Chinese]] and individually designated figures of various other races were added as well.

==Japanese==
{{Main|Japanese people in South Africa}}
The designation was ascribed to all [[Japanese people]] (who also once were ascribed as [[Honorary Aryan]]s by [[Nazi Germany]]) in the 1960s. This designation assisted a trade pact formed [[Japan-South Africa relations|between South Africa and Japan]] in the early 1960s when Tokyo's [[Nippon Steel|Yawata Iron &amp; Steel Co.]] offered to purchase 5 million tons of South African [[pig iron]], worth more than $250 million, over a 10-year period.&lt;ref name=Time&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20080709144156/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C895835%2C00.html South Africa: Honorary Whites], ''[[TIME]]'', 19 January 1962&lt;/ref&gt; 

With such a huge deal in the works, Prime Minister [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] determined that it would be tactless and disadvantageous to trade arrangements to subject the Japanese people to the same restrictions as other ethnicities because trade delegations from Japan would regularly visit South Africa for business. 

Afterward, Pretoria's Group Areas Board publicly announced that all Japanese people would be considered white. [[Johannesburg]]'s city officials even decided that, "in view of the trade agreements", the municipal swimming pools would be open to all Japanese guests.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; 

The designation gave Japanese almost all of the same rights and privileges as whites (except for [[suffrage|the right to vote]]; they were also exempt from [[conscription]]). Until the early 1970s, opposition party politicians and the press questioned why Japanese were granted special privileges, citing inconsistencies with apartheid.&lt;ref name=park&gt;Afro-Hispanic Review: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23055227 White, Honorary White, or Non-White: Apartheid Era Constructions of Chinese], Dr. Yoon Jung Park (Univ of Johannesburg), Spring 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese==
{{POV section|date=October 2016}}
{{Main|Chinese South Africans}}
The new designation granted to the Japanese seemed grossly unfair to South Africa's small Chinese community (roughly 7,000 at that time), who it seemed, would enjoy none of the new benefits given to the Japanese. As ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported one of Cape Town's leading Chinese businessmen's saying "If anything, we are whiter in appearance than our Japanese friends." Another indignantly demanded: "Does this mean that the Japanese, now that they are [considered] White, cannot associate with us without running afoul of the [[Immorality Act]]?"&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;

Inclusion of other East Asians as honorary whites (Japanese, South Korean and especially Taiwanese) complicated matters on how the Chinese were treated, and apartheid regulation on Chinese varied from department to department and province to province as locals could not distinguish these Asians apart from each other. 

In 1984, the Group Areas Act was amended to allow Chinese South Africans to live in areas the government had declared white areas and use the facilities within them.&lt;ref name=NewBlack/&gt; Chinese South Africans were required to apply for a permit from the government in order to move into a white area. Permission had to be obtained from all the neighbours in the suburb for the application to be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerardy|first1=Justine|title=Chinese have trod murky path as 'non-people'|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/chinese-have-trod-murky-path-as-non-people-405246|website=IOL News|accessdate=2 January 2016|date=21 June 2008|quote=they had to get permission right down to the neighbours}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ho|first1=Ufrieda|title=Alan Ho's death stirs hope out of tragedy|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-04-23-allan-hos-death-stirs-hope-out-of-tragedy|website=The M&amp;G Online|accessdate=2 January 2016|date=24 April 2015|quote=Still, a family that wanted to move into a white suburb had to ask the permission of their neighbours – 10 houses to the front, 10 to the back and 10 on each side of the house they intended to call home.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Koreans==
{{Main|Koreans in South Africa}}

Unlike Japan, [[South Korea]] was unwilling to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa because of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uctscholar.uct.ac.za/PDF/98482_Kim_M.pdf In Search of a Better Life: A History of Korean Migration to Cape Town], Kim Mino, University of Cape Town, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa offered honorary white status to South Korean citizens when the two countries negotiated diplomatic relations in 1961. South Korea severed ties with South Africa in 1978 in protest against apartheid, and full diplomatic relations between the two countries were not reestablished until 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://zaf.mofa.go.kr/webmodule/common/download.jsp?boardid=15140&amp;tablename=TYPE_ENGLEGATIO&amp;seqno=02cfc9044ffb03e05c07c019&amp;fileseq=012fe9fba029fc3f9d07d029|title=South Korea-South Africa Relations|work=The Embassy of the Republic of Korea to the Republic of South Africa|date=6 April 2015|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taiwanese==
{{Main|Chinese South Africans#Immigration from Taiwan}}

The inclusion of Taiwanese was due to the important relations between South Africa and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=NewBlack&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2008/06/19/in-south-africa-chinese-is-the-new-black/|title=In South Africa, Chinese is the New Black|date=19 June 2008|newspaper=WSJ|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xitem=123749&amp;ctnode=1360&amp;mp=1 |title=Premier Sun visits four African countries |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |journal=Taiwan Review |date=5 January 1980 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230103823/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xitem=123749&amp;ctnode=1360&amp;mp=1 |archivedate=30 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979, Taiwan had become South Africa's fifth largest trading partner. As South Africa continued to support the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalists]] even after the [[Chinese Communist Party]] gained control of the mainland, the relations of the two warmed as both were isolated from the international community.&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

==Others==
The "honorary white" status was given to other special visitors belonging to other races, including:
* Guyanese author [[E.R. Braithwaite]] who wrote a scathing book ''Honorary White: Visit to South Africa''&lt;ref name="Braithwaite1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Braithwaite|first=Edward Ricardo|authorlink=E. R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9091">[[File:National Security Operations Center photograph, c. 1975 - National Cryptologic Museum - DSC07658.JPG|thumb|The United States national security operations center in 1975]]
An '''information security operations center''' ("'''ISOC'''" or "'''SOC'''") is a facility where [[enterprise information systems]] ([[web sites]], [[application software|applications]], [[databases]], [[data centers]] and [[server (computing)|servers]], [[computer network|networks]], [[client (computing)|desktops]] and other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended.

==Objective==
A SOC is related to the people, processes and technologies that provide situational awareness through the detection, containment, and remediation of IT threats.  A SOC will handle, on behalf of an institution or company, any threatening IT incident, and will ensure that it is properly identified, analyzed, communicated, investigated and reported.  The SOC also monitors applications to identify a possible cyber-attack or intrusion (event), and determines if it is a genuine malicious threat (incident), and if it could affect business.

===Regulatory requirements===
Establishing and operating a SOC is expensive and difficult; organisations should need a good reason to do it. This may include:
* Protecting sensitive data
* Complying with industry rules such as [[PCI DSS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PCI DSS 3.0: The Impact on Your Security Operations|url=http://www.securityweek.com/pci-dss-30-impact-your-security-operations|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=Security Week|date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complying with government rules, such as CESG GPG53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transaction Monitoring for HMG Online Service  Providers|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271268/GPG_53_Transaction_Monitoring_issue_1-1_April_2013.pdf|publisher=CESG|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names==
A security operations center (SOC) can also be called a security defense center (SDC), security analytics center (SAC), network security operations center (NSOC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managed Services at the Tactical FLEX, Inc. Network Security Operations Center (NSOC)|url=https://www.aanval.com/nsoc|publisher=Tactical FLEX, Inc.|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; security intelligence center, cyber security center, threat defense center, security intelligence and operations center (SIOC). In the Canadian Federal Government the term, infrastructure protection center (IPC), is used to describe a SOC.

==Technology==
SOCs typically are based around a [[security information and event management]] (SIEM) system which aggregates and correlates data from security feeds such as network discovery and [[vulnerability assessment]] systems; governance, risk and compliance (GRC) systems; web site assessment and monitoring systems, application and database scanners; [[penetration test]]ing tools; [[intrusion detection systems]] (IDS); [[intrusion prevention system]] (IPS); log management systems; network behavior analysis and [[Cyber threat intelligence]]; wireless intrusion prevention system; firewalls, enterprise [[antivirus]] and unified threat management (UTM).  The SIEM technology creates a "single pane of glass" for the security analysts to monitor the enterprise.

==People==
SOC staff includes analysts, security engineers, and SOC managers who should be seasoned IT and networking professionals. They are usually trained in [[computer engineering]], [[cryptography]], [[Computer network|network engineering]], or [[computer science]] and may have credentials such as [[Certified Information Systems Security Professional|CISSP]] or [[Global Information Assurance Certification|GIAC]].

SOC staffing plans range from eight hours a day, five days a week (8x5) to twenty four hours a day, seven days a week (24x7). Shifts should include at least two analysts and the responsibilities should be clearly defined.

==Organization==
Large organizations and governments may operate more than one SOC to manage different groups of [[information and communication technology]] or to provide redundancy in the event one site is unavailable. SOC work can be outsourced, for instance, by using a [[managed security service]]. The term SOC was traditionally used by governments and managed computer security providers, although a growing number of large corporations and other organizations also have such centers.

The SOC and the [[network operations center]] (NOC) complement each other and work in tandem. The NOC is usually responsible for monitoring and maintaining the overall network infrastructure, and its primary function is to ensure uninterrupted network service. The SOC is responsible for protecting networks, as well as web sites, applications, databases, servers and data centers, and other technologies.  Likewise, the SOC and the physical security operations center coordinate and work together. The physical SOC is a facility in large organizations where security staff monitor and control security officers/guards, alarms, CCTV, physical access, lighting, vehicle barriers, etc.

Not every SOC has the same role. There are three different focus areas in which a SOC may be active, and which can be combined in any combination:
*Control - focusing on the state of the security with compliancy testing, penetration testing, vulnerability testing, etc.
*Monitoring - focusing on events and the response with log monitoring, SIEM administration, and incident response
*Operational - focusing on the operational security administration such as identity &amp; access management, key management, firewall administration, etc.

In some cases the SOC, NOC or physical SOC may be housed in the same facility or organizationally combined, especially if the focus is on ''operational'' tasks. If the SOC originates from a [[Computer emergency response team|CERT]] organisation, then the focus is usually more on ''monitoring'' and ''control'', in which case the SOC operates independently from the NOC to maintain [[separation of duties]]. Typically, larger organizations maintain a separate SOC to ensure focus and expertise. The SOC then collaborates closely with network operations and physical security operations.

==Facilities==
SOCs usually are well protected with physical, electronic, computer, and personnel security. Centers are often laid out with desks facing a video wall, which displays significant status, events and alarms; ongoing incidents; a corner of the wall is sometimes used for showing a news or weather TV channel, as this can keep the SOC staff aware of current events which may affect information systems. A security engineer or security analyst may have several computer monitors on their desk.

==Process and procedures==
Processes and procedures within a SOC will clearly spell out roles and responsibilities as well as monitoring procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://expel.io/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-24x7-soc/|title=How much does it cost to build a 24x7 SOC? - Expel|date=2018-02-28|work=Expel|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes include business, technology, operational and analytical processes. They lay out what steps are to be taken in the event of an alert or breach including escalation procedures, reporting procedures, and breach response procedures.

== CloudSOC ==

A cloud security operations center (CloudSOC) may be set up to monitor cloud service use within an enterprise (and keep the [[Shadow IT]] problem under control), or parse and audit [[IT infrastructure]] and application logs via  [[Security information and event management|SIEM]] technologies and machine data platforms (such as [[LogRhythm]], [[Splunk]], [[IBM QRadar]], [[Assuria]], [[HP ArcSight]], CYBERShark&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackstratus.com/cybershark/&lt;/ref&gt; and Elastica&lt;ref&gt;https://www.symantec.com/products/web-and-cloud-security/cloud-application-security-cloudsoc&lt;/ref&gt;) to provide alerts and details of suspicious activity.

== Smart SOC ==

A Smart SOC (Security Operations Center) is a comprehensive, technology agnostic [[Computer security|cybersecurity]] solution that utilizes leading-edge technology and tools, highly skilled and experienced human talent (composed of cyber intelligence gatherers, analysts, and security experts), and proactive [[cyberwarfare]] principles to prevent and neutralize threats against an organization’s digital infrastructure, assets, and data.

== Other types and references ==
In addition, there are many other commonly referenced terms related to the original "ISOC" title including the following:
* NSOC, Network Security Operations Center
* ASOC, Advanced Security Operations Center
* GSOC, Global Security Operations Center
* vSOC, Virtual Security Operations Center&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alienvault.com/resource-center/videos/what-is-a-virtual-security-operations-center-vsoc&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism''' (ICCA) is an international coalition of Parliamentarians from around the world that work together to combat [[antisemitism]]. Among its goals is the understanding and awarneness of [[new antisemitism|modern antisemitism]] and ways to combat it on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisem.org/about-us/|title=Account Suspended|website=www.antisem.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual conference of the ICCA was held in [[London]], [[England]] in cooperation with the British Government in 2009 and produced the [[London Declaration on Combating Antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisem.org/london-declaration/|title=Account Suspended|website=www.antisem.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] was the first world leader to sign the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;http://ukinisrael.fco.gov.uk/en/news/?view=News&amp;id=14159560&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been signed by several additional Prime Ministers across the globe and more than 600 Parliamentarians worldwide.{{citation-needed|date=February 2018}}

The second annual conference was held in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]] in association with the [[Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Antisemitism]] and the Canadian Government on November 7–9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antisem.org/2010-conference/&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICCA established an informal [[working group]] on antisemitism in the European Parliament, which produced a report into hate on the internet and established a working group on hate on the internet including all major internet industry players.{{citation-needed|date=February 2018}}

==Steering Committee==

The '''Irgun''' ({{lang-he-n|ארגון}}; full title: {{Hebrew|הארגון הצבאי הלאומי בארץ ישראל}} ''{{transl|he|Hā-ʾIrgun Ha-Tzvaʾī Ha-Leūmī b-Ērētz Yiśrāʾel}}'', lit. "The National Military Organization in the Land of Israel") was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[paramilitary]] organization that operated in [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] between 1931 and 1948. It was an offshoot of the older and larger [[Jewish]] [[paramilitary]] organization [[Haganah]] (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|הגנה}}, Defence). When the group broke from the Haganah it became known as the ''Haganah Bet'' (Hebrew: literally "Defense 'B' " or "Second Defense", {{Hebrew|הגנה ב}}), or alternatively as haHaganah haLeumit ({{lang|he|ההגנה הלאומית}}) or Hama'amad ({{Hebrew|המעמד}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Shavit]], ''Jabotinsky and the Revisionist Movement 1925–1948'' p. 97 Routledge 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-7146-3325-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irgun members were absorbed into the [[Israel Defense Forces]] at the start of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war]]. The Irgun is also referred to as '''Etzel''' ({{Hebrew|אצ"ל}}), an acronym of the Hebrew initials, or by the abbreviation IZL.

The Irgun policy was based on what was then called [[Revisionist Zionism]] founded by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]. According to [[Howard Sachar]], "The policy of the new organization was based squarely on Jabotinsky's teachings: every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arabs; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state".&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Sachar]]: ''A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time'', pp. 265–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the operations for which the Irgun is best known are the [[King David Hotel bombing|bombing of the King David Hotel]] in Jerusalem on 22 July 1946 and the [[Deir Yassin massacre]], carried out together with [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] on 9 April 1948.

The Irgun has been viewed as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts.&lt;ref name=SshmidtFCPRIOT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=J.

A History of the Modern Middle East. Boulder, CO: Westview, 2004. Print. p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irgun was a political predecessor to Israel's [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] ''[[Herut]]'' (or "Freedom") party, which led to today's [[Likud]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisenstadt|first=S.N.|title=The Transformation of Israeli Society|year=1985|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |isbn=0-297-78423-4|pages=173–4 |authorlink=Shmuel Eisenstadt|quote=One of the main developments in the initial period of the State was the growth of the Herut party....

==Nature of the movement==
[[File:Zeev Jabotinsky.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], who formulated the movement's ideology and was ''Supreme Commander'' of the Etzel]]

Members of the Irgun came mostly from [[Betar]] and from the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Party]] both in Palestine and abroad. The Revisionist Movement made up a popular backing for the underground organization. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], founder of Revisionist Zionism, commanded the organization until he died in 1940. He formulated the general realm of operation, regarding ''[[Havlagah|Restraint]]'' and the end thereof, and was the inspiration for the organization overall. An additional major source of ideological inspiration was the poetry of [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]]. The symbol of the organization, with the motto רק כך (only thus), underneath a hand holding a rifle in the foreground of a map showing both [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] (at the time, both were administered under the terms of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]]), implied that force was the only way to "liberate the homeland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Mitchell|first= Thomas G.|title= Native vs. Settler: Ethnic Conflict in Israel/Palestine, Northern Ireland, and South Africa|year= 2000|publisher= Greenwood|page= 172|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3PNt46aB_sYC&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=kach%20%22only%20thus%22%20irgun%20kahane&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q=kach%20%22only%20thus%22%20irgun%20kahane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of members of the Irgun varied from a few hundred to a few thousand. Most of its members were people who joined the organization's command,{{clarify|date=June 2016}} under which they carried out various operations and filled positions, largely in opposition to [[British law]]. Most of them were "ordinary" people, who held regular jobs, and only a few dozen worked full-time in the Irgun.

The Irgun disagreed with the policy of the [[Yishuv]] and with the [[World Zionist Organization]], both with regard to strategy and basic ideology and with regard to [[public relations|PR]] and military tactics, such as use of armed force to accomplish the Zionist ends, operations against the Arabs during the riots, and relations with the British mandatory government. Therefore, the Irgun tended to ignore the decisions made by the Zionist leadership and the Yishuv's institutions. This fact caused the elected bodies not to recognize the independent organization, and during most of the time of its existence the organization was seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as irresponsible, and its actions thus worthy of thwarting. Accordingly, the Irgun accompanied its armed operations with public-relations campaigns aiming to convince the public of the Irgun's way and the problems with the official political leadership of the Yishuv. The Irgun put out numerous advertisements, an underground newspaper and even ran the first independent Hebrew radio station – [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]].

===Structure, command, and organization===
{{Irgun Commanders}}
As members of an underground armed organization, Irgun personnel did not normally call Irgun by its name, but rather used other names. In the first years of its existence it was known primarily as ''Ha-Haganah Leumit''' (The National Defense), and also by names such as ''Haganah Bet'' ("Second Defense"), ''Irgun Bet'' ("Second Irgun"), the ''Parallel Organization'' and the ''Rightwing Organization''. Later on{{when|date=June 2016}} it became most widely known as המעמד (the Stand). The anthem adopted by the Irgun was "Anonymous Soldiers",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betar.org.il/music/songs/hayalim.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betar.org.il/music/songs/musicfiles/Khaialim_Almonim.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] who was at the time a commander in the Irgun. Later on Stern defected from the Irgun and founded [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], and the song became the anthem of the Lehi. The Irgun's new anthem then became the third verse of the "[[Shir Betar|Betar Song]]", by Ze'ev Jabotinsky.

The Irgun gradually evolved from its humble origins into a serious and well-organized paramilitary organization. The movement developed a hierarchy of ranks and a sophisticated command-structure, and came to demand serious military training and strict discipline from its members. It developed clandestine networks of hidden arms-caches and weapons-production workshops, safe-houses, and training camps.

The ranks of the Irgun were (in ascending order):

*''Khayal'' = (Private)
*''Segen Rosh Kvutza'', ''Segen'' ("Deputy Group Leader", "Deputy") = Assistant Squad Leader ([[Lance Corporal]])
*''Rosh Kvutza'' ("Group Leader") = Squad Leader ([[Corporal]])
*''Samal'' ("Sergeant") = Section Leader ([[Staff Sergeant|Sergeant]])
*''Samal Rishon'' ("Sergeant First Class") = Brigade Leader ([[Sergeant First Class|Platoon Sergeant]])
*''Rav Samal'' ("Chief Sergeant") = Battalion Leader ([[Master Sergeant]])
*''Gundar Sheni'', ''Gundar'' ("Commander Second Class", "Commander") = District Commander ([[2nd Lieutenant]])
*''Gundar Rishon'' ("Commander First Class") = Senior Branch Commander, Headquarters Staff ([[Lieutenant]]).

The Irgun was led by a High Command, which set policy and gave orders. Directly underneath it was a General Staff, which oversaw the activities of the Irgun. The General Staff was divided into a military and a support staff. The military staff was divided into operational units that oversaw operations and support units in charge of planning, instruction, weapons caches and manufacture, and first aid. The military and support staff never met jointly; they communicated through the High Command. Beneath the General Staff were six district commands: [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]]-[[Galilee]], [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern]], [[Sharon plain|Sharon]], and [[Samaria|Shomron]], each led by a district commander.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;Bell, Bowyer J.: ''Terror out of Zion'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; A local Irgun district unit was called a "Branch". A "brigade" in the Irgun was made up of three sections. A section was made up of two groups, at the head of each was a "Group Head", and a deputy. Eventually, various units were established, which answered to a "Center" or "Staff".

The head of the Irgun High Command was the overall commander of the organization, but the designation of his rank varied. During the revolt against the British, Irgun commander [[Menachem Begin]] and the entire High Command held the rank of ''Gundar Rishon''. His predecessors, however, had held their own ranks. A rank of Military Commander ([[Israel Defense Forces ranks|Seren]]) was awarded to the Irgun commander [[Yaakov Meridor]] and a rank of High Commander ([[Aluf]]) to [[David Raziel]]. Until his death in 1940, Jabotinsky was known as the "Military Commander of the Etzel" or the ''Ha-Matzbi Ha-Elyon'' ("Supreme Commander").

Under the command of Menachem Begin, the Irgun was divided into different corps:

* ''Hayil Kravi'' (Combat Corps) – responsible for combat operations
* ''Delek'' ("Gasoline") – the intelligence section; responsible for gathering and translating intelligence, and maintaining contact with local and foreign journalists
* ''HAT'' (Planning Division) – responsible for planning activities
* ''HATAM'' (Revolutionary Publicity Corps) – responsible for printing and disseminating propaganda

In theory, the Irgun was supposed{{by whom|date=June 2016}} to have a regular combat force, a reserve, and shock units, but in practice there were not enough personnel for a reserve or for a shock force.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;

The Irgun emphasized that its fighters be highly disciplined. Strict drill exercises were carried out at ceremonies at different times, and strict attention was given to discipline, formal ceremonies and military relationships between the various ranks. The Irgun put out professional publications on combat doctrine, weaponry, leadership, drill exercises, etc. Among these publications were three books written by David Raziel, who had studied military history, techniques, and strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, Colin:''Triumph of Military Zionism: Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right'', p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''The Pistol'' (written in collaboration with Avraham Stern)
* ''The Theory of Training''
* ''Parade Ground and Field Drill''

A British analysis noted that the Irgun's discipline was "as strict as any army in the world."&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;Hoffman, Bruce: ''Anonymous Soldiers'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irgun operated a sophisticated recruitment and military-training regime. Those wishing to join had to find and make contact with a member, meaning only those who personally knew a member or were persistent could find their way in. Once contact had been established, a meeting was set up with the three-member selection committee at a safe-house, where the recruit was interviewed in a darkened room, with the committee either positioned behind a screen, or with a flashlight shone into the recruit's eyes. The interviewers asked basic biographical questions, and then asked a series of questions designed to weed out romantics and adventurers and those who had not seriously contemplated the potential sacrifices. Those selected attended a four-month series of indoctrination seminars in groups of five to ten, where they were taught the Irgun's ideology and the code of conduct it expected of its members. These seminars also had another purpose - to weed out the impatient and those of flawed purpose who had gotten past the selection interview. Then, members were introduced to other members, were taught the locations of safe-houses, and given military training. Irgun recruits trained with firearms, hand grenades, and were taught how to conduct combined attacks on targets. Arms handling and tactics courses were given in clandestine training camps, while practice shooting took place in the desert or by the sea. Eventually, separate training camps were established for heavy-weapons training. The most rigorous course was the explosives course for bomb-makers, which lasted a year.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; The British authorities believed that some Irgun members enlisted in the Jewish section of the [[Palestine Police Force]] for a year as part of their training, during which they also passed intelligence.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; In addition to the Irgun's sophisticated training program, many Irgun members were veterans of the Haganah (including the [[Palmach]]), the [[British Armed Forces]], and Jewish partisan groups that had waged guerrilla warfare in Nazi-occupied Europe, thus bringing significant military training and combat experience into the organization.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; The Irgun also operated a course for its intelligence operatives, in which recruits were taught espionage, cryptography, and analysis techniques.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

Of the Irgun's members, almost all were part-time members. They were expected to maintain their civilian lives and jobs, dividing their time between their civilian lives and underground activities. There were never more than 40 full-time members, who were given a small expense stipend on which to live on.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; Upon joining, every member received an underground name. The Irgun's members were divided into cells, and worked with the members of their own cells. The identities of Irgun members in other cells were withheld. This ensured that an Irgun member taken prisoner could betray no more than a few comrades.

In addition to the Irgun's members in Palestine, underground Irgun cells composed of local Jews were established in [[Europe]] following [[World War II]]. An Irgun cell was also established in [[Shanghai]], home to many European-Jewish refugees. The Irgun also set up a Swiss bank account. Eli Tavin, the former head of Irgun intelligence, was appointed commander of the Irgun abroad.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;

In November 1947, the [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Jewish insurgency]] came to an end as the UN approved of the partition of Palestine, and the British had announced their intention to withdraw the previous month. As the British left and the [[1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] got underway, the Irgun came out of the underground and began to function more as a standing army rather an underground organization. It began openly recruiting, training, and raising funds, and established bases, including training facilities. It also introduced field communications and created a medical unit and supply service.&lt;ref&gt;Menachem Begin: ''The Revolt'', ch. 18, ''The Conquest of Jaffa''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Hagai: ''How My Grandmother Prevented A Civil War'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Until World War II the group armed itself with weapons purchased in Europe, primarily [[Italy]] and [[Poland]], and smuggled to Palestine. The Irgun also established workshops that manufactured spare parts and attachments for the weapons. Also manufactured were land mines and simple hand grenades. Another way in which the Irgun armed itself was theft of weapons from the [[Palestine Police Force|British Police]] and military.

==Prior to World War II==
===Founding===
The Irgun's first steps were in the aftermath of the [[1929 Palestine riots|Riots of 1929]]. In the [[Jerusalem]] branch of the Haganah there were feelings of disappointment and internal unrest towards the leadership of the movements and the [[Histadrut]] (at that time the organization running the Haganah). These feelings were a result of the view that the Haganah was not adequately defending Jewish interests in the region. Likewise, critics of the leadership spoke out against alleged failures in the number of weapons, readiness of the movement and its policy of restraint and not fighting back. On April 10, 1931, commanders and equipment managers announced that they refused to return weapons to the Haganah that had been issued to them earlier, prior to the [[Nebi Musa]] holiday. These weapons were later returned by the commander of the Jerusalem branch, [[Avraham Tehomi]], a.k.a. "Gideon". However, the commanders who decided to rebel against the leadership of the Haganah relayed a message regarding their resignations to the [[Vaad Leumi]], and thus this schism created a new independent movement.

The leader of the new underground movement was [[Avraham Tehomi]], alongside other founding members who were all senior commanders in the Haganah, members of [[Hapoel Hatzair]] and of the Histadrut. Also among them was [[Eliyahu Ben Horin]], an activist in the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Party]]. This group was known as the "Odessan Gang", because they previously had been members of the ''Haganah Ha'Atzmit'' of Jewish [[Odessa]]. The new movement was named ''Irgun Tsvai Leumi'', ("National Military Organization") in order to emphasize its active nature in contrast to the Haganah. Moreover, the organization was founded with the desire to become a true military organization and not just a [[militia]] as the Haganah was at the time.

In the autumn of that year the Jerusalem group merged with other armed groups affiliated with [[Betar]]. The Betar groups' center of activity was in [[Tel Aviv]], and they began their activity in 1928 with the establishment of "Officers and Instructors School of Betar". Students at this institution had broken away from the Haganah earlier, for political reasons, and the new group called itself the "National Defense", הגנה הלאומית. During the riots of 1929 Betar youth participated in the defense of Tel Aviv neighborhoods under the command of Yermiyahu Halperin, at the behest of the Tel Aviv city hall. After the riots the Tel Avivian group expanded, and was known as "The [[Right Wing]] Organization".

After the Tel Aviv expansion another branch was established in [[Haifa]]. Towards the end of 1932 the Haganah branch of [[Safed]] also defected and joined the Irgun, as well as many members of the [[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] sports association. At that time the movement's underground newsletter, ''Ha'Metsudah'' (the Fortress) also began publication, expressing the active trend of the movement. The Irgun also increased its numbers by expanding draft regiments of Betar – groups of volunteers, committed to two years of security and pioneer activities. These regiments were based in places that from which stemmed new Irgun strongholds in the many places, including the settlements of [[Yesod HaMa'ala]], [[Mishmar HaYarden]], [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]], [[Metula]] and [[Nahariya]] in the north; in the center – [[Hadera]], [[Binyamina]], [[Herzliya]], [[Netanya]] and [[Kfar Saba]], and south of there – [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Rehovot]] and [[Ness Ziona]]. Later on regiments were also active in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] ("the Kotel Brigades") among others. Primary training centers were based in [[Ramat Gan]], [[Qastina]] (by [[Kiryat Mal'akhi]] of today) and other places.

===Under Tehomi's command===
{{Main|1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine}}
[[File:Tehomi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Avraham Tehomi]], the first Commander of the Irgun]]
In 1933 there were some signs of unrest, seen by the incitement of the local Arab leadership to act against the authorities. The strong British response put down the disturbances quickly. During that time the Irgun operated in a similar manner to the Haganah and was a guarding organization. The two organizations cooperated in ways such as coordination of posts and even intelligence sharing.

Within the Irgun, Tehomi was the first to serve as "Head of the Headquarters" or "Chief Commander". Alongside Tehomi served the senior commanders, or "Headquarters" of the movement. As the organization grew, it was divided into district commands.

In August 1933 a "Supervisory Committee" for the Irgun was established, which included representatives from most of the Zionist political parties. The members of this committee were [[Meir Grossman]] (of the Hebrew State Party), Rabbi [[Meir Bar-Ilan]] (of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi Party]], either [[Immanuel Neumann]] or [[Yehoshua Supersky]] (of the [[General Zionists]]) and [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] or [[Eliyahu Ben Horin]] (of [[Hatzohar]]).

In protest against, and with the aim of ending [[Jewish immigration to Palestine]], the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Great Arab Revolt of 1936–1939]] broke out on April 19, 1936. The riots took the form of attacks by Arab rioters ambushing main roads, bombing of roads and settlements as well as property and agriculture vandalism. In the beginning, the Irgun and the Haganah generally maintained a policy of restraint, apart from a few instances. Some expressed resentment at this policy, leading up internal unrest in the two organizations. The Irgun tended to retaliate more often, and sometimes Irgun members patrolled areas beyond their positions in order to encounter attackers ahead of time. However, there were differences of opinion regarding what to do in the Haganah, as well. Due to the joining of many [[Betar]] Youth members, Jabotinsky (founder of Betar) had a great deal of influence over Irgun policy. Nevertheless, Jabotinsky was of the opinion that for moral reasons violent retaliation was not to be undertaken.

In November 1936 the [[Peel Commission]] was sent to inquire regarding the breakout of the riots and propose a solution to end the Revolt. In early 1937 there were still some in the [[Yishuv]] who felt the commission would recommend a partition of [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]), thus creating a Jewish state on part of the land. The Irgun leadership, as well as the "Supervisory Committee" held similar beliefs, as did some members of the Haganah and the [[Jewish Agency]]. This belief strengthened the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]] and led to the position that there was no room for defense institutions in the future Jewish state. Tehomi was quoted as saying: "We stand before great events: a Jewish state and a Jewish army. There is a need for a single military force". This position intensified the differences of opinion regarding the policy of restraint, both within the Irgun and within the political camp aligned with the organization. The leadership committee of the Irgun supported a merger with the Haganah. On April 24, 1937 a referendum was held among Irgun members regarding its continued independent existence. David Raziel and Avraham (Yair) Stern came out publicly in support for the continued existence of the Irgun:
:''The Irgun has been placed ... before a decision to make, whether to submit to the authority of the government and the [[Jewish Agency]] or to prepare for a double sacrifice and endangerment. Some of our friends do not have appropriate willingness for this difficult position, and have submitted to the Jewish Agency and has left the battle ... all of the attempts ... to unite with the leftist organization have failed, because the Left entered into negotiations not on the basis of unification of forces, but the submission of one such force to the other....''&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Kister]], ''The Etzel'', (Hebrew) pp. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first split===
In April 1937 the Irgun split after the referendum. Approximately 1,500–2,000 people, about half of the Irgun's membership, including the senior command staff, regional committee members, along with most of the Irgun's weapons, returned to the Haganah, which at that time was under the Jewish Agency's leadership. The Supervisory Committee's control over the Irgun ended, and Jabotinsky assumed command. In their opinion, the removal of the Haganah from the Jewish Agency's leadership to the national institutions necessitated their return. Furthermore, they no longer saw significant ideological differences between the movements. Those who remained in the Irgun were primarily young activists, mostly laypeople, who sided with the independent existence of the Irgun. In fact, most of those who remained were originally Betar people. [[Moshe Rosenberg]] estimated that approximately 1,800 members remained. In theory, the Irgun remained an organization not aligned with a political party, but in reality the supervisory committee was disbanded and the Irgun's continued ideological path was outlined according to Ze'ev Jabotinsky's school of thought and his decisions, until the movement eventually became Revisionist Zionism's military arm. One of the major changes in policy by Jabotinsky was the end of the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]].

On April 27, 1937 the Irgun founded a new headquarters, staffed by Moshe Rosenberg at the head, [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] as secretary, [[David Raziel]] as head of the Jerusalem branch, [[Hanoch Kalai]] as commander of Haifa and [[Aharon Haichman]] as commander of Tel Aviv. On 20 [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]], (June 29) the day of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s death, a ceremony was held in honor of the reorganization of the underground movement. For security purposes this ceremony was held at a construction site in Tel Aviv.

Ze'ev Jabotinsky placed Col. [[Robert Bitker]] at the head of the Irgun. Bitker had previously served as Betar commissioner in China and had military experience. A few months later, probably due to total incompatibility with the position, Jabotinsky replaced Bitker with Moshe Rosenberg. When the [[Peel Commission]] report was published a few months later, the Revisionist camp decided not to accept the commission's recommendations. Moreover, the organizations of Betar, [[Hatzohar]] and the Irgun began to increase their efforts to bring Jews to the land of Israel, illegally. This [[Aliyah]] was known as the עליית אף על פי "Af Al Pi (Nevertheless) Aliyah". As opposed to this position, the Jewish Agency began acting on behalf of the Zionist interest on the political front, and continued the policy of restraint. From this point onwards the differences between the Haganah and the Irgun were much more obvious.

===Illegal immigration===
[[File:Parita22839.jpg|thumb|The ship [[:he:פאריטה|''Parita'']] unloading immigrants at the beach in [[Tel Aviv]]]]
According to Jabotinsky's "Evacuation Plan", which called for millions of [[European Jews]] to be brought to Palestine at once, the Irgun helped the [[Aliyah Bet|illegal immigration]] of European Jews to the land of Israel. This was named by Jabotinsky the "National Sport". The most significant part of this immigration prior to [[World War II]] was carried out by the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] camp, largely because the [[Yishuv]] institutions and the Jewish Agency shied away from such actions on grounds of cost and their belief that Britain would in the future allow widespread Jewish immigration.

The Irgun joined forces with [[Hatzohar]] and [[Betar]] in September 1937, when it assisted with the landing of a convoy of 54 Betar members at Tantura Beach (near [[Haifa]].) The Irgun was responsible for discreetly bringing the [[Olim]], or Jewish immigrants, to the beaches, and dispersing them among the various Jewish settlements. The Irgun also began participating in the organisation of the immigration enterprise and undertook the process of accompanying the ships. This began with the ship ''Draga'' which arrived at the coast of British Palestine in September 1938. In August of the same year, an agreement was made between Ari Jabotinsky (the son of Ze'ev Jabotinsky), the Betar representative and [[Hillel Kook]], the Irgun representative, to coordinate the immigration (also known as [[Ha'apala]]). This agreement was also made in the "Paris Convention" in February 1939, at which Ze'ev Jabotinsky and David Raziel were present. Afterwards, the "Aliyah Center" was founded, made up of representatives of Hatzohar, Betar, and the Irgun, thereby making the Irgun a full participant in the process.

The difficult conditions on the ships demanded a high level of discipline. The people on board the ships were often split into units, led by commanders. In addition to having a daily roll call and the distribution of food and water (usually very little of either), organized talks were held to provide information regarding the actual arrival in Palestine. One of the largest ships was the ''Sakaria'', with 2,300 passengers, which equalled about 0.5% of the Jewish population in Palestine. The first vessel arrived on April 13, 1937, and the last on February 13, 1940. All told, about 18,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine with the help of the Revisionist organizations and private initiatives by other Revisionists. Most were not caught by the British.

===End of restraint===
{{Main|List of Irgun attacks}}
[[File:David raziel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Raziel]], commander of the Irgun]]
Irgun members continued to defend settlements, but at the same time began attacks on Arab villages, thus ending the policy of restraint. These attacks were intended to instill fear in the Arab side, in order to cause the Arabs to wish for peace and quiet. In March 1938, [[David Raziel]] wrote in the underground newspaper "By the Sword" a constitutive article for the Irgun overall, in which he coined the term '''"Active Defense"''':
:The actions of the Haganah alone will never be a true victory. If the goal of the war is to break the will of the enemy – and this cannot be attained without destroying his spirit – clearly we cannot be satisfied with solely defensive operations.... Such a method of defense, that allows the enemy to attack at will, to reorganize and attack again ... and does not intend to remove the enemy's ability to attack a second time – is called passive defense, and ends in downfall and destruction ... whoever does not wish to be beaten has no choice but to attack. The fighting side, that does not intend to oppress but to save its liberty and honor, he too has only one way available – the way of attack. Defensiveness by way of offensiveness, in order to deprive the enemy the option of attacking, is called ''active defense''.

The first attacks began around April 1936, and by the end of World War II, more than 250 Arabs had been killed. Examples include:
*After an Arab shooting at Carmel school in Tel Aviv, which resulted in the death of a Jewish child, Irgun members attacked an Arab neighborhood near [[Kerem Hatemanim]] in Tel Aviv, killing one Arab man and injuring another.
*On August 17, the Irgun responded to shootings by Arabs from the [[Jaffa]]–[[Jerusalem]] train towards Jews that were waiting by the train block on Herzl Street in Tel Aviv. The same day, when a Jewish child was injured by the shooting, Irgun members attacked a train on the same route, killing one Arab and injuring five.
During 1936, Irgun members carried out approximately ten attacks.

Throughout 1937 the Irgun continued this line of operation.
*On March 6, a Jew at Sabbath prayers at the [[Western Wall]] was shot by a local Arab. A few hours later, the Irgun shot at an Arab in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Rechavia.
*On June 29, a band of Arabs attacked an [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] bus on the Jerusalem – Tel Aviv road, killing one Jew. The following day, two Jews were also killed near [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Karkur]]. A few hours later, the Irgun carried out a number of operations.
**An Arab bus making its way from [[Lifta]] was attacked in Jerusalem.
**In two other locations in Jerusalem, Arabs were shot as well.
**In Tel Aviv, a hand grenade was thrown at an Arab coffee shop on Carmel St., injuring many of the patrons.
**Irgun members also injured an Arab on Reines St. in Tel Aviv.
**On September 5, the Irgun responded to the murder of a rabbi on his way home from prayer in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] by throwing explosives at an Arab bus that had left Lifta, injuring two female passengers and a British police officer.

A more complete list can be found [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s|here]].

At that time, however, these acts were not yet a part of a formulated policy of the Irgun.&lt;ref&gt;"Tagar u'Magen (Jabotinsky and the Etzel)" {{he icon}}, Jabtotinsky Publishing, pp. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of the aforementioned operations received a commander's approval, and Jabotinsky was not in favor of such actions at the time. Jabotinsky still hoped to establish a Jewish force out in the open that would not have to operate underground. However, the failure, in its eyes, of the [[Peel Commission]] and the renewal of violence on the part of the Arabs caused the Irgun to rethink its official policy.

===Increase in operations===
14 November 1937 was a watershed in Irgun activity. From that date, the Irgun increased its reprisals. Following an increase in the number of attacks aimed at Jews, including the killing of five [[kibbutz]] members near [[Kiryat Anavim]] (today kibbutz [[Ma'ale HaHamisha]]), the Irgun undertook a series of attacks in various places in Jerusalem, killing five Arabs. Operations were also undertaken in [[Haifa]] (shooting at the Arab-populated [[Wadi Nisnas]] neighborhood) and in [[Herzliya]]. The date is known as the day the policy of restraint ([[Havlagah]]) ended, or as [[Black Sunday, 1937|Black Sunday]] when operations resulted in the murder of 10 Arabs. This is when the organization fully changed its policy, with the approval of Jabotinsky and Headquarters to the policy of "active defense" in respect of Irgun actions.&lt;ref&gt;"The Birth of an Underground Organization", Yehuda Lapidot, pp. 62 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British responded with the arrest of Betar and Hatzohar members as suspected members of the Irgun. [[Military court]]s were allowed to act under "Time of Emergency Regulations" and even sentence people to death. In this manner [[Yehezkel Altman]], a guard in a Betar battalion in the [[Nahalat Yizchak]] neighborhood of Tel Aviv, shot at an Arab bus, without his commanders' knowledge. Altman was acting in response to a shooting at Jewish vehicles on the Tel Aviv–Jerusalem road the day before. He turned himself in later and was sentenced to death, a sentence which was later commuted to a life sentence.

Despite the arrests, Irgun members continued fighting. Jabotinsky lent his moral support to these activities. In a letter to Moshe Rosenberg on 18 March 1938 he wrote:
:Tell them: from afar I collect and save, as precious treasures, news items about your lives. I know of the obstacles that have not impeded your spirit; and I know of your actions as well. I am overjoyed that I have been blessed with such students.

Although the Irgun continued activities such as these, following Rosenberg's orders, they were greatly curtailed. Furthermore, in fear of the British threat of the death sentence for anyone found carrying a weapon, all operations were suspended for eight months. However, opposition to this policy gradually increased. In April, 1938, responding to the killing of six Jews, Betar members from the [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]] Brigade went on a reprisal mission, without the consent of their commander, as described by historian [[Avi Shlaim]]:
:On 21 April 1938, after several weeks of planning, he and two of his colleagues from the Irgun (Etzel) ambushed an Arab bus at a bend on a mountain road near Safad. They had a hand grenade, a gun and a pistol. Their plan was to destroy the engine so that the bus would fall off the side of the road and all the passengers would be killed. When the bus approached, they fired at it (not in the air, as Mailer has it) but the grenade lobbed by Ben Yosef did not detonate. The bus with its screaming and terrified passengers drove on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although the incident ended without casualties, the three were caught, and one of them – [[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]] was sentenced to death. Demonstrations around the country, as well as pressure from institutions and people such as [[Haim Weizman|Dr. Chaim Weizmann]] and the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]], [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]] did not reduce his sentence. In Shlomo Ben-Yosef's writings in Hebrew were later found:
:I am going to die and I am not sorry at all. Why? Because I am going to die for our country. Shlomo Ben-Yosef.

On 29 June 1938 he was executed, and was the first of the [[Olei Hagardom]]. The Irgun revered him after his death and many regarded him as an example.
In light of this, and due to the anger of the Irgun leadership over the decision to adopt a policy of restraint until that point, Jabotinsky relieved Rosenberg of his post and replaced him with David Raziel, who proved to be the most prominent Irgun commander until [[Menachem Begin]]. Jabotinsky simultaneously instructed the Irgun to end its policy of restraint, leading to armed offensive operations until the end of the Arab Revolt in 1939. In this time, the Irgun mounted about 40 operations against Arabs and Arab villages, for instance:
*After a Jewish father and son were killed in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], on June 6, 1938, Irgun members threw explosives from the roof of a nearby house, killing two Arabs and injuring four.
*The Irgun planted [[land mine]]s in a number of Arab [[Souk|markets]], primarily in places identified by the Irgun as activity centers of armed Arab gangs.
*Explosives detonated in the Arab [[souk]] in Jerusalem on July 15, killed ten local Arabs.
*In similar circumstances, 70 Arabs were killed by a [[land mine]] planted in the Arab souk in Haifa.

This action led the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] to discuss the disturbances in Palestine. On 23 February 1939 the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Malcolm MacDonald]] revealed the British intention to cancel the mandate and establish a state that would preserve Arab rights. This caused a wave of riots and attacks by Arabs against Jews. The Irgun responded four days later with a series of attacks on Arab buses and other sites. The British used military force against the Arab rioters and in the latter stages of the revolt by the Arab community in Palestine, it deteriorated into a series of internal gang wars.

====During the same period====
[[File:Irgun poster Erez Jisrael.jpg|thumb|1931 [[propaganda]] poster of the Irgun for distribution in [[central Europe]] – the map shows Israel defined in the borders of both [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]], which the Irgun claimed in its entirety for a future Jewish state.]]

At the same time, the Irgun also established itself in Europe. The Irgun built underground cells that participated in organizing migration to Palestine. The cells were made up almost entirely of Betar members, and their primary activity was military training in preparation for emigration to Palestine. Ties formed with the Polish authorities brought about courses in which Irgun commanders were trained by Polish officers in advanced military issues such as [[guerrilla warfare]], [[Tactic (method)|tactics]] and laying land mines. [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] was notable among the cell organizers in Europe. In 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the underground.According to Irgun activists Poland supplied the organization with 25,000 rifles, and additional material and weapons, by summer 1939 the Warsaw warehouses of Irgun held 5,000 rifles and 1,000 machine guns.The training and support by Poland would allow the organization to mobilize 30,000-40,000 men&lt;ref&gt;Perspectives on the Holocaust pp 71-91 The Irgun and the Destruction of European Jewry Yitshaq Ben-Ami page 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of handguns, rifles, explosives and ammunition stopped with the outbreak of World War II. Another field in which the Irgun operated was the training of pilots, so they could serve in the [[Air Force]] in the future war for independence, in the flight school in [[Lod]].

Towards the end of 1938 there was progress towards aligning the ideologies of the Irgun and the Haganah. Many abandoned the belief that the land would be divided and a Jewish state would soon exist. The Haganah founded פו"מ, a special operations unit, (pronounced ''poom''), which carried out reprisal attacks following Arab violence. These operations continued into 1939. Furthermore, the opposition within the [[Yishuv]] to illegal immigration significantly decreased, and the Haganah began to bring Jews to Palestine using rented ships, as the Irgun had in the past.

===First operations against the British===
The publishing of the MacDonald [[White Paper of 1939]] brought with it new edicts that were intended to lead to a more equitable settlement between Jews and Arabs. However, it was considered by some Jews to have an adverse effect on the continued development of the Jewish community in Palestine. Chief among these was the prohibition on selling land to Jews, and the smaller quotas for Jewish immigration. The entire Yishuv was furious at the contents of the White Paper. There were demonstrations against the "Treacherous Paper", as it was considered that it would preclude the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

Under the temporary command of [[Hanoch Kalai]], the Irgun began sabotaging strategic infrastructure such as electricity facilities, radio and telephone lines. It also started publicizing its activity and its goals. This was done in street announcements, newspapers, as well as the underground radio station [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]]. On August 26, 1939, the Irgun killed [[Ralph Cairns]], a British police officer who, as head of the Jewish Department in the [[Palestine Police]], had [[torture]]d a number of youths who were underground members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bell | first = John Bowyer | title = Terror Out of Zion | publisher = Transaction Publishers | year = 1996 | page = 48 | isbn = 9781560008705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ben-Yehuda | first = Nahman | title = Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice | publisher = State University of New York Press | year = 1993 | page = 155 | isbn = 0791411664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cairns and Ronald Barker, another British police officer, were killed by an Irgun [[improvised explosive device|IED]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mine Explosion In Jerusalem." OUR CORRESPONDENT, The Times [London, England] 28 Aug. 1939: 12. The Times Digital Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British increased their efforts against the Irgun. As a result, on August 31 the British police arrested members meeting in the Irgun headquarters. On the next day, September 1, 1939, World War II broke out.

==During World War II==
Following the outbreak of war, Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the [[New Zionist Organization]] voiced their support for Britain and France. In mid-September 1939 Raziel was moved from his place of detention in [[Tzrifin]]. This, among other events, encouraged the Irgun to announce a cessation of its activities against the British so as not to hinder Britain's effort to fight "the Hebrew's greatest enemy in the world – German [[Nazism]]". This announcement ended with the hope that after the war a Hebrew state would be founded "within the historical borders of the liberated homeland". After this announcement Irgun, Betar and Hatzohar members, including Raziel and the Irgun leadership, were gradually released from detention. The Irgun did not rule out joining the British army and the [[Jewish Brigade]]. Irgun members did enlist in various British units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/irgun.html |title=Irgun Zeva'i Le'umi—"The National Military Organization" (Etzel, I.Z.L.) |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irgun members also assisted British forces with intelligence in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. An Irgun unit also operated in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. David Raziel later died during one of these operations.

During the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], Betar members revolted numerous times against the Nazis in [[occupied Europe]]. The largest of these revolts was the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], in which an armed underground organization fought, formed by Betar and Hatzoar and known as the ''[[Jewish Military Union (League)|Żydowski Związek Wojskowy]] (ŻZW)'' (Jewish Military Union). Despite its political origins, the ŻZW accepted members without regard to political affiliation, and had contacts established before the war with elements of the Polish military. Because of differences over objectives and strategy, the ŻZW was unable to form a common front with the mainstream ghetto fighters of the [[Jewish Combat Organization|Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa]], and fought independently under the military leadership of [[Paweł Frenkiel]] and the political leadership of [[Dawid Wdowiński]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chaim Lazar, ''Matsada shel Varsha'' (Tel Aviv: Machon Jabotinsky, 1963), David Wdowiński, (1963), ''And we are not saved.''

There were instances of Betar members enlisted in the British military smuggling British weapons to the Irgun.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

From 1939 onwards, an Irgun delegation in the United States worked for the creation of a Jewish army made up of Jewish refugees and Jews from Palestine, to fight alongside the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]. In July 1943 the "Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People in Europe" was formed, and worked until the end of the war to rescue the [[Jews of Europe]] from the Nazis and to garner public support for a Jewish state. However, it was not until January 1944 that [[US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] established the [[War Refugee Board]], which achieved some success in saving European Jews.

===Second split===
[[File:Avraham Stern.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]]]]
Throughout this entire period, the British continued enforcing the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]]'s provisions, which included a ban on the sale of land, restrictions on Jewish immigration and increased vigilance against illegal immigration. Part of the reason why the British banned land sales (to anyone) was the confused state of the post Ottoman land registry; it was difficult to determine who actually owned the land that was for sale.

Within the ranks of the Irgun this created much disappointment and unrest, at the center of which was disagreement with the leadership of the [[New Zionist Organization]], David Raziel and the Irgun Headquarters. On June 18, 1939, Avraham (Yair) Stern and others of the leadership were released from prison and a rift opened between them the Irgun and Hatzohar leadership. The controversy centred on the issues of the underground movement submitting to public political leadership and fighting the British. On his release from prison Raziel resigned from Headquarters. To his chagrin, independent operations of senior members of the Irgun were carried out and some commanders even doubted Raziel's loyalty.

In his place, Stern was elected to the leadership. In the past, Stern had founded secret Irgun cells in Poland without Jabotinsky's knowledge, in opposition to his wishes. Furthermore, Stern was in favor of removing the Irgun from the authority of the New Zionist Organization, whose leadership urged Raziel to return to the command of the Irgun. He finally consented. Jabotinsky wrote to Raziel and to Stern, and these letters were distributed to the branches of the Irgun:

:... I call upon you: Let nothing disturb our unity. Listen to the commissioner (Raziel), whom I trust, and promise me that you and [[Betar]], the greatest of my life's achievements, will stand strong and united and allow me to continue with the hope for victory in the war to realize our old [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] dream....

Stern was sent a telegram with an order to obey Raziel, who was reappointed. However, these events did not prevent the splitting of the organization. Suspicion and distrust were rampant among the members. Out of the Irgun a new organization was created on July 17, 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac05.htm |title=The Split Within The Irgun |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first named "The National Military Organization in Israel" (as opposed to the "National Military Organization in '''the Land of''' Israel") and later on changed its name to [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], an acronym for '''Lohamei Herut Israel''', "Fighters for the Freedom of Israel", (לח"י – לוחמי חירות ישראל). Jabotinsky died in [[New York (state)|New York]] on August 4, 1940, yet this did not prevent the Lehi split. Following Jabotinsky's death, ties were formed between the Irgun and the [[New Zionist Organization]]. These ties would last until 1944, when the Irgun declared a revolt against the British.

The primary difference between the Irgun and the newly formed organization was its intention to fight the British in Palestine, regardless of their war against Germany. Later, additional operational and ideological differences developed that contradicted some of the Irgun's guiding principles. For example, the Lehi, unlike the Irgun, supported a [[population exchange]] with local Arabs.

The split damaged the Irgun both organizationally and from a morale point of view. As their spiritual leader, Jabotinsky's death also added to this feeling. Together, these factors brought about a mass abandonment by members. The British took advantage of this weakness to gather intelligence and arrest Irgun activists. The new Irgun leadership, which included Meridor, Yerachmiel Ha'Levi, [[Moshe Zvi Segal (Rabbi)|Rabbi Moshe Zvi Segal]] and others used the forced hiatus in activity to rebuild the injured organization. This period was also marked by more cooperation between the Irgun and the Jewish Agency, however [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s uncompromising demand that Irgun accept the Agency's command foiled any further cooperation.

In both the Irgun and the Haganah more voices were being heard opposing any cooperation with the British. Nevertheless, an Irgun operation carried out in the service of Britain was aimed at sabotaging pro-Nazi forces in [[Iraq]], including the assassination of [[Haj Amin al-Husayni]]. Among others, Raziel and [[Yaakov Meridor]] participated. On April 20, 1941, during a [[Luftwaffe]] air raid on [[Habbaniya Airport|RAF Hannaniya]] near [[Baghdad]], David Raziel, commander of the Irgun, was killed during the operation.

In late 1943 a joint Haganah – Irgun initiative was developed, to form a single fighting body, unaligned with any political party, by the name of עם לוחם (''Fighting Nation'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palmach.org.il/show_item.asp?levelId=38612&amp;itemId=5199&amp;itemType=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/1146 |title=Reflections on the assassination of Sheikh Yassin |publisher=Fromoccupiedpalestine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new body's first plan was to kidnap the British High Commissioner of Palestine, [[Harold MacMichael|Sir Harold MacMichael]] and take him to [[Cyprus]]. However, the Haganah leaked the planned operation and it was thwarted before it got off the ground. Nevertheless, at this stage the Irgun ceased its cooperation with the British. As [[Eliyahu Lankin]] tells in his book:
:Immediately following the failure of ''Fighting Nation'' practical discussions began in the Irgun Headquarters regarding a declaration of war.

==The Revolt==
In 1943 the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]], commanded by [[Władysław Anders]], arrived in Palestine from [[Iraq]]. The British insisted that no Jewish units of the army be created. Eventually, many of the soldiers of Jewish origin that arrived with the army were released and allowed to stay in Palestine. One of them was [[Menachem Begin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/sullivan/bios/MenachemBegin-Bio.html|title=Menachem Begin Biography|website=www.ibiblio.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose arrival in Palestine created new-found expectations within the Irgun and Betar. Begin had served as head of the Betar movement in [[Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/begin-bio.html |title=Menachem Begin – Biography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a respected leader. [[Yaakov Meridor]], then the commander of the Irgun, raised the idea of appointing Begin to the post. In late 1943, when Begin accepted the position, a new leadership was formed. Meridor became Begin's deputy, and other members of the board were Aryeh Ben Eliezer, Eliyahu Lankin, and Shlomo Lev Ami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/irgunrevolt.html|title=The Revolt is Proclaimed by the Irgun|last=Lapidot|first=Yehuda|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 1944 the Irgun put up posters all around the country, proclaiming a revolt against the British mandatory government. The posters began by saying that all of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movements stood by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] and over 25,000 Jews had enlisted in the British military. The hope to establish a Jewish army had died. European Jewry was trapped and was being destroyed, yet Britain, for its part, did not allow any rescue missions. This part of the document ends with the following words:
:[[MacDonald White Paper|The White Paper]] is still in effect. It is enforced, despite the betrayal of the Arabs and the loyalty of the Jews; despite the mass enlisting to the British Army; despite the [[ceasefire]] and the quiet in The Land of Israel; despite the massacre of masses of the Jewish people in Europe....

:The facts are simple and horrible as one. Over the last four years of [[World War II|the war]] we have lost millions of the best of our people; millions more are in danger of eradication. And The Land of Israel is closed off and quarantined because the British rule it, realizing the White Paper, and strives for the destruction of our people's last hope.

The Irgun then declared that, for its part, the ceasefire was over and they were now at war with the British. It demanded the transfer of rule to a Jewish government, to implement ten policies. Among these were the mass evacuation of Jews from Europe, the signing of treaties with any state that recognized the Jewish state's sovereignty, including Britain, granting social justice to the state's residents, and full equality to the Arab population. The proclamation ended with:
:The God of Israel, God of Hosts, will be at our side. There is no retreat. Liberty or death.... The fighting youth will not recoil in the face of sacrifices and suffering, blood and torment. They will not surrender, so long as our days of old are not renewed, so long as our nation is not ensured a homeland, liberty, honor, bread, justice and law.

The Irgun began this campaign rather weakly. At the time of the start of the revolt, it was only about 1,000 strong, including some 200 fighters. It possessed about 4 submachine guns, 40 rifles, 60 pistols, 150 hand grenades, and 2,000 kilograms of explosive material, and its funds were about £800.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

===Struggle against the British===
{{Main|Jewish insurgency in Palestine}}
The Irgun began a militant operation against the symbols of government, in an attempt to harm the regime's operation as well as its reputation. The first attack was on February 12, 1944 at the government immigration offices, a symbol of the immigration laws. The attacks went smoothly and ended with no casualties—as they took place on a Saturday night, when the buildings were empty—in the three largest cities: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. On February 27 the income tax offices were bombed. Parts of the same cities were blown up, also on a Saturday night; prior warnings were put up near the buildings. On March 23 the national headquarters building of the British police in the [[Migrash Harusim|Russian Compound]] in Jerusalem was attacked, and part of it was blown up. These attacks in the first few months were sharply condemned by the organized leadership of the Yishuv and by the Jewish Agency, who saw them as dangerous provocations.

At the same time the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] also renewed its attacks against the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/120/Chapter+Eight+The+Struggle+for+the+Establishment+of+the+State+of+Israel.htm |title=Chapter Eight: The Struggle for the Establishment of the State of Israel |publisher=Jewishagency.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irgun continued to attack police stations and headquarters, and [[Tegart fort|Tegart Fort]], a fortified police station (today the location of [[Latrun]]). One relatively complex operation was the takeover of the radio station in [[Ramallah]], on May 17, 1944.

One symbolic act by the Irgun happened before [[Yom Kippur]] of 1944. They plastered notices around town, warning that no British officers should come to the [[Western Wall]] on Yom Kippur, and for the first time since the mandate began no British police officers were there to prevent the Jews from the traditional [[Shofar]] blowing at the end of the fast.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/history/hayom/2a-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; After the fast that year the Irgun attacked four police stations in Arab settlements. In order to obtain weapons, the Irgun carried out "confiscation" operations – they robbed British armouries and smuggled stolen weapons to their own hiding places. During this phase of activity the Irgun also cut all of its official ties with the [[New Zionist Organization]], so as not to tie their fate in the underground organization.

Begin wrote in his [[memoir]]s, ''[[The Revolt]]'':
:History and experience taught us that if we are able to destroy the prestige of the British in Palestine, the regime will break. Since we found the enslaving government's weak point, we did not let go of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Underground exiles===
{{Main|Irgun and Lehi internment in Africa}}
In October 1944 the British began expelling hundreds of arrested Irgun and Lehi members to detention camps in [[Africa]]. 251 detainees from [[Latrun]] were flown on thirteen planes, on October 19 to a camp in [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]]. Eleven additional transports were made. Throughout the period of their detention, the detainees often initiated rebellions and hunger strikes. Many escape attempts were made until July 1948 when the exiles were returned to Israel. While there were numerous successful escapes from the camp itself, only nine men actually made it back all the way. One noted success was that of [[Yaakov Meridor]], who escaped nine times before finally reaching Europe in April 1948. These tribulations were the subject of his book ''Long is the Path to Freedom: Chronicles of one of the Exiles''.

===Hunting Season===
{{Main|The Hunting Season}}
On November 6, 1944, [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], British Deputy Resident Minister of State in [[Cairo]] was assassinated by Lehi members [[Eliyahu Hakim]] and [[Eliyahu Bet-Zuri]]. This act raised concerns within the Yishuv from the British regime's reaction to the underground's violent acts against them. Therefore, the Jewish Agency decided on starting a ''Hunting Season'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac07.htm |title=The 'Hunting Season' |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/history/lapidot/8.htm |title=Besiege / Yehuda Lapidut – The Hunting Season |publisher=Daat.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the ''saison'', (from the [[French language|French]] "la saison de chasse").

The Irgun's recuperation was noticeable when it began to renew its cooperation with the Lehi in May 1945, when it sabotaged oil pipelines, telephone lines and railroad bridges. All in all, over 1,000 members of the Irgun and Lehi were arrested and interned in British camps during the ''Saison''. Eventually the Hunting Season died out, and there was even talk of cooperation with the Haganah leading to the formation of the [[Jewish Resistance Movement]].

===The Jewish Resistance Movement===
{{Main|The Jewish Resistance Movement}}
[[File:KD 1946.JPG|thumb|The King David Hotel after the bombing, photo from [[The Jerusalem Post|''The Palestine Post'']]]]

Towards the end of July 1945 the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] in Britain was elected to power. The Yishuv leadership had high hopes that this would change the anti-Zionist policy that the British maintained at the time. However, these hopes were quickly dashed when the government limited Jewish immigration, with the intention that the population of [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]) would not be more than one third of the total. This, along with the stepping up of arrests and their pursuit of underground members and illegal immigration organizers led to the formation of the [[The Jewish Resistance Movement|Jewish Resistance Movement]]. This body consolidated the armed resistance to the British of the Irgun, Lehi, and Haganah. For ten months the Irgun and the Lehi cooperated and they carried out nineteen attacks and defense operations. The Haganah and Palmach carried out ten such operations. The Haganah also assisted in landing 13,000 illegal immigrants.

Tension between the underground movements and the British increased with the increase in operations. On April 23, 1945 an operation undertaken by the Irgun to gain weapons from the [[Tegart fort]] at [[Ramat Gan]] resulted in a firefight. One Irgun member was killed and his body was later hanged on the fort's fence. Another fighter, [[Yizchak Bilu]], was killed as well in a diversionary ploy – an explosive device fell out of his hand, and he leapt onto it in order to save his comrades, who were also carrying explosives. A third fighter, [[Dov Gruner]], was caught. He stood trial and was sentenced to be death by hanging, refusing to sign a pardon request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac14.htm |title=The Gallows |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, British relations with the Yishuv worsened, building up to [[Operation Agatha]] of June 29. The authorities ignored the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]]'s recommendation to allow 100,000 Jews into Palestine at once. As a result of the discovery of documents tying the Jewish Agency to the Jewish Resistance Movement, the Irgun was asked to speed up the plans for the [[King David Hotel bombing]] of July 22.&lt;ref&gt;Jabotinsky Institute Archives (k-4 1/11/5)&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel was where the documents were located, the base for the British Secretariat, the military command and a branch of the [[Criminal Investigation Department|Criminal Investigation Division]] of the police. The Irgun later claimed to have sent a warning that was ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Menachem Begin, ''The Revolt''. 1951, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; 91 people were killed in the attack where a 350&amp;nbsp;kg bomb was placed in the basement of the hotel and caused a large section of it to collapse. Only 13 were British soldiers.

===Further struggle against the British===
[[File:Menahem Begin during his "Rabbi Sassover" period with wife Aliza and son Benyamin-Zeev in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]] as "Rabbi Sassover", with wife Aliza and son Benyamin-Zeev, Tel Aviv, December 1946]]

The King David Hotel bombing and the arrest of Jewish Agency and other Yishuv leaders as part of [[Operation Agatha]] caused the Haganah to cease their armed activity against the British. Yishuv and Jewish Agency leaders were released from prison. From then until the end of the British mandate, resistance activities were led by the Irgun and Lehi. In early September 1946 the Irgun renewed its attacks against civil structures, railroads, communication lines and bridges. One operation was the attack on the train station in Jerusalem, in which [[Meir Feinstein]] was arrested and later committed suicide awaiting execution. According to the Irgun these sort of armed attacks were legitimate, since the trains primarily served the British, for redeployment of their forces. The Irgun also publicized leaflets, in three languages, not to use specific trains in danger of being attacked. For a while the British stopped train traffic at night. The Irgun also carried out repeated attacks against military and police traffic using disguised, electronically-detonated roadside mines which could be detonated by an operator hiding nearby as a vehicle passed, carried out arms raids against military bases and police stations (often disguised as British soldiers), launched bombing, shooting, and mortar attacks against military and police installations and checkpoints, and robbed banks to gain funds as a result of losing access to Haganah funding following the collapse of the Jewish Resistance Movement.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

On October 31, 1946, in response to the British barring entry of Jews from Palestine, the Irgun [[1946 British Embassy bombing|blew up the British Embassy]] in [[Rome]], a center of British efforts to monitor and stop Jewish immigration. The Irgun also carried out a few other operations in Europe: a British troop train was derailed and an attempt against another troop train failed. An attack on a British officers club in [[Vienna]] took place in 1947, and an attack on another British officer's club in Vienna and a sergeant's club in [[Germany]] took place in 1948.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;

In December 1946 a sentence of 18 years and 18 beatings was handed down to a young Irgun member for robbing a bank. The Irgun made good on a threat they made&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FLOGGING SENTENCE|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2703695|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=25 December 1946|quote=He was convicted following a bank hold-up In September.  Irgun Zvai Leumi broadcast a threat that if the sentence were confirmed, British Army officers would be flogged in retaliation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and after the detainee was whipped, Irgun members kidnapped British officers and beat them in public. The operation, known as the "[[Night of the Beatings]]" brought an end to British punitive beatings. The British, taking these acts seriously, moved many British families in Palestine into the confines of military bases, and some moved home.

[[File:Bombe Irgoun 29 dec 1947.jpg|thumb|left|Arab bus after a bomb attack by the Irgun, 29 December 1947]]
On February 14, 1947, [[Ernest Bevin]] announced that the Jews and Arabs would not be able to agree on any British proposed solution for the land, and therefore the issue must be brought to the [[United Nations]] (UN) for a final decision. The Yishuv thought of the idea to transfer the issue to the UN as a British attempt to achieve delay while a UN inquiry commission would be established, and its ideas discussed, and all the while the Yishuv would weaken. [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet|Foundation for Immigration B]] increased the number of ships bringing in Jewish refugees. The British still strictly enforced the policy of limited Jewish immigration and illegal immigrants were placed in detention camps in [[Cyprus]], which increased the anger of the Jewish community towards the mandate government.

The Irgun stepped up its activity and from February 19 until March 3 it attacked 18 British military camps, convoy routes, vehicles, and other facilities. The most notable of these attacks was the bombing of a British officer's club located in Goldschmidt House in Jerusalem, which was in a heavily guarded security zone. Covered by machine-gun fire, an Irgun assault team in a truck penetrated the security zone and lobbed explosives into the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac12.htm |title=The Raid On The Jerusalem Officers Club |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen people, including two officers, were killed.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; As a result, martial law was imposed over much of the country, enforced by approximately 20,000 British soldiers. Despite this, attacks continued throughout the martial law period. The most notable one was an Irgun attack against the Royal Army Pay Corps base at the [[Schneller Orphanage]], in which a British soldier was killed.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

Throughout its struggle against the British, the Irgun sought to publicize its cause around the world. By humiliating the British, it attempted to focus global attention on Palestine, hoping that any British overreaction would be widely reported, and thus result in more political pressure against the British. Begin described this strategy as turning Palestine into a "glass house". The Irgun also re-established many representative offices internationally, and by 1948 operated in 23 states. In these countries the Irgun sometimes acted against the local British representatives or led public relations campaigns against Britain. According to [[Bruce Hoffman]]: "''In an era long before the advent of 24/7 global news coverage and instantaneous satellite-transmitted broadcasts, the Irgun deliberately attempted to appeal to a worldwide audience far beyond the immediate confines of its local struggle, and beyond even the ruling regime's own homeland''."&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

===The Acre Prison break===
{{Main|Acre Prison break}}
On April 16, 1947, Dov Gruner, Yehiel Dresner, Eliezer Kashani, and Mordechai El'kachi were hanged, while singing [[Hatikvah]]. On April 21 [[Meir Feinstein]] and Lehi member [[Moshe Barazani]] blew themselves up, using an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED), hours before their scheduled hanging. And on May 4 one of the Irgun's largest operations took place – the raid of the prison in the citadel in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The operation was carried out by 23 men, commanded by [[Dov Cohen]] – AKA "Shimshon", along with the help of the Irgun and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] prisoners inside the prison. The raid allowed 41 underground members to escape, although some were caught outside of the prison, and some were killed in the escape. Along with the underground movement members, other criminals – including 214 Arabs&lt;ref&gt;Horne, Edward (1982). A Job Well Done (Being a History of The Palestine Police Force 1920–1948). The Anchor Press. {{ISBN|0-9508367-0-2}}. p. 310. States 41 Jews escaped and that nine terrorists and one Arab convict were killed, 13 arrested of whom 8 wounded.&lt;/ref&gt; – also escaped. Five of the attackers were caught and three of them – [[Avshalom Haviv]], [[Meir Nakar]], and [[Yaakov Weiss]], were sentenced to death.

===The Sergeants affair===
{{Main|The Sergeants affair}}
[[File:Hanged sergeants.jpg|thumb|Two British sergeants hanged by the Irgun]]

After the death sentences of the three were confirmed, the Irgun tried to save them by kidnapping [[hostage]]s — British sergeants Clifford Martin and Mervyn Paice — in the streets of [[Netanya]]. British forces closed off and combed the area in search of the two, but did not find them. On July 29, 1947, in the afternoon, Meir Nakar, Avshalom Haviv, and Yaakov Weiss were executed. Approximately thirteen hours later the hostages were hanged in retaliation by the Irgun and their bodies, booby-trapped with an explosive, afterwards strung up from trees in woodlands south of Netanya. This action caused an outcry in Britain and was condemned both there and by Jewish leaders in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887512,00.html |title=Eye for an Eye for an Eye, Time Magazine. Aug. 11, 1947 |publisher=Time.com |date=1947-08-11 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode has been given as a major influence on the British decision to terminate the Mandate and leave Palestine. The [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine|United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP)]] was also influenced by this and other actions. At the same time another incident was developing – the events of the ship [[Exodus (ship)|''Exodus 1947'']]. The 4,500 Holocaust survivors on board were not allowed to enter Palestine. UNSCOP also covered the events. Some of its members were even present at [[Haifa]] port when the putative immigrants were forcefully removed from their ship (later found to have been rigged with an IED by some of its passengers) onto the deportation ships, and later commented that this strong image helped them press for an immediate solution for Jewish immigration and the question of Palestine.

Two weeks later, the House of Commons convened for a special debate on events in Palestine, and concluded that their soldiers should be withdrawn as soon as possible.

==The 1948 Palestine War==
{{Main|1948 Palestine War}}
[[File:בגין (במרכז) עם משוחררי אצ"ל, 1948.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]] with Irgun members, 1948]]

[[File:Mitzad.jpg|thumb|Irgun parade in 1948]]

UNSCOP's conclusion was a unanimous decision to end the British mandate, and a majority decision to divide [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]) between a Jewish state and an Arab state. During the UN's deliberations regarding the committee's recommendations the Irgun avoided initiating any attacks, so as not to influence the UN negatively on the idea of a Jewish state. On November 29 the [[UN General Assembly]] voted in favor of ending the mandate and [[1947 UN Partition Plan|establishing two states]] on the land. That very same day the Irgun and the Lehi renewed their attacks on British targets. The next day the local Arabs began attacking the Jewish community, thus beginning the first stage of the [[1948 Palestine War]]. The first attacks on Jews were in Jewish neighborhoods of [[Jerusalem]], in and around [[Jaffa]], and in [[Bat Yam]], [[Holon]], and the [[Ha'Tikvah]] neighborhood in [[Tel Aviv]].

In the autumn of 1947, the Irgun had approximately 4,000 members. The goal of the organization at that point was the conquest of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea for the future Jewish state, and preventing Arab forces from driving out the Jewish community. The Irgun became almost an overt organization, establishing military bases in [[Ramat Gan]] and [[Petah Tikva]]. It began recruiting openly, thus significantly increasing in size. During the war the Irgun fought alongside the Lehi and the Haganah in the front against the Arab attacks. At first the Haganah maintained a defensive policy, as it had until then, but after the [[Convoy of 35]] incident it completely abandoned its policy of restraint: "Distinguishing between individuals is no longer possible, for now – it is a war, and the even the innocent shall not be absolved."&lt;ref&gt;Netanel Lorch. ''The Edge of the Sword: Israel's War of Independence, 1947-1949'', Massada Publishing, 1958. pp. 85 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irgun also began carrying out reprisal missions, as it had under David Raziel's command. At the same time though, it published announcements calling on the Arabs to lay down their weapons and maintain a ceasefire:
:The National Military Organization has warned you, if the murderous attacks on Jewish civilians shall continue, its soldiers will penetrate your centers of activity and plague you. You have not heeded the warning. You continued to harm our brothers and murder them in wild cruelty. Therefore soldiers of the National Military Organization will go on the attack, as we have warned you.

:... However even in these frenzied times, when Arab and Jewish blood is spilled at the British enslaver, we hereby call upon you ... to stop the attacks and create peace between us. We do not want a war with you. We are certain that neither do you want a war with us...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/ezrachut/begin/47_20-2.htm |title=Petition of Our Arab Neighbors: Announcement in Arabic to the Arab Rioters |language=Hebrew |publisher=Daat.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the mutual attacks continued. The Irgun attacked the Arab villages of [[Al-Tira (Haifa)|Tira]] near [[Haifa]], [[Yehudiya]] ('Abassiya) in the center, and [[Shuafat]] by Jerusalem. The Irgun also attacked in the [[Wadi Rushmiya]] neighborhood in Haifa and [[Abu Kabir]] in Jaffa. On December 29 Irgun units arrived by boat to the Jaffa shore and a gunfight between them and Arab gangs ensued. The following day a bomb was thrown from a speeding Irgun car at a group of Arab men waiting to be hired for the day at the Haifa oil refinery, resulting in seven Arabs killed, and dozens injured. In response, some Arab workers [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre|attacked Jews in the area]], killing 41. This sparked a Haganah response in [[Balad al-Shaykh raid|Balad al-Sheykh]], which resulted in the deaths of 60 civilians. The Irgun's goal in the fighting was to move the battles from Jewish populated areas to Arab populated areas. On January 1, 1948 the Irgun attacked again in Jaffa, its men wearing British uniforms; later in the month it attacked in [[Beit Nabala]], a base for many Arab fighters. On 5 January 1948 the Irgun detonated a lorry bomb outside Jaffa's Ottoman built Town Hall, killing 14 and injuring 19.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Scotsman]]'', 6 January 1948; Walid Khalidi states that 25 civilians were killed.

During the operation, the villagers fiercely resisted the attack, and a battle broke out. In the end, the Irgun and Lehi forces advanced gradually through house-to-house fighting. The village was only taken after the Irgun began systematically dynamiting houses, and after a Palmach unit intervened and employed mortar fire to silence the villagers' sniper positions.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Milstein&gt;Milstein, Uri (1998). ''History of Israel's War of Independence: Out of Crisis Came Decision''. Volume 4, University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt; The operation resulted in five Jewish fighters dead and 40 injured. Some 100 to 120 villagers were also killed.&lt;ref&gt;B. Morris, 2004, ''The Birth of the Palestinian refugee problem revisited'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

There are allegations that Irgun and Lehi forces committed war crimes during and after the capture of the village. These allegations include reports that fleeing individuals and families were fired at, and prisoners of war were killed after their capture. A Haganah report writes:
:''The conquest of the village was carried out with great cruelty. Whole families – women, old people, children – were killed. ... Some of the prisoners moved to places of detention, including women and children, were murdered viciously by their captors.''&lt;ref&gt;quoted by B. Morris, 2004, ''The Birth of the Palestinian refugee problem revisited'', p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that this incident was an event that accelerated the Arab exodus from Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/israel_at_50/profiles/81305.stm | work=BBC News | title=Menachem Begin | date=April 21, 1998 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irgun cooperated with the Haganah in the conquest of Haifa. At the regional commander's request, on April 21 the Irgun took over an Arab post above Hadar Ha'Carmel as well as the Arab neighborhood of Wadi Nisnas, adjacent to the Lower City.

The Irgun acted independently in the conquest of Jaffa (part of the proposed Arab State according to the [[UN Partition Plan]]). On April 25 Irgun units, about 600 strong, left the Irgun base in [[Ramat Gan]] towards Arab Jaffa. Difficult battles ensued, and the Irgun faced resistance from the Arabs as well as the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac18.htm |title=The Conquest Of Jaffa |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the command of [[Amichai Paglin|Amichai "Gidi" Paglin]], the Irgun's chief operations officer, the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya, which threatened the city of [[Tel Aviv]]. Afterwards the force continued to the sea, towards the area of the port, and using mortars, shelled the southern neighborhoods.
[[File:Manshiyeh.jpg|thumb|left|The Manshiya quarter between [[Jaffa]] and Tel Aviv after the Irgun mortar bombardment.]] In his report concerning the fall of Jaffa the local Arab military commander, Michel Issa, wrote: "Continuous shelling with mortars of the city by Jews for four days, beginning 25 April, [...] caused inhabitants of city, unaccustomed to such bombardment, to panic and flee."&lt;ref&gt;W. Khalidi, 1998, "Selected Documents on the 1948 Palestine War", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 27(3), p. 60–105&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morris the shelling was done by the Irgun. Their objective was "to prevent constant military traffic in the city, to break the spirit of the enemy troops [and] to cause chaos among the civilian population in order to create a mass flight."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Morris, 2004, 'The Birth ... Revisited', p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; High Commissioner Cunningham wrote a few days later "It should be made clear that IZL attack with mortars was indiscriminate and designed to create panic among the civilian inhabitants."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The British demanded the evacuation of the newly conquered city, and militarily intervened, ending the Irgun offensive. Heavy British shelling against Irgun positions in Jaffa failed to dislodge them, and when British armor pushed into the city, the Irgun resisted; a bazooka team managed to knock out one tank, buildings were blown up and collapsed onto the streets as the armor advanced, and Irgun men crawled up and tossed live dynamite sticks onto the tanks. The British withdrew, and opened negotiations with the Jewish authorities.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; An agreement was worked out, under which Operation Hametz would be stopped and the Haganah would not attack Jaffa until the end of the Mandate. The Irgun would evacuate Manshiya, with Haganah fighters replacing them. British troops would patrol its southern end and occupy the police fort. The Irgun had previously agreed with the Haganah that British pressure would not lead to withdrawal from Jaffa and that custody of captured areas would be turned over to the Haganah. The city ultimately fell on May 13 after Haganah forces entered the city and took control of the rest of the city, from the south – part of the ''Hametz Operation'' which included the conquest of a number of villages in the area. The battles in Jaffa were a great victory for the Irgun. This operation was the largest in the history of the organization, which took place in highly built up area that had many militants in shooting positions. During the battles explosives were used in order to break into homes and continue forging a way though them. Furthermore, this was the first occasion in which the Irgun had directly fought British forces, reinforced with armor and heavy weaponry. The city began these battles with an Arab population estimated at 70,000, which shrank to some 4,100 Arab residents by the end of major hostilities. Since the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya on its own, causing the flight of many of Jaffa's residents, the Irgun took credit for the conquest of Jaffa. It had lost 42 dead and about 400 wounded during the battle.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;

==Integration with the IDF and the Altalena Affair==
{{Main|Altalena Affair}}

On May 14, 1948 [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|the establishment]] of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] was proclaimed. The declaration of independence was followed by the establishment of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), and the process of absorbing all military organizations into the IDF started. On June 1, an agreement had been signed Between [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yisrael Galili]] for the absorption of the Irgun into the IDF. One of the clauses stated that the Irgun had to stop smuggling arms. Meanwhile, in France, Irgun representatives purchased a ship, renamed ''[[Altalena]]'' (a pseudonym of [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]), and weapons. The ship sailed on June 11 and arrived at the Israeli coast on June 20, during the first truce of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. Despite [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 50]] declared an arms embargo in the region, neither side respected it.&lt;ref&gt;(Benny (2008), "1948: The First Arab-Israeli War", Yale University Press, New Haven, pp. 269–71, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12696-9}}).[[Mordechai Weingarten]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ship arrived the Israeli government, headed by Ben-Gurion, was adamant in its demand that the Irgun surrender and hand over all of the weapons. Ben-Gurion said: "We must decide whether to hand over power to Begin or to order him to cease his activities. If he does not do so, we will open fire! Otherwise, we must decide to disperse our own army."

[[File:Altalena off Tel-Aviv beach.jpg|thumb|left|''Altalena'' on fire after the Israeli government quelling of the Irgun's attempt to smuggle weapons]]
There were two confrontations between the newly formed IDF and the Irgun: when ''Altalena'' reached [[Kfar Vitkin]] in the late afternoon of Sunday, June 20 many Irgun militants, including Begin, waited on the shore. A clash with the [[Alexandroni Brigade]], commanded by Dan Even (Epstein), occurred. Fighting ensued and there were a number of casualties on both sides. The clash ended in a ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander, and with the ship, now reinforced with local Irgun members, including Begin, sailing to Tel Aviv, where the Irgun had more supporters.
Many Irgun members, who joined the IDF earlier that month, left their bases and concentrated on the Tel Aviv beach. A confrontation between them and the IDF units started. In response, Ben-Gurion ordered [[Yigael Yadin]] (acting Chief of Staff) to concentrate large forces on the Tel Aviv beach and to take the ship by force. Heavy guns were transferred to the area and at four in the afternoon, Ben-Gurion ordered the shelling of the ''Altalena''. One of the shells hit the ship, which began to burn.
Sixteen Irgun fighters were killed in the confrontation with the army; six were killed in the Kfar Vitkin area and ten on [[Tel Aviv beach]]. Three IDF soldiers were killed: two at Kfar Vitkin and one in Tel Aviv.

After the shelling of the ''Altalena'', more than 200 Irgun fighters were arrested. Most of them were freed several weeks later. The Irgun militants were then fully integrated with the IDF and not kept in separate units.

The initial agreement for the integration of the Irgun into the IDF did not include [[Jerusalem]], where a small remnant of the Irgun called the ''Jerusalem Battalion'', numbering around 400 fighters, and Lehi, continued to operate independently of the government. Following the assassination of UN Envoy for Peace [[Folke Bernadotte]] by Lehi in September 1948, the Israeli government determined to immediately dismantle the underground organizations. An ultimatum was issued to the Irgun to liquidate itself and integrate into the IDF or be destroyed. The Irgun accepted the ultimatum, and shortly afterward, its fighters began enlisting in the IDF and turning over their arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19480923&amp;id=13ssAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KcsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3395,2171340&amp;hl=en|title=Herald-Journal - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Propaganda ==
In order to increase the popularity of the Irgun organization and ideology, Irgun employed propaganda. This propaganda was mainly aimed at the British, and included the idea of [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]]. According to Irgun [[:File:Irgun_poster_Erez_Jisrael.jpg|propaganda posters]], the Jewish state was not only to encompass all of [[Mandatory Palestine]], but also [[The Emirate of Transjordan]].&lt;ref name="Irgun Documentation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tavin and Alexander|first1=Eli and Yonah|title=Psychological Warfare and Propaganda: Irgun Documentation|publisher=Scholarly Resources Inc.|isbn=0-8420-2188-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Labour party came into power in Britain in July 1945, Irgun published an announcement entitled, "We shall give the Labour Government a Chance to Keep Its Word." In this publication, Irgun stated, "Before it came to power, this Party undertook to return the Land of Israel to the people of Israel as a free state... Men and parties in opposition or in their struggle with their rivals, have, for twenty-five years, made us many promises and undertaken clear obligations; but, on coming to power, they have gone back on their words."&lt;ref name="Irgun Documentation"/&gt; Another publication, which followed a British counter-offensive against Jewish organizations in Palestine, Irgun released a document titled, "Mobilize the Nation!" Irgun used this publication to paint the British regime as hostile to the Jewish people, even comparing the British to the Nazis. In response to what was seen as British aggression, Irgun called for a Hebrew Provisional Government, and a Hebrew Liberation Army.&lt;ref name="Irgun Documentation"/&gt;

Leaders within the mainstream Jewish organizations, the [[Jewish Agency]], [[Haganah]] and [[Histadrut]], as well as the British authorities, routinely condemned Irgun operations as [[terrorism]] and branded it an illegal organization as a result of the group's attacks on [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s|civilian targets]].&lt;ref name=bbcprofile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7702408.stm |title=Profile:Rahm Emanuel | work=BBC News | date=November 7, 2008 |accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, privately at least the Haganah kept a dialogue with the dissident groups.&lt;ref name=WilsonD11&gt;{{cite book |title=With 6th Airborne Division in Palestine 1945–48 |last=Wilson |first=Dare |year=2008 |publisher=Pen&amp; Sword Books Ltd |isbn=978-1-84415-771-6 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ironically, in early 1947, "the British army in Mandate Palestine banned the use of the term 'terrorist' to refer to the Irgun zvai Leumi ... because it implied that British forces had reason to be terrified."&lt;ref&gt;Ray C. Rist (editor), Martha Crenshaw (article author).

Irgun attacks prompted a formal declaration from the [[World Zionist Congress]] in 1946, which strongly condemned "the shedding of innocent blood as a means of political warfare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Zionists Condemn Palestine Terror |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/12/24/archives/zionists-condemn-palestine-terror-basle-congress-bars-joining-in.html?sq=Irgun+terrorist+president&amp;scp=13&amp;st=p |quote=The World Zionist Congress in its final session here strongly condemned by a vote early today terrorist activities in Palestine and "the shedding of innocent blood as a means of political warfare. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 24, 1946 |accessdate=2008-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli government, in September 1948, acting in response to the assassination of Count [[Folke Bernadotte]], outlawed the Irgun and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] groups, declaring them terrorist organizations under the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance.&lt;ref name=SshmidtFCPRIOT&gt;{{cite book|last=Dr. Yvonne Schmidt|title=Foundations of Civil and Political Rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories |page=254|isbn=978-3-638-94450-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51gNA4Go_lUC&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;ots=MTU_nhKFpv&amp;dq=%22Prevention%20of%20Terrorism%20Ordinance%22%20%20Irgun&amp;pg=PA254}}No 33 of 5708-1948 – 23 September 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a letter signed by a number of prominent Jewish figures including [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[Rabbi]] [[Jessurun Cardozo]], which described Irgun as "a terrorist, [[right-wing]], [[chauvinist]] organization in Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wrestling With Zion: Re-thinking Jewish Tradition and the Ongoing Crisis in the Middle East

Teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. By gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and widespread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute."&lt;ref name=shatz&gt;{{cite book |title=Prophets Outcast |author=Adam Shatz |pages=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after World War II, Winston Churchill said "we should never have stopped immigration before the war", but that the Irgun were "the vilest [[gangster]]s" and that he would "never forgive the Irgun terrorists."&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;{{cite book |title=Churchill and the Jew Quotings |author=Martin Gilbert |page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[US military intelligence]] report, dated January 1948, described Irgun recruiting tactics amongst [[Displaced Persons]] (DP) in the camps across Germany:
:'Irgun ... seems to be concentrating on the DP police force. This is an old technique in Eastern Europe and in all police states. By controlling the police, a small, unscrupulous group of determined people can impose its will on a peaceful and inarticulate majority; it is done by threats, intimidation, by violence and if need be bloodshed ... they have embarked upon a course of violence within the camps.'&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Green, 'Taking sides – America's secret relations with a militant Israel 1948/1967'. Faber and Faber, London. 1984. p. 49. Quoting weekly intelligence report 87 from the Office of the Director of Intelligence (Germany), dated 10 January 1948. Copy in publications file, Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Record Group 319, National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clare Hollingworth]], the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Scotsman]]'' correspondent in Jerusalem during 1948 wrote several outspoken reports after spending several weeks in [[West Jerusalem]]:

:Irgun is in fact rapidly becoming the 'SS' of the new state. There is also a strong 'Gestapo' – but no-one knows who is in it.

{{quote|'The shopkeepers are afraid not so much of shells as of raids by Irgun Zvai Leumi and the Stern Gang.

In 2006, Simon McDonald, the British ambassador in Tel Aviv, and John Jenkins, the Consul-General in Jerusalem, wrote in response to a pro-Irgun commemoration of the [[King David Hotel bombing]]: "We do not think that it is right for an act of terrorism, which led to the loss of many lives, to be commemorated." They also called for the removal of plaques at the site which presented as a fact that the deaths were due to the British ignoring warning calls. The plaques, in their original version, read:

Warning phone calls had been made urging the hotel's occupants to leave immediately. For reasons known only to the British the hotel was not evacuated and after 25 minutes the bombs exploded, and to the Irgun's regret and dismay 91 persons were killed.

McDonald and Jenkins said that no such warning calls were made, adding that even if they had, "this does not absolve those who planted the bomb from responsibility for the deaths."&lt;ref name=LTimes1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article690085.ece |title=British anger at terror celebration | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Ned | last1=Parker | first2=Stephen | last2=Farrell | date=July 20, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ha'aretz]]'' columnist and Israeli historian [[Tom Segev]] wrote of the Irgun: "In the second half of 1940, a few members of the Irgun Zvai Leumi (National Military Organization) &amp;ndash; the anti-British terrorist group sponsored by the Revisionists and known by its acronym Etzel, and to the British simply as the Irgun &amp;ndash; made contact with representatives of Fascist Italy, offering to cooperate against the British."&lt;ref name=segev/&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]] wrote in his book ''[[The Case for Israel]]'' that unlike the Haganah, the policy of the Irgun had been to encourage the flight of local Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Case for Israel |author=Alan Dershowitz |page=81 |chapter=12: Did Israel Create the Arab Refugee Problem?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joint Advertising Marketing Research &amp; Studies''' ('''JAMRS''') is a program run by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to maintain sufficient levels of [[Volunteer military|voluntary service]] in the [[United States Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jamrs.defense.gov/ |title=JOINT ADVERTISING, MARKET RESEARCH &amp; STUDIES |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This objective is facilitated by the collection of information about U.S. persons of enlistment age, surveys, and other [[market research]] in a central database made available to military recruiters.

==JAMRS Recruiting Database==
JAMRS manages a database (subcontracted by [[Equifax]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/09/few-good-kids |publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |author=David Goodman |title=A Few Good Kids? |date=September–October 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectcensored.org/the-pentagons-child-recruiting-strategy/ |title=The Pentagon's Child Recruiting Strategy |author= Gary Evans |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of personal information of over 30 million [[United States]] citizens aged 16–25 for the purposes of [[military recruitment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamrs.defense.gov/RecruitingDatabase.aspx |title=JAMRS Recruiting Database |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stored information includes, but is not limited to: name, address, email addresses, cell phone numbers, [[ethnicity]], education, and employment information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=1495382532 Vidéos MySpaceTV : MFZ Mini-Documentary par Military Free Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamrs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brooklynpeace.org/antimil/jamrs.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;milrec.nyclu.org/2f.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;# www.privacycoalition.org/nododdatabase/ letter.html&lt;/ref&gt; The database is sourced from public and private organizations such as the [[Selective Service System]], [[Department of Motor Vehicles|Departments of Motor Vehicles]] and [[College Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyclu.org/milrec/jamrs |title=Joint Advertising Market Research Studies (JAMRS) |publisher=New York Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and other federal agencies for research purposes and for the Military Draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jamrs.defense.gov/MarketResearchStudies.aspx |title=Market Research |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jamrs.defense.gov/Affiliations.aspx |title=Affiliations |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names and contact information of all registrants in the [[Selective Service System]] are distributed to JAMRS on a quarterly basis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamrs.org/aff.php JAMRS Affiliations]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opt-out===
Individuals whose information is present in the JAMRS database can opt out of having that information shared with recruiters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyclu.org/files/optoutletter_02012010.doc |title=Opt-out form}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it cannot be permanently removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyclu.org/milrec/jamrs |title=Joint Advertising Market Research Studies (JAMRS) |publisher=New York Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal challenges==
The [[New York Civil Liberties Union]] filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense in 2006 (Hanson v. Rumsfeld) claiming the unconstitutionality of the JAMRS database. They succeeded in getting a settlement forcing the DOD to stop collecting Social Security Numbers, keep student information for only three years, restrict the ages of students included in the database, and maintain better privacy standards for student information. Also, the Department of the Defense clarified the procedure for opting out of the database. The Department of Defense updated those procedures in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyclu.org/milrec/jamrs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyclu.org/files/hanson_v_rumsfeld_complaint_042406.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Futures Survey==
This survey was distributed by [[United States Postal Service|postal mail]] to a randomly selected group of 16- to 24-year-olds. Information requested included education, career plans, and attitudes toward the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jamrs.defense.gov/MarketResearchStudies/FuturesStudy.aspx |title=Futures Study |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  $2.00 was included with the survey and participants were promised an additional $10.00 upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyranger.com/story.php?story_id=12590 |publisher=Daily Ranger |title=Think carefully before filling out military survey for young people |author=Misti Bolte |date= 8 May 2014 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John H. Tanton''' (born February 23, 1934)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_5yAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT853&amp;dq=John+H.+Tanton+(born+1934)&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje6PjJ6_zcAhULVN8KHcI1DSkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20H.%20Tanton%20(born%201934)&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; is an American retired [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] and activist in efforts aimed at [[immigration reduction|reducing immigration levels]] in the United States. He was the founder and first chairman of the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR), an immigration-reduction organization. He was chairman of [[U.S. English (organization)|U.S. English]] and [[ProEnglish]]. He is the founder of [[The Social Contract Press]], which publishes the quarterly journal ''The Social Contract''. He founded the pro-[[eugenics]] organization ''Society for Genetic Education''.

==Early life==
Tanton was born in 1934 in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="univmichiganjohntanton"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Tanton Papers  1960-2007: Biography|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-861056?byte=43896196;focusrgn=bioghist;subview=standard;view=reslist|website=Bentley Historical Library|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, he moved with his family to a farm northeast of [[Bay City, Michigan]] on which his mother had been raised and on which he worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesocialcontract.com/pdf/eighteen-one/tsc_18_1_tanton.pdf |title=Sustainable Agriculture? |work= The Social Contract Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanton graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry from [[Michigan State University]] in 1956, received an M.D. from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1960, and received an M.S. in ophthalmology from the University of Michigan in 1964.&lt;ref name="univmichiganjohntanton"/&gt;

==Career==
Tanton ran an [[ophthalmology]] practice in [[Petoskey, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="theantiimmigrationcrusader"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeParle|first1=Jason|title=The Anti-Immigration Crusader|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/us/17immig.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 22, 2016|date=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political advocacy==
Tanton is a proponent of immigration reduction to the United States.&lt;ref name="theantiimmigrationcrusader"/&gt; He is the founder and patron of many immigration reduction non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/john-tantons-network |title=John Tanton's Network |date=Summer 2002 |website=Intelligence Report |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Petoskey, Michigan|Petoskey]] chapters of the [[Sierra Club]] and [[Planned Parenthood]] and, for a time, became the national president of [[Zero Population Growth]].  Unable to secure support from colleges, in 1979, he founded the non-profit Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) with early support from [[Warren Buffett]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]].&lt;ref name="theantiimmigrationcrusader"/&gt; By 1983, he co-founded [[U.S. English (organization)|U.S. English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/2608/ |title=Keeping America Empty -- In These Times |last=Hayes |first=Christopher  |date=2006-04-24 |work=In These Times |access-date=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_littleknown"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/us/politics/15immig.html |title=Little-Known Group Claims a Win on Immigration |last=Pear |first=Robert |date=2007-07-15 |work=New York Times |access-date=2008-08-22 |quote=Numbers USA is one of many organizations fostered by John H. Tanton, an ophthalmologist from Michigan who has also championed efforts to protect the environment, limit population growth and promote English as an official language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Tanton co-founded and has been heavily involved in the [[American Immigration Control Foundation]], [[American Patrol]]/[[Voices of Citizens Together]], [[Californians for Population Stabilization]], and [[ProjectUSA]]. Donations flow through U.S. Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/john-tanton-mastermind-behind-organized-anti-immigration-movement |title=The organized anti-immigration 'movement,' increasingly in bed with racist hate groups, is dominated by one man, John Tanton |date=Summer 2002 |website=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_print.jsp?id=554 |title=The Puppeteer |date=June 18, 2002 |publisher=Tolerance.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020810041904/https://www.tolerance.org/news/article_print.jsp?id=554 |archive-date=10 Aug 2002 |department=Hate in the News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also supports [[Scenic America|Scenic Michigan]], the [[International Dark-Sky Association]], the [[Foreign Policy Association#Great Decisions Television Series|Foreign Policy Association's ''Great Decisions'' Series]], and the [[Harbor Springs]] chapter of the [[North Country Trail|North Country Trail Association]]. Tanton serves on the Board of Population-Environment Balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_hate.jsp?id=557 |title=The Network |date=June 18, 2002 |website=Tolerance.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021226123810/https://www.tolerance.org/news/article_hate.jsp?id=557 |archive-date=26 Dec 2002 |department=Hate in the News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanton founded the [[Social Contract Press]] in 1990. He serves as its publisher. Additionally, he has been the editor-in-chief of its journal, ''The Social Contract'', since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/ |title=The Social Contract Journal |publisher=[[Social Contract Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion of eugenics===
According to [[CNN]], Tanton "has openly embraced eugenics, the science of improving the genetic quality of the human population by encouraging selective breeding and at times, advocating for the sterilization of genetically undesirable groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/politics/trump-administration-immigration-advisers/index.html |title= Hard-line anti-illegal immigration advocates hired at 2 federal agencies |last=CNN |first=Maria Santana |website= CNN.com |accessdate= 2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanton wrote a paper in 1975 arguing for "passive eugenics" whereby child-bearing would be restricted to those between the ages of 20 and 35.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.adl.org/news/article/ties-between-anti-immigrant-movement-and-eugenics |title= Ties Between Anti-Immigrant Movement and Eugenics |website= Anti-Defamation League |language=en |access-date= 2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the pro-eugenics organization, the Society for Genetic Education (SAGE).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Opposition to immigration ===
According to Rafael Bernal of ''the Hill,'' Tanton's opposition to immigration is " on the grounds of population reduction and protection of an ethnic white majority".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://thehill.com/latino/328571-dhs-hires-incense-immigration-supporters |title= DHS hires incense immigration supporters |last= Master |first=Cyra |date= 2017-04-12 |work= TheHill |access-date= 2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', Tanton has over time increasingly made his case against immigration in "racial terms".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/us/17immig.html |title= The Anti-Immigration Crusader |last= Deparle |first=Jason |date= 2011-04-17 |work= The New York Times |access-date= 2017-04-12 |issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', Tanton has also said "One of my prime concerns is about the decline of folks who look like you and me ... for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Resignation from U.S. English===
In 1988, shortly before a referendum in Arizona to make English the state's official language, a private memo written by Tanton was leaked to the media. In this memo, he expressed concerns about the potential political, cultural, environmental, and demographic impacts of continued high levels of Hispanic immigration into the U.S., especially if the Hispanic [[fertility rate]] remained higher than that of other ethnic groups. He ended by calling for limiting the flow of immigrants to a rate that would enable them to be [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]]. However, several of his questions and statements were provocative, such as: "Will [[Latin American]] migrants bring with them the tradition of the ''[[mordida]]'' ([[bribe]]), the lack of involvement in public affairs, etc.?", "What are the differences in educability between Hispanics (with their 50% dropout rate) and Asiatics (with their excellent school records and long tradition of scholarship)?", and "On the [[demographic]] point: perhaps this is the first instance in which those with their pants up are going to get caught by those with their pants down!"&lt;ref name="SPLC_2009_Tanton_Memo"&gt;{{cite web |title= 'WITAN MEMO' III |last=Tanton|first=John|department= Intelligence Report |origyear= October 10, 1986 |url= https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/witan-memo-iii |via= Southern Poverty Law Center |date= January 20, 2009 |accessdate= May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the media published the memo, several prominent members of [[U.S. English (organization)|U.S. English]] cut their ties with the organization, including advisory board member [[Walter Cronkite]] and its executive director [[Linda Chavez]], a prominent conservative Republican columnist.&lt;ref name="Potok, Mark 2004, pp. 59-63"&gt;Potok, Mark, ''Intelligence Report'', Spring 2004, pp. 59-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Tanton himself eventually resigned, although he complained that he had been [[smear campaign|smeared]] as a [[racist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= U.S. English - it's being victimized by the `Big Lie' |last=Tanton |first=John |work= Houston Chronicle |date= 30 Oct 1988 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding of FAIR===
Under Tanton's leadership FAIR was criticized for taking funding for many years from the [[Pioneer Fund]], a [[non-profit foundation]] dedicated to "improving the character of the American people" by, among other things, promoting the practice of [[eugenics]], or selective breeding.&lt;ref name="Potok, Mark 2004, pp. 59-63"/&gt;  FAIR responded to this criticism by asserting that the Pioneer Fund clearly states that it supports equal opportunity for all Americans, regardless of race, religion, national origin, or ethnicity; that other major organizations, including universities in the United States and other countries, have also accepted grants from the Fund;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/ISAR/Institut/pioneer/pfspread/pfp6.htm |title=Pioneer Fund Grants, Part VI |website=[[Institute for the Study of Academic Racism]] |publisher=Ferris State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Pioneer Fund's contributions to FAIR were used only for the general operation of the organization.&lt;ref name="response to splc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_splcresponse |title=Response to the Southern Poverty Law Center |publisher=Federation for American Immigration Reform |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217022733/http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_splcresponse |archive-date=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SPLC criticism===
In February 2009, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) described his views as racist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/john-tanton |title=John Tanton |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publicized allegations against him. Tanton challenged the SPLC to a public debate at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=John Tanton challenges Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) to Debate over 'Lies' |date=February 3, 2009 |url=http://www.johntanton.org/answering_my_critics/press_release_2009feb03.html |last1=Tanton |first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanton's environmentalist and immigration-reduction activities are well-documented in 15 file boxes of archives he donated to the Bentley Historical Library at the [[University of Michigan]]. Another 10 file boxes are sealed until 2035.&lt;ref name="nativistlobby_022009"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/pdf/static/splc_nativistlobby_022009.pdf |title=SPLC: The Nativist Lobby: Three Faces of Intolerance |last=Beirich |first=Heidi |date=February 26, 2009 |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |access-date=29 April 2017 |department=Intelligence Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="umich-bhl-861056"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=bhlead&amp;idno=umich-bhl-861056 |title=John Tanton's files |publisher=Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A February 2009 Southern Poverty Law Center report examined Tanton's written correspondence&lt;ref name="umich-bhl-861056" /&gt; highlighted alleged connections between Tanton's immigration-reduction efforts and [[white supremacist]], [[neo-Nazi]] and pro-[[eugenics]] leaders.
The introduction to the report read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;FAIR, CIS and NumbersUSA are all part of a network of restrictionist organizations conceived and created by John Tanton, the "puppeteer" of the nativist movement and a man with deep racist roots. As the first article in this report shows, Tanton has for decades been at the heart of the white nationalist scene. He has met with leading white supremacists and associated closely with the leaders of a eugenicist foundation once described by a leading newspaper as a "neo-Nazi organization." He has made a series of racist statements about Latinos and worried that they were outbreeding whites. At one point, he wrote candidly that to maintain American culture, "a European-American majority" is required.&lt;ref name="nativistlobby_022009" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
Tanton is married to Mary Lou Tanton. She chairs the U.S. Immigration Reform PAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0745-4724| pages = B.01| last = Bulkeley| first = Deborah| title = Foe of immigrant tuition denies supremacist links| work = Deseret News| date = 2006-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves as the first vice president of [[Scenic America|Scenic Michigan]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NHemblem.jpg|thumb|right|"Live Free or Die" in the [[Emblem of New Hampshire|State Emblem]]]] --&gt;
"'''Live Free or Die'''" is the official motto of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Hampshire]], adopted by the state in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/i/3/3-mrg.htm |title=CHAPTER 3 STATE EMBLEMS, FLAG, ETC |publisher=Gencourt.state.nh.us |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possibly the best-known of all [[List of U.S. state and territory mottos|state mottos]], partly because it conveys an assertive [[independence]] historically found in [[Political ideologies in the United States|American political philosophy]] and partly because of its contrast to the milder sentiments found in other state mottos.

The phrase was adopted from a toast written by General [[John Stark]], New Hampshire's most famous soldier of the [[American Revolutionary War]], on July 31, 1809. Poor health forced Stark to decline an invitation to an anniversary reunion of the [[Battle of Bennington]].  Instead, he sent his toast by letter: 
:''Live free or die: Death is not the worst of evils.''

By the time Stark wrote this, ''Vivre Libre ou Mourir'' ("Live free or die") was already a popular motto of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama. ''Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution''. New York: Vintage Books, 1989. p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; The English romantic poet [[William Wordsworth]] also adopted this Revolutionary motto when he composed the line, “We must be free or die, who speak the tongue that [[Shakespeare]] spoke”.&lt;ref&gt;The line appears in the poem "It is not to be Thought of"&lt;/ref&gt;

The motto was enacted at the same time as the [[Emblem of New Hampshire|New Hampshire state emblem]], on which it appears.&lt;ref name="State of New Hampshire General Court"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/I/3/3-1.htm | title=State emblems, flag, etc/ | accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal battle==
In 1971, the [[New Hampshire General Court|New Hampshire state legislature]] mandated that the phrase appear on all non-commercial [[Vehicle registration plates of New Hampshire|license plate]]s, replacing "Scenic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=State of New Hampshire |url=https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xxi/261/261-mrg.htm |title=CHAPTER 261  CERTIFICATES OF TITLE AND REGISTRATION OF VEHICLES 261:75 (II) Number Plates|publisher=State of New Hampshire |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the case of ''[[Wooley v. Maynard]]'', 430 U.S. 705, that the State of New Hampshire could not prosecute motorists who chose to hide part or all of the motto. That ruling came about because George Maynard, a [[Jehovah's Witness]], covered up "or die" from his plate. "By religious training and belief, I believe my 'government' – Jehovah's Kingdom – offers everlasting life. It would be contrary to that belief to give up my life for the state, even if it meant living in bondage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Doug Linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/wooley.html |title=Wooley vs Maynard |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to these beliefs, the Maynards began early in 1974 to cover up the motto on their license plates.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 in his favor and likened Maynard's refusal to accept the state motto with the Jehovah's Witness children refusing to salute the American flag in public school in the 1943 decision ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]''.

"We begin with the proposition that the right of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all," Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for the majority in Maynard.

"Here, as in Barnette, we are faced with a state measure which forces an individual, as part of his daily life indeed constantly while his automobile is in public view to be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view he finds unacceptable.

"The fact that most individuals agree with the thrust of New Hampshire's motto is not the test; most Americans also find the flag salute acceptable," Burger wrote.

The Supreme Court concluded that the state's interests paled in comparison to individuals' free expression rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=15440 |title=George Maynard recalls license-plate ordeal, free-speech victory |publisher=freedomforum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible source of such mottoes is [[Patrick Henry]]'s famed March 23, 1775, speech to the [[House of Burgesses]] (the legislative body of the [[Virginia]] colony), which contained the following phrase: "Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, [[give me liberty or give me death]]!"

A medal struck at [[Matthew Boulton]]'s [[Soho Mint]], as tokens of exchange for the Paris firm of Monneron Freres, 1791–92, has on its obverse the motto ''Vivre libres ou mourir'' ("Live free or die" in French). A mention of "vivre libre ou mourir" occurs in 1754 ''Memoires'' by Chalopin.

During the [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–14)|Siege of Barcelona]] (25 August 1713 – 11 September 1714) the [[Barcelona defenders]] and the [[Maulets (history)|Maulets]] used black flags with the motto "Live free or die", in Catalan "''Viurem lliures o morirem''". Now it is used as a symbol of [[Catalan independentism]].

The phrase "Antes morrer livres que em Paz sujeitos" (English: Rather die free than in peace be subjugated) is contained in a 1582 letter reply to King [[Phillip II of Spain]] from the Portuguese Corregidor (Governor) of the Azores, [[Ciprião de Figueiredo]], still faithful to the Portuguese King-in-Exile, [[António, Prior of Crato]]. It has been adopted as the [[Azores]] motto and is present in the autonomous region's [[Coat of arms of the Azores|Coat-of-Arms]].

The [[Declaration of Arbroath]] of 1320, the document in which the Scottish nobility appealed to [[Pope John XXII]] to recognise [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Scotland's independence from England]], contains the oft-cited line, "It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom – for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself."

"Live Free or Die" is popular among [[Unix]] users, a group which also cherishes its independence. The popularity dates to the 1980s, when [[Armando Stettner]] of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) had a set of Unix license plates printed up and given away at a [[USENIX]] conference. They were modeled on the license plates in New Hampshire, where DEC's Unix Engineering Group was headquartered. Stettner lived in New Hampshire at the time and used the [[vanity license plate]] UNIX. When DEC came out with its own Unix version, [[Ultrix]], they printed up Ultrix plates that were distributed at trade shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unix.org/license-plate.html The History of the UNIX License Plate]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7989">'''Livestock Keepers' Rights''' are a bundle of [[rights]] that would support the survival of small-scale livestock keepers such as [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]], smallholders and family farms in a general policy environment that favours large-scale [[Intensive animal farming|industrial modes of livestock production]].

The term "Livestock Keepers' Rights" was coined during the [http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsummit/english/index.html World Food Summit] in 2002 by [[civil society]] attending the Forum for [[Food sovereignty|Food Sovereignty]] to flag the role of livestock keepers in animal genetic resource management. It alluded to "Farmers' Rights" as known from the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] that had been recently concluded.

== Background ==

Between . 2003 and 2007, a large number of grassroots consultations were carried out by and with livestock keeping communities to define the term more closely. These consultations took place in Kenya "Karen Comittment"), India, Italy ("Bellagio Brief") and Ethiopia ("Addis Résumé")  and involved about 500 representatives of livestock keeping communities from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe. They identified 7 cornerstones of "Livestock Keepers' Rights" that would enable livestock keepers to continue playing their role as guardians of [[biological diversity]].

During this process, Livestock Keepers’ Rights were elaborated into a much more comprehensive concept than Farmers’ Rights. Rather than representing legal rights, they correspond to development principles that would help livestock keepers continue to conserve biodiversity and [[Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|animal genetic resources]].

== Principles and Rights ==
During a workshop with legal experts held in [[Kalk Bay]], [[South Africa]] in December 2008, the rights were further refined and subdivided into principles and rights:

'''Principle 1:'''
''Livestock Keepers are creators of breeds and custodians of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. ''

'''Principle 2:'''
''Livestock Keepers and the sustainable use of traditional breeds are dependent on the conservation of their respective ecosystems. ''

'''Principle 3:'''
''Traditional breeds represent collective property, products of indigenous knowledge and cultural expression of Livestock Keepers.''

Based on these principles articulated and implicit in existing legal instruments and international agreements, Livestock Keepers from traditional livestock keeping communities and/or adhering to ecological principles of animal production, shall be given the following Livestock Keepers' Rights:

# ''Livestock Keepers have the right to make breeding decisions and breed the breeds they maintain.''
# ''Livestock Keepers shall have the right to participate in policy formulation and implementation processes on animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. ''
# ''Livestock Keepers shall have the right to appropriate training and capacity building and equal access to relevant services enabling and supporting them to raise livestock and to better process and market their products. ''
# ''Livestock Keepers shall have the right to participate in the identification of research needs and research design with respect to their genetic resources, as is mandated by the principle of [[Informed consent|Prior Informed Consent]].''
# ''Livestock Keepers shall have the right to effectively access information on issues related to their local breeds and livestock diversity.''

== Declaration on Rights ==

The workshop also resulted in a Declaration on Livestock Keepers Rights that references the individual principles and rights to existing international legal frameworks such as the UN [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]], the [http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a1404e/a1404e00.htm Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources] and the Interlaken Declaration on Animal Genetic Resources, as well as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], the [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]], the Convention (No. 169) concerning [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries]], the [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]], and other pertinent legal agreements.

The Declaration on Livestock Keepers’ Rights was signed by a large number of individuals and organizations. At an International Technical Expert Workshop on [http://www.cbd.int/abs/ Access and Benefit Sharing] in Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, that was held in Wageningen in the Netherlands from 8–10 December 2010, it was decided that Livestock Keepers’ Rights should be addressed. At another workshop on rights to animal genetic resources that was held in Bern (Switzerland) on 20 June 2011, Livestock Keepers’ Rights were contrasted with Animal Breeders Rights.In July 2011,at a side-event during the 13th session of the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) held at FAO in Rome, the concept of Livestock Keepers' Rights was introduced and supported by government officials.

'''World Magshimey Herut''' ({{lang-he|מגשימי חרות עולמי}}, ''lit.'' "world achievers of liberty") is a [[Zionist]] young adult movement founded in 1999 by a group of [[Jewish]] activists who felt the need for a young adult movement dedicated to the ideals of [[aliyah]], [[social justice]] and the territorial integrity of the [[Land of Israel]]. The world headquarters of the movement are located in [[Israel]] symbolizing the state of Israel's centrality to Jewish life.

World MH is dedicated to a strong and independent Jewish nation in the Land of Israel, composed of Jews from around the world reuniting in their homeland. To this end the movement works in conjunction with the [[World Zionist Organization]] (WZO), the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], and the [[Jewish National Fund]] on projects that advance common goals.

== History ==
When a [[Likud]] government led by [[Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] relinquished parts of [[Hebron]] to [[Yasser Arafat]] in 1998, Betar (the youth movement most associated with the Likud) members were uncertain as to how to view a Likud Prime Minister's  betrayal of one of their most sacred principles. As a reaction to the Prime Minister's decision, the Director of Overseas Activities at the time, Karma Feinstein-Cohen, along with a group of ideological purists and veteran activists from chapters throughout the world, left Betar in order to establish a new movement.

In 1999, Herut: The National Movement was established and registered in the Israeli Department of Party Registry by former Likud activists led by Knesset members Benny Begin, [[Michael Kleiner]], and David Re'em who opposed the Likud government’s withdrawal in Judea and Samaria. [[Herut]] ran in three Israeli national elections. Upon inception, the movement joined the World Zionist Organization, set up party branches all over the world, and established a young adult movement, Magshimey Herut— the reborn Jabotinsky movement for Zionist education and activism. Herut has active branches in 11 countries today. Since 2004, the threshold for Knesset membership has been raised twice. Herut, consequently, has chosen not to participate in Israeli elections. For the present, Herut concentrates its efforts on gaining adherents to Herut ideology and promoting Aliyah and the absorption of Olim into Israeli society. 

Individual members, among them, MK Benny Begin and the head of the Likud Supreme Court, Michael Kleiner, have rejoined the Likud. Nevertheless, Herut continues to be registered in the Israeli government's Party Registry. The Herut party remains intact and reserves the right to compete in future elections, should suitable circumstances arise.

World Herut and Magshimey Herut initiate, promote, and support the activities of students, Olim (Jews returning to Israel) and social action groups that are consistent with the movements' objectives. World Herut works in conjunction with the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency for Israel, and Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael on projects that advance common goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldmh.org.il/about-us/|title=About Us – World Magshimey Herut|website=www.worldmh.org.il|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==

In their mission statement they write: "World Magshimey Heurt is a [[Zionist youth movement]] dedicated to social justice, the unity of the Jewish people, and the territorial integrity of the Land of Israel. World Magshimey Herut educates Jewish young adults throughout the world towards Jewish pride, activist Zionism, and love for Israel. World Magshimey Herut encourages members to assume an active role in determining the future of the Jewish people and to assert Israel's national rights."..."World Herut is committed to the creation, in Israel, of the social, economic and political conditions conductive to successfully integrating all Jews within the body politic. World Herut, therefore, is politically democratic, socially liberal, economically free-market and social-welfare oriented. In addition, as a Zionist movement, World Herut emphasizes the Jewish people's right to live freely and securely in its ancestral homeland." .

World MH is proactively engaged in the fulfillment of classic Zionist goals:

# The ingathering of the majority of world Jewry into the Land of Israel
# Jewish settlement throughout the homeland
# The incorporation of the entire Land into the free nation-state of the Jewish people, in the State of Israel.

Magshimey Herut has referred to itself as the "reborn Jabotinsky movement", and sees itself as the ideological successors of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and [[Revisionist Zionism]]

Magshimey Herut looks at the [[Israel|State of Israel]] as the natural successor to the previous sovereign Jewish Kingdoms and States in the Land of Israel. They see Zionism as the natural indigenous right of the Jewish people to rule themselves in their native homeland, and that the fact that this right was taken away is a root cause of antisemitism.[https://forward.com/scribe/368369/the-tribal-case-for-israel/]

{{For|the government ministries in other Malay-speaking countries which have the same Malay name|Ministry of Education (Brunei)|Ministry of Education (Malaysia)}}{{For|the Indonesian government ministry with similar name in Indonesian|Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)}}The '''Ministry of Education''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''MOE'''; {{lang-ms|'''Kementerian Pendidikan'''}}; [[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|'''教育部'''}}; {{lang-ta|கல்வி அமைச்சு}}) is a [[ministry (government department)|ministry]] of the [[Government of Singapore]] that directs the formulation and implementation of policies related to [[education in Singapore]]. It is currently headed by Minister [[Ong Ye Kung]] who oversees education from Primary 1 to tertiary institutions.

== Budget ==
The [[Government of Singapore]] invests heavily in education to equip citizens with the necessary knowledge and skills to compete in the global marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yorozu|first=Rika|date=2017|title=Lifelong Learning in Transformation: Promising practices in Southeast Asia|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002536/253603e.pdf|journal=UNESCO|volume=No. 4|pages=16|via=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore currently spends around 1/5 of its national budget on education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Singapore|last=Mara|first=Wil|publisher=Scholastic|year=2016|isbn=978-0-531-23297-2|location=New York|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To boost its economic standing, the Government of Singapore created a mandate that most Singaporeans learn English. As a result, the country rose from one of the most impoverished Asian countries to one with the strongest economies and highest standards of living.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Singapore|last=Mara|first=Wil|publisher=Scholastic|year=2016|isbn=978-0-531-23297-2|location=New York|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Statutory boards==
The ministry currently oversees 10 statutory boards:
*[[Council for Private Education]]
*[[Singapore Polytechnic]]
*[[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]]
*[[Temasek Polytechnic]]
*[[Nanyang Polytechnic]]
*[[Republic Polytechnic]]
*[[Institute of Technical Education]]
*[[ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute]]
*[[Science Centre, Singapore]]
*[[Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board]]

In 2016, a new statutory board under the Ministry of Education (MOE), SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), was formed to drive and coordinate the implementation of SkillsFuture. It took over some of the functions currently performed by the [[Singapore Workforce Development Agency]] (WDA) and absorbed the [[Council for Private Education]] (CPE).

== SkillsFuture ==
The SkillsFuture initiative was introduced in 2016 to support Singapore’s next stage of economic advancement by providing [[lifelong learning]] and skills development opportunities for Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yorozu|first=Rika|date=2017|title=Lifelong Learning in Transformation: Promising practices in Southeast Asia|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002536/253603e.pdf|journal=UNESCO|volume=No. 4|pages=50|via=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; SkillsFuture aims at unlocking the full potential of all Singaporeans, regardless of background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yorozu|first=Rika|date=2017|title=Lifelong Learning in Transformation: Promising Practices in Southeast Asia|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002536/253603e.pdf|journal=UIL PUBLICATIONS SERIES ON LIFELONG LEARNING POLICIES AND STRATEGIES|volume=No.4|pages=17|via=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program contains several key initiatives, such as SkillsFuture Credit and SkillsFuture Earn and Lean. SkillsFuture caters to many stakeholders, with initiatives centered on students, adult learners, employers, and training providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yorozu|first=Rika|date=2017|title=Lifelong Learning in Transformation: Promising Practices in Southeast Asia|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002536/253603e.pdf|journal=UIL PUBLICATIONS SERIES ON LIFELONG LEARNING POLICIES AND STRATEGIES|volume=No.4|pages=17|via=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four key objectives of the SkillsFuture initiative:

# Helping individuals make well-informed choices in education, training and careers.
# Developing an integrated, high-quality system of education and training that responds to constantly evolving industry needs.
# Promoting employer recognition and career development based on skills and mastery.
# Fostering a culture that supports and celebrates lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yorozu|first=Rika|date=2017|title=Lifelong Learning in Transformation: Promising practices in Southeast Asia|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002536/253603e.pdf|journal=UNESCO|volume=No. 4|pages=50|via=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Singapore citizen from the age of 25 is given S$500 (approximately $370) by the Singapore government for the SkillsFuture Credit to invest in their personal learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/the-st-guide-to-using-your-skillsfuture-credit|title=The ST Guide To...

By the end of 2017, the SkillsFuture Credit has been utilized by over 285,000 Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/285000-singaporeans-have-used-skillsfuture-credit-with-more-doing-so-in-2017|title=285,000 Singaporeans have used SkillsFuture Credit, with more doing so in 2017|last=Seow|first=Joanna|date=2018-02-01|website=The Straits Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were more than 18,000 SkillsFuture credit-approved courses available at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yorozu|first=Rika|date=2017|title=Lifelong Learning in transformation: Promising practices in Southeast Asia.|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002536/253603e.pdf|journal=UNESCO|volume=No. 4|pages=52|via=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, there were also a total of 40 Earn and Learn Programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yorozu|first=Rika|date=2017|title=Lifelong Learning in transformation: Promising practices in Southeast Asia|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002536/253603e.pdf|journal=UNESCO|volume=No. 4|pages=52|via=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25701">[[File:Roman &amp; RED camera.JPG|thumb|Many states provide financial incentives for film and television production.]]

'''Movie production incentives''' are [[Creative Sector Tax Relief|tax benefits]] offered on a state-by-state basis throughout the United States to encourage in-state [[film production]].  These incentives came about in the 1990s in response to the flight of movie productions to other countries such as Canada.  Since then, states have offered increasingly competitive incentives to lure productions away from other states.  The structure, type, and size of the incentives vary from state to state.  Many include tax credits and exemptions, and other incentive packages include cash grants, fee-free locations, or other perks.  Proponents of these programs point to increased economic activity and job creation as justification for the credits.  Others argue that the cost of the incentives outweighs the benefits and say that the money goes primarily to out-of-state talent rather than in-state cast and crew members.

Studies of the costs and benefits of incentive programs show different levels of effectiveness.  See some studies below.

==History==

The development of movie production incentives stems from the perceived economic benefits of [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]] in the US.  In 2010 revenues from television production in the US were estimated at $30.8 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBISWORLD US Television Production Market Research Report|publisher=IBIS World}}&lt;/ref&gt; while revenues from movie and video production in the US were estimated at $29.7 billion in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBISWorld US Movie &amp; Video Production in the US|publisher=IBIS World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the TV and film industries grew through the 1990s, so did concern over [[runaway production]]s, [[TV shows]] and films that are intended for a US audience but are filmed in other countries in order to reduce production costs.  The issue of runaway productions gained further traction after Canada adopted a movie production incentive program in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Film Capital Tax Credit Overview|url=http://www.canadafilmcapital.com/taxcredit/index.html|publisher=Canada Film Capital|accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall economic losses to the US due to runaway productions are difficult to measure, as the perceived economic benefit of film production could include benefits from tourism in the short and long-term, local job creation, and any number of other benefits.  Most methods of measuring such economic benefit apply a multiplier to production costs in order to account for the lost opportunities from taxes not collected, jobs not created, and other revenues that are lost when a film is made outside of the US.  A 1999 study by The Monitor Group estimated that in 1998 $10.3 billion was lost to the US economy due to runaway productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=US Runaway Film and Television Production Study Report |journal=The Monitor Group |year=1999 |url=http://www.dga.org/thedga/leg_rp_runaway.pdf |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206143555/http://www.dga.org/thedga/leg_rp_runaway.pdf |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1990s, U.S. states saw the opportunity to launch their own production incentives as an effort to capture some of the perceived economic benefits of film and TV production.  Louisiana was the first state to do so in 2001, and in 2002 passed legislation to further increase the scope its incentives.  Over the next three years Louisiana experienced an increase in film and television productions some of which were nominated for Emmy Awards.  The perceived success of Louisiana's incentive program did not go unnoticed by other states, and by 2009 the number of states which offered incentives was 44, up from 5 in 2002.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;  Critics have suggested that the increase in states offering incentives mirrors a [[race to the bottom]] or an [[arms race]] because states continue to increase the scope of their incentive packages to compete on a national level to not only maximize their individual benefits but also to stay ahead of their competitors.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;

==Types==
* Movie Production Incentives (MPIs): "Movie Production Incentive" is an umbrella term referring to any incentive states offer filmmakers to encourage film production in-state.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;
* Tax Credits: [[Tax credits]] can remove a portion of the income tax owed to the state by the production company, but since most production companies are limited purpose business entities they often incur very little, if any tax liability.&lt;ref name="blogs.theadvocate.com"&gt;http://blogs.theadvocate.com/specialreports/2014/12/02/giving-away-louisiana-film-tax-incentives/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2012/12/14/tax-breaks-for-sale-transferable-tax-credits-explained&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://massbudget.org/report_window.php?loc=The%20Massachusetts%20Film%20Tax%20Credit.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/18/states-film-tax-credits_n_7306342.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/ny_keeps_public_in_dark_as_fil.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/group-backed-by-koch-brothers-takes-aim-at-tax-credits-for-films-1458934367&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the word "tax credit" or "tax rebate" often results in public confusion, as they layperson may think the program is a refund of taxes paid by the production, when it is actually based on a significant percentage of the production's actual spend and the amount is awarded regardless of whether the entity pays taxes (which they generally do not) (as explained by Louisiana's Chief Legislative Economist: “It’s got nothing to do with tax...We’re just using the tax-filing process and the Department of Revenue as the paying agent for a spending program. That’s what we’re doing.”)&lt;ref name="blogs.theadvocate.com"/&gt;  Production companies must often meet minimum spending requirements to be eligible for the credit.  Of the 28 states that offer tax credits, 26 make them either transferable or refundable.  Transferable credits allow production companies that generate tax credits greater than their tax liability to sell those credits to other taxpayers, who then use them to reduce or eliminate their own tax liability.&lt;ref name="MassDORJan11"/&gt; Refundable credits are such that the state will pay the production company the balance in excess of the company's owed state tax.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;
* Cash Rebates: Cash rebates are paid to production companies directly by the state, usually as a percentage of the company's qualified expenses.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;
* Grant: [[Grant (money)|Grants]] are distributed to production companies by three states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;
* Sales Tax Exemption &amp; Lodging Exemption: Exemption from state sales taxes are offered to companies as an incentive.  Many states offer exemption from lodging taxes to all guests staying over 30 days, but these incentives are highlighted for production companies.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;
* Fee-Free Locations: An additional incentive states offer is to allow production companies to use state-owned locations at no charge.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;*As of November 24, 2009, Iowa has suspended new registration for incentives pending a criminal investigation into the handling of past film tax credits.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;**Maine's wage rebate is effectively a cash rebate and is considered as such in this table.

==Arguments==

===Pros===
Proponents of production incentives for the film industry point to increases in job creation, small business and infrastructure development, the generation of tax revenue, and increased tourism as positive byproducts of the incentives.&lt;ref name="Alabama Bill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamafilm.org/AEIIA%202008%20Highlights%20V5%20031908.pdf|title=Alabama Entertainment Industry Incentive Act of 2008 HB356 (Companion Bill SB404)|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters also maintain that MPIs are a net benefit to the states because they attract productions that would have gone elsewhere.

The immediate effect of a tax incentive is the direct production spend for the region in hotel rooms for visiting cast and crew, lumber for sets, food for catering, fuel for trucks and generators, to the secondary expenditures of crew members who go to local restaurants for dinner, the dry cleaners for their laundry, and the need for everyday sundry items from toothpaste to shampoo. These expenses average in the millions of dollars on a typical Studio feature which usually carries approximately a 100 traveling crew members and employs another 100 crew locally.&lt;ref name="Hawaii News Now"&gt;{{Citation | author =  | last = David | first = Mari-Ela | title = Hawaii's Film Industry Seeing Record Numbers | URL = http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/13621661/hawaiis-film-industry-seeing-record-numbers | date = December 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, if the area did not previously have an existing infrastructure, the production provides hands-on training for local employees to learn the stock in trade of filmmaking and helps to develop the experienced crew base that will make the area more valuable in reducing the number of crew a production will need to import the next time around.&lt;ref name="Fortune Magazine"&gt;{{Citation | title = An Unexpected Bright Spot For Unions | URL = http://fortune.com/2013/05/21/an-unexpected-bright-spot-for-unions/ | date = May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film tourism has become a significant multiplier of the initial investment by the region in providing increased tourism marketing opportunities at a fraction of the media buy necessary through taking advantage of the extensive marketing efforts by a studio.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{Citation | author =  | last = Cha | first = Francis | title = Hollywood: World's most dramatic travel agent? | url = http://travel.cnn.com/lights-camera-country-power-and-glamour-film-tourism-735306 | date = February 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KPCC"&gt;{{Citation | author =  | last = Watt | first = Brian | title = 'Sideways': 10 years later, hit film still makes waves in Santa Ynez Valley economy | url = http://www.scpr.org/blogs/economy/2014/10/24/17437/sideways-ten-years-later-hit-film-still-makes-wave/ | date = October 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The impacts of film tourism have been met with skepticism, as examples of the phenomenon tend to be anecdotal and a reliable method for measurement is hard to come by.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2015/artisans/production/tourism-movie-tv-tax-breaks-1201476158/&lt;/ref&gt; Academic study of film tourism points to key elements that are needed for film tourism: iconic locations (like the baseball field in "Field of Dreams"), commercial success and on-location filming in the places where the underlying story is set.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mass.gov/dor/docs/dor/news/reportcalendaryear2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Most films produced in leading incentive states do not meet these criteria.

===Cons===

Those who oppose movie production incentives offer arguments that refute those made by supporters of the programs.
* Movie production incentives do not necessarily result in the creation of jobs.  Rather, the economic impact is that of a transfer of jobs from one location or state to another.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;  Additionally, unless the state in question has a consistent stream of productions, the project-based nature of the film and television industry generates short-term jobs that eventually leave specialized laborers out of work.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TaxAnalysts_March2006"&gt;{{Citation | author =  | last =  Grand | first = John | title = Motion Picture Tax Incentives: There's No Business Like Show Business | journal = Special Report | publisher = Tax Analysts | date = March 2006 | issue =  | pages = 5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* States have a tendency to use vague language and refer to successes in other states when advocating in support of production incentives.  Critics maintain that information is selected to present positive results, and that states rely too heavily on perceived successes in other states without adequately considering how available resources within the state will impact their respective economies.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;
* States often incorrectly use economic measurements, such as a [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] or an increase in different types of tax revenue, to promote film tax credits.  When comparing multipliers across different projects, movie production incentive multipliers tend to be smaller than those for other investment projects (e.g. nuclear power plant, hotels).  Revenue from alternate taxes not covered under tax credit policies do not always cover the original cost of the given film tax incentives.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;
* Grants require films to pass sensitivity tests&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt; in order to ensure a state is seen in a positive light, which may lead to censorship issues.&lt;ref name="AlbuquerqueJournal_May03"&gt;{{Citation | author = | last = Propp | first = Wren | title = State Council Keeps Movie Money Clean | journal = | publisher = Albuquerque Journal | date = May 2003 | issue = | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Politicians focus on immediate, short-term projects because it is politically easier to change these incentive policies.  However, a focus on improving baseline tax policies to incentivize long-term private investment in industry would lead to higher levels of job creation, productivity and economic development.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt;

Critics propose that unilateral or multilateral moratoriums&lt;ref name="FedResBankMN_94"&gt;{{Citation | author =  | last = Burstein | first = Melvin L. | last2 = Rolnick | first2 = Arthur J. | title = Congress Should End the Economic War Among the States | journal = Annual Report | publisher = Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis | issue = 9 | pages = 3–19 | year = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and federal intervention be used to solve these economic inefficiencies.&lt;ref name="TaxFoundation_Jan10" /&gt; For example, in a 2009 article, entertainment attorney Schuyler M. Moore proposed a federal tax credit combined with complete [[federal preemption]] of all state-level tax credits in order to halt the states' race into insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Schuyler|title=Commentary: Could federal tax credit end economic war among states?|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/commentary-federal-tax-credit-economic-84707|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State-by-state cost-benefit analysis==
Some states have attempted to evaluate the economic impact of their movie production incentives to establish whether the benefits outweigh the costs.

===Connecticut===
In 2008, the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development released a report on the economic impacts of the state's film production tax incentive program.&lt;ref name="CTDECD2008"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Economic and Fiscal Impacts of Connecticut's Film Tax Credit |journal=Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development |year=2008|url=http://www.ct.gov/cct/lib/cct/Film_Tax_Credit_Study_-_Final.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concludes the tax incentive program has a "modest" impact on the state's economy, returning $1.07 of real gross state product (RSGP) for every dollar spent (or tax revenue dollar foregone).  The report also finds that the program in FY2007 stimulated $55.1 million in film production spending, generated $20.72 million in new RGSP, and created 395 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs.&lt;ref name="CTDECD2008" /&gt;

An analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reached a different conclusion when reviewing the tax incentive program in 2009, finding that the program does not pay for itself and that the economic benefits are short-lived and easily lost if the program is discontinued.&lt;ref name="FedMemo09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner | first=Jennifer | title=Cost-benefit analysis of Connecticut's film tax credit |journal=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston |year=2009|url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neppc/memos/2009/weiner011609.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of 2011 budget shortfalls, Connecticut state legislators are considering ending the tax incentive program to balance the budget.&lt;ref name="FairfieldWeeklyJan11"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts===
In January 2011, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue released its third annual report detailing the impact of the state's film tax incentive program, specifically focusing on the productions and tax credits of 2009.&lt;ref name="MassDORJan11"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Report on the Massachusetts Film Industry Tax Incentives|journal=Massachusetts Department of Revenue|year=2011|url=http://www.mass.gov/dor/docs/dor/news/2011filmincentivereport.pdf|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report's key findings for 2009 showed:
* 86 productions generated $82.4 million in state tax credits.
* The film tax incentive program generated $10.4 million in new tax revenue, partially offsetting the cost of the tax credits.
* Productions spent $310 million in new spending attributable to the tax credit program.
* Accounting for production spending going to in-state people and businesses versus out-of-state people and businesses, the film tax credit program resulted in $32.6 million in new spending for the Massachusetts economy.
* The film tax incentive program generated additional Massachusetts state GDP of $168.5 million and personal income of $25.2 million.
* The cost to the state for the jobs created by the film tax credit program was $324,838/FTE job.

At a 2011 legislative hearing on the film tax credit program, policy analysts from Massachusetts think tanks criticized the film tax incentive program.&lt;ref name="CommonWealth05Apr11"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have also complained that much of the tax credit money goes to cover the pay of celebrity actors.&lt;ref name="Globe13Jan11"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate within state government over the value of the tax credits in the face of budget shortfalls led Governor [[Deval Patrick]] to attempt to cap the tax credit in 2010.  Although this effort was not successful, some point to it as a reason for a decline in film productions in Massachusetts in recent years.&lt;ref name="WBUR22Feb11"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michigan===
A September 2010 report by the Michigan Senate Fiscal Agency detailed the economics underlying the state's incentive programs.&lt;ref name="MichSFA"&gt;{{Cite news

  | url = http://www.senate.michigan.gov/sfa/Publications/Issues/FilmIncentives/FilmIncentives.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular it found that:
* Michigan spent $37.5 million in FY2008-09 to generate $21.1 in private sector spending, and would go on to spend $100.0 million in FY2009-10 to generate $59.5 million.
* 2008 productions created 216 direct, full-time-equated (FTE) jobs, or 937.3 FTEs if indirect effects (via multipliers) are taken into account.  The jobs came at an average cost of $186.519 and $42,991, respectively.  Similarly, in 2009, 355.5 direct FTEs were created at an average cost of $193,333 or, again if indirect effects are considered, 1,542.3 FTEs were created at a cost of $44,561.
* Taken together, the report concludes that the net revenue impact on the state was a cost of $30.8 million in FY2008-09, $91.4 million in FY2009-10, $111.8 million in FY 2010–11, and likely to continue to increase over time.

===New York===
* In fiscal year 2017 New York gave out $621 million in tax breaks for film and TV shoots that take place in the empire state. This works out to $31 a year in [[per capita]].&lt;ref name="Neil"&gt;{{cite news |last=Demause |first=Neil |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/10/11/new-york-is-throwing-money-at-film-shoots-but-who-benefits/ |title=New York Is Throwing Money at Film Shoots, But Who Benefits? |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=2017-10-11 |accessdate=2017-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Season two of [[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]] received $21,217,413 in state aid.&lt;ref name="Neil" /&gt;

===Rhode Island===
Supporters of the film tax credit in Rhode Island are urging state officials to maintain the program, pointing to a study showing the program created more than 4,000 jobs in the state between 2006–2009.&lt;ref name="CTPost24Mar11"&gt;{{Cite news

The term ''' 'National Union Government' ''' ({{Lang-fr|Gouvernement de l’Union Nationale}}) is used in [[Luxembourg]] to denote either of two different periods in the history of the Grand Duchy.  The National Union Governments were forms of [[National unity government|national governments]], an instrument used in many countries in times of national emergency or political instability.

==1916-7==
{{Main|National Union Government (1916)}}

The first National Union Government took office on 24 February 1916 and left office on 19 June 1917, at the height of the [[First World War]].  The government was led by [[Victor Thorn]], and the government included members of the [[conservatism|conservative]], [[liberalism|liberal]], and [[socialism|socialist]] factions.  At the time, Luxembourg was occupied by the [[German Empire]], but was allowed to maintain its own political affairs.  Regardless, the German army's presence in Luxembourg dominated the political landscape.

The government collapsed after sixteen months.  A growth in electoral support for [[independent (politician)|independent]] candidates indicated that the coalition did not represent the national consensus.  Furthermore, civil disorder, including strikes by iron miners and the emergence of a flourishing [[black market]] in foodstuffs, convinced Thorn that he was not serving his country properly, and he resigned.

==1945-7==
{{Main|National Union Government (1945)}}

The second National Union Government took office on 14 November 1945 and left office on 13 February 1947, in the direct aftermath of the [[Second World War]].  The government was led by [[Pierre Dupong]], the leader of the [[Christian Social People's Party|CSV]], and included members of all parties in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], in addition to the only independent.

The agenda was dominated by reconstruction and the normalisation of the economy and of society, particularly the creation of a [[welfare state]].  However, the greatest strength of the government, the unanimous support of the legislature, was turned into a weakness.  Ministers became too enthralled by their own briefs, and fundamental policy differences between the four ideologically-disparate parties brought an end to the National Union Government.

'''Neo-Confederate''', or '''Southern nationalist''', is a term used to describe the views of various groups and individuals who use [[historical negationism]] to portray the [[Confederate States of America]] and its actions in the [[American Civil War]] in a positive light.

=== History of the term ===
Historian [[James M. McPherson]] used the term "neo-Confederate historical committees" in his description of the efforts from 1890 to 1930 to have history textbooks present a version of the American Civil War in which secession was not rebellion, the Confederacy did not fight for [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the Confederate soldier was defeated by overwhelming numbers and resources.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, James M. "Long-Legged Yankee Lies: The Southern Textbook Crusade," from ''The Memory of the Civil War in American Culture,'' editors, Alice Fahs and Joan Waugh. (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004)64-78. Reference to neo-Confederate on page 76. McPherson's discussion on page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Nancy MacLean]] used the term "neo-Confederacy" in reference to groups, such as the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], that formed in the 1950s to oppose the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] rulings demanding racial integration, in particular ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Nancy, "Neo-Confederacy against the New Deal: The Regional Romance of the Modern American Right," paper presented at conference entitled "The End of Southern History? Reintegrating the Modern South and the Nation." (Atlanta: Emory University, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Former ''[[Southern Partisan]]'' editor and co-owner Richard Quinn used the term when he referred to Richard T. Hines, former ''Southern Partisan'' contributor and [[Ronald Reagan]] administration staffer, as being "among the first neo-Confederates to resist efforts by the infidels to take down the Confederate flag".&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Richard, "Partisan View," ''Southern Partisan'', 8.1 (1988);5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possibly the earliest use of the term "neo-Confederate" in ''Southern Partisan''.

This definition is not necessarily accepted by neo-Confederates, though [[Mel Bradford]], who was a key figure in the neo-Confederate movement and frequent writer for ''Southern Partisan'' from its founding, titled one of his books ''The Reactionary Imperative: Essays Literary and Political''.

An early use of the term came in 1954. In a book review, [[Leonard Levy]] (later a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1968) wrote: "Similar blindness to the moral issue of slavery, plus a resentment against the rise of the Negro and modern industrialism, resulted in the neo-Confederate interpretation of Phillips, Ramsdell and Owsley".&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Leonard W. Review of Americans Interpret Their Civil War by Thomas J. Pressly. The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 3. (Sep. 1954), pp. 523–524&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of the term ===
[[Gary W. Gallagher]], author of  ''The Confederate War'', has stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;Any historian who argues that the Confederate people demonstrated robust devotion to their slave-based republic, possessed feelings of national community, and sacrificed more than any other segment of white society in United States history runs the risk of being labeled a neo-Confederate. As a native of Los Angeles who grew up on a farm in southern Colorado, I can claim complete freedom from any pro-Confederate special pleading during my formative years. Moreover, not a single ancestor fought in the war, a fact I lamented as a boy reading books by [[Bruce Catton]] and [[Douglas Southall Freeman]] and wanting desperately to have some direct connection to the events that fascinated me. In reaching my conclusions, I have gone where the sources led me. My assertions and speculations certainly are open to challenge, but they emerged from an effort to understand the Confederate experience through the actions and words of the people who lived it.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction ''The Confederate War'' Gary W. Gallagher (Harvard University Press 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Background ==
=== Origins and doctrines of "Lost Cause" Civil War history ===
The "[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]" is the name commonly given to a literary and intellectual movement that sought to reconcile the traditional society of the [[Southern United States]] with the defeat of the [[Confederate States of America]] in the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–1865.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Gary W. and Nolan, Alan T. editors. ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War History''. (2000) p. 1. Gallagher wrote:
:"The architects of the Lost Cause acted from various motives.  They collectively sought to justify their own actions and allow themselves and other former Confederates to find something positive in all-encompassing failure.  They also wanted to provide their children and future generations of white Southerners with a 'correct' narrative of the war."&lt;/ref&gt; Those who contributed to the movement tended to portray the Confederacy's cause as noble and most of the Confederacy's leaders as exemplars of old-fashioned [[chivalry]], defeated by the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies not through superior military skill, but by overwhelming force. They believe the commonly-portrayed Civil War history to be a "false history". They also tended to condemn [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

On its main web site, the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] (SCV) speaks of "ensuring that a true history of the 1861-1865 period is preserved", claiming that "[t]he preservation of liberty and freedom was the motivating factor in the South's decision to fight the Second American Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scv.org/|title=Home|website=scv.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James M. McPherson]] has written on the origins of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] (UDC), stating: "A principal motive of the UDC's founding was to counter this 'false history' which taught Southern children 'that their fathers were not only rebels but guilty of almost every crime enumerated in the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]'".&lt;ref&gt;McPherson pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Much of what the UDC called "false history" centered on the relationship between slavery and secession and the war. The chaplain of the [[United Confederate Veterans]] (UCV), forerunner of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, wrote in 1898 that history books as written could lead Southern children to "think that we fought for slavery" and would "fasten upon the South the stigma of slavery and that we fought for it ... The Southern soldier will go down in history dishonored".&lt;ref&gt;McPherson pg. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to a 1932 call by the Sons of Confederate Veterans to restore "the purity of our history", McPherson notes that the "quest for purity remains vital today, as any historian working in the field can testify".&lt;ref&gt;McPherson pg. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s, [[Mildred Rutherford]], the historian general of the UDC, spearheaded the attack on schoolbooks that did not present the Lost Cause version of history. Rutherford assembled a "massive collection" which included "essay contests on the glory of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and personal tributes to faithful slaves".&lt;ref&gt;Blight, David W. Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory. (2001) pg 289&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[David Blight]] concluded: "All UDC members and leaders were not as virulently racist as Rutherford, but all, in the name of a reconciled nation, participated in an enterprise that deeply influenced the [[white supremacist]] vision of Civil war memory".&lt;ref&gt;Blight, David W. ''Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory''. (2001) pg. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Alan T. Nolan refers to the Lost Cause as "a rationalization, a cover-up". After describing the devastation that was the consequence of the war for the South, Nolan states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Leaders of such a catastrophe must account for themselves. Justification is necessary. Those who followed their leaders into the catastrophe required similar rationalization. Clement A. Evans, a Georgia veteran who at one time commanded the United Confederate Veterans organization, said this: "If we cannot justify the South in the act of Secession, we will go down in History solely as a brave, impulsive but rash people who attempted in an illegal manner to overthrow the Union of our Country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gallagher and Nolan pg. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nolan further states his opinion of the racial basis of Lost Cause mythology: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Lost Cause version of the war is a caricature, possible, among other reasons, because of the false treatment of slavery and the black people. This false treatment struck at the core of the truth of the war, unhinging cause and effect, depriving the United States of any high purpose, and removing [[African American]]s from their true role as the issue of the war and participants in the war, and characterizing them as historically irrelevant.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[David Goldfield]] observes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;If history has defined the South, it has also trapped white southerners into sometimes defending the indefensible, holding onto views generally discredited in the rest of the civilized world and holding on the fiercer because of that. The extreme sensitivity of some Southerners toward criticism of their past (or present) reflects not only their deep attachment to their perception of history but also their misgivings, a feeling that maybe they've fouled up somewhere and maybe the critics have something.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfield, David. Still Fighting the Civil War: The American South and Southern History. (2002) pg. 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked about purported "neo-Confederate revisionism" and the people behind it, [[Arizona State University]] professor and Civil War historian [[Brooks D. Simpson]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is an active attempt to reshape historical memory, an effort by white Southerners to find historical justifications for present-day actions. The neo-Confederate movement's ideologues have grasped that if they control how people remember the past, they'll control how people approach the present and the future. Ultimately, this is a very conscious war for memory and heritage. It's a quest for legitimacy, the eternal quest for justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2000/arizona-state-professor-brooks-d-simpson-discusses-neo-confederate-movement|author=Southern Poverty Law Center|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|work=White Lies|date=2000|title=Arizona State Professor Brooks D. Simpson Discusses Neo-Confederate Movement|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Tenets of neo-Confederate beliefs ==
=== Historical revisionism ===
Neo-Confederates often hold iconoclastic views about the American Civil War and the Confederate States of America. Contrary to the views held by most Americans, neo-Confederates are openly critical of the presidency of [[Abraham Lincoln]] to varied degrees and of the history of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Various authors have written critiques of Lincoln and the Union. [[Major general (United States)|Major Geneneral]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William Tecumseh Sherman's]] [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] is singled out for purported atrocities against Southern civilians, in contrast to the mainstream historical perspective that Sherman targeted Southern infrastructure and curtailed killing rather than expanded it. [[Slavery]] is rarely mentioned—if it is, it is usually not defended and is denied as a primary cause for the Confederacy's starting of the American Civil War. Critics often accuse neo-Confederates of engaging in "[[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]]" and of acting as "[[Apologetics|apologists]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=110 Lincoln Reconstructed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/01/why-do-people-believe-myths-about-the-confederacy-because-our-textbooks-and-monuments-are-wrong/|title=Why do people believe myths about the Confederacy? Because our textbooks and monuments are wrong.|last=W. Loewen|first=James|date=July 1, 2015|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Confederates have been accused of downplaying the role of slavery in triggering the Civil War and misrepresenting African-American support for the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/untold-stories/black-confederates.html|title=Black Confederates|last=Smith|first=Sam|date=|website=www.civilwar.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''The Confederate and Neo-Confederate Reader'' says that toward the end of the 20th century—in order to support the idea that the Civil War was not about slavery—neo-Confederates began to claim that "thousands of African Americans had served in the Confederate army". A neo-Confederate publication, ''[[Confederate Veteran]]'', published by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the [[Military Order of the Stars and Bars]], said in 1992 that "the overwhelming majority of blacks during the War Between the States supported and defended, with armed resistance, the Cause of Southern Independence".&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, James W. and Sebesta, Edward H., ''The Confederate and Neo-Confederate Reader'', pp.17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Bruce Levine says that "their [neo-Confederates'] insistent celebration these days of 'Black Confederates' [...] seeks to legitimate that claim" that the war "had ''never'' [italics in original] been fought on behalf of slavery; loyalty to the South, Southern self-government, Southern culture, or states' rights — rather than to slavery and white supremacy — fueled the Southern war effort".&lt;ref&gt;Levine (2006) p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Honor of the Confederacy and its veterans&amp;nbsp;is another controversial feature of neo-Confederate dogma. The neo-Confederate movement is concerned with giving [[honor]] to the Confederacy itself, to the veterans of the Confederacy and Confederate veterans' cemeteries, to the various flags of the Confederacy and to Southern cultural identity.&lt;ref name="vastpublicindifference.blogspot.com"&gt;http://vastpublicindifference.blogspot.com/2008/05/confederate-monumental-landscape_26.html Confederate Monumental Landscape: Literate Sources&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political beliefs ===
Political values held by neo-Confederates vary, but they often revolve around a belief in [[limited government]], [[states' rights]], the [[Secession in the United States|right of states to secede]], [[theocracy]] and [[Southern nationalism]]—that is, the belief that the people of the [[Southern United States]] are part of a distinct and unique civilization. Neo-Confederates are sometimes associated with the [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian movements]] because of shared views of the role of government.

Neo-Confederates typically support a decentralized national government and are strong advocates of states' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/first-person/2016/9/30/13090100/confederacy-myths-lost-cause|title=Confessions of a former neo-Confederate|last=Black|first=William|date=Dec 16, 2016|work=Vox|access-date=2017-04-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicalresearch.org/2013/11/22/nullification-neo-confederates-and-the-revenge-of-the-old-right/|title=Nullification, Neo-Confederates, and the Revenge of the Old Right {{!}} Political Research Associates|last=Tabachnick|first=Rachel|date=November 22, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Confederates are strongly in favor of the right of [[secession]], claiming it is legal and thus openly advocate the secession of the Southern states and territories which comprised the old [[Confederate States of America]]. The [[League of the South]], for example, promotes the "independence of the Southern people" from the "American empire".&lt;ref name="dixienet.org"/&gt; Most neo-Confederate groups do not seek violent revolution, but rather an orderly separation, such as was done in the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]]. Many neo-Confederate groups have prepared for what they view as a possible collapse of the federal United States into its 50 separate states much like the [[Soviet Union collapse]]d and believe the Confederacy can be resurrected at that time.&lt;ref name="mojmir"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mrak|first=Mojmir|title=Succession of States|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1999|isbn=90-411-1145-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Confederates are typically opposed to the [[civil rights movement]], which they view as federal overreach. Historian [[Nancy MacLean]] states that neo-Confederates used the history of the Confederacy to justify their opposition to the civil rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean (2010) p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Blight writes that current neo-Confederates are "driven largely by the desire of current white supremacists to re-legitimize the Confederacy, while they tacitly reject the victories of the modern civil rights movement".&lt;ref&gt;http://cwmemory.com/2006/03/05/david-blight-reviews-bruce-levines/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural and religious ===
Many neo-Confederates promote an unabashed [[Christianity|Christian]] culture. For example, they support public displays of [[Christianity in the United States|Christianity]], such as [[Ten Commandments]] monuments and displays of the [[Christian cross]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_10cc.htm The Ten Commandments&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all neo-Confederates [[Patriot movement|strongly support]] the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to keep and bear arms]], present in both the [[United States Constitution]] and the [[Confederate States Constitution]]. They generally oppose unmitigated [[illegal immigration]] of foreign nationals into Southern states.&lt;ref&gt;http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2007/09/another_civil_war_1.html Washington Post: Another Civil War?&lt;/ref&gt; Some neo-Confederates view the Civil War as a conflict between a Christian South and a secular North.&lt;ref&gt;http://gis.depaul.edu/ehague/Articles/PUBLISHED%20CRAS%20ARTICLE.pdf  "The US Civil War As A Theological War: Confederate Christian Nationalism and the League of the South," in ''Canadian Review of American Studies'', Vol. 32 No. 3, pp. 253-284.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain neo-Confederates believe in an "[[English Americans|Anglo]]-[[Celts|Celtic]]" identity theory for residents of the South.&lt;ref&gt;http://dixienet.org/New%20Site/faq.shtml Frequently Asked Questions about the League of the South&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to an Anglo-Celtic and Christian identity, neo-Confederates may often identify as "[[Ethnic nationalism|Southern nationalists]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dixienet.org/rights/2014/2016_league_of_south_conference.php|title=2014 League Conference|last=South|first=League of the|website=dixienet.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic policies ===
Neo-Confederates usually advocate a [[free market]] economy which engages in significantly less taxation than currently found in the United States and which does not revolve around [[Fiat money|fiat currencies]] such as the [[United States dollar]].&lt;ref name="dixienet.org"&gt;http://www.dixienet.org/New%20Site/corebeliefs.shtml League of the South Core Beliefs Statement&lt;/ref&gt; They desire an extreme type of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic system involving a minimal role for the state.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Neo-Confederates and libertarianism ==
Historian [[Daniel Feller]] asserts that libertarian authors [[Thomas DiLorenzo]], Charles Adams and Jeffrey Rogers Hummel have produced a "marriage of neo-Confederates and libertarianism". Despite an apparent disconnect ("How can a lover of liberty defend slavery?"), Feller writes: 
{{quote|What unites the two, aside from their hostility to the liberal academic establishment, is their mutual loathing of big government. Adams, DiLorenzo, and Hummel view the Civil War through the prism of market economics. In their view its main consequence, and even its purpose, was to create a leviathan state that used its powers to suppress the most basic personal freedom, the right to choose. The Civil War thus marks a historic retreat for liberty, not an advance. Adams and DiLorenzo dismiss the slavery issue as a mere pretext for aggrandizing central power. All three authors see federal tyranny as the war's greatest legacy. And they all hate Abraham Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;Feller (2004) p. 186. Feller differentiates between Hummel and the other two.  He writes (p.190), "After this soapbox tirade [referring to DiLorenzo's "The Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War" and Adams' "When in the Course of Human Events: Arguing the Case for Southern Secession"], Jeffrey Hummel's "Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men" is a breath of fresh air. Hummel is a real historian."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a review of libertarian [[Thomas Woods|Thomas E. Woods, Jr.]]'s  ''The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History'', in turn Hummel refers to the works by DiLorenzo and Adams as "amateurish neo-Confederate books". Of Woods, Hummel states that the two main neo-Confederate aspects of Woods' work are his emphasis on a legal right of secession while ignoring the moral right to secession and his failure to acknowledge the importance of slavery in the Civil War. Hummel writes: 
{{quote|Woods writes 'that the slavery debate masked the real issue: the struggle over power and domination' (p. 48). Talk about a distinction without a difference. It is akin to stating that the demands of sugar lobbyists for protective quotas mask their real worry: political influence. Yes, slaveholders constituted a special interest that sought political power. Why? To protect slavery.&lt;ref name="la-articles.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.la-articles.org.uk/woods.htm Hummel ''"Thomas Woods and His Critics: A Review Essay''" Part II]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hummel also criticizes Woods' "neo-Confederate sympathies" in his chapter on Reconstruction. Most egregious was his "apologia for the Black Codes adopted by the southern states immediately after the Civil War". Part of the problem was Woods' reliance on an earlier neo-Confederate work, [[Robert Selph Henry]]'s 1938 book ''The Story of Reconstruction''.&lt;ref name="la-articles.org.uk"/&gt;

Historian Gerald J. Prokopowicz mentioned apprehension toward recognizing Lincoln's role in freeing slaves as well as libertarian attitudes towards the Confederacy in an interview regarding his book ''Did Lincoln Own Slaves? And Other Frequently Asked Questions about Abraham Lincoln'': 
{{quote|text=Some critics look at his careful and politically practical approach to ending slavery and mistake it for reluctance to help African-Americans. Others overlook slavery altogether and romanticize the Confederacy as a libertarian paradise crushed by the tyrant Lincoln.

But since even Lincoln's most extreme opponents can't deny that the end of slavery was a good thing, they have to try to disassociate Lincoln from emancipation, and that leads to the absurdity of implying that Lincoln must have been a slave owner.&lt;ref&gt;Change of Subject: Lincoln didn't own slaves, but people keep asking anyway.

Some intellectuals who have helped shape the modern neo-Confederate movement have been associated with libertarian organizations such as the [[Mises Institute]]. These individuals often insist on the South's right to secede and typically hold views in stark contrast to mainstream academia in regards to the causes and consequences of the American Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/ideologues?page=0,2|title=The Ideologues|last=|first=|date=December 21, 2004|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2017-04-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Zack Beauchamp of ''[[ThinkProgress]]'' argues that because of its small size, the libertarian movement has become partially beholden to a neo-Confederate demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/why-libertarians-will-never-shake-their-neo-confederate-ties-12d568418003|title=Why Libertarians Will Never Shake Their Neo-Confederate Ties|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|date=2013-07-11|work=ThinkProgress|access-date=2017-04-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary politics, some libertarians have tried to distance themselves from neo-Confederate ideology while also critiquing President Lincoln's wartime policies, such as the suspension of ''habeas corpus'', from a libertarian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.libertarianism.org/media/libertarian-view/libertarians-confederacy|title=Libertarians and the Confederacy|last=|first=|date=August 14, 2013|work=Libertarianism.org|access-date=2017-04-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neo-Confederate views and the Republican Party ==
{{see also|Southern Democrats}}
Historian Nancy MacLean writes that "since the 1960s the party of Lincoln has become the haven of neo-Confederacy. Having long prided itself on saving the Union, the Republican Party has become home to those who lionize the slaveholding South and romanticize the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] South". This embrace of neo-Confederate views is not exclusively about race, but it is related to a pragmatic political realization that the "retrospective romanticization of the Old South" and secession presented many possible themes that could be used as conservatives attempted to reverse the national changes initiated by the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;MacLean (2010) pp. 308-309&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] and the successes of the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|civil rights movement]], [[National conservatism|national conservative]] leaders distanced themselves from racial issues, but they continued to support a "color-blind" version of neo-Confederatism. MacLean writes that "even into the twenty-first century mainstream conservative Republican politicians continued to associate themselves with issues, symbols, and organizations inspired by the neo-Confederate Right".&lt;ref&gt;MacLean (2010) pp. 320-321&lt;/ref&gt;

The current situation is in contrast to the view that many neo-Confederates held concerning the pre-1960s Republican Party. In an article in the official publication of the educational foundation of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), ''Southern Mercury'', "Republican Party: Red From the Start",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswithviews.com/Stang/alan30.htm|title=Alan Stang -- Republican Party, Red From the Start|last=Stang|first=Alan|date=February 1, 2008|website=www.newswithviews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservative columnist Alan Stang claims that there was a [[Communism|communist]] conspiracy in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of the mid-19th century. He alleges that the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 revolutionaries]] in Europe were communists and that some of these revolutionaries came to the United States after the failed revolution to perpetrate some type of communist agenda in the United States. Stang states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Robert E.] Lee and [Thomas Jonathan] Jackson did not fully comprehend what they were fighting. Had this really been a 'Civil' War, rather than a secession, they would and could have easily seized Washington after Manassas and hanged our first Communist President and the other war criminals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stang continues: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;So, again, the Republican Party did not "go wrong." It was rotten from the start. It has never been anything but red. The characterization of Republican states as "red states" is quite appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;'Southern Mercury'' Vol. 6 No. 2 -- (March/April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recently, two prominent neo-Confederates—Walter Donald Kennedy and Al Benson—published the book ''Red Republicans and Lincoln's Marxists: Marxism in the Civil War'', in which they argue that Lincoln and the Republican Party were influenced by [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/kevin-swanson-red-tyrant-abraham-lincoln-introduced-communism-to-america/|title=Red Tyrant Abraham Lincoln Introduced Communism To America {{!}} Right Wing Watch|last=Swanson|first=Kevin|date=August 8, 2014|work=Right Wing Watch|access-date=2017-04-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of neo-Confederates ==
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) reports on the "neo-Confederate movement" almost always in a critical fashion. A special report by the SPLC's Mark Potok in their magazine, ''Intelligence Report'', critically described a number of groups as "neo-Confederate" in 2000. "Lincoln Reconstructed", published in 2003 in the ''Intelligence Report'', focuses on the resurgent demonization of Abraham Lincoln in the South. The article quotes the chaplain of the Sons of Confederate Veterans as giving an invocation which recalled "the last real [[Christian civilization]] on Earth". The article further mentions that the LewRockwell.com website hosts a collection of anti-Lincoln articles.

"Whitewashing the Confederacy" was a review that alleged that the movie ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' presented a false, pro-Confederate view of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=47|title=Intelligence Report|website=splcenter.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused the neo-Confederacy of being essentially a movement with [[Racism|racist]] undertones. Most prominently, the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] and the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] (formerly the [[White Citizens' Councils]]) have had this charge leveled against them.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Mercury, 2003-2008, 23 issues&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The '''politics of Somalia''' takes place in a framework of [[Federalism|federal]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]]. According to the Constitution of Somalia, the [[President of Somalia]] is [[head of state]], and [[Prime Minister of Somalia|Prime Minister]] as [[head of government]] who is appointed by the President with the parliament's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Antonios Kouroutakis Note on the Provisional Constitution of the Federal Republic of Somalia http://www.iconnectblog.com/2013/09/note-on-the-provisional-constitution-of-somalia/&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]], which consists of the Senate (upper house) and the National Assembly of Somalia (lower house). Together, they make up the Federal Parliament of Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/08/2012818183718864689.html |title=Somalia swears in historic new parliament |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012 The [[Federal Parliament of Somalia]] was concurrently inaugurated, ushering in the [[Federal Government of Somalia]], the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref name="Fcacsunesinpshm"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: UN Envoy Says Inauguration of New Parliament in Somalia 'Historic Moment'|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201208220474.html|accessdate=24 August 2012|newspaper=Forum on China-Africa Cooperation|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a new constitution and a new parliament representing diverse parties and factions, Somalia's political structure subsequently showed signs of stabilization.&lt;ref name="Aasratdocwau"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Muddassar|title=Somalia rising after two decades of civil war and unrest|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/views/2012/08/08/231008.html|accessdate=9 August 2012|newspaper=Al Arabiya|date=8 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809223608/http://english.alarabiya.net/views/2012/08/08/231008.html|archive-date=9 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hmeanbd&gt;{{cite web|last=Mulupi|first=Dinfin|title=Mogadishu: East Africa’s newest business destination?|url=http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/mogadishu-east-africas-newest-business-destination/17661/|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political history==

Following the [[Somali Rebellion|outbreak]] of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] and the ensuing collapse of the [[Siad Barre]] regime in the early 1990s, [[Somalia]]'s residents reverted to local forms of conflict resolution, consisting of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[religious law]] and [[Custom (law)|customary law]]. 
	
A few [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous regions]], including the [[Somaliland]], [[Puntland]] and [[Galmudug]] administrations, emerged in the north in the ensuing process of [[decentralization]]. The early 2000s saw the creation of fledgling interim federal administrations. The [[Transitional National Government]] (TNG) was established in 2000 followed by the formation of its successor the [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) in 2004, which reestablished national institutions such as the [[Military of Somalia]].&lt;ref name="factbook"&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Somalia|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|year=2011|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html|accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nytsnnpm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIAwfb"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency, ''The CIA World Factbook 2010'', Book 2010, (Skyhorse Publishing Inc.: 2009), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the TFG, assisted by Ethiopian troops, assumed control of most of the nation's southern conflict zones from the newly formed [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU). The ICU subsequently splintered into more radical groups such as [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], which battled the TFG and its [[AMISOM]] allies for control of the region,&lt;ref name="factbook"/&gt; with the insurgents losing most of the territory that they had seized by mid-2012. 
	
{{Main|Transitional Federal Institutions|Transitional Federal Government|Transitional Federal Parliament}}
The [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) was the internationally recognised government of Somalia until 20 August 2012, when its tenure officially ended.&lt;ref name="Fcacsunesinpshm"/&gt; It was established as one of the [[Transitional Federal Institutions]] (TFIs) of government as defined in the [[Transitional Federal Charter]] (TFC) adopted in November 2004 by the [[Transitional Federal Parliament]] (TFP).

The Transitional Federal Government officially comprised the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch of government, with the TFP serving as the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch. The government was headed by the [[President of Somalia]], to whom the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] reported through the [[Prime Minister of Somalia|Prime Minister]]. However, it was also used as a general term to refer to all three branches collectively.

===Islamic Courts Union and Ethiopian intervention===
{{See also|Battle of Mogadishu (2006)|Rise of the Islamic Courts Union (2006)|War in Somalia (2006–2009)}}
[[File:Somalian10ef5-1.jpg|thumb|right|Puntland strongman [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]], who eventually became a founder of the [[Transitional Federal Government]].]]
In 2006, the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU), an [[Islamic]] movement, assumed control of much of the southern part of the country and imposed [[Shari'a|Shari'a law]]. The Transitional Federal Government sought to re-establish its authority, and, with the assistance of [[Ethiopian National Defense Force|Ethiopian troops]], [[African Union]] peacekeepers and air support by the United States, managed to drive out the rival ICU and solidify its rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26334.html |title=Ethiopian Invasion of Somalia |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2007-08-14 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2007, as the [[Battle of Ras Kamboni]] raged, TFG President and [[Harti]] strongman [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]], entered Mogadishu for the first time since being elected to office. The government then relocated to [[Villa Somalia]] in the capital from its interim location in [[Baidoa]]. This marked the first time since the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.&lt;ref name="Gosppsdott"&gt;{{cite web |last=Online |first=Garowe |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=558:somalia-president-parliament-speaker-dispute-over-tfg-term&amp;catid=55:somalia&amp;Itemid=79 |title=Somalia President, Parliament Speaker dispute over TFG term |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131640/http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=558%3Asomalia-president-parliament-speaker-dispute-over-tfg-term&amp;catid=55%3Asomalia&amp;Itemid=79 |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including [[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]], regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272bc,0.html |title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 – The Commission's Watch List: Somalia |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005900/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CUSCIRF%2C%2C%2C4a4f272bc%2C0.html |archivedate=2011-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To shore up his rule in Mogadishu, Yusuf deployed thousands of his own troops from Puntland to Mogadishu. Financial support for this effort was provided by the autonomous region's government. This left little revenue for Puntland's own security forces and civil service employees, leaving the territory vulnerable to piracy and terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Sgtpe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Guide_to_Puntland_Election_2009.shtml |title=Somalia: Guide to Puntland Election 2009 |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2008-12-25 |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131633/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Guide_to_Puntland_Election_2009.shtml |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oagadsgumsp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2005/ga10386.html |title=Opening Annual General Assembly Debate, Secretary-General Urges Member States to Press in Tackling Poverty, Terrorism, Human Rights Abuses, Conflicts |publisher=Unis.unvienna.org |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December 2008, Yusuf announced before a united parliament in Baidoa his resignation as [[President of Somalia]]. In his speech, which was broadcast on national radio, Yusuf expressed regret at failing to end the country's seventeen-year conflict as his government had mandated to do.&lt;ref name=Resignation&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7802622.stm "Somalia's president quits office"], BBC News, 29 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He also blamed the international community for its failure to support the government, and said that the speaker of parliament would succeed him in office per the [[Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic|Charter]] of the Transitional Federal Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a790e984-d590-11dd-a9cc-000077b07658.html "Somali President Yusuf resigns"], Reuters (FT.com), 29 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coalition government===

Between 31 May and 9 June 2008, representatives of Somalia's federal government and the moderate Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) participated in peace talks in [[Djibouti]] brokered by the former United Nations Special Envoy to Somalia, [[Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah]]. The conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation. Parliament was subsequently expanded to 550 seats to accommodate ARS members, which then elected [[Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed]], the former ARS chairman, to office. President Sharif shortly afterwards appointed [[Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke]], the son of slain former President [[Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke]], as the nation's new Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="factbook"/&gt;
[[File:Somalian embassy in Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Embassy]] of Somalia in [[Paris]], [[France]].]]
With the help of the growing [[African Union]] regional intervention force [[AMISOM]], the coalition government also began a [[War in Somalia (2009-)|counteroffensive]] in February 2009 to seize more control of the southern half of the country. The TFG formed an alliance with the [[Islamic Courts Union]], other members of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]], a moderate [[Sufism|Sufi]] militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kamaal says: |url=http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/ |title=UN boss urges support for Somalia ahead of Istanbul summit |publisher=Horseedmedia.net |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2010-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619183438/http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/ |archive-date=2010-06-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam, the two main Islamist groups in opposition, began to fight amongst themselves in mid-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8318798.stm |title=Islamists break Somali port truce |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a truce, in March 2009, Somalia's coalition government announced that it would re-implement Shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.&lt;ref name="Shariah in Somalia"&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=119757&amp;d=1&amp;m=3&amp;y=2009 Shariah in Somalia] – ''[[Arab News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, conflict continued in the southern and central parts of the country. Within months, the coalition government had gone from holding about 70% of south-central Somalia's conflict zones, territory which it had inherited from the previous Yusuf administration, to losing control of over 80% of the disputed territory to the Islamist insurgents.&lt;ref name="Gosppsdott"/&gt;

During the coalition government's brief tenure, Somalia topped the [[Fund For Peace]]'s [[Failed States Index]] for three consecutive years. In 2009, [[Transparency International]] ranked the nation in last place on its annual [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2009|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a metric that purports to show the prevalence of corruption in a country's public sector. In mid-2010, the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]] also ranked Somalia in the next-to-last position, in between war-afflicted Iraq and Afghanistan, on its [[Global Peace Index]]. During the same period, the UN International Monitoring Group (IMG) published a report claiming that the Somali government's security forces were ineffective and corrupt, and that up to half of the food aid that was destined for the conflict-stricken parts of the country was being misdirected. It also accused Somali officials of collaborating with pirates, UN contractors of helping insurgents, and the [[Eritrea]]n government of still supporting rebel groups in southern Somalia despite earlier sanctions imposed on the former. Somalia's government and local businessmen, as well as [[United Nations]] officials and the Eritrean government all emphatically rejected the report's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gettleman|first=Jeffrey|title=Somalia’s President Assails U.N.

In 2010, reports surfaced linking the secessionist government of the northwestern Somaliland region with the Islamist extremists that are currently waging war against the Transitional Federal Government and its African Union allies. [[Garowe Online]] reported in October that Mohamed Said Atom, an arms-smuggler believed to be allied with Al-Shabaab and who is on U.S. and U.N. security watch-lists, was hiding out in Somaliland after being pursued by the neighboring Puntland region's authorities for his role in targeted assassination attempts against Puntland officials as well as bomb plots.&lt;ref name="Sasrahisr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somali_Al_Shabaab_member_Atom_hiding_in_Somaliland_Report.shtml |title=Somalia: Al Shabaab rebel Atom 'hiding in Somaliland': Report |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2010-10-23 |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514132158/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somali_Al_Shabaab_member_Atom_hiding_in_Somaliland_Report.shtml |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sssfaalsigp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_70_Somaliland_soldiers_fought_alongside_Al_Shabaab_in_Galgala_Puntland.shtml |title=Somalia: '70 Somaliland soldiers fought alongside Al Shabaab in Galgala': Puntland |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225091844/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_70_Somaliland_soldiers_fought_alongside_Al_Shabaab_in_Galgala_Puntland.shtml |archivedate=2011-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Atom's followers were also reportedly receiving medical attention in the region, after having been wounded in a counter-terrorism raid in the [[Galgala]] hills by Puntland security personnel.&lt;ref name="Sasrahisr"/&gt;

According to Puntland government documents, the Somaliland region's [[Dahir Riyale Kahin|Riyale]] government in 2006 both financed and offered military assistance to Atom's men as part of a campaign to destabilize the autonomous territory via proxy agents and to distract attention away from the Somaliland government's own attempts at occupying the disputed [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] province. The Puntland Intelligence Agency (PIA), a covert organization supported and trained by U.S. counter-terrorism agencies based in Djibouti, also indicated that over 70 salaried Somaliland soldiers had fought alongside Atom's militiamen during the Galgala operation, including one known Somaliland intelligence official who died in the ensuing battle.&lt;ref name="Sssfaalsigp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ssibatse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Editorial_29/Somalia_Somaliland_is_becoming_Africa_s_terrorism_secret_Editorial.shtml |title=Somalia: Somaliland is becoming Africa's 'terrorism secret' [Editorial&amp;#93; |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131636/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Editorial_29/Somalia_Somaliland_is_becoming_Africa_s_terrorism_secret_Editorial.shtml |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the Puntland government issued a press release accusing the incumbent Somaliland administration of providing a safe haven for Atom and of attempting to revive remnants of his militia.&lt;ref name="Spidcasgttapr"&gt;{{cite web |last=Online |first=Garowe |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=555:somalia-puntland-is-deeply-concerned-about-somalilands-growing-ties-to-al-shabaab-press-release&amp;catid=59:press-releases&amp;Itemid=128 |title=Somalia: Puntland is Deeply Concerned About Somaliland's Growing Ties to Al Shabaab [Press Release&amp;#93; |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131556/http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=555:somalia-puntland-is-deeply-concerned-about-somalilands-growing-ties-to-al-shabaab-press-release&amp;catid=59:press-releases&amp;Itemid=128 |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several top commanders in the Al-Shabaab group, including former leader [[Moktar Ali Zubeyr|Ahmed Abdi Godane]] ("Moktar Ali Zubeyr"), are also reported to hail from the Somaliland region, with Godane quoted as saying that Al Shabaab insurgents "should not interfere in Somaliland until Puntland is destabilized first."&lt;ref name="Sasrahisr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Srsisimr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2010/10/25/Somalia-Islamists-splinter-in-major-rift/UPI-18881288029099/ |title=Somalia Islamists splinter in major rift |publisher=Upi.com |date=2010-10-25 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforms===
Somalia's coalition government enacted numerous political reforms since taking office in 2009. One of its first changes involved ensuring that all government institutions, which had previously been spread out in various areas throughout the country, were now based in [[Mogadishu]], the nation's capital. The [[Central Bank of Somalia]] was also re-established, and a national plan as well as an effective anti-corruption commission were put into place.&lt;ref name="AfDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afdb.org/en/news-events/article/afdb-approves-a-2m-grant-for-somalia-5415/ |title=AfDB approves a $2m grant for Somalia |publisher=Afdb.org |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, Somalia's Transitional Federal Government hired global [[professional services]] firm [[Pricewaterhousecoopers]] to monitor development funding and serving as a trustee of an account in Mogadishu for the security, healthcare and education sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camagonline.co.uk/News/2728.aspx |title=PwC asked to monitor aid in Somalia |publisher=Camagonline.co.uk |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504061133/http://www.camagonline.co.uk/News/2728.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in November of that year with a $2 million agreement between the government and the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB), which saw Somalia re-engage with the AfDB after nearly two decades of interruption. The grant is aimed at providing financial and technical assistance; specifically, to develop a sound legal framework for monetary and fiscal institutions and human and institutional capacity building, as well as to establish  public financial systems that are transparent.&lt;ref name="AfDB"/&gt;

Similarly, the autonomous Puntland region's new administration, which took office in early 2009, has also implemented numerous reforms such as the expansion and improvement of its security and judicial sectors. According to [[Garowe Online]], to bolster the region's justice system, numerous new prosecutors, judges and other court personnel as well as additional prison guards were hired and trained. In July 2010, the Puntland Council of Ministers unanimously approved a new anti-terrorism law to more efficiently handle terror suspects and their accomplices; a special court is also expected to be established within the region's existing criminal courts system to facilitate the task.&lt;ref name="Puntantel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_Cabinet_approves_counterterrorism_law.shtml |title=Somalia: Puntland Cabinet approves counterterrorism law |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2010-07-17 |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514132216/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_Cabinet_approves_counterterrorism_law.shtml |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscally, a transparent, [[Government budget|budget]]-based [[public finance]] system was established, which has reportedly helped increase public confidence in government. In addition, a new regional constitution was drafted and later passed on 15 June 2009, which is believed to represent a significant step toward the eventual introduction of a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] political system to the region for the first time;&lt;ref name="GARW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Editorial_29/Somalia_President_Farole_the_Pride_of_Puntland_Editorial.shtml |title=President Farole – the Pride of Puntland |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619122328/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Editorial_29/Somalia_President_Farole_the_Pride_of_Puntland_Editorial.shtml |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such a system already exists in the adjacent Somaliland region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/14904 |title=Somaliland women prepare strategy for election |publisher=Afrol.com |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modest reforms were also put into motion in the social sector, particularly in the education and healthcare fields. The regional government has hired more healthcare workers and teachers, with major plans underway for school and hospital renovations.&lt;ref name="GARW"/&gt; One of the most significant new reforms enacted by the incumbent Puntland administration is the launching in May 2009 of the Puntland Agency for Social Welfare (PASWE), the first organization of its kind in Somali history. The agency provides medical, educational and counseling support to vulnerable groups and individuals such as orphans, the disabled and the blind. PASWE is overseen by a Board of Directors, which consists of religious scholars (''[[Ulama|ulema]]''), businesspeople, intellectuals and traditional elders.&lt;ref name="PASWE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_leader_launches_welfare_agency_printer.shtml |title=Somalia: Puntland leader launches welfare agency |publisher=Garoweonline.com |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024151636/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_leader_launches_welfare_agency_printer.shtml |archivedate=2013-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010-2012 government===
On 14 October 2010, diplomat [[Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed]] (Farmajo) was appointed the new Prime Minister of Somalia.

Additional members of the Independent Constitutional Commission were also appointed to engage Somali constitutional lawyers, religious scholars and experts in Somali culture over the nation's upcoming new constitution, a key part of the government's Transitional Federal Tasks. In addition, high level federal delegations were dispatched to defuse clan-related tensions in several regions.

An Anti-Corruption Commission with the power to carry out formal investigations and to review government decisions and protocols was also established to more closely monitor all activities by public officials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">A '''postal worker''' is one who works for a [[post office]], such as a [[mail]] carrier. In the [[United States|U.S.]], postal workers are represented by the National Postal Mail Handlers Union - NPMHU, the National Association of Rural Letter Carriers and the [[American Postal Workers Union]], part of the [[AFL-CIO]]. In [[Canada]], they are represented by the [[Canadian Union of Postal Workers]] and in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Communication Workers Union (UK)|Communication Workers Union]].

The US Postal Service employs around 584,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunewsviews.com/postal-employees-stats-at-a-glance.htm Postal Employees Stats at a Glance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131110549/http://lunewsviews.com/postal-employees-stats-at-a-glance.htm |date=2009-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bulk of these work as:

*Service Clerks - Sell stamps and postage, help people pick up packages and assist with other services such as passports.
*Mail Sorters - Physically sort the mail to go to the correct place.  As automation has become more common, some of these people now operate the sorting machines.
*Mail Carriers - Deliver the mail.  In densely populated areas this is done on foot.  In urban areas the carriers often use a [[mail truck]] and in rural areas carriers drive their own vehicles.

Most postal workers in the US make between $36,000 and $43,000 per year.

The phrase was not very often used until a spate of [[workplace violence]] incidents by postal workers in the late 1980s made headlines. The incidents also led to the coining of the phrase "[[going postal]]".

[[File:Extreme poverty 1981-2008.svg|thumb|Graph (based on data from the World Bank) showing the proportion of the world's population (blue) and the absolute numbers of people (red) living on &lt;1, &lt;1.25, and &lt;2 US dollars a day (2005 equivalent values) between 1981 and 2008]]
'''Poverty reduction''', or '''poverty alleviation''', is a set of measures, both [[economic]] and [[humanitarian]], that are intended to permanently lift people out of [[poverty]].

Measures, like those promoted by [[Henry George]] in his economics classic ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', are those that raise, or are intended to raise, ways of enabling the poor to create wealth for themselves as a means of ending poverty forever. In modern times, various economists within the [[Georgism]] movement propose measures like the [[land value tax]] to enhance access to the natural world for all. Poverty occurs in both [[developing country|developing countries]] and [[developed country|developed countries]]. While poverty is much more widespread in developing countries, both types of countries undertake poverty reduction measures.

Poverty has been historically accepted in some parts of the world as inevitable as non-industrialized economies produced very little while populations grew almost as fast, making wealth scarce.&lt;ref&gt;"Under traditional (i.e., non-industrialized) modes of economic production, widespread poverty had been accepted as inevitable. The total output of goods and services, even if equally distributed, would still have been insufficient to give the entire population a [[right to an adequate standard of living]] by prevailing standards. With the economic productivity that resulted from industrialization, however, this ceased to be the case" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], "Poverty"&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey Parker wrote that {{quote|In Antwerp and Lyon, two of the largest cities in western Europe, by 1600 three-quarters of the total population were too poor to pay taxes, and therefore likely to need relief in times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]] (2001). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qy8y8rHgucoC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Europe in crisis, 1598–1648]''". Wiley–Blackwell. p.11. {{ISBN|0-631-22028-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Poverty reduction occurs largely as a result of overall economic growth.&lt;ref name=cato&gt;[https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/ending-mass-poverty "Ending Mass Poverty"] by Ian Vásquez, [[Cato Institute]], September 4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krugman&gt;Krugman, Paul, and Robin Wells. Macroeconomics. 2. New York City: Worth Publishers, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Famine|Food shortages]] were common before modern agricultural technology and in places that lack them today, such as [[nitrogen fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s and [[irrigation]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm Forgotten benefactor of humanity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ethicalman/2009/03/is_the_green_movement_part_of_the_problem.html|title= Ethical Man blog: Is the green movement part of the problem?|publisher=BCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dawn of [[industrial revolution]] led to high economic growth, eliminating mass poverty in what is now considered the developed world.&lt;ref name=cato/&gt; World GDP per person quintupled during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Angus Maddison]], see graph&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, 75% of humanity lived on less than a dollar a day, while in 2001, only about 20% did.&lt;ref name=cato/&gt;

Today, continued economic development is constrained by the lack of [[economic freedom]]s. [[Economic liberalization]] requires extending [[property rights]] to the poor, especially to [[land rights|land]].&lt;ref name=landrights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3006562.stm|title=Business – Land rights 'help fight poverty'|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Financial services]], notably [[savings]], can be made accessible to the poor through technology, such as [[mobile banking]].&lt;ref name=time.com&gt;http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1918733,00.html Microfinance’s next step: deposits&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=safaricom&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8194241.stm Africa’s mobile banking revolution&lt;/ref&gt; Inefficient institutions, corruption, and political instability can also discourage investment. [[Aid]] and government support in health, education, and [[infrastructure]] helps growth by increasing [[human capital|human]] and [[physical capital]].&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

Poverty alleviation also involves improving the living conditions of people who are already poor. [[Aid]], particularly in the medical and scientific areas, is essential in providing better lives, such as the [[Green Revolution]] and the eradication of [[smallpox]].&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;&lt;ref name=aid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4210122.stm|title=Science/Nature – Why aid does work|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with today's [[development aid]] include the high proportion of [[tied aid]], which mandates receiving nations to buy products, often more expensive, originating only from donor countries.&lt;ref name=tiedaid/&gt; Nevertheless, some believe ([[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[The Life You Can Save]]'') that small changes in the way each of us in affluent nations lives our lives could solve world poverty.

==Economic liberalization==
Some commentators have claimed that, due to [[economic liberalization]], poverty in the world is rising rather than declining,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/08/global-inequality-may-be-much-worse-than-we-think "Global inequality may be much worse than we think"], ''The Guardian'', April 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the data provided by the World Bank, which shows poverty is decreasing, is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;http://courses.arch.vt.edu/courses/wdunaway/gia5524/edward06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noticiasdeabajo.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/banco-mundial-una-disminucion-de-la-pobreza-en-el-mundo/|title=Banco Mundial: ¿Una disminución de la pobreza en el mundo?|date=17 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharing.org/information-centre/articles/world-bank-poverty-figures-what-do-they-mean|title=World bank poverty figures: what do they mean? |publisher= Share The World's Resources (STWR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anwarshaikhecon.org/sortable/images/docs/publications/international_trade/2007/1-Shaikh%20-%20Globalization%20and%20the%20Myths%20of%20Free%20Trade%20(Introduction).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  They also argue that extending property rights protection to the poor is one of the most important poverty reduction strategies a nation can implement.&lt;ref name=cato/&gt; Securing property rights to land, the largest asset for most societies, is vital to their economic freedom.&lt;ref name=cato/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/id/160070 How to spread democracy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]] concludes that increasing land rights is ‘the key to reducing poverty’ citing that land rights greatly increase poor people’s wealth, in some cases doubling it.&lt;ref name=landrights/&gt; It is estimated that state recognition of the property of the poor would give them assets worth 40 times all the foreign aid since 1945.&lt;ref name=cato/&gt; Although approaches varied, the [[World Bank]] said the key issues were security of tenure and ensuring land transactions were low cost.&lt;ref name=landrights/&gt; In China and India, noted reductions in poverty in recent decades have occurred mostly as a result of the abandonment of [[collective farming]] in China and the cutting of government red tape in India.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5407770.stm|title=Can aid bring an end to poverty?|publisher=BBC News: Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New enterprises and foreign investment can be driven away by the results of inefficient institutions, corruption, the weak rule of law and excessive bureaucratic burdens.&lt;ref name=cato/&gt;&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt; It takes two days, two bureaucratic procedures, and $280 to open a business in Canada while an entrepreneur in Bolivia must pay $2,696 in fees, wait 82 business days, and go through 20 procedures to do the same.&lt;ref name=cato/&gt; Such costly barriers favor big firms at the expense of small enterprises where most jobs are created.&lt;ref name=cato/&gt; In India before economic reforms, businesses had to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which was in effect a tax on business.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

However, ending government sponsorship of social programs is sometimes advocated as a [[free market]] principle with tragic consequences. For example, the [[World Bank]] presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for [[fertilizer]] that many farmers cannot afford at market prices. The reconfiguration of public financing in former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states during their [[transition economy|transition to a market economy]] called for reduced spending on health and education, sharply increasing poverty.&lt;ref name=malawi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Transition: The First Ten Years – Analysis and Lessons for Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union'', The World Bank, Washington, DC, 2002, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0D8163FF931A25753C1A9669C8B63 Study Finds Poverty Deepening in Former Communist Countries]".

[[Trade liberalization]] increases total surplus of trading nations. [[Remittance]]s sent to poor countries, such as India, are sometimes larger than [[foreign direct investment]] and total [[remittances]] are more than double aid flows from [[OECD]] countries.&lt;ref name=remittance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=894664&amp;story_id=14586906|title=The aid workers who really help|date=8 October 2009|publisher=|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign investment and export industries helped fuel the economic expansion of [[Four Asian Tigers|fast growing Asian nations]].&lt;ref name=vogel991&gt;Vogel, Ezra F. 1991. ''The Four Little Dragons: The Spread of Industrialization in East Asia.''

==Capital, infrastructure and technology==

Long run economic growth per person is achieved through increases in capital (factors that increase productivity), both human and physical, and technology.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt; Improving [[human capital]], in the form of health, is needed for economic growth. Nations do not necessarily need wealth to gain health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcp2.org/main/Home.html|title=Disease Control Priorities Project|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406154431/http://dcp2.org/main/Home.html|archivedate=6 April 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Sri Lanka]] had a [[maternal mortality rate]] of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/02/AR2006040200813.html|title=Saving Millions for Just a Few Dollars|first=David|last=Brown|date=3 April 2006|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reduced it to 0.5–0.6% in the 1950s and to 0.06% today.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; However, it was spending less each year on [[maternal health]] because it learned what worked and what did not.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; Knowledge on the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be elusive but educational measures to disseminate what works are available, such as the disease control priorities project.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060406154431/http://dcp2.org/main/Home.html] Promoting hand washing is one of the most cost effective health intervention and can cut [[child mortality|deaths]] from the major childhood diseases of [[diarrhea]] and [[pneumonia]] by half.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7670855.stm Millions mark UN hand washing day&lt;/ref&gt;

Human capital, in the form of education, is an even more important determinant of economic growth than physical capital.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt; [[Deworming]] children costs about 50 cents per child per year and reduces non-attendance from [[anemia]], illness and [[malnutrition]] and is only a twenty-fifth as expensive to increase school attendance as by constructing schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/books/review/Kristof-t.html|title=How Can We Help the World’s Poor?|first=Nicholas D.|last=Kristof|date=20 November 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN economists argue that good infrastructure, such as roads and information networks, helps market reforms to work.&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt; China claims it is investing in railways, roads, ports and rural telephones in African countries as part of its formula for economic development.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_6079000/6079838.stm|title=Home | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the technology of the [[steam engine]] that originally began the dramatic decreases in poverty levels. Cell phone technology brings the market to poor or rural sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html?page=2|title=UN aid debate: Give cash, not food?|first=Rob|last=Crilly|date=4 June 2008|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; With necessary information, remote farmers can produce specific crops to sell to the buyers that brings the best price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0223/p01s04-woaf.html|title=Market approach recasts often-hungry Ethiopia as potential bread basket|first=Scott|last=Baldauf|date=23 February 2007|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such technology also helps bring economic freedom by making [[financial services]] accessible to the poor. Those in poverty place overwhelming importance on having a safe place to [[savings|save]] money, much more so than receiving loans.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; Also, a large part of [[microfinance]] loans are spent on products that would usually be paid by a [[checking account|checking]] or [[savings account]].&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt; [[Mobile banking]] addresses the problem of the heavy regulation and costly maintenance of [[saving account]]s.&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt; Mobile financial services in the [[developing world]], ahead of the [[developed world]] in this respect, could be worth $5 billion by 2012.&lt;ref name=m-banking&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8100388.stm Africa pioneers mobile bank push&lt;/ref&gt; [[Safaricom]]’s [[M-Pesa]] launched one of the first systems where a network of agents of mostly shopkeepers, instead of bank branches, would take [[Deposit account|deposits]] in cash and translate these onto a virtual account on customers' phones. Cash transfers can be done between phones and issued back in cash with a small commission, making [[remittance]]s safer.&lt;ref name="safaricom"/&gt;

However, several academic studies have shown that mobile phones have only limited affect on poverty reduction when not accompanied by other basic infrastructure development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mobile-phones-are-not-always-a-cure-for-poverty-in-remote-regions-73901|title=Mobile phones are not always a cure for poverty in remote regions|first=Petr|last=Matous|date=30 March 2017|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment and productivity==
[[File:Shiva Kumar - 2 - Importance of MDGs in redifining the Poverty-- TVP.webm|thumb| [[A. K. Shiva Kumar|Shiva Kumar]] – The importance of MDGs in redefining what are the poverty drivers]]

Economic growth has the indirect potential to alleviate poverty, as a result of a simultaneous increases in employment opportunities and [[labour productivity]].&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Claire Melamed, Renate Hartwig and Ursula Grant 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5752&amp;title=jobs-growth-poverty-employment Jobs, growth and poverty: what do we know, what don't we know, what should we know?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; A study by researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) of 24 countries that experienced growth found that in 18 cases, poverty was alleviated.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; However, employment is no guarantee of escaping poverty, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) estimates that as many as 40% of workers are poor, not earning enough to keep their families above the $2 a day poverty line.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; For instance, in India most of the chronically poor are wage earners in [[informal sector|formal employment]], because their jobs are insecure and low paid and offer no chance to accumulate wealth to avoid risks.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; This appears to be the result of a negative relationship between employment creation and increased productivity, when a simultaneous positive increase is required to reduced poverty. According to the [[UNRISD]], increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Increases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of "[[working poor]]", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of "quality" and not "quantity" in labour market policies.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; In Viet Nam, for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as [[manufacturing]].&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; The [[services sector]] is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth. Agriculture provides a safety net for jobs and economic buffer when other sectors are struggling.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; This study suggests a more nuanced understanding of economic growth and quality of life and poverty alleviation.

===Helping farmers===
Raising farm incomes is described as the core of the antipoverty effort as three quarters of the poor today are farmers.&lt;ref name=agriculture&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/world/africa/20worldbank.html|title=World Bank report puts agriculture at core of antipoverty effort|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Celia W.|last=Dugger|date=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates show that growth in the agricultural productivity of small farmers is, on average, at least twice as effective in benefiting the poorest half of a country’s population as growth generated in nonagricultural sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/0,,contentMDK:21893554~menuPK:2643747~pagePK:64020865~piPK:149114~theSitePK:336992,00.html|title=Climate Change: Bangladesh facing the challenge|publisher=The [[World Bank]]|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 2012 study suggested that new varieties of [[chickpea]] could benefit Ethiopian farmers in future. The study assessed the potential economic and poverty impact of 11 improved chickpea varieties, released by the national agricultural research organization of Ethiopia in collaboration with the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]], ([[ICRISAT]]). The researchers estimated that using the varieties would bring about a total benefit of US$111 million for 30 years  with consumers receiving 39% of the benefit and producers 61%. They expected the generated benefit would lift more than 0.7 million people (both producers and consumers) out of poverty. The authors concluded that further investments in the [[chickpea]] and other legume research in [[Ethiopia]] were therefore justified as a means of poverty alleviation.&lt;ref&gt;Macharia I, Orr A, Simtowe F and Asfaw, S., ''Potential economic and poverty impact of improved chickpea technologies in Ethiopia'' http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/chickpea/685/107. [[ICRISAT]]. Downloaded 26 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving water management is an effective way to help reduce poverty among farmers. With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherji, A. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071102102545/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Other/index.aspx Revitalising Asia’s Irrigation: To sustainably meet tomorrow’s food needs] 2009, [[IWMI]] and [[FAO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Water Management Institute]] in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] aims to improve the management of land and water resources for food, livelihoods and the environment. One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole area was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/Landing_Pages/WIB8.aspx ''Water, poverty and equity'']. Water Issue Brief, Issue 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Building opportunities for self-sufficiency====
Making employment opportunities available is just as important as increasing income and access to basic needs.  Poverty activist [[Paul Polak]] has based his career around doing both at once, creating companies that employ the poor while creating "radically" affordable goods.  In his book ''Out of Poverty'' he argues that traditional poverty eradication strategies have been misguided and fail to address underlying problems.   He lists, “Three Great Poverty Eradication Myths”: that we can donate people out of poverty, that national economic growth will end poverty, and that Big Business, operating as it does now, will end poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Polak|first=Paul|title=Out of Poverty|url=http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=9781605092768&amp;PG=1&amp;Type=BL&amp;PCS=BKP}}&lt;/ref&gt;     Economic models which lead to national growth and more big business will not necessarily lead to more opportunities for self-sufficiency.

A 2012 World Bank research article, “A Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India,” looked at the three nations’ strategies and their relative challenges and successes. During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.29 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2008. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 18%; India from 80% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: “China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil’s case for lack of growth and in India’s case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China’s case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India’s case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/poverty-reduction-brazil-china-india/ |title = Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aid==
{{main|Aid}}

===Welfare===
{{Main|Welfare's effect on poverty}}
Aid in its simplest form is a [[basic income grant]], a form of [[social security]] periodically providing citizens with money. In pilot projects in [[Namibia]], where such a program pays just $13 a month, people were able to pay tuition fees, raising the proportion of children going to school by 92%, child [[malnutrition]] rates fell from 42% to 10% and economic activity grew 10%.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,642310,00.html A new approach to aid: How a basic income program saved a Namibian village&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Namibians line up"&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7415814.stm Namibians line up for free cash&lt;/ref&gt; Aid could also be rewarded based on doing certain requirements. [[Conditional Cash Transfer]]s, widely credited as a successful anti-poverty program, is based on actions such as enrolling children in school or receiving [[vaccination]]s.&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin.csmonitor.com/2008/1113/p01s03-woam.html?page=1|title=Brazil becomes antipoverty showcase|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, for example, the country with the largest such program, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height.&lt;ref name=csm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0921/p06s10-woam.html|title=Latin America makes a dent in poverty with 'conditional cash' programs|first=Tyler|last=Bridges|date=21 September 2009|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial fears that the program would encourage families to stay at home rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children are prevented from begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.&lt;ref name=csm/&gt;

[[Welfare states]] have an effect on poverty reduction. Currently modern, expansive welfare states that ensure economic opportunity, independence and security in a near universal manner are still the exclusive domain of the [[Developed countries|developed nations]].&lt;ref name="Esping-Andersen"&gt;Esping-Andersen, G. (1990). ''The three worlds of welfare capitalism''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly constituting at least 20% of GDP, with the largest [[Scandinavia]]n welfare states constituting over 40% of GDP.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, N. (2004). ''The economics of the welfare state''. New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt; These modern welfare states, which largely arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, seeing their greatest expansion in the mid 20th century, and have proven themselves highly effective in reducing relative as well as absolute poverty in all analyzed high-income OECD countries.&lt;ref name="Kenworthy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenworthy | first1 = L | year = 1999 | title = Do social-welfare policies reduce poverty?

Philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]] is a supporter of gathering funds for the poor by using a sort of [[Global Resources Dividend]].

===Development aid===
{{See also|Development aid|Tied aid}}
A major proportion of aid from donor nations is ‘tied’, mandating that a receiving nation buy products originating only from the donor country.&lt;ref name=tiedaid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=24509|title=News and Views from the Global South|publisher=Inter Press Service|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223203509/http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=24509|archivedate=23 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be harmful economically.&lt;ref name=tiedaid/&gt; For example, [[Eritrea]] is forced to spend aid money on foreign goods and services to build a network of railways even though it is cheaper to use local expertise and resources.&lt;ref name=tiedaid/&gt; Money from the United States to fight AIDS requires it be spent on U.S brand name drugs that can cost up to $15,000 a year compared to $350 a year for [[generic drug|generics]] from other countries.&lt;ref name=tiedaid/&gt; Only Norway, Denmark, Netherlands and Britain have stopped tying their aid.&lt;ref name=tiedaid/&gt;

Some people disagree with aid when looking at where the development aid money from NGO's and other funding is going.  Funding tends to be used in a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development.  This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease.  The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, morbidity, risk of mortality, and the feasibility of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Julia A.|author2=Kenneth S. Warren|title=Selective primary health care: An interim strategy for disease control in developing countries.|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine. Part C: Medical Economics |volume=14|year=1980|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this ranking system, the disease that cause the most mortality and are most easily treated are given the funding.  The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place.  By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected.  This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the  disease again once back in the conditions of which they came from.  To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure.  Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable.  These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birn|first=Anne-Emanuelle|author2=Armando Solórzano|title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=49|year=1999|page=1209|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00160-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[think tanks]] and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagekonpa.com/archives/Haiti;s%20rice%20farmers%20suffered%20since%20trade%20barrier%20in%201994.htm Haiti's rice farmers and poultry growers have suffered greatly since trade barriers were lowered in 1994.] By Jane Regan&lt;/ref&gt; or because it's tied with the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives.&lt;ref name=tiedaid/&gt; Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp US and Foreign Aid], GlobalIssues.org&lt;/ref&gt; and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance. Policy becomes much more oriented toward what will get more aid money than it does towards meeting the needs of the people.&lt;ref name="ABC-myth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=1955664&amp;page=1|title=Will More Foreign Aid End Global Poverty?|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=15 November 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with the aid system and not aid itself are that the aid is excessively directed towards the salaries of consultants from donor countries, the aid is not spread properly, neglecting vital, less publicized area such as agriculture, and the aid is not properly coordinated among donors, leading to a plethora of disconnected projects rather than unified strategies.&lt;ref name=aid/&gt;

Supporters of aid argue that these problems may be solved with better auditing of how the aid is used.&lt;ref name="ABC-myth" /&gt; Immunization campaigns for children, such as against [[polio]], [[diphtheria]] and [[measles]] have saved millions of lives.&lt;ref name=aid/&gt; Aid from non-governmental organizations may be more effective than governmental aid; this may be because it is better at reaching the poor and better controlled at the grassroots level.&lt;ref name="ABC-myth"/&gt; As a point of comparison, the annual [[world military spending]] is over $1 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yearbook2006.sipri.org/|title=SIPRI Yearbook 2006|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debt relief===
{{See also|Debt relief}}
One of the proposed ways to help poor countries that emerged during the [[Brady Plan|1980s]] has been [[debt relief]]. Given that many less developed nations have gotten themselves into extensive debt to banks and governments from the rich nations, and given that the interest payments on these debts are often more than a country can generate per year in profits from exports, cancelling part or all of these debts may allow poor nations "to get out of the hole".&lt;ref&gt;World Bank and International Monetary Fund. 2001. ''Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, Progress Report.'' Retrieved from http://worldbank.org.&lt;/ref&gt; If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for priorities which help reduce poverty such as basic health-care and education.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4081220.stm African debt relief&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from the rounds of debt relief in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4883062.stm|title= Zambia overwhelmed by free health care|publisher=BBC NEWS – Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of education and skillbuilding as precursors to economic development ==

[[File:Working Together To End Poverty One Nail At A Time - 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|"Working together to end poverty one nail at a time," T-shirt, 50th Anniversary of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] ]]
Universal public education has some role in preparing youth for basic academic skills and perhaps many trade skills, as well. Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size—an important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty.

===Microloans===

One of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the [[Grameen Bank]] in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of [[irrigation]]. A specific example is the Thai government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. [[IFAD|The International Fund for Agricultural Development]] [[IFAD Vietnam|(IFAD) Vietnam]] country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to [[microcredit]] for taking up small-scale farm activities.&lt;ref&gt;RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empowering women==
{{See also|Women's education and development}}
The [[empowerment]] of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with [[gender inequality]]. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Zuckerman, Elaine. 2002 “Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Gender”. Berlin, Germany: Conference on Sustainable Poverty Reduction and PRSPs.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the socialized phenomenon known as the [[feminization of poverty]], policies aimed to reduce poverty have begun to address poor women separately from poor men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition to engendering poverty and poverty interventions, a correlation between greater gender equality and greater poverty reduction and economic growth has been illustrated by research through the [[World Bank]], suggesting that promoting [[gender equality]] through empowerment of women is a qualitatively significant poverty reduction strategy.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. 2001a “Engendering Development: Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources, and Voice”. Policy Research Report. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender equality===
Addressing gender equality and empowering women are necessary steps in overcoming poverty and furthering development as supported by the human development and [[capabilities approach]] and the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2). 8 September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Disparities in the areas of education, [[mortality rates]], health and other social and economic indicators impose large costs on well-being and health of the poor, which diminishes productivity and the potential to reduce poverty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The limited opportunities of women in most societies restrict their aptitude to improve economic conditions and access services to enhance their well-being.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Mainstreaming gender====
[[Gender mainstreaming]], the concept of placing gender issues into the mainstream of society, was established by the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women as a global strategy for promoting gender equality; the UN conference emphasized the necessity to ensure that gender equality is a primary goal in all areas of social and economic development, which includes the discussion of poverty and its reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Gender Mainstreaming|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/gender/newsite2002/about/defin.htm|website=International Labour Organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, the [[World Bank]] also created objectives to address poverty with respect to the different effects on women.&lt;ref name="Muwanigwa, Virginia 2002"&gt;Muwanigwa, Virginia. 2002. “Gender Considerations in Poverty Alleviation”. Harere, Zimbabwe.&lt;/ref&gt; One important goal was the revision of laws and administrative practices to ensure women’s equal rights and access to economic resources.&lt;ref name="Muwanigwa, Virginia 2002"/&gt; Mainstreaming strengthens women’s active involvement in poverty alleviation by linking women’s capabilities and contributions with macro-economic issues.&lt;ref name="Muwanigwa, Virginia 2002"/&gt;  The underlying purpose of both the UN and World Bank policies speaks to the use of discussion of gender issues in the promotion of gender equality and reduction of poverty.

===Strategies to empower women===
Several platforms have been adopted and reiterated across many organizations in support of the empowerment of women with the specific aim of reducing poverty. Encouraging more economic and political participation by women increases financial independence from and social investment in the government, both of which are critical to pulling society out of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Narayan, Deepa and Nicholas Stern. 2002. “Empowerment and Poverty Reduction: A Sourcebook”, pp. 1–272. Washington DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic participation====
Women’s [[economic empowerment]], or ensuring that women and men have equal opportunities to generate and manage income, is an important step to enhancing their development within the household and in society.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36"&gt;UNICEF. 2007. “Equality in Employment,” in The State of the World’s Children, pp. 36–49. New York: UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, women play an important economic role in addressing poverty experienced by children.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36"/&gt; By increasing female participation in the [[labor force]], women are able to contribute more effectively to economic growth and [[income distribution]] since having a source of income elevates their financial and social status.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36"/&gt; However, women’s entry into the paid labor force does not necessarily equate to reduction of poverty; the creation of decent employment opportunities and movement of women from the informal work sector to the formal labor market are key to poverty reduction.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Martha, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz with Renana Jhabvala, and Christine Bonner. 2005. “Employment, Gender, and Poverty,” in Progress of the World’s Women, pp. 36–57. New York: United Nations Development Fund for Women.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ways to encourage female participation in the workforce to promote decline of poverty include providing childcare services, increasing educational quality and opportunities, and furthering [[entrepreneurship]] for women.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36"/&gt;
Protection of [[property rights]] is a key element in economically empowering women and fostering economic growth overall for both genders. With legitimate claims to land, women gain bargaining power, which can be applied to their lives outside of and within the household.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, Bina. 1994. “Land Rights for Women: Making the Case,” in A Field of One’s Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia, pp. 1–50. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability and opportunity for women to lawfully own land also decreases the asset gap that exists between women and men, which promotes [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36"/&gt;

====Political participation====
Political participation is supported by organizations such as IFAD as one pillar of gender equality and women’s empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy and Approach: Gender equality and women’s empowerment|url=http://www.ifad.org/gender/approach/index.htm|website=International Labour Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable economic growth requires poor people to have influence on the decisions that affect their lives;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00430|title=Occupational Health and Safety.

==Good institutions==
{{POV|section|date=June 2015}}
{{See also|Political corruption}}
Efficient institutions that are not corrupt and obey the [[rule of law]] make and enforce good laws that provide security to property and businesses. Efficient and fair governments would work to invest in the long-term interests of the nation rather than plunder resources through corruption.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt; Researchers at [[UC Berkeley]] developed what they called a "Weberianness scale" which measures aspects of [[bureaucracies]] and governments which [[Max Weber]] described as most important for [[rational-legal authority|rational-legal]] and efficient government over 100 years ago. Comparative research has found that the scale is correlated with higher rates of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = Peter | last2 = Rauch | first2 = James E. | year = 1999 | title = Bureaucracy and Growth: A Cross-National Analysis of the Effects of 'Weberian' State Structures on Economic Growth | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 64 | issue = 5| pages = 748–65 | doi=10.2307/2657374| jstor = 2657374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With their related concept of good governance [[World Bank]] researchers have found much the same: Data from 150 nations have shown several measures of good governance (such as [[accountability]], effectiveness, rule of law, low [[corruption]]) to be related to higher rates of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Funds from aid and [[natural resources]] are often diverted into private hands and then sent to banks overseas as a result of graft.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13278728|title=Dancing with despots|date=12 March 2009|publisher=|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Western banks rejected stolen money, says a report by [[Global Witness]], ordinary people would benefit “in a way that aid flows will never achieve”.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; The report asked for more regulation of banks as they have proved capable of stanching the flow of funds linked to terrorism, [[money-laundering]] or [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;

Some, like [[Thomas Pogge]], call for a global organization that can manage some form of [[Global Resources Dividend]], which could evolve in complexity with time.

Examples of good governance leading to economic development and poverty reduction include [[Thailand]], Taiwan, [[Malaysia]], South Korea, and [[Vietnam]], which tend to have a strong government, called a ''hard state'' or ''[[development state]]''. These “hard states” have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for [[wage|pay]] and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development.

The [[United Nations Development Program]] published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that “Without [[good governance]], reliance on [[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]] economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.”&lt;ref name="undp2000"&gt;United Nations Development Report. 2000. ''Overcoming Human Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000.'' New York: United Nations Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the promise of such research several questions remain, such as where good governance comes from and how it can be achieved. The comparative analysis of one sociologist&lt;ref name="kerbo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerbo|first1=Harold|title=World Poverty: The Roots of Global Inequality and the Modern World System|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780073042954}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that broad historical forces have shaped the likelihood of good governance. Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before [[colonialism]], as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand, strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world.&lt;ref name="kerbo"/&gt;

==Other approaches==
Another approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is [[Fair Trade]] which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial.

Community and monetary economist [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]] has argued that the mainstream [[international finance|global economy]] with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern [[barter]] clubs and historical local currencies such as the [[Wörgl Experiment]] at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of [[community currency]] as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Greco, Jr., ''Money Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender'', Chelsea Green Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-890132-37-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Toronto Dollar]] is an example of a [[local currency]] oriented towards reducing poverty. Toronto Dollars are sold and redeemed in such a way that raise funds which are then given as grants to local charities, primarily ones oriented towards reducing poverty.&lt;ref name="milestone"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/347455 Barbara Turnbull, "Milestone for the `Toronto Dollar'", ''Toronto Star'', 22 Mar. 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto Dollars also provide a means to create an [[incentive]] for welfare recipients to work: Toronto dollars can be given as gifts to welfare recipients who perform volunteer work for charitable and non-profit organizations, and these gifts do not affect welfare benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/58941 Mark Herpel, "The Toronto Dollar: Community Alternative Dollar", ''California Chronicle'', 18 Apr. 2008.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716073246/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/58941 |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued for radical economic change in the system. There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented. Such proposals have been put forward by both left-wing and right-wing groups: socialism, communism, [[anarchism]], [[libertarianism]], [[binary economics]] and [[participatory economics]], among others.

Inequality can be reduced by [[progressive tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diversity.berkeley.edu/6-policies-to-reduce-economic-inequality|title=Six policies to reduce economic inequality|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, there has been a move to establish the absence of poverty as a [[human right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|title=Poverty and Human Rights |author= Thomas Pogge|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/poverty|title=Poverty and Human Rights  |publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IMF and member countries have produced [[Poverty Reduction Strategy]] papers or PRSPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.asp Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book [http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/endofpoverty/ "The End of Poverty"],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1034738,00.html The End of Poverty] by JEFFREY D. SACHS for time.com&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent economist named [[Jeffrey Sachs]] laid out a plan to eradicate global poverty by the year 2025. Following his recommendations, international organizations such as the [http://www.globalsolidaritynetwork.org Global Solidarity Network] are working to help eradicate poverty worldwide with intervention in the areas of housing, food, education, basic health, agricultural inputs, safe drinking water, transportation and communications.

The [[Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign]] is an organization in the United States working to secure freedom from poverty for all by organizing the poor themselves. The Campaign believes that a human rights framework, based on the value of inherent dignity and worth of all persons, offers the best means by which to organize for a political solution to poverty. Makes camps of anti-poverty.

Also one approach to reduce poverty was with Norplant, a form of birth control, which was approved in the United States on December 10, 1990. Norplant prevents pregnancy for up to five years by gradually releasing a low dose of the hormone into the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberts, Dorothy|title=Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty|location= New York|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|year=1997|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer entitled "Poverty and Norplant: Can Contraception Reduce the Underclass?", deputy editorial-page editor [[Donald Kimelman]] proposed Norplant as a solution to inner-city poverty, arguing that "the main reason black children are living in poverty is that people having the most children are the ones least capable of supporting them.&lt;ref name=Roberts /&gt; Kimelman claimed in his article "it's very tough to undo the damage of being born into a dysfunctional family. So why not make a major effort to reduce the number of children, of any race, born into such circumstances?"
According to Dorothy Roberts book "Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty", within two years of Norplant being approved thirteen state legislatures had proposed some twenty measures to implant poor women with Norplant and a number of these bills would pressure women on welfare to use the device either by requiring implantation as a condition of receiving benefits or by offering them a financial bonus. Every state made Norplant available to women for free through [[Medicaid]] or other forms of public assistance and to teenage girls through school programs that presented [[Norplant]] as the most reasonable option. Efforts were also made to provide Norplant to women without Medicaid. As Roberts stated, "California governor Pete Wilson allocated an extra $5 million to reimburse state-funded clinics for Norplant going to women without Medicaid or Medi-Cal coverage."

===Climate change adaptation===
{{main|Climate change and poverty}}
The increase in extreme weather events, linked to climate change, and resulting disasters is expected to continue.  Disasters are a major cause of impoverishment and can reverse progress towards poverty reduction.&lt;ref name=ODI2013&gt;Andrew Shepherd, Tom Mitchell, Kirsty Lewis, Amanda Lenhardt, Lindsey Jones, Lucy Scott and Robert Muir-Wood (2013) [http://www.odi.org/publications/7491-geography-poverty-disasters-climate-change-2030 "The geography of poverty, disasters and climate extremes in 2030"] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is predicted that by 2030, 325 million (plus) extremely poor people will be living in the 49 most hazard prone countries.  Most of these are located in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=ODI2013/&gt;

A researcher at a leading global think-tank, the [[Overseas Development Institute]], suggests that far more effort should be done to better coordinate and integrate [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper|poverty reduction strategies]] with climate change adaptation.&lt;ref name=ODI2009&gt;Martin Prowse, Natasha Grist and Cheikh Sourang (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3290&amp;title=climate-change-poverty-strategies "Closing the gap between climate adaptation and poverty reduction frameworks"] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The two issues are argued to be currently only dealt with in parallel as most poverty reduction strategy papers ignore [[climate change adaptation]] altogether, while National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) likewise do not deal directly with poverty reduction. Adaptation-poverty linkages were found to be strongest in NAPAs from sub-Saharan Africa LDCs.&lt;ref name=ODI2009/&gt;

===Bicycles===
{{main|Bicycle poverty reduction}}
[[File:Bike with chickens.jpg|thumb|Man on bike with chickens, [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]]]]
Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3–10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.

===Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)===
Eradication of [[extreme poverty]] and hunger by 2015 is a [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]]. In addition to broader approaches, the [[Jeffrey Sachs|Sachs]] Report (for the UN Millennium Project)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/|title=UN Millennium Project – Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes a series of "quick wins", approaches identified by development experts which would cost relatively little but could have a major constructive effect on world poverty. The quick wins are:
* Access to information on [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexual and reproductive health]].
* Action against [[domestic violence]].
* Appointing government scientific advisors in every country.
* Deworming school children in affected areas.
* Drugs for AIDS, [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].
* Eliminating [[tuition|school fees]].
* Ending [[Fee-for-service|user fees]] for basic health care in [[Developing country|developing countries]].
* [[Free school meal]]s for schoolchildren.
* Legislation for [[women’s rights]], including rights to property.
* [[Planting trees]].
* Providing [[fertilizer|soil nutrients]] to farmers in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].
* Providing [[mosquito net]]s.
* [[Rural electrification|Access to electricity]], water and [[sanitation]].
* Supporting [[breast-feeding]].
* Training programs for [[community health]] in rural areas.
* Upgrading slums, and providing land for [[public housing]].

=== Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ===
The first goal of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] calls for an end to poverty by 2030 and seeks to ensure social protection for the poor and supporting people affected by climate-related extreme events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg1|title=Goal 1 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the decade that began in 2002, the percentage of the world's population living under the poverty line by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. If during those 10 years growth rates prevailed over the next 15 years, it is possible to decrease the rate of extreme poverty in the world to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth will benefit all income groups of the population on an equal footing. However, if the growth rates over a longer period of 20 years, the rate of prevalent global poverty is likely to be about 6 per cent. In other words, the
eradication of extreme poverty will require a significant change from its historical growth rates.

===Global initiatives to end hunger and undernutrition===
An important part of the fight against poverty are efforts to end hunger and achieve food security. In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome |publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. In particular Goal 2: Zero Hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|title=Hunger and food security |publisher=United Nations Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Caritas International started a Caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025. The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the impact of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caritas.org/2013/12/pope-francis-denounces-global-scandal-hunger/|title=Pope Francis denounces ‘global scandal’ of hunger|date=9 December 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compact2025.org/about-compact2025/governance/leadership-council/|title=Leadership Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition|title=Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition |publisher=IFPRI|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

Another initiative focused on improving the hunger situation by improving nutrition is the Scaling up Nutrition movement (SUN). Started in 2010 this movement of people from governments, civil society, the United Nations, donors, businesses and researchers, publishes a yearly progress report on the changes in their 57 partner countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scalingupnutrition.org/about|title=SUN communication materials|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poverty reduction in Taiwan ===
In spite of the intensive reduction [[Strategy|strategies]] deployed in the previous two decades, poverty levels in several countries of the world has not been reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chinn|first=Dennis|title=The University of Chicago Press Journals|journal=Rural Poverty and the Structure of Farm Household Income in Developing Countries: Evidence from Taiwan|volume=27|jstor=1153441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has demonstrated that the low wage levels of the needy families have risen gradually, although in some scenarios they have declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajamann|title=Poverty inequality and economic growth: Rural Punjab|journal=Journal of Development Studies|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While wage level is the main median pointer of welfare, such results  suggest that past poverty reduction procedures have not been precise. Unless suitable reduction procedures are formulated and implemented in the near future, rustic poverty will probably be a real issue for quite some long time. Families are determined to be low-pay if their monthly income does not surpass the evaluated monthly minimum set by every city or region. To meet the family's essential needs (shelter, food, clothing, and education) in [[Taipei]], one would need to have $337 every month. This sum changes relying upon the city's way of life; for instance, one would just need to have $171 every month to live in [[Kinmen]] County.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Taiwan-POVERTY-AND-WEALTH.html#ixzz4NSHx2r3A|title=Taiwan – Poverty and wealth|last=|first=|date=2 November 2016|website=Nations Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustained economic growth is noted as the main propelling agent for [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper|Poverty Reduction]] in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X07001337|title=Openness, Growth and Poverty: The Case of Taiwan|journal=World Development|first1=Pang-Long|last1=Tsai|first2=Chao-Hsi|last2=Huang|access-date=3 December 2016|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2006.11.013|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1858–71|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While internal [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] has no noteworthy effect on the mean wage of poor people, outward [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] from Taiwan in the previous two decades appears to have adversely affected the poorest 20% of the populace. Poverty in Taiwan has nearly been eliminated, with under 1 percent of the populace considered as poor or earning the low-level pay. This implies more than 99 percent of the populace appreciates the advantages of Taiwan's economic flourishing and extraordinarily enhanced personal satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Handbook of the Nations , 17th,18th, 19th and 20theditions for 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 data|journal=CIA World Factbook 2001 [Online] for 2000 data|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside lowly-paid families, the government offers support to other individuals, for example, the elderly and the incapacitated, who can't work. During 1980 to 1999 Taiwanese government developed a program called [[National Health Insurance]] program. NHI mainly provides economically disadvantaged people with quality healthcare at an affordable price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Health Coverage in Taiwan|url=http://www.nhi.gov.tw/English/webdata/webdata.aspx?menu=11&amp;menu_id=290&amp;webdata_id=2974&amp;WD_ID|website=National Health Insurance Administration|publisher=National Health Insurance Administration|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 1993, the government of Taiwan started giving a monthly sponsorship to elderly people. People beyond 65 years old whose normal family salary is not exactly, or equivalent to, 1.5 times the base monthly costs are fit to get a monthly sponsorship of $174.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Private transfers also play an important role in Taiwan for antipoverty according to the date Taiwan provided to the Luxembourg Income Studies, the results indicates the private transfer has greater impact than public transfers in terms of proving welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Jin Wook|title=Private Transfers and Emerging Welfare States in East Asia: A Comparative Perspective|url=http://www.welfareasia.org/5thconference/papers/Kim%20J_private%20transfers%20and%20welfare%20states.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the government of Taiwan spent US$5.08 billion on social welfare projects and offered numerous sorts of assistance to people and families from low-pay sets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Notwithstanding money, assistance to get employment is given to the breadwinners in families, alongside educational guide for school-age children and well-being programs for women and children. In addition, there are additionally community associations, scholastic organizations, and private establishments arranged by government offices to help needy people. In principle, Taiwan is currently a liberal and elections based society. Hence social versatility ought to be the standard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Notably, as per an investigation of extra cash in Taiwan by the [[Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics]], families with the most astounding dispensable salaries number 2.6 people, while families with the least discretionary cash flow number 4.7 people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With rising costs of simple commodities and privatization of the training market, economically distraught families will end up in an undeniably hard position to educate their own children. However, this type of social welfare will significantly lower the Taiwan's revenue. Due to the slow economic development in the past years, this method will no longer close the income inequality or reduce the unemployment rate effectively in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Development of Social Welfare Policy in Taiwan: Welfare Debates between the Left and the Right|url=http://www.npf.org.tw/2/3867|website=National Policy Foundation|publisher=National Policy Foundation|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Militaries]] and their [[troops]] are held in high regard in the United States, where military officers are considered to have one of the most prestigious jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/07/28/leadership-careers-jobs-cx_tvr_0728admired.html|title=America's Most Admired Professions|author=Tom Van Riper|date=28 July 2006|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-10-most-respected-professions_7.html|title=Military: Respected Professions - AskMen|author=Jon Skindzier|work=AskMen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion by country==
While military support is very high in most countries, there is variation. While 10% of Canadians viewed the military as "not at all favorable,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/fewer-canadians-strongly-approve-of-afghan-mission-survey-1.605606|title=Fewer Canadians 'strongly approve' of Afghan mission: survey|date=9 November 2006|work=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 3% of Britons had a "low" or "very low" view of the military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbriefing.org/docs/bsa29_armed_forces.pdf The UK's Armed Forces: public support for the troops but not their missions?]&lt;/ref&gt; 65% of Russians believe their military, which is the second largest in the world, does their job "just about always" or "most of the time." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/HTML%20Reports/public-opinion-in-russia-russians-attitudes-on-the-economic-and-domestic-issues-issue-brief.aspx#police|title=Public Opinion in Russia: Russians' Attitudes on Economic and Domestic Issues {{!}} APNORC.org|website=www.apnorc.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, 89% of white Americans had a "very" or "somewhat" favorable opinion of the military, compared to 77% of Latinos and 72% of blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/lealdl3/AFS.2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106092822/https://webspace.utexas.edu/lealdl3/AFS.2005.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change over time==
In the United States, public opinion of the military was very low during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taskandpurpose.com/the-shifting-public-perception-of-americas-veterans/|title=The Shifting Perception of America's Veterans|date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public perception increased considerably between the early 1970s to the late 1990s, with the exception of briefly after the [[Gulf War]], when support was around 60%, the percentage of Americans who said they had a "very favorable" view of the US military hovered between 20% and 30%. By 2007, 47% claimed a "very favorite" view of the military and 84% expressed a "favorable" view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/2007/03/22/iraq-and-vietnam-a-crucial-difference-in-opinion/|title=Iraq and Vietnam: A Crucial Difference in Opinion|date=22 March 2007|work=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the [[Iraq War]] was comparable to opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], but unlike the Vietnam War, opposition to the Iraq War did not correlate with a significant decrease in public opinion of military personnel themselves.

The '''Razakars''' were a private [[militia]] organised by [[Qasim Razvi]] to support the rule of [[Nizam]] [[Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII]] and resist the integration of [[Hyderabad State]] into the [[Dominion of India]]. They also attempted to make the Nizam accede his princely state to [[Pakistan]] instead of India.

To counter the Razakars, people of [[Telangana]] under the leadership of [[Swami Ramanand Tirtha]] formed the Andhra Hindu Mahasabha which sought integration of the state with rest of India. Razakars were responsible for the killing, rape, and brutal murder of many people in the Telangana and Marathwada region who were driven out.&lt;ref&gt;Moraes, Frank, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mumbai: Jaico. 2007, p.394&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the [[Indian Army]] routed the Razakars during [[Operation Polo]]. Qasim Razvi was initially jailed and then allowed to move to Pakistan where he was granted asylum.

[[File:Razakars.jpg|thumb|Razakars during Operation Polo]]
The [[Hyderabad State|princely state of Hyderabad]] was a Hindu-majority state that was ruled by the Muslim [[Nizam]]. When India became independent in 1947, like all the other Princely states, the Hyderabad State was also given the choice of either joining India or Pakistan. The Nizam wanted neither- he wanted to remain independent.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The Nizam finally entered into a [[standstill agreement (India)|standstill agreement]] with India on 29 November 1947 to maintain status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbtBJb1bsHUC&amp;pg=PA75|title=War and peace in modern India|last=Srinath|first=Raghavan|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=9780230242159|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=75|oclc=664322508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyderabad state had been steadily becoming more theocratic since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1926, [[Mahmud Nawaz Khan]], a retired Hyderabad official, founded the [[All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen|Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen]] (also known as Ittehad or MIM).
"Its objectives were to unite the Muslims in the State in support of Nizam and to reduce the Hindu majority by large-scale conversion to Islam". The MIM became a powerful communal organization, with the principal focus to marginalize the political aspirations of Hindus and moderate Muslims.{{sfn|Kate, Marathwada under the Nizams|1987|p=73}}

MIM "had its storm troopers in the Razakars who were headed by [[Kasim Razvi]], a Muslim educated at [[Aligarh Muslim University|Aligarh University]] who claimed Hyderabad was a Muslim state and that Muslim supremacy was based upon the right of conquest".&lt;ref&gt;Moraes, Frank, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mumbai: Jaico. 2007, p.390&lt;/ref&gt; This in a princedom where only 14% of the population was Muslim.  The Razakars demanded special powers from the Nizam, which they started to misuse and the helpless Nizam had to abide by their dictates{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}. The Nizam sent a delegation to the [[United Nations]] to refer the Hyderabad State case to the [[UN Security Council]]. Qasim Rizvi and the Razakars had the additional agenda to persuade the Nizam to accede to Pakistan, instead of remaining independent of both India and Pakistan.

The Razakar militia brutally put down the armed revolts by Communists and the Peasantry and even eliminated activist Muslims such as Shoebullah Khan who advocated merger with India.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, P.R., ''History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh: From the Earliest Times to 1991'', New Delhi: Sterling Publishers, 2012. p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/Remembering-a-legend/article15287211.ece Remembering a legend], The Hindu, 22 August 2008; Aniket Alam, [http://www.thehindu.com/2003/01/06/stories/2003010604090400.htm A one-man crusade, it was and still is], ''The Hindu'', 6 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The Razakars terrorised the Hindu and pro-India population causing them to flee to the Indian provinces.{{sfn|Kate, Marathwada under the Nizams|1987|p=84}} By October 1948 there were reported to be 119,000 refugees in the [[Central Provinces]], 145,000 in [[Bombay State|Bombay]], 163,000 in [[Madras State|Madras]] and 5500 in [[Mysore State|Mysore]].{{sfn|Sherman, Muslim Belonging in Secular India|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;24, footnote 20}} The [[Hyderabad State Congress]] was banned and its leaders forced to flee to [[Vijaywada]] or [[Bombay]].

==Annexation after Operation Polo==
{{Main|Indian annexation of Hyderabad}}
Finally, [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], the Indian Minister for Home Affairs, decided to undertake "police action" in Hyderabad State to force the King Nizam's hand. [[Operation Polo]] was launched and the [[Indian Army]], led by Major General J. N. Chaudhuri, entered the state from five directions. The Razakars fought briefly against the overwhelming attack by Indian forces before surrendering on 18 September 1948. [[Mir Laik Ali]], the [[Prime Minister]] of the Nizam, and Qasim Rizvi were arrested. On 23 September, the Nizam was forced to withdraw his complaint from the UN Security Council. The merger of Hyderabad into the Indian Union was announced. Major General Chaudhuri took over as military governor of Hyderabad and stayed in that position till the end of 1949. In January 1950, [[M. K. Vellodi]], a senior civil servant was made the Chief Minister of the state and the Nizam was given the ceremonial position of "[[Rajpramukh|Raj Pramukh]]" or "Governor".

The [[Pandit Sunderlal Committee Report]] estimated that between 27,000 and 40,000 people, mostly Muslims, lost their lives in the violence that ensued the operation.&lt;ref name="India hidden massacre"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Thomson | first = Mike | title = India's hidden massacre | work = BBC | accessdate = 2013-09-26 | date = 2013-09-24 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24159594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disbanded==
The Razakars were disbanded after the merger of Hyderabad with India and the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen was banned—though it was rechartered under the Congress government as [[Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen|All India MIM (AIMIM)]] in 1957. Qasim Rizvi was jailed and served in Indian prisons for almost a decade. He was released only on an undertaking that he would migrate to Pakistan within forty-eight hours of his release.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-10/hyderabad/36257886_1_akbaruddin-owaisi-mim-mla-asaduddin&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted asylum in Pakistan.

Religious activities generally need some infrastructure to be conducted. For this reason, there generally exist '''religion-supporting organizations''', which are some form of organization that manage:

* the upkeep of places of worship, such as [[mosque]]s, [[church (building)|churches]], [[temples]], [[synagogue]]s, [[chapel]]s and other buildings or meeting places.
* the payment of [[salary|salaries]] to [[religious leader]]s, such as [[Roman Catholic priest]]s, [[Hindu priest]]s, [[minister (Christianity)|Christian ministers]], [[imam]]s and [[rabbi]]s.

In addition, such organizations usually have other responsibilities, such as: the formation, nomination or appointment of religious leaders, the establishment of a corpus of doctrine, the disciplining of leaders and followers with respect to religious law, the determination of qualification for membership, etc.In terms of religion..

==Legal status==

===Public organizations===
Some countries run the activities of one or more [[religion]]s as part of their government, or as external organizations closely supported by the government. See [[state religion]].

===Private organizations===
In some countries, the government is prohibited by law from establishing or supporting religions by [[separation of church and state]], though there may be exceptions to such rules. Religions are thus necessarily supported by private organizations, generally funded by those who attend their services.

====France====
The French Republic is constitutionally ''[[laïque]]'' (roughly, [[secular]]). It is prohibited by a 1905 statute to salary, subsidize or recognize any religion; for historical reasons, this statute however does not apply to the [[Alsace-Moselle]] area (where four religions are state-subsidized under the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]]), to [[French Guiana]] (Catholic priests are employed by the local government, although this situation is likely to change) and to military [[chaplain]]s ({{As of|2005|lc=on}}, there are indications that the statute of religious services to the military will be changed).

Religious organizations are not required to register, but may if they wish to apply for tax-exempt status or to gain official recognition. The French government defines two categories under which religious groups may register: ''associations cultuelles'' (associations of worship, which are exempt from taxes) and ''associations culturelles'' (cultural associations, which are not exempt from all taxes). Associations in these two categories are subject to certain management and financial disclosure requirements. An association of worship may organize only religious activities, defined as liturgical services and practices. A cultural association may engage in profit-making activity. Although a cultural association is not exempt from taxes, it may receive government subsidies for its cultural and educational operations, such as schools. Religious groups normally register under both of these categories; the Mormons, for example, runs strictly religious activities through its association of worship and operates a school under its cultural association.

Under the 1905 statute, religious groups must apply with the local [[prefecture]] to be recognized as an association of worship and receive tax-exempt status. The prefecture reviews the submitted documentation regarding the association's purpose for existence. To qualify, the group's purpose must be solely the practice of some form of religious ritual. Printing publications, employing a board president, or running a school may disqualify a group from receiving tax-exempt status. A common method is to run such activities in another financially separate association ("cultural association" or other similar denomination).

According to the 1905 law, associations of worship are not taxed on the donations that they receive. However, the prefecture may decide to review a group's status if the association receives a large donation or legacy that comes to the attention of the tax authorities. If the prefecture determines that the association is not in fact in conformity with the 1905 law, its status may be changed, and it may be required to pay taxes at a rate of 60 percent on present and past donations.

According to the  100 Catholic associations are tax-exempt; a representative of the Ministry of Interior reports that the number of non-tax-exempt Catholic associations is too numerous to estimate accurately. More than 50 associations of the Jehovah's Witnesses have tax-free status.

====United States====
In the United States, a faith-based organization (FBO) is an organization that has its mission based in a faith system. The U.S. [[IRS ]] designates [[tax exemption]]s for those legal entities that qualify. To be a legal entity in America each organization must file the required documents in the [[U.S. state]]s in which they operate.

'''Rugby''' is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in [[Morgan County, Tennessee|Morgan]] and [[Scott County, Tennessee|Scott]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Tennessee]].  Founded in 1880 by English author [[Thomas Hughes]], Rugby was built as an experimental utopian colony.  While Hughes's experiment largely failed, a small community lingered at Rugby throughout the 20th century. In the 1960s, residents, friends and descendants of Rugby began restoring the original design and layout of the community, preserving surviving structures and reconstructing others.  Rugby's [[Victorian architecture]] and picturesque setting have since made it a popular tourist attraction.  In 1972, Rugby's historic area was listed under the name '''Rugby Colony''' on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]].&lt;ref&gt;Sweeny-Justice, Karen. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709151545/http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/24-09/24-09-5.pdf Thomas Hughes’ “Rugby”: Utopia on the Cumberland Plateau], ''Cultural Resources Management'', No. 9 (2001), [[U.S. National Park Service]].  Accessed at the Internet Archive 1 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rugby experiment grew out of the social and economic conditions of Victorian England, where the practice of [[primogeniture]] and an economic depression had left many of the "second sons" of the English gentry jobless and idle.  Hughes envisioned Rugby as a colony where England's second sons would have a chance to own land and be free of social and moral ills that plagued late-19th-century English cities.  The colony would reject late Victorian materialism in favor of the [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] ideals of equality and cooperation espoused in Hughes's ''Tom Brown's School Days''.&lt;ref name=stagg1&gt;Brian Stagg, ''The Distant Eden, Tennessee's Rugby Colony: A History of the English Colony at Rugby, Tennessee, With a Guide to the Remaining Original Buildings'' (Rugby, Tenn.: Paylor Publications, 1973), pp. 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outset, however, the colony was beset with problems, namely a [[typhoid]] epidemic in 1881, lawsuits over land titles, and a population unaccustomed to the hard manual labor required to extract crops from the poor soil of the [[Cumberland Plateau]].  By late 1887, most of the original colonists had either died or moved away from Rugby.&lt;ref name=mcgehee&gt;Margaret McGehee, "Castle In the Wilderness: Rugby, Tennessee, 1880&amp;ndash;1887."  ''Journal of East Tennessee History'', Vol. 70 (1998), pp. 62-89.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few carried on into the 20th century and the village retained a small, continuous population.

==Geography==
Rugby is located atop the [[Cumberland Plateau]] near the junction of Morgan, Scott, and [[Fentress County, Tennessee|Fentress]] counties.  While it straddles the two former counties, the majority of it lies in Morgan County. On the north side of Rugby, the [[Clear Fork (Big South Fork Cumberland River)|Clear Fork]] joins White Oak Creek to form a natural pool known as "The Meeting of the Waters" that has been a popular hiking destination since the colony's early days. Beyond Meeting-of-the-Waters, the Clear Fork continues northeastward for another {{convert|9|mi|km}} to where it joins [[New River (Tennessee)|New River]] to form the [[Big South Fork of the Cumberland River]].

[[Tennessee State Route 52|State Route 52]] passed through the town, until December 2013 when the "Rugby Bypass" opened, connecting it with [[U.S. Route 127]] in [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]] to the west and [[U.S. Route 27]] in the community of Elgin to the east. The area is relatively remote, with the {{convert|125000|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area]] dominating the area to the north, and sparsely-populated rolling hills stretching for miles to the south. Most of the historic district is located on or near TN-52. A more modern residential area is located in the Beacon Hill section on the north side of the community.

==History==

===Establishment===

Thomas Hughes was born in [[Uffington, Oxfordshire]], [[England]] in 1822.  In the 1830s, he attended the [[Rugby School]] in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]], where he was greatly influenced by the school's progressive headmaster, [[Thomas Arnold]].  Both Rugby School and Arnold figured prominently in Hughes's 1857 novel, ''Tom Brown's School Days'', and the school would eventually be the namesake for Hughes's utopian colony in Tennessee.  In ''Tom Brown's School Days'', Hughes espoused the ideals of Christian socialism, namely the [[cooperative]] ownership of community businesses.  By the 1860s, Hughes had grown disenchanted with the materialism of late Victorian England.  He was disheartened by the fact that the talents of many of England's younger sons were wasted due to an economic recession and the medieval system of primogeniture, in which the oldest son inherited all of the family's land.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;

In 1870, Hughes travelled to America to meet his friend, the poet [[James Russell Lowell]], and learned of the [[Boston]]-based Board of Aid to Land Ownership, which specialized in helping unemployed urban craftsmen relocate to rural areas.&lt;ref name=howell&gt;Benita Howell, "Rugby, Tennessee's Master Planner: Franklin Webster Smith of Boston."  ''Journal of East Tennessee History'', Vol. 73 (2001), pp. 23-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hughes indicated that such an operation might also be beneficial to young, unemployed English gentry.  In 1878, Board of Aid president [[Franklin W. Smith|Franklin Webster Smith]] and an agent with the new [[Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway|Cincinnati Southern Railway]], Cyrus Clarke, were travelling on the railroad's new tracks along the Cumberland Plateau when they identified the future site of Rugby, and were impressed with its virgin forests, clear air, and scenic gorges.  Clarke secured [[option (finance)|options]] on hundreds of thousands of acres of Plateau land.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;  Knoxville attorney [[Oliver Perry Temple]], who became the colony's legal and agricultural advisor, began the complicated process of securing land titles.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Bailey, "Legalities, Agriculture, and Immigration: The Role of Oliver Perry Temple in the Rugby Experiment," East Tennessee Historical Society ''Publications'', Vol. 44 (1972), pp. 90-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith returned to Boston to recruit families to move to the newly acquired land on the Plateau, but economic conditions in the northeast had improved, and few families were interested in relocating. Smith then notified Hughes of the Board's new land acquisitions, and Hughes expressed interest in establishing a colony.  Hughes formed a partnership with British lawyers [[Sir Henry Kimber, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Kimber]] and John Boyle, and bought the Board of Aid.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;

===Rugby Colony, 1880&amp;ndash;1887===
[[Image:Thomas-hughes-library-tn1.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Thomas Hughes Library, built 1882]]

Franklin W. Smith, who was primarily responsible for Rugby's early layout, chose the townsite for Rugby for its resort-like qualities, even though it was {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the nearest railroad stop at Sedgemoor (modern Elgin).  The colony's first frame structure, known as the "Asylum" (now the Pioneer Cottage), was erected in early 1880,&lt;ref name=howell /&gt; and the first wave of colonists constructed [[tennis]] and [[croquet]] courts, and built a walkway to "The Meeting of the Waters."  Within a few months, several residences had been completed, along with the three-story Tabard Inn, which was named for the [[The Tabard|Southwark hostelry]] in ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;

Thomas Hughes was on hand for the colony's "opening" on October 5, 1880, and gave a speech that laid out his plans for Rugby.  All colonists would be required to invest $5 in the commissary, thus ensuring public ownership.  Personal freedoms were guaranteed, although the sale of alcohol was banned.  The colony would build an Episcopal church, but the building could be used by any denomination.&lt;ref name=mcgehee /&gt;  On opening day, Tennessee's Episcopal bishop, the Right Reverend [[Charles Quintard]], chartered [[Christ Church Episcopal (Rugby, Tennessee)|Christ Church]] and licensed colonist Joseph Blacklock as [[lay reader]].&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;

American publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' and London publications such as ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'', and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', all followed the colony's progress.  Rugby published its own newspaper, ''The Rugbeian'', which was edited by [[Oxford University|Oxford]] graduate Osmond Dakeyne, and several colonists formed a Library and Reading Room Society, headed by [[Tübingen University|Tübingen]] graduate Edward Bertz.  In summer 1881, a typhoid outbreak killed seven colonists&amp;mdash;including Dakeyne&amp;mdash;and forced the Tabard Inn to close for cleansing, but the colony recovered.  By 1884, the colony boasted over 400 residents, 65 frame public buildings and houses, a tennis team, a social club, and a literary and dramatic society.  In 1885, Rugby established a university, Arnold School, named for Rugby School headmaster Thomas Arnold.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;

===Struggle and decline===
[[Image:Laurel-dale-cemetery-tn1.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Laurel Dale Cemetery contains the graves of Rugby's 1881 typhoid victims along with Margaret Hughes and other early colonists]]

Throughout its early history, Rugby was beset with lawsuits over land titles.  While Cyrus Clarke had obtained options on nearly {{convert|350000|acre|ha}} of land, many of the Plateau's [[Appalachia]]n natives grew suspicious of Clarke and refused to sell their property.  This slowed the colony's early development, and as the lawsuits dragged on, many colonists gave up and moved away.  Furthermore, Smith, who had selected the townsite, had ignored the site's poor soil in favor of its potential as a mountain resort.  Rugby's main resort hotel, the Tabard, was forced to close due to the typhoid outbreak in 1881, however, and burned down altogether in 1884, halting Rugby's burgeoning tourist economy and damaging the Board of Aid's credit.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=howell /&gt;

Frustrated by the colony's slow development, the Board of Aid's London backers replaced colony director John Boyle with [[Irish people|Irish]]-born [[Cincinnati]] city engineer Robert Walton in May 1882.  Rugby attempted to establish a [[tomato]] canning operation in 1883, but after the cannery was constructed, colonists failed to grow enough tomatoes to keep it operational.  Newspapers began to ridicule Rugby, with London's ''Daily News'' accusing Hughes of creating a "pleasure picnic" rather than a functioning colony, and ''The New York Times'' claiming that Hughes was planning to abandon the colony altogether.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;

In 1887, the deaths of a number of prominent colonists&amp;mdash;including Hughes's mother, Margaret, and geologist Charles Wilson&amp;mdash;led to the departure of most of Rugby's original settlers.  That year, Hughes made his last annual visit to the colony, and ''The Rugbeian'' ceased publication.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;  In 1892, Sir Henry Kimber reorganized the Board of Aid as the Rugby Tennessee Company, which focused on harvesting the region's natural resources, all but abandoning the anti-materialistic ideals on which the colony was founded.&lt;ref name=howell /&gt;  By 1900, the company had sold its Cumberland Plateau holdings.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;

===Preservation===

Robert Walton's son, William (1887&amp;ndash;1958), maintained the Thomas Hughes Library, the Christ Church Episcopal, and Kingstone Lisle until the mid-20th century.  During the same period, Uffington House was maintained by the family of C.C. Brooks.  Conservation efforts at Rugby began in the 1940s when logging practices were decimating the surrounding virgin forests.  The efforts were publicized by ''The New York Times'' and ''The Washington Post'', and gained federal support with the aide of Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]], but the state of Tennessee rejected the logging companies' offering price for the land, and the forest was cut right up to the community's boundaries.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;

In 1966, preservationists formed Historic Rugby, a non-profit group dedicated to restoring and maintaining the community's surviving historic structures, which include the Christ Church Episcopal, the Thomas Hughes Library, the Rugby School, Kingstone Lisle, Uffington House, and Newbury House.  The group has also reconstructed several buildings based on their original designs, including the Board of Aid office, the Rugby Commissary, and Sir Henry Kimber's Percy Cottage.  The Harrow Road Cafe, a restaurant built in the 1980s, was named for a restaurant that existed at Rugby in the 1880s, although its original design is unknown.  The Rugby Printing Works, which originally stood at nearby [[Deer Lodge, Tennessee|Deer Lodge]], was moved to Rugby in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;"Rugby, Tennessee: Guide to Buildings &amp; Sites," onsite brochure published by Historic Rugby.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historic Rugby opened up the community's Beacon Hill area (originally planned to include residences and a park) to new home construction, with the condition that all new homes must be designed in accordance with the community's Victorian aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Brooks, "[http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/aug/30/no-headline---083009nomorethan4/ A Short Vacation Idea Close to Knoxville: 40th Rugby Village Pilgrimage]."

==Notable buildings==
[[Image:Rugbylibrary church.jpg|thumb|210px|Christ Church (left) and Thomas Hughes Library in Rugby, Tennessee]]

===Christ Church Episcopal===
The [[Christ Church Episcopal (Rugby, Tennessee)|Christ Church Episcopal]] was established on October 5, 1880, and initially used the original Rugby schoolhouse for services.  The current building was built in the [[Carpenter Gothic architecture|Carpenter Gothic style]] in 1887 by Cornelius Onderdonk, who constructed many of the original buildings in Rugby, and consecrated by [[ECUSA|Episcopal]] bishop [[Charles Quintard]] in 1888.&lt;ref name=wichmann&gt;Patricia Wichmann, ''Christ Church, Episcopal, Rugby, Tennessee: A Short History'' (Rugby, Tenn.: 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;  The church's alms basin was designed by English carpenter Henry Fry, who had previously done work for various churches in the London area.  The church's [[reed organ]], built in 1849, is one of the oldest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Christ Church parish has met here regularly since 1887.

===Thomas Hughes Library===
Built in 1882, the Thomas Hughes Library is the most unchanged of all the buildings in Rugby.  The library's 7,000 volumes were collected primarily by Boston bookseller Estes &amp; Lauriat, and donated to Rugby's Library and Reading Room Society with the stipulation they name the new library for Hughes.  The library still contains most of its original collection, the oldest volume of which dates to 1687.  German-born colonist Edward Bertz, Rugby's first librarian, published a book about his Rugby experiences, entitled ''Das Sabinergut'', in 1896.&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;

===Kingstone Lisle===
Kingstone Lisle, a [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne-style]] cottage, was built in 1884 as a residence for Thomas Hughes, although Hughes stayed at the cottage for just a very short period on one of his annual visits (he usually stayed at the Newbury House).&lt;ref name=stagg1 /&gt;  In the late 1880s, Hughes gave the house to Christ Church priest Joseph Blacklock for use as a [[rectory]].&lt;ref name=wichmann /&gt;  Historic Rugby restored the house in the 1960s, and has outfitted it with period furniture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6677">'''Thomas Hency Brewer, Sr.''' (1894-1956) was an [[African-American]] [[physician]], born on November 19, 1894, in [[Saco, Alabama|Saco]], [[Alabama]], who was instrumental in the [[civil rights movement]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]] during the early- to mid-20th century, before he was [[assassination|assassinated]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/thomas-brewer-1894-1956|title=Thomas Brewer (1894-1956)|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and Death ==

Dr. Thomas Brewer was born in Saco, Alabama, graduated from [[Selma University]] in Selma, Alabama, then from [[Meharry Medical College]] in Nashville, Tennessee, and moved to Columbus, Georgia in 1920. He became a respected physician and one of Columbus' most prominent civil rights activists, succeeding in the desegregation of the Columbus Police Department, being one of the founders of the city's [[NAACP]] chapter, and as a supporter of Primus King, among other advocacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Thomas Brewer's Office|url=http://digitalarchives.columbusstate.edu/11-dr-thomas-brewers-office|website=Columbus State University Archives|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was active in the [[Republican party (United States)|Republican Party]], serving as a delegate to the GOP National Convention in Philadelphia.

On July 4, 1944, Primus E. King, an African-American registered voter, went to the [[Muscogee County]] Courthouse in Columbus to cast his vote in the Democratic Party’s primary election. He was turned away by law enforcement. Dr. Brewer encouraged and financially supported Mr. King in his lawsuit filed in federal court, styled ''King v. Chapman''.  In a landmark ruling, the court found in Mr. King's favor, deciding that the exclusion of black voters was unconstitutional.  The U.S. Court of Appeals agreed, which ended the [[State of Georgia]]'s "whites only" primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primus King and the Civil Rights Movement|url=http://georgiahistory.com/ghmi_marker_updated/primus-king-and-the-civil-rights-movement/|website=Georgia Historical Society|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Brewer shared an office building on First Street in Columbus with the F&amp;B Department store, owned by Luico Flowers.  In 1956, the two men witnessed a beating of a black man by police outside of the building. Dr. Brewer and Mr. Flowers argued about the incident: Dr. Brewer believed the police officer used excessive force and Mr. Flowers disagreed.  About a week later, on February 18, 1956, Mr. Flowers shot Dr. Brewer seven times and killed him, claiming self-defense. The grand jury believed Mr. Flowers' account of the incident and he was not charged. A year later, Mr. Flowers was found shot dead, in what authorities determined was a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Doctor's Death Causes Black Professionals to Flee|url=http://www.civilrights.uga.edu/cities/columbus/doctors.htm|website=Freedom on Film: University of Georgia|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 2,500 mourners showed up for Dr. Brewer's funeral at the [[First African Baptist Church (Columbus, Georgia)|First African Baptist Church]] on Fifth Avenue.

Lillian "Bunky" McClung, the daughter of the first African-American mayor of Columbus, A.J. McClung, recalled the death of Dr. Brewer in a 2015 interview with the Columbus [[Ledger-Enquirer]] newspaper: ''"Dr. Brewer had been the person behind motivating the people in this community to want more. ... I remember that day he was shot. I remember when my daddy got that phone call and he ran out the door. ... There were several dentists, several doctors in the community ... they all left when Dr Brewer was shot."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunday Interview with Lillian "Bunky" McClung|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article44930010.html|accessdate=7 July 2017|agency=''Ledger-Enquirer''|date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer's wife and daughter left the city, as did Brewer's attorney and several other prominent physicians and businessmen, including Dr. W.G. McCoo, his spouse, Dr. Mary McCoo and their children, including their young daughter [[Marilyn McCoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Judith|title=Black America Series: Columbus, Georgia|date=2000|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9780738542874|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Brewer (1894-1956)|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/thomas-brewer-1894-1956|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[historical marker]] placed at the site of his assassination reads ''"Dr. Thomas H. Brewer - A [[Pike County, Alabama]] native of African-American descent, Dr. Brewer was born November 16, 1894. His office was located at 1025½ First Avenue. Brewer emerged as a chief spokesman for the civil rights of the [[Negro]] and was described by [[Roy Wilkins]] of the NAACP as a 'fearless champion of the rights of his people.' His goal to guarantee the Negro the right to vote throughout the State of Georgia and [[Southern United States|the South]] was achieved in the Primus King case in 1945. He was a leader of the local chapter of the NAACP and worked tirelessly for racial equality. Brewer was killed by gunshots February 18, 1956 near this site."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/muscogee/dr.-thomas-h.-brewer|title=Historical Markers by County - GeorgiaInfo|website=georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By Proclamation issued by the Mayor of Columbus and the Governor of Georgia in 1989, November 19 is designated as "Dr. Thomas H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5620">The '''Transcaspian Government''' (1918 - July 1919) was a "[[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Mensheviks)|Menshevik]]-[[Socialist Revolutionary]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[C. H. Ellis]], Letters: ''Baku Commissars'', [[The Times]], 10 October 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; coalition set up by the [[Railway]] workers of the [[Trans-Caspian Railway]] in 1918. It was based at [[Ashgabat]].

==Origin==
Autonomous sentiments were developing amongst the local Turkmen population, with the formation of the [[Turkmen National Army]] (TNA) in February 1918. Concerned about this, the [[Bolshevik]] dominated Ashgabat Soviet appealed to {{ill|Fyodor Ivanovich Kolesov|lt=Kolesov|ru|Колесов, Фёдор Иванович}}, leader of the [[Tashkent Soviet]] for military support, and declared it would carry out a census of all arms bearing men in the [[Russian people|Russian]] majority town on 17 June 1918. However this sparked off two days of rioting.

The Tashkent Soviet dispatched some [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] led by V. Frolov and a [[Cheka]] contingent who arrived on 24 June and disarmed the Turkmen Cavalry Squadron, which was the core of the TNA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/HST451/Readings/Hiro1.html Introduction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716171630/http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/HST451/Readings/Hiro1.html |date=2011-07-16 }}, Alan Fisher, Matrix Education, accessed 21 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Frolov declared [[martial law]] and personally shot the five members of a delegation of railwaymen that had tried to present a petition to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]], ''The Fighting In Trans-Caspia'', 3 March 1919&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeded to [[Serdar (city)|Kizyl-Arvat]] to continue restoring Bolshevik control but local railway workers had heard of the events and armed themselves. Frolov and a number of his bodyguards were shot and the remainder disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;''The British Intervention in Transcaspia, 1918-1919'' by [[C. H. Ellis]], University of California Press, 1963 p26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ashkhabad Committee ==
On 14 July 1918 The Ashkhabad Executive Committee was founded by [[Menshevik]]s and [[Social Revolutionaries]] following their successful revolt against the [[Bolshevik]]s of [[Tashkent]]. This committee took the name of the Trans Caspian Provisional Government in November 1918, but is generally referred to as the '''Transcaspian Government'''.&lt;ref&gt;''The British Intervention in Transcaspia, 1918-1919'' by C. H. Ellis, University of California Press, 1963 p27&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial leadership consisted of:
*[[Fyodor Funtikov]], [[Socialist Revolutionary]] worker, President

==Military action==
The Committee had around 1000 armed men, which consisted of Armenian and Russian troops. British opinion of these forces was less than complimentary. General [[Wilfrid Malleson]] had been dispatched by the British Government to resist the Bolshevik forces, and assisted the Transcaspian forces by sending them a machine gun team across the border from India. This team stopped the Transcaspian forces being completely overrun by the Bolsheviks, early in the conflict.
 
Malleson then sent an Anglo Indian unit to assist in what became referred to as the [[Malleson mission]]. The combined Anglo-Indian and Transcaspian force then went on to successfully engage the Bolsheviks, pushing them out of some of the major cities.

The Government was largely in a weak position. It had no economy, and was existing on the money it had gained from the soviets when it took over. The main economy was based on cotton, however it had no means to export this. It largely sought funds from the British, which it did not get, even for food the British military had used and promised to pay for.

==The execution of the Baku Commissars==
[[File:The Execution of the Twenty Six Baku Commissars.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Isaak Brodsky]]'s ''The Execution of the Twenty Six Baku Commissars'' depicting the Soviet view of the execution.]] On the night of 20 September 1918, under the leadership of Fyodor Funtikov, they executed the [[26 Baku Commissars]], which had fled Baku by ship to [[Krasnovodsk]] in Turkmenistan.
.

==The crisis of December 1918==
In December 1918 there was a crisis in the Transcaspian Government. The Government felt it could not control the capital, and asked help from the British who helped by sending troops there. However the Government was fragile, Malleson's opinion being that they had at best a tenuous grip on their forces and people. In addition, Malleson had promised funds and not delivered them. The people started protesting and the Committee resigned. It was replaced by another committee, which was appointed by Teague-Jones. The New committee gradually eventually came under the influence of Denikin's Southern White Russian army, and his men came to bolster the force. However, when the British withdrew in 1919, the Bolsheviks went on the offensive and defeated the Transcaspian forces. By 1920 the Tashkent Soviet had regained control of the area and the Transcaspian Government was no longer.

'''''Tricontinental''''' is a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] [[quarterly]] [[magazine]] founded during the [[Tricontinental Conference]]. The magazine is the official publication of the [[Cuba]]n organisation [[OSPAAAL]] which also publishes it.&lt;ref name=milt&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brian Williams|title=‘Tricontinental’ magazine marks 150th anniversary of José Martí|journal=The Militant|date=28 April 2003|volume=67|issue=14|url=http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6714/671466.html|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abeb/&gt; It has its headquarters in [[Havana]].&lt;ref name=abeb/&gt;

The magazine receives much funding from sympathetic European groups.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

''Tricontinental'' began to be printed again in 1995. In 2000, the decision was made to begin to reprint posters. 

The magazine is distributed around the world, and at its height, 87 [[country|countries]] received ''Tricontinental'', and there were more than 100,000 [[subscription|subscribers]], mostly [[student]]s. At one time, it was very common for posters from issues of ''Tricontinental'' to be posted on the walls of student [[community]] centres.

In [[Bangladesh]] the '''Upazila Nirbahi Officer''' often abbreviated '''UNO''', ({{lang-bn|উপজেলা নির্বাহী অফিসার}})''' is the chief executive of an [[Upazilas of Bangladesh|Upazila]] (sub-district) and a mid-level officer of the [[Bangladesh Civil Service]] (Administration Cadre). A [[Ministries of Bangladesh|Senior Assistant Secretary]] is usually assigned to this post.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Upazila_Nirbahi_Officer|title=Upazila Nirbahi Officer - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. UNO works as Chief Executive Officer of Upazila Parishad for executing all decisions taken by the upazila parishad and ensuring financial disciplines of the funds of upazila parishad and representative of [[Government of Bangladesh]] in the Upazila level for performing retained activities to the [[Government of Bangladesh]], non-transferred and controlling activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{https://www.scribd.com/doc/69410519/Upazila-Parishad-Manual-in-Bengali}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The role of the UNO was created in accordance with a decision by the military regime of [[Lieutenant General]] [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1982, the Ershad government constituted a committee for administrative reorganization and reform. One of the committee's major recommendations was to create a representative body called Upazila Porishod (council) under a directly elected chair. The government created the position of [[Administrative divisions of Bangladesh|Thana]] Nirbahi Officer or TNO (thana executive officer) later renaming it Upazila Nirbhahi Officer (UNO)—in each of the existing thanas (later upgraded and renamed upazila) outside the [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] areas.

About the same time subdivisions were upgraded and converted into [[districts of Bangladesh|districts]], responsibility for all development activities at the local level was transferred to the Upazila Porishads. It was also decided that the UNO should continue to chair the Upazila Porishads until an elected chair took office.

UNOs were normally posted from among the officers ranked as "Senior Assistant Secretary" of the BCS Administration cadre.

==Charter of duties==

The '''Vice President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam''' ({{lang-vi|Phó Chủ tịch nước Cộng hòa xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam}}), known as '''Deputy Chairman of the Council of State''' ({{lang|vi|Phó Chủ tịch Hội đồng Nhà nước}}) from 1981 to 1992, is the vice head of state of the [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. The Vice President is appointed on the recommendation of the [[President of Vietnam|President]] to the [[National Assembly (Vietnam)|National Assembly]]. The president can also recommend the vice president's dismissal and resignation from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = | chapter = Article 103 of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam | publisher = [[Government of Vietnam|Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] | accessdate = 27 October 2012}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the President's recommendation, the Vice President has to be approved by the National Assembly. The main duty of a Vice President is to help the President in discharging his duties – in certain cases, the Vice President can be empowered by
the president to replace him in the discharge of some of his duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = | chapter = Article 107 of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam | publisher = [[Government of Vietnam|Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] | accessdate = 27 October 2012}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the president can't discharge of his duties, the Vice President becomes acting president&lt;ref name="VPlast"&gt;{{cite book | title = | chapter = Article 108 of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam | publisher = [[Government of Vietnam|Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] | accessdate = 27 October 2012}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Tôn Đức Thắng]] and [[Nguyễn Hữu Thọ]] were both acting presidents for a short period). In case of vacancy, the vice president will remain acting president until the National Assembly elects a new president.&lt;ref name="VPlast"/&gt;

While the office of Vice President was first mentioned in the 1946 constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = | chapter = Article 44 of the 1946 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam | publisher = [[Government of Vietnam|Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] | accessdate = 27 October 2012}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tôn Đức Thắng]] became the first Vice President of Vietnam in 1960. The 1980 constitution renamed the office of vice president to Deputy Chairman of the Council of State. Unlike the 1946, 1959 and the present constitution, the 1980 constitution did not mentioned what kind of authority the office of vice president had — for instance, it was not mentioned if a vice president would take the responsibilities of acting head of state if the head of state was incapacitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = | chapter = Articles 104–112 of the 1980 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam | publisher = [[Government of Vietnam|Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] | accessdate = 27 October 2012}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the name for the post of deputy chairman of the Council of State was reverted to its original name; vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = | chapter = Articles 101–108 of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam | publisher = [[Government of Vietnam|Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] | accessdate = 27 October 2012}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Vietnam, under its 1967 constitution, also had a Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Vietnam_South_1967.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992, the office of Vice President of Vietnam has usually been occupied by a woman.  Current Vice President Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh has served as acting President since September 21, 2018 following the death of Vietnamese President Trần Đại Quang from a viral disease,.

As a result, she was designated team leader for several beet farms in the Chuy Region. During [[World War II]] she worked to produce crops to aid the war effort, and took in a number of war orphans.
