__NOTOC__
'''5x5=25''' was a two-part [[abstract art]] exhibition held in September–October 1921 in [[Moscow]]. The five artists whose work was shown were [[Aleksandra Ekster]], [[Lyubov Popova]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Alexander Vesnin]]. They presented highly abstracted, geometric work that rejected [[expressionist]] forms of painting common before the [[World War I]] and pretended to be the "end" or "death" of art.

Rodchenko presented three canvases of a single colour (red, yellow and blue). He saw that his formal research into [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] had reached completion at this point, and claimed that he had demonstrated the "end of painting".&lt;ref name="artdaily"&gt;[http://www.artdaily.org/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=26647&amp;int_modo=1 Art Daily article on Rodchenko and his role in Constructivism]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition has been considered an anti-painting manifesto.&lt;ref name="artprof"&gt;[http://www.artprofessor.com/artists/alexander-rodchenko.php Art Professor article on Alexander Rodchenko]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

Lyubov Popova showed canvasses almost bare, puzzling viewers and provoking hail from the critics. Her "flight from painting" influenced [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]].&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/drawing-a-blank-russian-constructivist-makes-late-tate-debut-1516801.html | title=Drawing a blank: Russian constructivist makes late Tate debut | publisher=[[The Independent]] | author=Arifa Akbar | accessdate=2009-06-25 | location=London | date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popova herself did not regard her works as "the end"; on the contrary, she wrote, "all pieces presented here should be regarded as merely preparations for concrete construction".&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Kenez, Stites, pp. 208-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Vesnin presented five&lt;ref name=KM92&gt;Khan-Magomedov, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; abstract [[cubism|cubist]] canvases that appear pure abstractions but were, in fact, ultimate decomposition of human figures.&lt;ref name=KM92/&gt; Vesnin's catalogue cover, in particular, is typical of his book and advertising art of the period:  numbers in two "lines" (5x5 and 25) are offset against the baseline, but this irregularity is "disguised" by angled lines dissecting the space.&lt;ref name=KM93&gt;Khan-Magomedov, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalogues of the exhibition were hand-drawn by the artists and contained original artwork that has never been displayed publicly. At least ten unique albums survive in Russia to date.&lt;ref name=KM92/&gt; The 1921 show was reconstructed in 2009 in London's [[Tate|Tate Gallery]]. Modern critics remain divided over the question of whether "death of painting" was a genuine statement of modern art or, indeed, it was a dead end with no future.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

'''ARTEXPRESS''' is an [[art exhibition]] which is a showcase of [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] Visual Arts Examination artworks from across [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Whilst usually perceived as an exhibition of 'the best' artworks, this is not necessarily true as the chosen artworks are merely representative of the broad diversity of different artworks submitted for that year's HSC.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Although students are not so restricted in the works that are produced for the HSC,{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} ARTEXPRESS works must have a "G" rating.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} ARTEXPRESS occurs annually in the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], Sydney Olympic Park and ten other art galleries in New South Wales. The works selected for ArtExpress reflect trends in the galleries who select the works, therefore they may not represent the exemplar works from the Visual Arts Examination but needs of the gallery showing the work. Works selected may reflect trends in cost cutting, so  less complex works with fewer components and often less challenging ( or engaging ) works for the audience are given focus.

The '''Ashkenaz''' is a live music and dance venue located in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] in the [[United States]]. It is a [[non-profit]] organization. It focuses on [[world music]]. In 2011 it was voted the best place to dance by readers of ''[[East Bay Express]]''.&lt;ref name=EBE1&gt;{{cite web|title=Readers' Poll Winners: Arts and Culture|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/readers-poll-winners-arts-and-culture/BestOf?oid=2928575&amp;keywords=|work=Best of the East Bay|publisher=East Bay Express|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Ashkenaz opened in 1973 and was founded by [[performance artist]] and activist [[David Nadel]]. After relocating from [[Los Angeles]] to attend [[University of California, Berkeley]], Nadel formed a [[dance troupe]]. The troupe started renting spaces on [[San Pablo Avenue]]. Nadel, along with six other people, would go on to buy the building where Ashkenaz is located today. He named the organization after his [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] ancestry. The original building was a series of old retail shops. Nadel and friends built the wooden facade that is seen today.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; It is supposed to resemble an [[Eastern European]] [[synagogue]].&lt;ref name=EBE2&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashkenaz|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/ashkenaz/Location?oid=1109232|publisher=East Bay Express|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It totals 5,000 square feet.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenblatt|first=Eli|title=A Place Called Ashkenaz|url=http://forward.com/articles/12917/a-place-called-ashkenaz-/|work=Arts &amp; Culture|publisher=Forward|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the city of Berkeley named the Ashkenaz a [[List of Berkeley Landmarks, Structures of Merit, and Historic Districts|city landmark]].&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Leslie|title=Slain Ashkenaz owner recalled for his sense of justice|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/4790/slain-ashkenaz-owner-recalled-for-his-sense-of-justice/|work=Local|publisher=J Weekly|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 a drunken patron was kicked out of the club by Nadel. The patron threatened to shoot Nadel. The man returned after Nadel closed the club for the evening and shot Nadel [[point blank]] in the head. Nadel died from the gunshot wound at the hospital and the man was never found. In wake of Nadel dying, a group of Ashkenaz patrons bought it, and then formed it into a nonprofit.&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;{{cite web|last=Mills|first=Robert|title=Ashkenaz provides music, “living room” for activists|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2011/07/21/ashkenaz-provides-music-dance-living-room-for-activists/|work=Berkeley History|publisher=Berkeleyside|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It re-opened six months later, on June 21, 1997.&lt;ref name=Bowman/&gt;

==Today==
It caters to [[world music]], both local and international. Music genres range from [[hip-hop]] to [[Cajun music]].&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; They also host events focused around [[Judaism]], including holiday celebrations and [[klezmer]] concerts.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt/&gt; The majority of concerts start with a [[dancing|dance lessons]] based around the style or genre of the music.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; They host benefits for local organizations and activists, such as the [[American Indian Movement]] and [[Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref name=Bowman&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowman|first=Catherine|title=Ashkenaz Reborn 6 Months After Owner's Slaying|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ashkenaz-Reborn-6-Months-After-Owner-s-Slaying-2822075.php|work=News|publisher=SFGate|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=14 June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization aims to be a [[zero waste]] business. They recycle everything and provide customers glasses of water instead of [[water bottles]]. They have a television program on [[Berkeley Community Television]] called ''Ashkenaz Live,'' where they showcase performances and history of the performers genres. Ashkenaz has a live children's program where musicians play to local children on Sundays.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; The venue has a stage, alcohol serving bar, a dance studio, and a [[vegetarian]] restaurant. A space upstairs where Nadel used to live is an office space.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt/&gt;

The lowest result achieved equates to the overall [[fire-resistance rating]] of the [[system]] in order to ensure that the barrier works equally well from both sides.]]
'''Asymmetry''' is the absence of, or a violation of, [[symmetry]] (the property of an object being invariant to a transformation, such as reflection). Symmetry is an important property of both physical and abstract systems and it may be displayed in precise terms or in more aesthetic terms. The absence of or violation of symmetry that are either expected or desired can have important consequences for a system.

==In organisms==
Due to how [[cell (biology)|cell]]s divide in [[organism]]s, asymmetry in organisms is fairly usual in at least one dimension, with [[symmetry (biology)|biological symmetry]] also being common in at least one dimension.

Louis Pasteur proposed that biological molecules are asymmetric because the cosmic [i.e. physical] forces that preside over their formation are themselves asymmetric. While at his time, and even now, the symmetry of physical processes are highlighted, it is known that there are fundamental physical asymmetries, starting with time.

===Evolution of asymmetry in organisms===
Asymmetry is an important and widespread trait, having evolved numerous times in many organisms and at many levels of organisation (ranging from individual cells, through organs, to entire body-shapes). Benefits of asymmetry sometimes have to do with improved spatial arrangements, such as the left [[human]] [[lung]] being smaller, and having one fewer lobes than the right lung to make room for the asymmetrical [[heart]]. In other examples, division of function between the right and left half may have been beneficial and has driven the asymmetry to become stronger. Such an explanation is usually given for mammal hand or paw preference ([[Handedness]]), an asymmetry in skill development in mammals. Training the neural pathways in a skill with one hand (or paw) may take less effort than doing the same with both hands.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Nature also provides several examples of handedness in traits that are usually symmetric. The following are examples of animals with obvious left-right asymmetries:
[[Image:Fiddler Crab Gulf Coast.jpg|thumb|[[Fiddler crab]], ''Uca pugnax'']]
*Most [[snail]]s, because of [[Torsion (gastropod)|torsion]] during development, show remarkable asymmetry in the shell and in the internal organs.
*[[Fiddler crab]]s have one big claw and one small claw.
*The [[narwhal]]'s tusk is a left incisor which can grow up to 10 feet in length and forms a left-handed helix.
*[[Flatfish]] have evolved to swim with one side upward, and as a result have both eyes on one side of their heads.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:halibut.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Halibut, a type of flatfish]] --&gt;
*Several species of [[owl]]s exhibit asymmetries in the size and positioning of their ears, which is thought to help locate prey.
*Many animals (ranging from insects to mammals) have asymmetric male [[genitalia]]. The evolutionary cause behind this is, in most cases, still a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schilthuizen|first1=Menno|title=Something gone awry: unsolved mysteries in the evolution of asymmetric animal genitalia|journal=Animal Biology|date=2013|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1163/15707563-00002398|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15707563-00002398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an indicator of unfitness===

*Certain disturbances during the development of the organism, resulting in [[birth defect]]s.
*Injuries after cell division that cannot be biologically repaired, such as a lost [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] from an accident.

Since birth defects and injuries are likely to indicate poor health of the organism, defects resulting in asymmetry often put an animal at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a mate. In particular, a degree of [[facial symmetry]] is associated with physical attractiveness, but complete symmetry is both impossible and probably unattractive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==In structures==
Pre-modern architectural styles tended to place an emphasis on symmetry, except where extreme site conditions or historical developments lead away from this classical ideal. To the contrary, [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[Postmodernism#Architecture|postmodern architects]] became much more free to use asymmetry as a design element.

While most bridges employ a symmetrical form due to intrinsic simplicities of design, analysis and fabrication and economical use of materials, a number of modern bridges have deliberately departed from this, either in response to site-specific considerations or to create a dramatic design statement.

===In fire protection===
In [[Fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated wall assemblies]], used in [[passive fire protection]], including, but not limited to, [[high-voltage transformer fire barriers]], asymmetry is a crucial aspect of design. When designing a facility, it is not always certain, that in the event of [[fire]], which ''side'' a fire may come from. Therefore, many building codes and fire test standards outline, that a symmetrical assembly, need only be [[Fire test|tested]] from one side, because both sides are the same. However, as soon as an assembly is asymmetrical, both sides must be tested and the test report is required to state the results for each side. In practical use, the lowest result achieved is the one that turns up in [[certification listing]]s. Neither the test sponsor, nor the laboratory can go by an opinion or deduction as to which side was in more peril as a result of contemplated testing and then test only one side. Both must be tested in order to be compliant with test standards and [[building code]]s

==In mathematics==

There are no ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and ''b'' &lt; ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Set Theory'', Third Edition, Revised and Expanded: Hrbacek, Jech.{{full|date=October 2014}}&lt;!--missing year, page, publisher, possibly ISBN--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This form of asymmetry is an [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetrical relation]].

==In chemistry==

Certain molecules are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]; that is, they cannot be superposed upon their mirror image. Chemically identical molecules with different chirality are called ''enantiomers''; this difference in orientation can lead to different properties in the way they react with biological systems.

{{Expand section|date=November 2007}}

==In physics==

Asymmetry arises in physics in a number of different realms.

===Thermodynamics===

The original non-statistical formulation of [[thermodynamics]] was [[Entropy (arrow of time)|asymmetrical in time]]: it claimed that the [[entropy]] in a closed system can only increase with time. This was derived from the Second Law (any of the two, [[Clausius]]' or [[Lord Kelvin]]'s statement can be used since they are equivalent) and using the [[Clausius' Theorem]] (see [[Kerson Huang {{ISBN|978-0471815181}}]]). The later theory of statistical mechanics, however, is symmetric in time. Although it states that a system significantly below maximum entropy is very likely to evolve ''towards'' higher entropy, it also states that such a system is very likely to have evolved ''from'' higher entropy.

===Particle physics===

[[Symmetry in physics|Symmetry]] is one of the most powerful tools in [[particle physics]], because it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. Violations of symmetry therefore present theoretical and experimental puzzles that lead to a deeper understanding of nature. Asymmetries in experimental measurements also provide powerful handles that are often relatively free from background or systematic uncertainties.

====Parity violation====
{{Main|parity (physics)}}

Until the 1950s, it was believed that fundamental physics was left-right symmetric; i.e., that interactions were invariant under [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Although parity is conserved in [[electromagnetism]], [[strong interactions]] and [[gravity]], it turns out to be violated in [[weak interactions]]. The [[Standard Model]] incorporates parity violation by expressing the weak interaction as a [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in weak interactions in the Standard Model. A consequence of parity violation in particle physics is that [[neutrinos]] have only been observed as left-handed particles (and antineutrinos as right-handed particles).

In 1956-1957 [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], E. Ambler, R. W. Hayward, D. D. Hoppes, and R. P. Hudson found a clear violation of parity conservation in the beta decay of cobalt-60.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Simultaneously, [[Richard Garwin|R. L. Garwin]], [[Leon Lederman]], and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment and immediately verified parity violation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

====CP violation====
{{Main|CP-violation}}

After the discovery of the violation of parity in 1956-57, it was believed that the combined symmetry of parity (P) and simultaneous [[charge conjugation]] (C), called ''CP'', was preserved. For example, CP transforms a left-handed neutrino into a right-handed antineutrino. In 1964, however, [[James Cronin]] and [[Val Fitch]] provided clear evidence that CP symmetry was also violated in an experiment with neutral [[kaons]].

CP violation is one of the necessary conditions for the generation of a baryon asymmetry in the universe.

Combining the CP symmetry with simultaneous [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] (T) produces a combined symmetry called [[CPT symmetry]]. CPT symmetry must be preserved in any [[Lorentz invariant]] local [[quantum field theory]] with a [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. As of 2006, no violations of CPT symmetry have been observed.

====Baryon asymmetry of the universe====
{{Main|baryogenesis}}

The [[baryons]] (i.e., the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] and the atoms that they comprise) observed so far in the universe are overwhelmingly [[matter]] as opposed to [[anti-matter]]. This asymmetry is called the [[baryon asymmetry]] of the universe.

====Isospin violation====

[[Isospin]] is the symmetry transformation of the [[weak interactions]]. The concept was first introduced by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in [[nuclear physics]] based on the observations that the masses of the [[neutron]] and the [[proton]] are almost identical and that the strength of the [[strong interaction]] between any pair of nucleons is the same, independent of whether they are protons or neutrons. This symmetry arises at a more fundamental level as a symmetry between up-type and down-type [[quark]]s. Isospin symmetry in the strong interactions can be considered as a subset of a larger [[flavor symmetry]] group, in which the strong interactions are invariant under interchange of different types of quarks. Including the [[strange quark]] in this scheme gives rise to the [[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] scheme for classifying mesons and baryons.

Isospin is violated by the fact that the masses of the up and down quarks are different, as well as by their different electric charges. Because this violation is only a small effect in most processes that involve the strong interactions, isospin symmetry remains a useful calculational tool, and its violation introduces corrections to the isospin-symmetric results.

====In collider experiments====

Because the [[weak interaction]]s violate parity, [[collider]] processes that can involve the weak interactions typically exhibit asymmetries in the distributions of the final-state particles. These asymmetries are typically sensitive to the ''difference'' in the interaction between particles and antiparticles, or between left-handed and right-handed particles. They can thus be used as a sensitive measurement of differences in interaction strength and/or to distinguish a small asymmetric signal from a large but symmetric background.
*A '''forward-backward asymmetry''' is defined as A&lt;sub&gt;FB&lt;/sub&gt;=(N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;)/(N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;+N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;), where N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of events in which some particular final-state particle is moving "forward" with respect to some chosen direction (e.g., a final-state electron moving in the same direction as the initial-state electron beam in electron-positron collisions), while N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of events with the final-state particle moving "backward". Forward-backward asymmetries were used by the [[LEP]] experiments to measure the difference in the interaction strength of the [[Z boson]] between left-handed and right-handed fermions, which provides a precision measurement of the [[weak mixing angle]].
*A '''left-right asymmetry''' is defined as A&lt;sub&gt;LR&lt;/sub&gt;=(N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)/(N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;+N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), where N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of events in which some initial- or final-state particle is left-polarized, while N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the corresponding number of right-polarized events. Left-right asymmetries in Z boson production and decay were measured at the [[Stanford Linear Collider]] using the event rates obtained with left-polarized versus right-polarized initial electron beams. Left-right asymmetries can also be defined as asymmetries in the polarization of final-state particles whose polarizations can be measured; e.g., [[tau lepton]]s.
*A '''charge asymmetry''' or particle-antiparticle asymmetry is defined in a similar way. This type of asymmetry has been used to constrain the [[parton (particle physics)|parton distribution functions]] of protons at the [[Tevatron]] from events in which a produced [[W boson]] decays to a charged lepton. The asymmetry between positively and negatively charged leptons as a function of the direction of the W boson relative to the proton beam provides information on the relative distributions of up and down quarks in the proton. Particle-antiparticle asymmetries are also used to extract measurements of CP violation from [[Meson|B meson]] and anti-B meson production at the [[BaBar experiment|BaBar]] and [[Belle experiment|Belle]] experiments.

==Lexical==
{{references|section|date=November 2015}}

Asymmetry is also relevant to [[grammar]] and [[linguistics]], especially in the contexts of [[lexical analysis]] and [[transformational grammar]].

'''Enumeration example:'''
In [[English language|English]], there are grammatical rules for specifying coordinate items in an enumeration or series. Similar rules exist for [[programming language]]s and [[mathematical notation]]. These rules vary, and some require lexical asymmetry to be considered grammatically correct.

For example, in standard written English:
    We sell domesticated cats, dogs, and goldfish.        ### in-line asymmetric and grammatical
    We sell domesticated animals (cats, dogs, goldfish).  ### in-line symmetric and grammatical
    We sell domesticated animals (cats, dogs, goldfish,). ### in-line symmetric and ungrammatical
    We sell domesticated animals:                         ### outline symmetric and grammatical
      - cats
      - dogs
      - goldfish

The '''Beauvais Manufactory''' ({{Lang-fr|Manufacture de Beauvais}}) is a historic [[tapestry]] factory in [[Beauvais]], [[France]]. It was the second in importance, after the [[Gobelins Manufactory]], of French tapestry workshops that were established under the general direction of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], the finance minister of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Whereas the royal Gobelins Manufactory executed tapestries for the royal residences and as ambassadorial gifts, the manufacture at Beauvais remained a private enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Roger-Armand Weigert, ''French Tapestry'' (London: Faber and Faber) 1962, pp 123-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Beauvais specialised in [[Warp and weft|low-warp]] tapestry weaving, although the letters patent of 1664, authorising the company and offering royal protection, left the field open for the production of high-warp tapestry as well. 

== History ==
The first entrepreneur, Louis Hinard, a native of Beauvais who had already established workshops in Paris, produced unambitious floral and foliate tapestries called ''verdures'' and landscape tapestries, which are known through chance notations in royal accounts. He was arrested for his debts in 1684, and the workshops were refounded more successfully under Philippe Behagle, a merchant tapestry-manufacturer from [[Oudenarde]], who had also worked in the traditional tapestry-weaving city of [[Tournai]]. Behagle's first successes were a suite of ''Conquests of the King''&lt;ref&gt;The cartoons were by the battle painter [[Jean-Baptiste Martin]] (Weigert 1962:125).&lt;/ref&gt; which complemented a contemporaneous Gobelins suite showing episodes in the ''Life of the King'', without directly competing with them. A suite of ''Acts of the Apostles'', following copies of [[Raphael Sanzio|Raphael's cartoons]], are in the [[cathedral of Beauvais]]. The so-called ''Teniers'' tapestries, in the manner of village scenes painted by [[David Teniers the Younger]], began to be woven under Behagle and continued popular, with up-dated borders, into the eighteenth century, when the earliest series of archives begin.
[[File:Kronborg - Gobelin 1.jpg|thumb|left|Tapestry from the suite of "''[[Jean Bérain the Elder|Bérain]] [[Grotesque]]s''" (detail), made under the Behagles, ''c.''1700 ([[Kronborg]])&lt;ref&gt;Another weaving of this design is at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1977.437.1 acc. no. 1977.437.1]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The great series of ''Grotesques'' (''illustration, left'') initiated in the 1690s became a mainstay of Beauvais production, woven through the Régence. The cartoons, which were inspired by the engravings of the elder [[Jean Bérain the Elder|Jean Bérain]] and were carried out to cartoons by [[Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer]], a painter attached to the Gobelins factory, were based on fanciful ''[[Grotesque|grotteschi]]''. Against mustard yellow grounds vases and baskets of fruit with birds, a specialty of Monnoyer's, are contrasted with lively figures, sometimes acrobats and dancers, sometimes from the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' in slender and fanciful ''arabesque'' architecture. 

Behagle continued his private workshops in Paris, as had his predecessor. From these shops came the suite of ''Marine Triumphs'' with the arms of the [[comte de Toulouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Now at the [[Banque de France]].&lt;/ref&gt; On his death in 1705, the Beauvais manufacture was continued by his wife and son, and in 1711 by new proprietors, the brothers Filleul. Under Filleul ownership Beauvais produced suites of ''The story of Telemachus'' and Ovidian ''Metamorphoses'' as well as animal combats, and a series of "Chinese" hangings that are a high point in the career of [[chinoiserie]]. Between 1722 and 1726, Beauvais was directed by Noël-Antoine de Mérou, and maintained showrooms in Paris, and in [[Leipzig]] and [[Ratisbon]] ([[Regensburg]]), for Beauvais found many commissions among foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Weigert 1962:129.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chevalfondu.jpg|thumb|''Le Cheval fondu'' from the series of ''Amusements Champêtres'' for which Oudry provided cartoons in the 1720s]]
The great period of Beauvais tapestry begins with the arrival of [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]], 22 July 1726, replacing the unsatisfactory Jacques Duplessis.&lt;ref&gt;"an important event in the history of Beauvais, for it saved the workshops from ruin, and initiated their finest period." (Weigert 1962:129.&lt;/ref&gt; When Mérou was dismissed in 1734 for falsifying the accounts, for the first time the manufacture was directed by an artist, since Oudry's financial backer, Nicolas Besnier, a goldsmith of Paris, was wise enough not to interfere with the artistic production, and the partnership lasted until 1753. Oudry was simultaneously inspector of the works at Gobelins. At Beauvais he reorganized the training of the young workers and turned out designs and constantly renewed borders: the ''New Hunts'', the suite of ''Country Pleasures'', the hangings illustrating [[Molière]]'s comedies, a renewed suite of perennially popular ''Metamorphoses''. Sets of tapestry covers for seat furniture were introduced, and in September 1737 it was decided that the King of France should purchase two sets of tapestry each year, for 10,000 ''livres'', for gifts to foreign ministers, an advertisement of French hegemony in the field of art and also a fine advertisement for the quality of the Beauvais manufacture. The king had the entire production of Gobelins at his disposal, but as [[Edith Standen]] points out,&lt;ref&gt;Edith A. Standen, "The 'Amours des Dieux': A Series of Beauvais Tapestries after Boucher" ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' '''19''' (1984, pp. 63-84) p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; they were rather large, rather solemn and definitely old-fashioned.  In 1739, for the first time,  cartoons for Beauvais were exhibited at the [[Paris salon]], another way of keeping the tapestry workshops before the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;The subjects, from the suite ''Jason and Medea'' by [[Michel-François Dandré-Bardon]], and from the ''Amours de Psyché'' by Boucher; the description in the ''livret de salon'' pointed out that the actions were reversed, in order to appear the right way in tapestry. (Standen 1984:63).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Belgian Royal collection Faulteuil LP.jpg|thumb|left|Beauvais tapestry upholsters seats given by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] as a wedding gift to [[Louise-Marie of France|his daughter]], 1832]]
Oudry turned to other artists to supplement the tapestry cartoons he was producing; from [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]]'s designs Beauvais wove the suite of ''Don Quichotte'', and from [[François Boucher]], starting in 1737, a long series of six suites of tapestry hangings, forty-five subjects in all, constituting the familiar "Boucher-Beauvais" suites that embody the [[rococo]] style: the ''Fêtes Italiennes'', a set of village festivals in settings evoking the [[Roman Campagna]], the ''Nobles Pastorales'', a further suite of six chinoiseries, now in a lighter, Rococo handling. Boucher's eight oil sketches for these ''Tentures chinoises'' were shown in the Salon of 1742;. It was unusual for the artist's sketches to be enlarged to provide cartoons, as in this case;&lt;ref&gt;Standen 1984:64, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  the translation to cartoons was made by [[Jean-Joseph Dumons de Tulle]]. The successful series was woven at Beauvais at least ten times between July 1743 and August 1775; in addition further copies were made at [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]].&lt;ref&gt;P.-F. Bertrand, "La Seconde 'Tenture Chinoise' tissée à Beauvais et Aubusson'', ''Gazette des Beaux-Arts'', (November 1990)173-84); C. Adelson, ''European Tapestry at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts'', Minneapolis, 1994:322-42.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Boucher-chinoiserie-Besançon.jpg|thumb|''La pêche chinoise'', 1742, one of Boucher's ''[[chinoiserie]]'' designs woven at Beauvais ([[Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'archéologie de Besançon]])]]
Boucher also designed for Beauvais the ''Story of Psyche''&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn B. Hiesinger, "The sources of François Boucher's ''Psyché'' tapestries," ''The Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin'' '''72''' (1976), pp 7-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the apex of the lot, the ''Amours des Dieux'', the "Loves of the Gods", after paintings by Boucher delivered 1747-49; suites from among the nine subjects, though never all subjects in one suite, were being woven at Beauvais as late as 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Standen 1984, pp. 63-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new partner, André-Charlemagne Charron, and increased royal support, with annual order for sets of hangings now with complete suites of furniture coverings, to be delivered to the [[Garde-Meuble de la Couronne]] or the foreign ministry should have launched new successes for Beauvais, but Oudry's death, 30 April 1755, and Boucher's defection to the Gobelins the same year, initiated a period of stagnation, while the old designs were repeated, and then decline. At the [[French Revolution]] the workshops were temporarily closed, following a dispute between the weavers and the administration, and then were reopened, under State direction, making little but upholstery covers.

'''''Before We Forget''''' is a 2011 observational [[documentary film]] about two women with [[dementia]], who live in an Asian society where terminal illnesses and dying remain taboo. It is directed by Singaporean first-time filmmakers [[Jeremy Boo]] and [[Lee Xian Jie]], who have also started an online platform that encourages people in Asia to share their experiences about dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_707904.html |title='Before We Forget' web project puts spotlight on dementia |publisher=The Straits Times |date= |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film tells the story of Joyce Fernandez, a 50-year-old woman caring for her mother, Celine Fernandez, who has had [[Alzheimer's Disease]] for 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rdasia.com/before-we-forget |title=Before We Forget - Reader's Digest Asia (October 2011) |publisher=Rdasia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Celine suffers a mild [[stroke]] and is hospitalized for over three months, Joyce attempts to keep herself together, especially after Celine loses all of what little speech and she originally had. The duo, staunch [[Catholics]], keep their heads above the emotional turmoil through daily prayer.

The documentary also captures frank interviews with Dr Irene Giam (PhD), a former mathematics tutor and [[atheist]], with strong views about death in the face of [[terminal illness]]. She is first filmed after being diagnosed with [[mild cognitive impairment]], likely due to [[systemic fibrosis]], an [[autoimmune disorder]] which affects her breathing. After she is warded in a hospice because of her rapidly worsening health, [[vascular dementia]] causes her to forget the frequent visits by her husband and deepens her feelings of loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beforeweforget.org/your-stories/2011/05/rewriting-obituary/ |title=Rewriting the obituary |publisher=Beforeweforget.org |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BlueLabel''' is an online database for the international [[art world]]. BlueLabel was developed for [[Modern art|modern]] and [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] artists to record details of their [[art|art work]]s to ensure that these are permanently stored and easily accessible.

Art works are more valuable when fully documented&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artbusiness.com/estateplan.html&lt;/ref&gt; but modern technology may increase the chances for data loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainmentstorage.org/articles/Hard%20Disk%20Drives_%20The%20Good,%20The%20Bad%20and%20The%20Ugly.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132930/http://entertainmentstorage.org/articles/Hard%20Disk%20Drives_%20The%20Good%2C%20The%20Bad%20and%20The%20Ugly.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BlueLabel caters to all members of the international art world and allows artists to securely register the details of their artwork online to prevent loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluelabel.net |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132754/http://bluelabel.net/ |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists create “labels” for their works – online documents that detail all of the essential information for the work. These labels can then be accessed by members and non-members, sent, collected and managed.

Unlike other art archives, BlueLabel is artist driven and guarantees the authenticity of its contents by the very nature of its design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.basenow.net/2009/07/16/bluelabel-revolutionizes-the-art-world%E2%80%94through-order-god-forbid/&lt;/ref&gt;

The data entry system complies with advanced, international [[Archiving|archival]] standards; it is a relevant tool not only for conventional media such as [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] but also for [[New media art|new media]] practices and alternative contemporary art forms such as film, video, performance, internet art and site-specific art.

'''Development'''

BlueLabel was founded by Anne Faggionato in 2009. The website is currently undergoing a period of significant redevelopment. 

'''Sponsorship'''

In 2010, BlueLabel sponsored New York Gallery Week&lt;ref&gt;http://newyorkgalleryweek.com/2010/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] exhibition at [[Serpentine Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2010/04/richard_hamilton23_february_18.html&lt;/ref&gt;
BlueLabel also sponsored a show curated by [http://www.williammackrell.com/ William Mackrell] exclusively from BlueLabel members, ''A Tender Cut''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artslant.com/lon/events/show/109398-a-tender-cut&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, BlueLabel again sponsored New York Gallery Week&lt;ref&gt;http://newyorkgalleryweek.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and also sponsored ''In Deed: Certificates of Authenticity in Art'' (a traveling exhibition, opening at The Foundation for Visual Arts, Middelburg), an exhibition that looks at artists’ certificates  from the past 50 years and how their roles have shifted and developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://vleeshal.nl/tentoonstellingen/in-deed-certificates-of-authenticity-in-art&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Calligraphy}}

[[Image:Schriftzug Urkunde.jpg|thumb|Calligraphy of the German word "''Urkunde''" (deed)]]
'''Calligraphy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: καλλιγραφία) is a [[Visual arts|visual art]] related to [[writing]]. It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument,  [[brush]], or other writing instruments.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{rp|17}} A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner".&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{rp|18}}

Modern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not be readable.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Classical calligraphy differs from [[typography]] and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|trans-title=Calligraphy: Intensive Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt|isbn=9783874397001|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie: Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt|isbn=9783874396752|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2007&gt;{{cite book|author=Zapf, H.|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of technical developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester, New York|isbn=9781933360225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Zapf, H.|year=2006|title=The world of Alphabets: A kaleidoscope of drawings and letterforms}} CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt;

Calligraphy continues to flourish in the forms of [[wedding invitations]] and event invitations, [[font]] design and typography, original hand-lettered [[logo]] design, [[religious art]], announcements, [[graphic design]] and commissioned calligraphic art, cut stone [[inscription]]s, and memorial [[document]]s. It is also used for [[Theatrical property|prop]]s and moving images for film and television, and also for [[testimonial]]s, [[birth certificate|birth]] and [[death certificate|death]] certificates, [[map]]s, and other written works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Propfe, J.|year=2005|title=SchreibKunstRaume: Kalligraphie im Raum Verlag|publisher=[[Callwey Verlag]].|location=Munich|isbn=9783766716309|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geddes, A.|author2=Dion, C.|year=2004|title=Miracle: a celebration of new life|publisher=Photogenique Publishers|location=Auckland|isbn= 9780740746963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[File:Pointed pen parts.svg|thumb|A calligraphic [[Nib (pen)|nib]], with part names.]]

The principal tools for a calligrapher are the [[pen]] and the [[paintbrush|brush]]. Calligraphy pens write with [[nib (pen)|nibs]] that may be flat, round, or pointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reaves, M.|author2=Schulte, E.|year=2006|title=Brush Lettering: An instructional manual in Western brush calligraphy|edition=Revised|publisher=Design Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Child|editor-first=H.|year=1985|title=The Calligrapher's Handbook|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Lamb|editor-first=C.M.|origyear=1956|title=Calligrapher's Handbook|publisher=Pentalic|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some decorative purposes, multi-nibbed pens—steel brushes—can be used. However, works have also been created with [[felt-tip pen|felt-tip]] and [[ballpoint pen]]s, although these works do not employ angled lines. There are some styles of calligraphy, such as Gothic script, that require a stub nib pen.

Writing ink is usually water-based and is much less viscous than the oil-based inks used in printing. High quality paper, which has good consistency of absorption,{{clarify|date=October 2013}} enables cleaner lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calligraphyfonts.info/aesthetic-theory-arabic-calligraphy-islamic-art/ |title=Paper Properties in Arabic calligraphy |publisher=calligraphyfonts.info |date= |accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] is often used, as a knife can be used to erase imperfections and a [[light-box]] is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with ''litterea unciales'' (hence the name), and college-[[ruled paper]] often acts as a guideline well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calligraphyislamic.com |title=Calligraphy Islamic website |publisher=Calligraphyislamic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608004825/http://www.calligraphyislamic.com/ |archive-date=2012-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World traditions==

===Europe===
{{Main|Western calligraphy}}
====History====
[[Image:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|Folio 27r from the Lindisfarne Gospels (c.700) contains the [[incipit]] from the [[Gospel of Matthew]].]]
Western calligraphy is recognizable by the use of the [[Latin script]]. The [[Latin alphabet]] appeared about 600 BC, in Rome, and by the first century{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} developed into [[Roman imperial capitals]] carved on stones, [[Rustic capitals]] painted on walls, and [[Roman cursive]] for daily use. In the second and third centuries the [[uncial]] lettering style developed. As writing withdrew to monasteries, uncial script was found more suitable for copying the Bible and other religious texts. It was the monasteries which preserved calligraphic traditions during the fourth and fifth centuries, when the Roman Empire fell and Europe entered the [[Middle Ages|Dark Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabard, V.|author2=Geneslay, V.|author3=Rébéna, L.|title=Calligraphie latine: Initiation|location=, Paris|edition=7th|year=2004|pages=8–11|isbn=978-2215021308|trans-title=Latin calligraphy: Introduction|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the Empire, its power reached as far as Great Britain; when the empire fell, its literary influence remained. The [[Semi-uncial]] generated the Irish Semi-uncial, the small Anglo-Saxon. &lt;ref&gt;Insular Manuscripts: Paleography Section 6: Language on the Page in Insular Manuscripts LAYOUT AND LEGIBILITY. (n.d.). Retrieved May 30, 2018, from https://www.vhmml.org/school/lesson/insular-paleography/layout&lt;/ref&gt; Each region developed its own standards following the main monastery of the region (i.e. [[Merovingian script]], Laon script, [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil script]], [[Visigothic script]], [[Beneventan script]]), which are mostly cursive and hardly readable.

[[Image:Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg|thumb|left|Calligraphy in a [[Latin]] [[Bible]] of 1407 on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], [[Wiltshire]], England. This bible was hand written in Belgium, by Gerard Brils, for reading aloud in a [[monastery]].]]
Christian churches promoted the development of writing through the prolific copying of the Bible, the [[Roman Breviary|Breviary]], and other sacred texts.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 2001a&lt;/ref&gt; Two distinct styles of writing known as uncial and half-uncial (from the Latin "uncia", or "inch") developed from a variety of Roman bookhands.&lt;ref&gt;Knight 1998: 10&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th-9th centuries in northern Europe were the heyday of Celtic illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Durrow, [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Trinity College Library Dublin 2006; Walther &amp; Wolf 2005; Brown &amp; Lovett 1999: 40; Backhouse 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlemagne]]'s devotion to improved scholarship resulted in the recruiting of "a crowd of scribes", according to [[Alcuin]], the Abbot of [[York]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1981: 64&lt;/ref&gt; Alcuin developed the style known as the Caroline or [[Carolingian minuscule]]. The first manuscript in this hand was the Godescalc Evangelistary (finished 783)—a Gospel book written by the scribe Godescalc.&lt;ref&gt;Walther &amp; Wolf 2005; de Hamel 1994: 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; Carolingian remains the one progenitor hand from which modern booktype descends.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 1994: 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eleventh century, the Caroline evolved into the [[blackletter|Gothic script]], which was more compact and made it possible to fit more text on a page.&lt;ref name=lovett2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Lovett, Patricia|title=Calligraphy and Illumination: A History and Practical Guide|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|year=2000|isbn= 978-0810941199}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}} The Gothic calligraphy styles became dominant throughout Europe; and in 1454, when [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed the first printing press in Mainz, Germany, he adopted the Gothic style, making it the first [[typeface]].&lt;ref name=lovett2000 /&gt;{{rp|141}}

[[File:მარიამისეული ქართლის ცხოვრება.JPG|thumb|The [[Georgian calligraphy]] is centuries-old tradition of an artistic writing of the [[Georgian language]] with its [[Georgian scripts|three scripts]].]]
In the 15th century, the rediscovery of old Carolingian texts encouraged the creation of the [[humanist minuscule]] or ''littera antiqua''. The 17th century saw the [[Bastarda|Batarde script]] from France, and the 18th century saw the [[English script (calligraphy)|English script]] spread across Europe and world through their books.

In the mid-1600s French officials, flooded with documents written in various hands and varied levels of skill, complained that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher.  The Office of the Financier thereupon restricted all legal documents to three hands, namely the Coulee, the Rhonde, (known as [[Round hand]] in English) and a Speed Hand sometimes simply called the [[Bastarda]].&lt;ref name="Whalley"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joyce Irene Whalley|title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America|date=c. 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were many great French masters at the time, the most influential in proposing these hands was Louis Barbedor, who published ''Les Ecritures Financière Et Italienne Bastarde Dans Leur Naturel'' circa 1650.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

With the destruction of the [[Camera Apostolica]] during the [[sack of Rome (1527)]], the capitol for writing masters moved to Southern France.  By 1600, the Italic Cursiva began to be replaced by a technological refinement, the Italic Chancery [[Circumflessa]], which in turn fathered the Rhonde and later English [[Roundhand]].&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

In England, [[Philip Ayres (poet)|Ayres]] and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell is noted for his reaction to them, and warnings of restraint and proportionality. Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

====Style====
[[Image:Westerncalligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|Modern Western calligraphy]]
Sacred [[Western calligraphy]] has some special features, such as the illumination of the first letter of each book or chapter in medieval times. A decorative "carpet page" may precede the literature, filled with ornate, geometrical depictions of bold-hued animals. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] (715–720 AD) are an early example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, M.P.|year=2004|title=Painted Labyrinth: The World of the Lindisfarne Gospel|edition=Revised|publisher=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] or [[Islamic calligraphy]], Western calligraphic script employed the use of strict rules and shapes. Quality writing had a rhythm and regularity to the letters, with a "geometrical" order of the lines on the page. Each character had, and often still has, a precise [[stroke order]].

Unlike a typeface, irregularity in the characters' size, style, and colors increases aesthetic value,{{dubious|date=August 2016}} though the content may be illegible. Many of the themes and variations of today's contemporary Western calligraphy are found in the pages of [[The Saint John's Bible]]. A particularly modern example is [[Timothy Botts]]' illustrated edition of the Bible, with 360 calligraphic images as well as a calligraphy [[typeface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible: New Living Translation|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influences====
Several other Western styles use the same tools and practices, but differ by character set and stylistic preferences.
For [[Slavonic lettering]], the history of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] and consequently [[Russia]]n [[writing system]]s differs fundamentally from the one of the [[Latin|Latin language]]. It evolved from the 10th century to today.

===East Asia===
{{Main|Chinese calligraphy|Japanese calligraphy|Korean calligraphy}}
The Chinese name for calligraphy is ''{{transl|zh|ISO|shūfǎ}}'' ({{lang|zh|書法}} in Traditional Chinese, literally "the method or law of writing");&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh-TW|書}} (Taiwanese) being here used as in {{lang|yue|楷书}} (Cantonese) or {{lang|zh-TW|楷書}} (Taiwanese), meaning "writing style".{{clarify|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese name ''{{transl|ja|shodō}}'' ({{lang|ja|書道}}, literally "the way or principle of writing"); and the Korean name being ''{{transl|ko|seoye}}'' ({{lang-ko|서예}}/{{lang|ko-Hant|書藝}}, literally "the art of writing"). The calligraphy of [[CJK characters|East Asian characters]] is an important and appreciated aspect of traditional East Asian culture.

In [[ancient China]], the oldest Chinese characters existing are [[Oracle bone script|Jiǎgǔwén  characters]] (甲骨文) carved on ox [[scapula]]e and tortoise [[plastrons]], because the dominators in [[Shang Dynasty]] carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain auspice of military affairs, agricultural harvest, or even procreating and weather. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved. (Keightley, 1978). With the development of ''[[Bronzeware script|Jīnwén]]'' (Bronzeware script) and ''[[Large Seal Script|Dàzhuàn]]'' (Large Seal Script)&lt;ref&gt;Categories of Calligraphy - Seal Script. (n.d.). Retrieved May 30, 2018, from http://www.cityu.edu.hk/lib/about/event/ch_calligraphy/seal_eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt; "cursive" signs continued. Mao Gong Ding is one of the most famous and typical Bronzeware scripts in the Chinese calligraphy history. It has 500 characters on the bronze which is the largest number of bronze inscription we have discovered so far. &lt;ref&gt;The Bell and Cauldron Inscriptions-A Feast of Chinese Characters: The Origin and Development_Mao Gong Ding. (n.d.). Retrieved May 30, 2018, from https://www.npm.gov.tw/exh99/bell/3_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, each archaic kingdom of current China had its own set of characters. 

In [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]], the graphs on old steles—some dating from 200 BC, and in Xiaozhuan style—are still accessible.

About 220 BC, the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them [[Li Si]]'s character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized ''{{transl|zh|Xiǎozhuàn（小篆）}}'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fazzioli |first=Edoardo |others=Calligraphy by Rebecca Hon Ko |title=Chinese Calligraphy: From Pictograph to Ideogram: The History Of 214 Essential Chinese/Japanese Characters |publisher=[[Abbeville Publishing Group (Abbeville Press, Inc.)|Abbeville Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0896597741 |page=13 |quote=And so the first Chinese dictionary was born, the ''Sān Chāng'', containing {{formatnum:3300}} characters|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, few papers survive from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

The [[Clerical script|Lìshū style]] ({{lang|zh-TW|隸書}}/{{lang|zh|隸书}})(clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, have been also authorised under Qin Shi Huangdi.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6"&gt;{{cite book |author=R.

Between clerical script and traditional regular script, there is another transition type of calligraphy works called Wei Bei. It had started at the South and North dynasty and ended before Tang Dynasty. &lt;ref&gt;Z. (n.d.). Chinese Calligraphy. Retrieved May 30, 2018, from http://www.ebeijing.gov.cn/Culture/Culture_Recommendation/t1068241_2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regular script|Kǎishū style]] (traditional regular script)—still in use today—and attributed to [[Wang Xizhi]] ({{lang|zh|王羲之}}, 303–361) and his followers, is even more regularized.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; Its spread was encouraged by [[Li Siyuan|Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang]] (926–933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed a shape stabilization. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of &lt;big&gt;{{lang|zh|广}}&lt;/big&gt; which is not absolutely the same in the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=zh:康熙字典|trans-title=Kangxi Zidian|year=1716|url=http://ctext.org/library.pl?if=en&amp;res=77358|page=41|language=zh}}. See, for example, the radicals &lt;big&gt;{{lang|zh|卩}}&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;{{lang|zh|厂}}&lt;/big&gt;, or &lt;big&gt;{{lang|zh|广}}&lt;/big&gt;. The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, but old versions, visible on p. 41, clearly allow the stroke order to be determined.&lt;/ref&gt;

Styles which did not survive include Bāfēnshū, a mix made of Xiaozhuan style at 80%, and Lishu at 20%.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;
Some [[variant Chinese character]]s were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, compose the [[Simplified Chinese]] character set.

====Technique====
[[File:Mi Fu-On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|''On Calligraphy'' by [[Mi Fu]], [[Song Dynasty]]]]
Traditional East Asian writing uses the [[Four Treasures of the Study]] ({{lang|zh-TW|文房四寶}}/{{lang|zh|文房四宝}})&lt;ref&gt;Li, J. (Ed.). (n.d.). "Four treasures of Study" tour. Retrieved May 30, 2018, from http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/anhui/travel/2010-06/02/content_9948922.htm&lt;/ref&gt;: the [[ink brush]]es known as máobǐ ({{lang|zh-TW|毛筆}}/{{lang|zh|毛笔}}) to write [[Chinese character]]s, Chinese ink, paper, and inkstone, known as the ''Four Friends of the Study'' ({{lang-ko|문방사우|文房四友}}) in Korea. In addition to these four tools, desk pads and paperweights are also used.

The shape, size, stretch, and [[Brush#Bristles|hair type]] of the ink brush, the color, color density and water density of the ink, as well as the paper's water absorption speed and surface texture are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher's technique also influences the result. The calligrapher's work is influenced by the quantity of ink and water he lets the brush take, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, accelerations, decelerations of the writer's moves, turns, and crochets, and the [[stroke order]] give the "spirit" to the characters, by greatly influencing their final shapes.

=====Styles=====
Cursive styles such as ''[[Semi-cursive script|{{transl|zh|xíngshū}}]]'' ({{lang|zh-TW|行書}}/{{lang|zh|行书}})(semi-cursive or running script) and ''[[Grass script|{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}]]'' ({{lang|zh-TW|草書}}/{{lang|zh|草书}})(cursive, rough script, or grass script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, in the same time as Regular script ([[Han Dynasty]]), but ''{{transl|zh|xíngshū}}'' and ''{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}'' were used for personal notes only, and never used as a standard. The ''{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}''  style was highly appreciated in [[Emperor Wu of Han]] reign (140–187 AD).&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;

Examples of modern printed styles are [[Ming (typeface)|Song]] from the [[Song Dynasty]]'s [[Four Great Inventions of ancient China#Printing|printing press]], and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]]. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.

Both Japanese and Korean calligraphy were greatly influenced by Chinese calligraphy. The Japanese and Korean people have also developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences. For example, [[Japanese calligraphy]] go out of the set of [[CJK strokes]] to also include local alphabets such as [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], with specific problematics such as new curves and moves, and specific materials ([[Japanese paper]], ''{{transl|ja|washi}}'' {{lang|ja|和紙}}, and Japanese ink).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Yuuko|title=An introduction to Japanese calligraphy|year=2005|publisher=Search|location=Tunbridge Wells|isbn=978-1844480579}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Korean calligraphy]], the [[Hangeul]] and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique which usually confuses Chinese calligraphers.

Temporary calligraphy is a practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor, which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks of China. These will often open studio-shops in tourist towns offering traditional Chinese calligraphy to tourists. Other than writing the clients name, they also sell fine brushes as souvenirs and lime stone carved stamps.

Since late 1980s, a few Chinese artists have branched out traditional Chinese calligraphy to a new territory by mingling [[Chinese characters]] with English letters; notable new forms of calligraphy are [[Xu Bing]]'s square calligraphy and DanNie's coolligraphy or cooligraphy.

[[Mongolian calligraphy]] is also influenced by Chinese calligraphy, from tools to style.

Calligraphy has influenced [[ink and wash painting]], which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in [[East Asia]], including [[ink and wash painting]], a style of [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Japanese painting|Japanese]], and [[Korean painting|Korean]] based entirely on calligraphy.

The Philippines has numerous indigenous scripts collectively called as [[suyat]]. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various mediums. By the end of colonialism, only four of the suyat scripts survived and continue to be used by certain communities in everyday life. These four scripts are [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]] of the Hanuno'o [[Mangyan]] people, [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]] of the Buhid [[Mangyan]] people, [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]] of the [[Tagbanwa people]], and [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]] of the [[Palawan people|Palaw'an people]]. All four scripts were inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme]], under the name ''Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan)'', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/philippine-paleographs-hanunoo-buid-tagbanua-and-palawan/|title=Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan) – United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bayi, a bamboo bow from Mindoro.jpg|thumb|left|Bow with [[Hanunó'o alphabet|Hanunó'o calligraphy]]]]
Due to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of [[suyat]] scripts that went extinct due to Spanish persecution. These scripts being revived include the [[Kulitan alphabet|kulitan]] script of the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan people]], the [[Visayan languages|badlit]] script of various [[Visayan languages|Visayan ethnic groups]], the [[Eskaya|iniskaya]] script of the [[Eskaya people]], the [[baybayin]] script of the [[Tagalog people]], and the [[Ilocano language|kur-itan]] script of the [[Ilocano people]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/201104-baybayin-national-writing-system-reactions|title=‘Educate first’: Filipinos react to Baybayin as national writing system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1602707/Manila/Local-News/House-panel-approves-Baybayin-as-national-writing-system|title=House panel approves Baybayin as national writing system|date=24 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/25/18/5-things-to-know-about-phs-pre-hispanic-writing-system|title=5 things to know about PH's pre-Hispanic writing system|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the diversity of [[suyat]] scripts, all calligraphy written in [[suyat]] scripts are collectively called as Filipino suyat calligraphy, although each are distinct from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2018/04/26/baybayin-bill.html|title=The Baybayin bill and the never ending search for ‘Filipino-ness’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy using the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are also prevalent in the Philippines due to its colonial past, but the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are not considered as suyat, and therefore Western-alphabet and Arabic calligraphy are not considered as suyat calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brideandbreakfast.ph/2015/08/12/awesome-calligraphers/|title=10 Perfectly Awesome Calligraphers You Need To Check Out|author=|date=12 August 2015|website=brideandbreakfast.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/2018/06/01/1820721/watch-how-ace-script-lettering|title=WATCH: How to ace in script lettering - Philstar.com|author=|date=|website=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanskrit]] is the primary form of Thai calligraphy. Historically Thai calligraphy has been limited to sacred texts of the Pali Canon with few wider artistic applications where graphic calligraphy representing figures and objects is produced. Calligraphy appears on the personal flag of each member of the Thai royal family  bearing its owner's initials in calligraphy. The most obvious place in the country where calligraphy is present is in graffiti. A few books have been published with calligraphic compositions.

Vietnamese calligraphy uses a variety of scripts, including Chinese characters, Chữ nôm, and the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ. Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts. Due to the adoption of the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy uses Roman characters. Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China for historical and geographic regions. As part of the East Asian cultural sphere, Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy’s standard and use Han script (Chinese language) in many of its writings. In modern times, calligraphy has been done mainly in the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ script, as Chữ nôm and Chinese characters have largely fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnamese neglect Han-Nom heritage|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/sunday/features/220749/vietnamese-neglect-han-nom-heritage.html|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=Viet Nam News|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aśoka]]'s edicts (c. 265–238 BC) were committed to stone. These inscriptions are stiff and angular in form. Following the Aśoka style of Indic writing, two new calligraphic types appear: [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭī]] and [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]]. Kharoṣṭī was used in the northwestern regions of India from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century of the Christian Era, and it was used in [[Central Asia]] until the 8th century.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In many parts of ancient India, the inscriptions were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves. This tradition dates back to over two thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=10660&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Memory of the World &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020103635/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D10660%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html# |archive-date=2016-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the Indian languages were put on paper in the 13th century, palm leaves where considered a preferred medium of writing owing to its longevity (nearly 400 years) compared to paper. Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered on top of one another, holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to [[Southeast Asia]]. The palm leaf was an excellent surface for penwriting, making possible the delicate lettering used in many of the scripts of southern Asia.

====Nepal====
{{Main|Nepalese calligraphy}}
[[Ranjana script]] is the primary form of Nepalese calligraphy. The script itself, along with its derivatives (like [[Lanydza Script|Lantsa]], [['Phags-pa script|Phagpa]], [[Kutila]]) are used in [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Leh]], [[Mongolia]], coastal Japan, and Korea to write "[[Om mani padme hum]]" and other sacred [[Buddhist texts]], mainly those derived from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]].

====Tibet====
{{Main|Tibetan calligraphy}}
[[Image:BonpoBook.jpg|thumb|A [[Bön]] text]]

Calligraphy is central in [[Tibet]]an culture. The script is derived from [[Indic script]]s. The nobles of Tibet, such as the High [[Lama]]s and inhabitants of the [[Potala Palace]], were usually capable calligraphers. [[Tibet]] has been a center of [[Buddhism]] for several centuries, and that religion places a great deal of significance on written word. This does not provide for a large body of [[secular]] pieces, although they do exist (but are usually related in some way to Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all high religious writing involved calligraphy, including letters sent by the [[Dalai Lama]] and other religious and secular authority. Calligraphy is particularly evident on their [[prayer wheels]], although this calligraphy was forged rather than scribed, much like Arab and Roman calligraphy is often found on buildings. Although originally done with a reed, Tibetan calligraphers now use chisel tipped pens and markers as well.

===Islamic world===
{{Main|Islamic calligraphy}}
[[File:Basmalah-1wm.svg|left|thumb|The phrase [[Basmala|Bismillah]] in an 18th-century Islamic calligraphy from the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] region.]]
Islamic calligraphy (''calligraphy'' in Arabic is ''{{transl|ar|khatt ul-yad}}'' {{rtl-lang|ar|خط اليد}}) has evolved alongside [[Islam]] and the [[Arabic language]]. As it is based on Arabic letters, some call it "Arabic calligraphy". However the term "Islamic calligraphy" is a more appropriate term as it comprises all works of calligraphy by the Muslim calligraphers from [[Andalusia]] in modern [[Spain]] to China.

Islamic calligraphy is associated with geometric Islamic art ([[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]) on the walls and ceilings of [[mosque]]s as well as on the page. Contemporary artists in the [[Islamic world]] draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions.

Instead of recalling something related to the spoken word, calligraphy for [[Muslim]]s is a visible expression of the highest art of all, the art of the [[spirituality|spiritual]] world. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The [[Qur'an]] has played an important role in the development and evolution of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and passages from the Qur'an are still sources for Islamic calligraphy.

It is generally accepted that Islamic calligraphy excelled during the [[Ottoman era]].{{By whom|date=December 2016}} Istanbul is an open exhibition hall for all kinds and varieties of calligraphy, from inscriptions in mosques to fountains, schools, houses, etc. {{Clear}}

===Ethiopia/Abyssinia===
[[File:Ethiopian Scroll comprising prayers against various ailments Wellcome L0031387.jpg|thumb|upright|A painting of [[Susenyos I]] (r. 1607-1632)on a [[Ge'ez]] prayer scroll meant to dispel evil spirits, [[Wellcome Collection]], London]]

[[Ethiopian]] (Abyssinian)) calligraphy began with the [[Ge'ez script]], which replaced Epigraphic [[South Arabian]] in the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], that was developed specifically for [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]]. In those languages that use it, such as [[Amharic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], the script is called ''{{transl|sem|Fidäl}}'', which means script or alphabet. The Epigraphic South Arabian letters were used for a few inscriptions into the 8th century, though not any South Arabian language since [[Dʿmt]].

Early inscriptions in Ge'ez and Ge'ez script have been dated to as early as the 5th century BC, and in a sort of proto-Ge'ez written in ESA since the 9th century BC. Ge'ez literature begins with the Christianization of Ethiopia (and the civilization of Axum) in the 4th century, during the reign of [[Ezana of Axum]]. 

The Ge'ez script is read from left to right and has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for [[Amharic language|Amharic]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] in [[Eritrea]] and Ethiopia.

===Persia===
{{Main|Persian calligraphy}}

[[Image:Nastaliq-proportions.jpg|thumb|Example showing Nastaliq's proportional rules]]

The history of calligraphy in [[Persia]] dates back to the pre-Islam era. In [[Zoroastrianism]] beautiful and clear writings were always praised.

It is believed that [[Old Persian|ancient Persian script]] was invented by about 600–500 BC to provide monument inscriptions for the [[Achaemenid Empire#Achaemenid kings and rulers|Achaemenid kings]]. These scripts consisted of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal nail-shape letters, which is why it is called [[Cuneiform script|"script of nails/cuneiform script"]] (''{{transl|fa|khat-e-mikhi}}'') in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Centuries later, other scripts such as "[[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]]" and "[[Avestan script|Avestan]]" scripts were used in ancient Persia.









==== Contemporary scripts ====
The [[Nasta'liq script|Nasta'liq]] style is the most popular contemporary style among classical Persian calligraphy scripts; Persian calligraphers call it the "bride of calligraphy scripts". This calligraphy style has been based on such a strong structure that it has changed very little since. [[Mir Ali Tabrizi]] had found the optimum composition of the letters and graphical rules so it has just been fine-tuned during the past seven centuries. It has very strict rules for graphical shape of the letters and for combination of the letters, words, and composition of the whole calligraphy piece.

===Mayan civilization===
Mayan calligraphy was expressed via [[Mayan hieroglyphs]]; modern Mayan calligraphy is mainly used on [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and monuments in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in Mexico. Mayan hieroglyphs are rarely used in government offices; however in [[Campeche]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and [[Quintana Roo]], Mayan calligraphy is written in Latin letters.{{clarify|date=August 2016}} Some commercial companies in southern Mexico use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their business. Some community associations and modern Mayan brotherhoods use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their groups.

Most of the archaeological sites in Mexico such as [[Chichen Itza]], Labna, [[Uxmal]], [[Edzna]], [[Calakmul]], etc. have glyphs in their structures. Carved stone monuments known as [[stele]] are common sources of ancient Mayan calligraphy.

==Modern calligraphy==

===Revival===
[[File:Edward Johnston.png|thumb|[[Edward Johnston]], founder of modern western calligraphy, at work in 1902.]]
After [[printing]] became ubiquitous from the 15th century, the production of illuminated manuscripts began to decline.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 2001a; de Hamel 1986&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise of printing did not mean the end of calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Zapf 2007; de Hamel 2001a; Gilderdale 1999; Gray 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern revival of calligraphy began at the end of the 19th century, influenced by the aesthetics and philosophy of [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. [[Edward Johnston]] is regarded as being the father of modern calligraphy.&lt;ref name="ejf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejf.org.uk/|title=The Legacy of Edward Johnston|publisher=The Edward Johnston Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cockerell 1945; Morris 1882&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Font Designer — Edward Johnston|publisher=Linotype GmbH|url=http://www.linotype.com/733/edwardjohnston.html|accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After studying published copies of manuscripts by architect [[William Harrison Cowlishaw]], he was introduced to [[William Lethaby]] in 1898, principal of the [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Arts and Crafts]], who advised him to study manuscripts at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;such as the Ramsey Psalter, BL, Harley MS 2904&lt;/ref&gt;

This triggered Johnston's interest in the art of calligraphy with the use of a broad edged pen. He began a teaching course in calligraphy at the Central School in [[Southampton Row]], London from September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor [[Eric Gill]]. He was commissioned by  [[Frank Pick]] to design a [[Johnston (typeface)|new typeface]] for [[London Underground]], still used today (with minor modifications).&lt;ref&gt;The Eric Gill Society: [https://web.archive.org/web/20081010172820/http://www.ericgill.org.uk/associates/edward-johnston-1872-1944 Associates of the Guild: Edward Johnston]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been credited for reviving the art of modern [[penmanship]] and lettering single-handedly through his books and teachings - his handbook on the subject, ''Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering'' (1906) was particularly influential on a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including [[Graily Hewitt]], [[Stanley Morison]], [[Eric Gill]], [[Alfred Fairbank]] and Anna Simons. Johnston also devised the simply crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the ''Foundational hand''. Johnston initially taught his students an uncial hand using a flat pen angle, but later taught his hand using a slanted pen angle.&lt;ref&gt;Gilderdale 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He first referred to this hand as "Foundational Hand" in his 1909 publication, ''Manuscript &amp; Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen''.&lt;ref&gt;Baines &amp; Dixon 2003: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
[[Graily Hewitt]] taught at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and published together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century. Hewitt was central to the revival of [[gilding]] in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943. He is attributed with the  revival of  gilding with [[gesso]] and gold leaf on [[vellum]]. Hewitt helped to found the [[Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators]] (SSI) in 1921, probably the world's foremost calligraphy society.

[[File:Graily Hewitt.JPG|thumb|left|An example of [[Graily Hewitt]]'s calligraphy.]]
Hewitt is not without both critics&lt;ref&gt;Tresser 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and supporters&lt;ref&gt;Whitley 2000: 90&lt;/ref&gt; in his rendering of [[Cennino Cennini]]'s medieval gesso recipes.&lt;ref&gt;Herringham 1899&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Jackson (calligrapher)|Donald Jackson]], a British calligrapher, has sourced his gesso recipes from earlier centuries a number of which are not presently in English translation.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1981: 81&lt;/ref&gt; Graily Hewitt created the patent announcing the award to [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] of the title of Duke of Edinburgh on November 19, 1947, the day before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt 1944-1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston’s pupil, [[Anna Simons]], was instrumental in sparking off interest in calligraphy in Germany with her German translation of ''Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering'' in 1910.&lt;ref name="ejf" /&gt; Austrian [[Rudolf Larisch]], a teacher of lettering at the Vienna School of Art, published six lettering books that greatly influenced German-speaking calligraphers. Because German-speaking countries had not abandoned the Gothic hand in printing, Gothic also had a powerful effect on their styles.

[[Rudolf Koch]] was a friend and younger contemporary of Larisch. Koch's books, type designs, and teaching made him one of the most influential calligraphers of the 20th century in northern Europe and later in the U.S. Larisch and Koch taught and inspired many European calligraphers, notably [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]], and [[Hermann Zapf]].&lt;ref&gt;Cinamon 2001; Kapr 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary typefaces used by computers, from word processors like [[Microsoft Word]] or [[Apple Pages]] to professional designers' software like [[Adobe InDesign]], owe a considerable debt to the past and to a small number of professional typeface designers today.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Mediaville|first=Claude|title=Calligraphy: From Calligraphy to Abstract Painting|year=1996|publisher=Scirpus-Publications|location=Belgium|isbn=9080332518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henning, W.E.|year=2002|title=An Elegant Hand: The Golden Age of American Penmanship and Calligraphy|editor-last=Melzer|editor-first=P.|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, Delaware|isbn=978-1584560678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celtic knots''', called '''Icovellavna''',{{cn|date=October 2016}} ({{lang-ga|snaidhm Cheilteach}}, {{lang-cy|cwlwm Celtaidd}}) are a variety of [[knot]]s and [[Style (visual arts)#Stylization|stylized]] [[graphic]]al representations of knots used for decoration, used extensively in the [[Celt]]ic style of [[Insular art]]. These knots are most known for their adaptation for use in the [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]]ation of Christian [[monument]]s and [[manuscript]]s, such as the 8th-century [[St. Teilo Gospels]], the [[Book of Kells]] and the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]. Most are [[endless knot]]s, and many are varieties of [[basket weave knot]]s.

== History ==
The use of [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] patterns had its origins in the artwork of the late Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;James Trilling (2001). ''The Language of Ornament''. Thames and Hudson Ltd {{ISBN|0-500-20343-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knot patterns first appeared in the third and fourth centuries AD and can be seen in Roman floor [[mosaics]] of that time. Interesting developments in the artistic use of interlaced knot patterns are found in Byzantine architecture and book illumination, Coptic art, Celtic art, Islamic art, Kievan Rus'ian book illumination, Ethiopian art, and European architecture and book illumination. 

Spirals, step patterns, and key patterns are dominant motifs in Celtic art before the Christian influence on the Celts, which began around 450. These designs found their way into early Christian manuscripts and artwork with the addition of depictions from life, such as [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and even [[human]]s. In the beginning, the [[pattern]]s were intricate interwoven cords, called [[Braid|plaits]], which can also be found in other areas of [[Europe]], such as [[Italy]], in the 6th century. A [[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|fragment]] of a Gospel Book, now in the [[Durham Cathedral]] library and created in northern [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the 7th century, contains the earliest example of true knotted designs in the Celtic manner.

Examples of plait work (a woven, unbroken{{clarify|date=January 2018}} cord design) predate knotwork designs in several cultures around the world,&lt;ref name=georgebain&gt;{{cite book |author=George Bain |title=Celtic art: The methods of construction |year=1951 |publisher=Constable Press|location=London |isbn=|ref=harv}}{{cite book |author=George Bain |title=Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction |year=1973 |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc |location= |isbn=0-486-22923-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the broken and reconnected{{clarify|date=January 2018}} plait work that is characteristic of true knotwork began in northern Italy and southern Gaul and spread to [[Ireland]] by the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sir Edward Sullivan |title=The Book of Kells |year=1986 |publisher=Studio Editions Ltd |location= |isbn=1-85170-035-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is most commonly associated with the Celtic lands, but it was also practiced extensively in England and was exported to Europe by Irish and Northumbrian monastic activities on the continent. [[J. Romilly Allen]] has identified "eight elementary knots which form the basis of nearly all the interlaced patterns in Celtic decorative art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. Romilly Allen |title=Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian Times |year=1933 |publisher=Studio Editions Ltd |location= |isbn=1-85891-075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkythings.org/knotwork/jra-knots.html |title=Eight Basic Knotwork Patterns |accessdate = 2007-01-10 |author=Drew Ivan |date=2005-08-10 |work= |publisher= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times Celtic art is popularly thought of in terms of national identity and therefore specifically Irish, Scottish or Welsh.

Though tattooing was not a Celtic tradition, Celtic knot tattoos became popular in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/11/25/366584255/the-american-origins-of-the-not-so-traditional-celtic-knot-tattoo The American Origins Of The Not-So-Traditional Celtic Knot Tattoo] NPR, November 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - Charles Collette TCS 1.5439 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Charles Collette in ''Bootles' Baby'', c. 1888]]
'''Charles Henry Collette''' (29 July 1842 – 10 February 1924) was an English stage actor, composer and writer noted for his work in comedy in a long career onstage.  He appeared, beginning in the late 1860s, in many [[Effie Bancroft|Bancroft]] productions and was engaged by other managers, including [[J. L. Toole]], [[John Hollingshead]], [[Mary Anderson (actress, born 1859)|Mary Anderson]], [[Lydia Thompson]] and [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], as well as performing in his own companies.  He toured for some years as the title character in [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'' and played many military men.

Collette continued acting in London and in the British provinces until 1907, a career of nearly four decades, but he is probably best remembered today for the presence of his musical play ''[[Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata]]'' on the bill with the historic 1875 premiere of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.

==Early life and acting career==
[[File:Charles Collette - Weir Collection.jpg|thumb|left|Poster of Collette, c. 1865]]
Collette was born in London, the son of [[Charles Hastings Collette]], a solicitor, and his wife, Frances Mary, ''née'' Sharpe,&lt;ref&gt;"Marriages", ''Gentleman's Magazine'', January 1842, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and the grandson of General Collette of the Madras Cavalry.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', 12 February 1924, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, he held a commission in the [[Dragoon Guards]]. He left the army in 1868, and, having enjoyed amateur theatricals while serving in India, he was attracted by a stage career.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; A mutual friend put him in touch with [[Effie Bancroft|Marie Bancroft]], who cast him as Charles Hampton, a light romantic role, in a comedy, ''Tame Cats'' at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He made an immediate impression. The magazine ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' published an article with the title "Tame Cats; Or, The Triumph of Collette";&lt;ref&gt;''Fun'', 26 December 1868, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; this, however, was not so much a tribute to the actor as a rebuke to his over-enthusiastic friends in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;The same charge was made in the magazine ''The Orchestra'', 19 December 1868, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the succeeding years, Collette appeared in many Bancroft productions, including ''School'' by [[Thomas William Robertson|T. W. Robertson]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' (as Sir Oliver Surface), ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and [[Lord Lytton]]'s ''Money''. Another classic role that Collette played was Mr. Puff in ''[[The Critic (play)|The Critic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Sketch of Mr. Charles Collette", ''The Belfast News-Letter'', 23 June 1877, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He was engaged by other managers, notably [[J. L. Toole]], [[John Hollingshead]], [[Mary Anderson (actress, born 1859)|Mary Anderson]], [[Lydia Thompson]] and [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], among others, as well as touring his own companies.  He appeared in plays by a wide variety of authors besides Shakespeare, Sheridan and Robertson, including stage adaptations of Dickens novels.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Michael.  "Crypto", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', Vol. 4, No. 28: Winter 2011, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, his attempt at theatrical management ended in financial disaster, sending him into bankruptcy for several years and drawing his solicitor father to the brink of professional ruin.&lt;ref&gt;"The Charge Against Mr. Collette", ''The Morning Post'', 12 December 1879, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Collette toured for some years as Colonel Woottwweell Woodd in [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xix-e.pierre-marteau.com/ed/colonel/actors.html Information about actors who played in ''The Colonel''], Pierre Marteau, accessed 17 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Woodd was one of his favourite roles; others included Sergeant Jones in Robertson's ''Ours'', Colonel Berners in They're Smith's ''Cut off with a Shilling'', Adonis Evergreen in [[Charles James Mathews|Charles Mathews]]'s ''My Awful Dad'', Autolycus in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', and Private Saunders in ''Bootles' Baby'', an adaptation by Hugh Moss of a popular novelette by J. S. Winter.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He was often referred to as the "soldier-actor"; not only did he play a large number of military men, there was, ''[[The Times]]'' said, "no mistaking that he had been in the Army. Tall and upright, with a broad chest and shoulders, he looked even when quite old the perfect type of a healthy Englishman."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

In 1887, Collett performed his own comic sketch at the [[Alhambra Theatre]], called ''Charles Collette at Home''.  The sketch included several [[patter song]]s and a comic lecture upon Natural History.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dramatic Review'', London, 8 January 1887, p. 234b&lt;/ref&gt; Collette continued acting in London and in the British provinces until 1907, when he played Mr. Micawber in an adaptation of ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', and in ''In the Bishop's Carriage'' at the [[Novello Theatre|Waldorf Theatre]].  He also appeared in concerts, and, towards the end of his life performed in "variety" shows.  He also created illustrations later in his life.&lt;ref&gt;Ince, Bernard. "Natural-Born Showman: The Stage Career of Charles Collette, Actor &amp; Comedian", ''Theatre Notebook'', vol. 63 (no. 1), 2009, pp. 20–37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and personal life==
[[File:Collette-what-an-affternoon.jpg|thumb|right|Sheet music for Collette's popular song from ''[[Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata]]]]
In addition to performing, Collette wrote a number of his own works, including the "successful romantic extravaganza" improbably titled ''[[Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata]], or While It's to be Had''.  This play was on the bill at the [[Royalty Theatre]], with Collette in the lead, when [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was premiered in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David.  [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/C/ColletteCharles.htm Charles Collette biography], ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', 2002, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 11 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Collette's song from the piece, "What an Afternoon!", became popular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/26913?show=full Music to "What an Afternoon!"], Jscholarship library, Johns Hopkins University&lt;/ref&gt; The simple form of the lyric, with its title repeated every other line, caught the public fancy:
&lt;poem&gt;
:His trousers' sleeves were bright green-red,
:What an afternoon!
:With velvet collar of white black lead;
:What an afternoon!
:He also moved his legs when he walked,
:What an afternoon!
:And he generally spoke when he usually talked;
:What an afternoon!
&lt;/poem&gt;
The popularity of the song prompted unauthorized distribution of the words and music. Collette successfully sued a man named Goode, causing one paper to comment that the song should be retitled "What a Goode Afternoon".&lt;ref&gt;Short, T. Duff, "Law", ''The Musical World,  9 February 1878, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Offstage, Collette was an enthusiastic collector of [[Staffordshire Potteries|Staffordshire china]], and was a long-standing and popular member of the [[Savage Club]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He married Blanche Julia Wilton (1851–1934), the younger sister of Lady Bancroft, with whom he had one daughter.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Collette died at his home near [[Kew Gardens]] at the age of 81.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

A '''Contributor License Agreement''' ('''CLA''') defines the terms under which [[intellectual property]] has been contributed to a company/project, typically [[software]] under an [[open source license]].

== Rationale ==

CLAs can be used to enable vendors to easily pursue legal resolution in the case of copyright disputes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apache.org/licenses/|title=Licenses|author=|date=|website=www.apache.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to relicense products to which contributions have been received from third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/ContributingFAQ|title=Contributing FAQ|author=|date=|website=mysql.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a CLA is to ensure that the guardian of a project's outputs has the necessary ownership or grants of rights over all contributions to allow them to distribute under the chosen license. In some cases this will mean that the contributor will assign the copyright in all contributions to the project owner; in other cases, they will grant an irrevocable licence to allow the project maintainer to use the contribution. CLAs also have roles in raising awareness of [[Intellectual property rights|IPR]] issues within a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla.xml |title=Contributor Licence Agreements |publisher=Oss-watch.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dorothea "Dodo" Chaplet''' is a fictional character played by [[Jackie Lane (actress)|Jackie Lane]] in the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. An [[Earth]] teenager from the year 1966, she was a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the [[First Doctor]] and a regular in the programme in its third season, from February to July, 1966. Only three of the serials in which Dodo appeared as a regular are complete in the BBC archive (''The Ark'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''The War Machines''). Dodo's personality was an unsophisticated, bright and happy one.

Ultimately the character was not deemed a success by the programme's makers, and Lane's contract was not extended beyond episode two of ''The War Machines.'' To replace her, two new characters, [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] ([[Anneke Wills]]) and [[Ben Jackson (Doctor Who)|Ben]] ([[Michael Craze]]), thought to be more in tune with the "[[swinging sixties]]", became companions.&lt;ref&gt;"production" in [http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/bb.html](retrieved 8 August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Dodo appeared in six stories (19 episodes, of which 11 currently exist in the BBC Archives).

Despite Jackie Lane's refusal to be involved with the programme, Dodo has appeared in several spin-off productions, including the popular Big Finish audio dramas and novels such as "Who Killed Kennedy?" explaining her life after leaving the Doctor.

==Appearances==

===Television===
Dodo is introduced at the end of the serial ''[[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve]]''. In that story, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] and [[Steven Taylor (Doctor Who)|Steven]] travel to 1572 [[Paris]], where they witness the persecution of the city's [[Huguenot]] population. Despite befriending a young woman named Anne Chaplet, the Doctor knows he cannot prevent the coming [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre|massacre of 10,000 Huguenots]], including Anne, by the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] French authorities. He therefore leaves in the [[TARDIS]], taking Steven with him. When Steven finds out, he is furious and considers leaving the Doctor while the TARDIS is in 1960s &lt;ref&gt;Dodo joins the Tardis. In the later story ''[[The War Machines]]'' on noticing the [[BT Tower|Post Office Tower]] she exclaims "it's finished". Construction of the Tower commenced in June 1961 and it was officially opened on 8 October 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; [[London]].

Steven returns at the same time that a young woman wanders into the TARDIS thinking it was a real [[police box]]. The Doctor and Steven are taken aback when she introduces herself as Dodo Chaplet and reveals that her grandfather was French. The Doctor speculates that Dodo might be Anne's descendant.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (2006) p.35&lt;/ref&gt; (As some have pointed out, this would mean Anne lived to have an illegitimate offspring unless she or a descendant married a man of the same name).&lt;ref&gt;Langley (2005) p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of ''[[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve]]'' she reveals she has no parents, explaining that she lives with her great aunt "and she won't care if she never sees me again". She witnesses images of herself on the Celestial Toymaker's memory window from the day her mother died.

In her travels with the Doctor, Dodo travels to the far future, unfortunately bringing the common cold with her to infect humanity's descendants; faces the [[The Celestial Toymaker|mad games]] of the [[Celestial Toymaker]]; witnesses the gunfight at the O.K. Corral; says good-bye to Steven in ''[[The Savages (Doctor Who)|The Savages]]''; and is [[hypnosis|hypnotised]] by the rogue [[artificial intelligence]] [[List of Doctor Who villains#WOTAN|WOTAN]] in ''[[The War Machines]]''.

Halfway through that last adventure, she abruptly departs for a rest in the country after being hypnotised, and never reappears. At the story's conclusion [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] (who, with [[Ben Jackson (Doctor Who)|Ben Jackson]], took Dodo's place as a companion) explains to the departing Doctor that Dodo has decided to remain in the 20th Century.

===Other media===
Dodo's life prior to joining the Doctor and the circumstances under which she joined him in the TARDIS were elaborated on in the [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Salvation (Doctor Who)|Salvation]]'', where the TARDIS, departing after she has entered it, travels to [[New York City]] in Dodo's present, resulting in Dodo working with the Doctor and Steven to investigate mysterious beings who appear to be gods. In the [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] novel ''[[The Man in the Velvet Mask]]'', Dodo has sex and is infected with an alien virus which slowly corrupts her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Phillip|last=Sandifer|url=http://tardiseruditorum.blogspot.com/2011/04/time-can-be-rewritten-4-man-in-velvet.html|title=Time Can Be Rewritten 4: The Man in the Velvet Mask (Daniel O'Mahoney, Virgin Books, 1996)|work=TARDIS Eruditorum|date=8 April 2011|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2013}}

Dodo's life after she left the Doctor was not dealt with in the programme. The [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] novel ''[[Who Killed Kennedy]]'' by [[David Bishop]] reveals that Dodo suffered a nervous breakdown and was unable to remember her adventures with the Doctor, drifting in and out of psychiatric institutions. Becoming involved with a journalist who was investigating the truth behind [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce|UNIT]], Dodo is murdered by a pawn of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. Her funeral is attended only by her lover and an unidentified man who, based on the limited description provided, may be either the [[Second Doctor|Second]] or [[Seventh Doctor]]. However in the 20th anniversary version of the novel, a new timeline is created where the assassin is stopped by her lover when he travels back in time from the future after an intervention by [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], implied to be the Twelfth such incarnation. However the [[Whoniverse#Inclusion and canonicity|canonicity]] of the novels in relation to the television series is open to question.

Dodo also appears in the Past Doctor Adventures novel ''[[Bunker Soldiers]]'', four short stories in the ''[[Virgin Decalog]]'' and ''[[BBC Short Trips]]'', and the [[Big Finish Productions]] audio dramas ''[[Mother Russia (Doctor Who audio)|Mother Russia]]'', ''[[Tales from the Vault]]'', ''[[Return of the Rocket Men]]'', and ''The War to End All Wars'' (which reveals that Steven named his favorite daughter after Dodo, although she died in an attempted coup caused by her sisters).

==Conception and casting==
Dodo was originally intended to have a "common" accent, and is portrayed this way at the end of ''The Massacre''. However, starting with the next story, ''[[The Ark (Doctor Who)|The Ark]]'', it was declared that ''Doctor Who'' regulars were required to speak in "[[Received Pronunciation|BBC English]]", and so Dodo's accent was changed.&lt;ref name="RT Ark"&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Mulkern|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2009-03-07/doctor-who-the-ark|title=Doctor Who: The Ark|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=7 March 2009|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1502">'''''Draxt ī Āsūrīg''''' (meaning "'''The [[Asorestan|Assyrian]] Tree'''" or "'''The Babylonian Tree'''") is a [[Parthian language|Parthian]]-language [[poem]] consisting of about 120 verses and written in [[Book Pahlavi]] script. The language shows influences from [[Middle Persian]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; It is one of the oldest existing texts in Parthian language.

The poem is framed as a dialogue between a [[goat]] and a [[palm tree]]. At the end, the goat is proclaimed to be victorious. The Iranians may have adopted this genre from the oral traditions of [[ancient Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;[[Ahmad Tafazzoli]], [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/draxti-asurig "DRAXT Ī ĀSŪRĪG"], ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', December 15, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the goat and the palm tree to be the symbols of [[Zoroastrianism]] and the [[Babylonian religion]], or simply the [[pastoral]] life and [[agriculture|agricultural]] life, respectively.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

The poem is also considered [[wisdom literature]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

A similar but less significant story, "The story of the vine and the ewe" ({{lang|fa|رز و میش}} ''raz o mīš''), has been recorded in [[Persian literature]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

The '''Fairbanks Arts Association''', is a [[non-profit organization]] established in 1966 to promote excellence in contemporary and traditional Alaskan arts in Interior Alaska.  It is the oldest community arts council in [[Alaska]] as well as serving as the official arts organization for both the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]] and the [[Fairbanks, Alaska|City of Fairbanks]], Alaska.  The main office is located in the Alaska Centennial Center for Arts in [[Alaskaland|Pioneer Park]].

The Fairbanks Arts Association provides services to local artists and arts organizations.  Volunteers serve on standing committees of the Board, and help to steer the course of programming in performance, literary, visual, community, and educational arts. The association has developed educational programs to improve the climate for the arts in Interior Alaska.

They have a number of educational programs. One of these is the Artists-in-Schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists-in-Schools Program|url=http://fairbanksarts.org/education/artists-in-schools-program/|publisher=Fairbanks Arts|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  program within the FNSBSD. The AIS residence enables artists to study traditional and contemporary art forms that include music, dance, traditional Alaska Native art, digital arts and more.

They also have a program called the Very Special Arts (VSA) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Very Special Arts|url=http://fairbanksarts.org/education/very-special-arts/|publisher=Fairbanks Arts Program|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a day when special education students come to Pioneer Park for a hands-on art experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7503">In [[academia]], a '''Festschrift''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfɛstʃrɪft}}; [[plural]], ''Festschriften'' {{IPA-de|ˈfɛstʃrɪftən|}}) is a book honoring a respected person, especially an [[academic]], and presented during their lifetime. It generally takes the form of an [[edited volume]], containing contributions from the honoree's colleagues, former pupils, and friends.

The term, borrowed from [[German language|German]], and literally meaning "party-writing" (cognate with "feast-script"), might be translated as "celebration publication" or "celebratory (piece of) writing". An alternative Latin term is ''liber amicorum'' (literally: “book of friends”). A comparable book presented posthumously is sometimes called a '''Gedenkschrift''' ("memorial publication"), but this term is much rarer in English.

==Description==
Originating in Germany before World War I, this European tradition of honoring special achievements in science and culture was carried to the United States by scientists who escaped the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Irving Louis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qcr1RD5ABbkC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;ots=k58vm0ExlM&amp;dq=Irving%20Louis%20Horowitz%20Scholarly%20Publishing%201990%20%20&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Communicating Ideas: The Politics of Scholarly Publishing.''] New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ricki Lewis. [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/18041/title/Festschriften-Honor-Exceptional-Scientific-Careers--Scholarly-Influences/ Festschriften Honor Exceptional Scientific Careers, Scholarly Influences], ''The Scientist,''  September 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 20th century, the practice became used internationally. Since no English term for such a book to mark a special occasion had been in use, the German word ''Festschrift'' has been incorporated into the English language and is frequently used without the italics that designate a foreign term, although the capitalization of the first letter is usually retained from German. Its plural may be either the original ''Festschriften'' or anglicized as "Festschrifts".&lt;ref name="Michael2004"&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Agnes, editor in chief | title = Webster's New World College Dictionary, ''fourth edition''  | publisher = Wiley Publishing | year = 2004 | pages = 524 | isbn = 0-02-863118-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festschriften are often titled something like ''Essays in Honour of...'' or ''Essays Presented to... .''

A Festschrift compiled and published by electronic means on the internet is called a '''Webfestschrift''' (pronounced either {{IPA|[vɛp-]}} or {{IPA|[wɛb-]}}), a term coined by the editors of the late [[Boris Marshak]]'s Webfestschrift, ''Eran ud Aneran'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/ |title=Eran ud Aneran - Transoxiana Webfestschrift Series 2003 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |issn=1666-7050 |website= |publisher=Transoxiana.org |accessdate=2013-10-08}}
*Information on how the term ''Webfestschrift''" was coined can be found in [http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/introduction.html Introduction to the Electronic Version of ''Webfestschrift Marshak'' 2003].

The corresponding ''Webgedenkschrift'' does not appear to be in frequent use {{as of|lc=y|2015|7}}.&lt;ref&gt;Google search turns up no results for [https://www.google.com/#safe=off&amp;q=Webgedenkschrift "Webgedenkschrift"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Festschrift contains original contributions by the honored academic's close colleagues, often including their former [[doctorate|doctoral]] students. It is typically published on the occasion of the honoree's retirement, significant birthday, or other notable career anniversary. A Festschrift can be anything from a slim volume to a work in several volumes. ''[[Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt]]'', for example, began in 1972 as a Festschrift to commemorate the 75th birthday of [[Joseph Vogt]], a German classical historian. Four volumes were planned, but it has since reached 89 volumes (including several which were planned for the next years, but put on hold in 1998). The essays usually relate in some way to, or reflect upon, the honoree's contributions to their scholarly field, but can include important original research by the authors. Many Festschriften also feature a ''tabula gratulatoria'', an extended list of academic colleagues and friends who send their best wishes to the honoree.

In the case of prominent academics, several Festschriften might be prepared by various groups of students and colleagues, particularly if the scholar made significant contributions to different fields.

In Germany it is an honor to be designated to prepare such a collection, and being selected by a prominent academic to edit a Festschrift, according to [[Claudio Naranjo]], can symbolize the proverbial passing of the torch.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Naranjo. [http://www.claudionaranjo.net/navbar_english/festschrift_english.html Festschrift]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Endel Tulving]], a Canadian neuroscientist, proposed that "a Festschrift frequently enough also serves as a convenient place in which those who are invited to contribute find a permanent resting place for their otherwise unpublishable or at least difficult-to-publish papers."&lt;ref name="Tulving"&gt;{{cite book |author=Endel Tulving |authorlink=Endel Tulving |editor=James S. Nairne |chapter=Are there 256 different kinds of memory? |title=The foundations of remembering: essays in honor of Henry L.

As [[Irving Louis Horowitz]] summarized, "''Festschriften'' persist and multiply. Why? Because they are not  just retrospective, but prospective. That is to say the ''Festschrift'' is a ''Beruf'', a call to further work, effort, and energy, a call to the improvement of learning, of a discipline, a science, an artistic vision, or an intellectual position. Even in this age of mass ''Festschriften'', they remain a special literary genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Ideas: The Politics of Scholarly Publishing|first=Irving Louis|last=Horovitz|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Alan Soble]], in a review of a Festschrift in honor of [[MIT]]'s philosopher [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]] proposed 13 conditions that must be satisfied by any adequate Festschrift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soble|first=Alan G.|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1072&amp;context=eip|title=Review of ''Fact and Value: Essays on Ethics and Metaphysics for Judith Jarvis Thomson''|journal=Essays in Philosophy|volume=4|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flatter''' is a [[colorist|coloring]] specialist within the [[comic book|comic book industry]] that prepares the inked or sketched comic book page for the colorist with digital art software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. The specialist does so by selecting the objects on the page and filling them in with a solid color called a "flat", so that the "flats" can be used by the colorist by way of the "magic wand" tool. In this way, the colorist may select each object during the rendering process-to the exclusion of the other objects on the page-so that the object's base color may be changed, or to render the colors.

Because each colorist has preferences as to how the flats are to be done flatters usually work as freelancers commissioned directly by the colorist. Pricing for flats vary but as of early 2010 one common going rate for a flatted page was $15 if the page were inked and of regular difficulty ($30 for a double page) with $20 for a sketched page of regular difficulty ($40 for a double sketched page).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Notable flatters include Jeremiah Embs and Neil Fraser that obtained published credit for flats while working for the colorist Brian Buccellato on the comic book series ''Witchblade'' (issues #72, 73, 74) for [[Top Cow Productions|Top Cow]] in 2003-2004. Other notable flatters include Alex Petretich, Talon Kelley, and Fredric Paculba, who have worked for the colorist [[Dave Stewart (artist)|Dave Stewart]] on such series as [[Hellboy]], [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense|BPRD]] and received published credits for the comic [[Shaolin Cowboy]].

'''''Freeheld''''' is a 2015 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Peter Sollett]] and written by [[Ron Nyswaner]]. The film stars [[Julianne Moore]], [[Ellen Page]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Luke Grimes]], and [[Michael Shannon]]. It is based on the 2007 [[Freeheld (2007 film)|documentary short film of the same name]] about police officer [[Laurel Hester]]'s fight against the [[Ocean County, New Jersey]] [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]] to allow her pension benefits to be transferred to her domestic partner after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.

==Plot==
The film is based on the true story of [[Laurel Hester]] (Moore), a police officer in [[Ocean County, New Jersey]]. The story narrates the difficulties faced by a [[lesbian]] police [[detective]] and her domestic partner, Stacie Andree (Page). Following her diagnosis with terminal [[lung cancer]] in 2005, Hester repeatedly appealed to the county's [[board of chosen freeholders]] to have her pension benefits passed on to her domestic partner; she was eventually successful.&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/story/news/local/ocean-county/2014/09/16/hollywood-immortalize-ocean-county-gay-rights-battle/15735709/|title=Hollywood to immortalize Ocean County gay rights battle|work=Asbury Park Press|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2014|first=Erik|last=Larsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

===Development===
Screenwriter [[Ron Nyswaner]] announced his intention in 2010 to write a feature-length adaptation of [[Cynthia Wade]]'s 2007 Oscar-winning short film ''Freeheld'', a documentary about New Jersey police officer [[Laurel Hester]]'s fight against the [[Ocean County, New Jersey]] [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]] to pass on her pension benefits to her domestic partner, Stacie Andree, after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.&lt;ref name=Page/&gt; At that time, [[Ellen Page]] had already agreed to star as Andree; she stated in 2014 that she had been involved in the project's development for almost six years.&lt;ref name=Page/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/x-mens-ellen-page-life-701414|title='X-Men's' Ellen Page on Life After Coming Out, the Bryan Singer Case and Her Battle With Depression|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Seth|last=Abramovitch|date=May 7, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She first became involved after two of the film's producers, [[Stacey Sher]] and [[Michael Shamberg]], sent her a copy of Wade's documentary and asked if she was interested in starring in an adaptation, an offer which she accepted "right away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4001823/ellen-page-freeheld/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Ellen Page on Freeheld and Why She Came Out: ‘I Was Just Depressed’|date=August 27, 2015|first=Daniel|last=D'Addario| accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine Hardwicke]] was attached to the project as director early in its development but later withdrew.&lt;ref name=Hardwicke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/watch-gay-rights-doc-freeheld-thats-being-turned-into-feature-starring-ellen-page-financing-for-film-secured-20120823|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|title=Watch: Gay Rights Doc 'Freeheld' That's Being Turned Into A Feature Starring Ellen Page, Financing For Film Secured|date=August 23, 2012|first=Joe|last=Cunningham|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the film's financing was secured in August 2012,&lt;ref name=Hardwicke/&gt; [[Peter Sollett]] signed on to replace Hardwicke as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/nick-and-norah-director-peter-sollett-to-helm-ellen-pages-equal-rights-drama-freeheld-20120906|date=September 6, 2012|title='Nick and Norah' Director Peter Sollett To Helm Ellen Page's Equal Rights Drama 'Freeheld'|first=Drew|last=Taylor|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julianne Moore]] was cast as Hester in February 2014.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt; [[Zach Galifianakis]] was cast as [[Steven Goldstein (activist)|Steven Goldstein]], the founder and then-Chair of [[Garden State Equality]], but was later replaced by [[Steve Carell]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt; Andree consulted with Page, Sollett and Nyswaner about the making of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/zurich-ellen-page-calls-for-more-diverse-stories/5094676.article?blocktitle=LATEST-FILM-NEWS-HEADLINES|first=Wendy|last=Mitchell|title=Zurich: Ellen Page calls for more diverse stories|date=September 26, 2015|work=[[Screen International]]|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Although the film is set in New Jersey, it was filmed in [[New York (state)|New York]] due to its more generous tax incentives for filmmakers.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; Filming began in October 2014 in [[Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2778771/Ouch-Julianne-Moore-displays-nasty-looking-cut-forehead-s-film-new-movie-alongside-Ellen-Page-plays-mechanic-girlfriend.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014|title=Ouch!

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s views on women have attracted controversy, beginning during his life and continuing to the present.

==Attitudes in public and in private==
Ida von Miaskowski{{who|date=November 2018}} remarked in her memoir, published 7 years after his death:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the eighties, when Nietzsche's later writings containing some of the oft-quoted sharp words against women appeared, my husband sometimes told me jokingly not to tell people of my friendly relations with Nietzsche, since this was not very flattering for me. It was just a joke. My husband, like myself, always kept friendly memories of Nietzsche [...] his behavior precisely towards women was so sensitive, so natural and comradely, that even today in old age I cannot regard Nietzsche as a despiser of women.&lt;ref&gt;Ida von Miaskowski, cited in S. L. Gilman (Ed.), D. J. Parent (Trans.), ''Conversations with Nietzsche, A Life in the Words of His Contemporaries'',  Oxford University Press, 1987, p52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Remarks in his writings==
Nietzsche wrote specifically about his views on women in Section VII of ''Human, All Too Human'', which seems to hold women in high regard; but given some of his other comments, his overall attitude towards women is ambivalent. For instance, while in ''Human, All Too Human'', he states that "the perfect woman is a higher type of human than the perfect man, and also something much more rare," there are a number of contradictions and subtleties in Nietzsche's thought elsewhere which are not easily reconcilable. He could be both in praise and contempt of women at one time or another. For instance, in the following passage: "What inspires respect for woman, and often enough even fear, is her nature, which is more “natural” than man’s, the genuine, cunning suppleness of a beast of prey, the tiger’s claw under the glove, the naiveté of her egoism, her uneducability and inner wildness, the incomprehensibility, scope, and movement of her desires and virtues." (''Beyond Good and Evil'', section 239.)

His attitude can sometimes be entirely disparaging: "From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than truth—her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty." In section 6 in "Why I Write Such Excellent Books" of ''Ecce Homo'', he claims that "goodness" in women is a sign of "physiological degeneration", and that women are on the whole cleverer and more wicked than men- which in Nietzsche's view, constitutes a compliment. Yet he goes on to claim that the emancipation of women, and feminists, was merely the resentment of some women against other women, who were physically better constituted and able to bear children.

Despite Nietzsche's writings being viewed as being misogynistic by many, others, such as [[Anthony Ludovici]], insist that he is only an [[anti-feminist]], not a misogynist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ludovici|first1=Anthony|title=Enemies of Women (The Origins in Outline of Anglo-Saxon Feminism)|date=1948|publisher=Carroll &amp; Nicholson Limited|location=London|page=VII|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writings include:

"Woman's love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love... Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best cows... (''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', On the Friend)

"Woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant... she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine: or better, she makes the strong weak--she rules when she succeeds in overcoming the strong... Woman has always conspired with the types of decadence, the priests, against the 'powerful', the 'strong', the men-" ([[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]] - 864, Second German edition of 1906) (It must be noted, however, that ''The Will to Power'' is a gathering of notes and fragments assembled through his sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] and others which were never approved by Nietzsche himself to be published.)

==Possible influence from Aristotle==
Scholars of [[Aristotle]] have drawn comparisons between Nietzsche's views on women and [[Aristotle's views on women]]. They have argued that Nietzsche may have borrowed much of his political philosophy from the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will (1926 (2006). The Story of Philosophy. United States: Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., p. 86 ,{{ISBN|978-0-671-73916-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Nietzsche's anthropology==
Some philosophers{{who|date=August 2015}} have even suggested that Nietzsche's philosophy cannot be understood or analyzed apart from his remarks on women. They discuss the fact that Nietzsche's work has been useful in the development of some feminist theory but ultimately conclude "While Nietzsche challenges traditional hierarchies between mind and body, reason and irrationality, nature and culture, truth and fiction - hierarchies that have been used to degrade and exclude women - his remarks about women and his use of feminine and maternal metaphors throughout his writings confound attempts simply to proclaim Nietzsche a champion of feminism or women."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Oliver, Marilyn Pearsall, "Introduction: Why Feminists Read Nietzsche", in Feminist Interpretations of Friedrich Nietzsche, Penn State Press, 1998, pp 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Salomé==
[[Lou Andreas-Salomé]], who knew Nietzsche very well, and claimed that he had proposed to her (according to her, she refused him) claimed there was something feminine in Nietzsche's "spiritual nature", and that he had considered genius to be a feminine genius.&lt;ref&gt;Biddy Martin, Women and Modernity: The (Life)Styles of Lou Andreas-Salomé, Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1991, p98&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2018}}

==Apparent misogyny as rhetorical strategy==
Frances Nesbitt Oppel interprets Nietzsche's attitude towards women as part of a [[rhetoric]]al strategy.&lt;blockquote&gt;...Nietzsche's apparent misogyny is part of his overall strategy to demonstrate that our attitudes toward sex-gender are thoroughly cultural, are often destructive of our own potential as individuals and as a species, and may be changed. What looks like misogyny may be understood as part of a larger strategy whereby "woman-as-such" (the universal essence of woman with timeless character traits) is shown to be a product of male desire, a construct.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Nesbitt Oppel, Nietzsche on Gender, University of Virginia Press, 2005, p1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Not advocating a model for others==
{{POV-section|date=June 2014}}
Others exhibit a less tolerant sophistication, though some recognize that Nietzsche made these remarks from a consciously relative position, and while they show little patience for his remarks overall they recognize that however odious his individual opinion of women may have been, he was not advocating it as a model for others. Cornelia Klinger states in her book ''Continental Philosophy in Feminist Perspective'': "Nietzsche, like Schopenhauer a prominent hater of women, at least relativizes his savage statements about woman-as-such."&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Klinger, Herta Nagl-Docekal, Continental Philosophy in Feminist Perspective, Penn State Press, 2002, p224&lt;/ref&gt; One of Nietzsche's own statements is cited in support of this assertion:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whenever a cardinal problem is at stake, there speaks an unchangeable "this is I"; about man and woman, for example, a thinker cannot relearn but only finish learning–only discover ultimately how this is "settled in him." At times we find certain solutions of problems that inspire strong faith in ''us''; some call them henceforth ''their'' "convictions." Later–we see them only as steps to self-knowledge, signposts to the problem we ''are''–rather, to the great stupidity we are, to our spiritual ''fatum'', to what is ''unteachable'' very "deep down". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this abundant civility that I have just evidenced in relation to myself I shall perhaps be permitted more readily to state a few truths about "woman as such"–assuming that it is now known from the outset how very much these are after all only–''my'' truths." (BGE, 7, 231)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Psychological digs and constructions==
Another author takes up this same quote, recognizing that "[a]lthough Nietzsche as generously as ever saves his commentators the labor of interpretation the problem recurs precisely because of the nature of what he proceeds to call his truths." But instead of focusing on putative misogyny she opines:&lt;blockquote&gt;Much more [...] must be thought to affect everything Nietzsche writes about woman. Rather than mere psychological digs and constructions, rather than a simple expression of his own misogyny, Nietzsche's philosophic expression of the nature of woman reflects and repeats the possibilities of the affirmation or denial of illusion. This is Nietzsche's understanding of truth, and to this extent Nietzsche was able to exploit his own misogyny, in style, tracing the Platonic metaphor as such.&lt;ref&gt;Babette E. Babich, ''Nietzsche's Philosophy of Science'', SUNY Press, 1994,  p241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Women as source of all folly and unreason==
As Leonard Lawlor and Zeynep Direk point out, "What Nietzsche ''says'' -and repeats with hysterical insistence- is that woman is the source of all folly and unreason, the siren figure who lures the male philosopher out of his appointed truth-seeking path."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Lawlor and Zeynep Direk, Derrida, Routledge, 2002, p139&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gujarat Sahitya Akademi''' ({{lang-gu|ગુજરાત સાહિત્ય અકાદમી}}) or '''Gujarat Sahitya Academy''', established in 1981, is a government institution dedicated to the development of the languages spoken in [[Gujarat]], [[India]] and their literature. Gujarati, an official language of Gujarat, is one of them; the others are [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Urdu]]. {{as of|2017}}, [[Vishnu Pandya]] is the chairman of the Akademi.&lt;ref name="The Times of India 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Vishnu Pandya replaces Bhagyesh Jha at Sahitya Akademi | website=The Times of India | date=2017-05-13 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/vishnu-pandya-replaces-jha-at-sahitya-akademi/articleshow/58651041.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wee2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lionel Wee|title=The Language of Organizational Styling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZvWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=United kingdom|isbn=978-1-107-05480-6|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The Gujarat Academy oversees five other academies; namely the Hindi Sahitya Academy for [[Hindi language|Hindi]], the Sanskrit Sahitya Academy for [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], the Kutchi Sahitya Academy for [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], the Sindhi Sahitya Academy for [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and the Urdu Sahitya Academy for [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. The registrar is the administrative head of all five academies. There are three standing committees, each of which has ten members, including five official members, for folk literature, Sanskrit language and literature, and other modern Indian languages.&lt;ref name="RahmanVerma2005"/&gt;

The chairman, the vice chairman and the registrar have day to day control of the Akademi. The Akademi's overall controlling authorities are the general body and the executive council. The term of the general body is 5 years. The general body is made of 41 members including the education commissioner of Gujarat, the financial adviser of the education department, the registrar of Akademi, the higher education commissioner of Gujarat, the director of language of Gujarat, five members from the Gujarati literary community selected by the state government, 9 members selected by the committee appointed by representative of different Gujarati literary institutions, 8 members representing of the University of Gujarat, 3 members selected by the members of the general body of the Akademi, 9 members selected by a committee appointed by Gujarati writers, 2 members who have been awarded the [[Sahitya Gaurav Puraskar]]. The executive council is made up of a maximum of ten members including the chairman, the registrar and the vice-chairman of the Akademi, the education commissioner of Gujarat, the financial adviser of the education department, the education commissioner of Gujarat and five members of the general body selected by the state government.&lt;ref name=thesis&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Dhameliya|first=Priti Y.|script-title=gu:ગુજરાતી સાહિત્ય પરિષદના મુખપત્ર 'પરબ' તથા ગુજરાત સાહિત્ય અકાદમીના મુખપત્ર 'શબ્દસૃષ્ટિ'ના વિશેષાંકોનો સમિક્ષાત્મક અભ્યાસ|date=2016|publisher=[[Bhavnagar University]]|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10603/129321|place=Bhavnagar |trans-title=A Critical Study of Gujaratí Sahitya Parishad's organ 'Parab' and Gujarat Sahitya Academy's organ 'Shabdasrishti|language=gu|format=PDF|type=PhD|script-chapter=gu:પ્રકરણ 2: સાહિત્ય સંસ્થાઓનો પરિચય |trans-chapter=Chapter 2: An Introduction of Literary Institutions|hdl=10603/129321|access-date=2017-09-09|pages=8–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The Akademi is an autonomous body empowered by its constitution to elect its chairman through a [[Electoral system|voting process]] by the 41 members of the general body.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bharat Mehta returns state Akademi award | website=The Indian Express | date=2015-11-04 | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/bharat-mehta-returns-state-akademi-award/ | access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akademi did not have a chairman from 2003 to 2015 as the government did not held an election.&lt;ref name=AGSI/&gt; It was run by the registrar in-charge and the secretary of the sports, youth and cultural activities department; ex-offcio. In April 2015, the state government appointed Bhagyesh Jha, a Gujarati writer and retired [[Indian Administrative Services|IAS]] officer, as the new chairman of the Akademi without any election.&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes2017"/&gt; This resulted in the Autonomous Academy Agitation (''Swayatta Akademi Andolan'') led by [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]], the oldest literary institute in Gujarat and several Gujarati writers including Manishi Jani, [[Shirish Panchal]], [[Dhiru Parikh]], [[Chandrakant Topiwala]], Bharat Mehta, Paresh Naik and Raju Solanki.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title=Writers demand autonomy for Sahitya Academy | website=The Indian Express | date=2011-06-06 | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/writers-demand-autonomy-for-sahitya-academy/ | access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parishad boycotted the activities of the Akademi in protest.

An '''immortelle''' is a long-lasting flower arrangement placed on graves in cemeteries.

They were originally made from natural dried flowers (which lasted longer than fresh flowers) or could be made from artificial materials such as china and painted [[plaster of paris]] or beads strung on wire arrangements. Unless made of a highly durable material (e.g. china), they would often be enclosed in a glass container (known as globes) to protect them from the weather. In some cases, they were embedded into the grave itself (e.g. on the concrete over the grave) while others were merely placed on or by the grave.

[[File:Immortelles, from Life on the Mississippi by Mark Twain, 1883.jpg|thumb|left|Immortelles, from Life on the Mississippi by Mark Twain, 1883]]
In ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'', [[Mark Twain]] comments on burial practices in [[New Orleans]]: ''"They bury their dead in vaults, above the ground. ... Fresh flowers, in vases of water, are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults: placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and children, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and ugly but indestructible 'immortelle'—which is a wreath or cross or some such emblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross's bars—kind of sorrowful breast-pin, so to say. The immortelle requires no attention: you just hang it up, and there you are; just leave it alone, it will take care of your grief for you, and keep it in mind better than you can; stands weather first-rate, and lasts like boiler-iron."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Twain, Mark | author2=Roy J. Friedman Mark Twain Collection (Library of Congress) | title=Life on the Mississippi : with over 300 illustrations | publication-date=1883 | publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10904097 | accessdate=27 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Immortelle, Allora Cemetery, 2015.JPG|thumb|Immortelle, Allora Cemetery, 2015]]
Immortelles were popular in Australia in the early 20th century. Being more expensive than fresh flowers, immortelles were normally left on graves by close family. They were purchased from undertakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article121047009 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[Inglewood Advertiser]] |location=Vic. |date=4 February 1916 |accessdate=27 December 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article151064590 |title=FUNERAL. |newspaper=[[Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser]] |location=Qld. |date=12 September 1929 |accessdate=27 December 2014 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, plastic flowers have replaced immortelles as a long-lasting flower arrangement for use with graves. Therefore, immortelles will mostly only be seen on older graves.

At the time of its inception Intermedia aimed to create a centre of community resource in Vancouver where artists, architects, engineers, technologists and educators could come together and explore new models and formats for the purpose of intensifying and expanding the effectiveness of creative sensibility in the community.&lt;ref name=Westell1980 &gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As time passed the aims of the group changed to focus of individual artists and small groups:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The purpose/aim of Intermedia is to help the artist realize [their self] and [their] work by providing an umbrella/shelter of cooperatively-structured, contiguous and inter-related functioning artists' groups, often service-oriented.&lt;ref name=Westell1980 &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] hosted &lt;i&gt;Intermedia Nights&lt;/i&gt;, which enabled Intermedia to reach a wide audience. The artists associated with Intermedia explored different techniques, including performance art, experimental film, correspondence art, and other media, to expand popular concepts of art. In 1972, Intermedia ceased to function as an organization.

'''Jane Arden''' (29 October 1927{{spaced ndash}}20 December 1982) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[film director]], actress, [[screenwriter]], [[playwright]], [[songwriter]], and [[poet]].

==Early life, education and early career==

Arden was born '''Norah Patricia Morris''' at 47 Twmpath Road, [[Pontypool]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://babylonwales.blogspot.com/2010/05/jane-arden.html Jane Arden at babylonwales.blogspot.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied acting at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in [[London]], [[England]], and began her career in the late 1940s on television and in the cinema.

She appeared in a television production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in the late 1940s, and then starred in two British crime films: ''[[Black Memory]]'' (1947) directed by [[Oswald Mitchell]]{{spaced ndash}} which provided South African-born actor [[Sid James]] with his first screen credit (billed as Sydney James){{spaced ndash}} and Richard M. Grey's ''A Gunman Has Escaped'' (1948). There are copies of both films in the [[BFI National Archive]], but the copy of ''A Gunman Has Escaped'' is incomplete.

==Writing and theatre==

In the 1950s she married the director [[Philip Saville]], and after a short spell in New York where she began writing, the couple settled in Hampstead and had two sons. Arden then wrote several plays and television scripts, some of which her husband directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1364950/index.html|title=Arden, Jane (1927-82)|website="Screen Online"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her stage play ''Conscience and Desire, and Dear Liz'' (1954) attracted interest, and her comedy television drama ''Curtains For Harry'' (1955), starring [[Bobby Howes]] and [[Sydney Tafler]], was transmitted on 20 October 1955 by the newly established [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. The latter featured the ''[[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]]'' actress [[Joan Sims]]. Arden's co-writer on this piece was the American [[Richard Lester]], who was then working as a television director.

Arden worked with some leading figures of British theatre and cinema in the late 1950s.

In 1958, her play ''[[The Party (1958 play)|The Party]]'', an intense family drama set in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], was directed at [[London]]'s [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] by [[Charles Laughton]]. It turned out to be Laughton's last appearance on the London stage, while it provided [[Albert Finney]] with his first theatre role.

Her television drama ''The Thug'' (1959) provided a powerful early role for actor [[Alan Bates]].

In 1964, Arden appeared with [[Harold Pinter]] in a television production of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[No Exit|Huis Clos]]'', directed by Saville.

==Feminism, film and radical theatre==

Arden's work became increasingly radical following her growing interest and involvement in [[feminism]] and the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement of the 1960s. This is particularly evident from 1965 onwards, starting with the television drama ''The Logic Game'', which she wrote and starred in. ''The Logic Game'', which was directed by Saville, also starred the British actor [[David de Keyser]] who worked alongside Arden again in the film ''[[Separation (1967 film)|Separation]]'' (1967). Arden, again, wrote the screenplay and the film was directed by her creative partner [[Jack Bond (director)|Jack Bond]] (born 1937). ''[[Separation (1967 film)|Separation]]'', which was photographed in atmospheric black and white by Aubrey Dewar, also featured music by the chart-topping British group [[Procol Harum]].

Arden and Bond had previously worked on the [[documentary film]] ''Dalí in New York'' (1966), which mainly consists of the [[surrealist]] artist [[Salvador Dalí]] and Arden walking the streets of [[New York City]] discussing Dalí's work. This film was resurrected and shown at the 2007 [[Tate Gallery]] Dalí exhibition.

Arden's television work in the mid-1960s included appearances in Saville's ''Exit 19'', Jack's Russell's ''The Interior Decorator'', and the satirical programme ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'', hosted by [[David Frost]].

Arden's work in [[experimental theatre]] in the late 1960s and the 1970s coincided with her return to cinema as an actor, writer and director (or co-director).

The play ''Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven'' (1969), starring [[Victor Spinetti]], and [[Sheila Allen (English actress)|Sheila Allen]], played to packed houses for six weeks at London's [[Arts Lab]]. It was described by [[Arthur Marwick]], in his book ''The Sixties'' as "perhaps the most important single production"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marwick  | first = Arthur  | title = The Sixties  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | year = 1998  | location = Oxford  | page = 352  | isbn = 0-19-288100-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the venue during that period. Also around this time Arden wrote the drama ''The Illusionist''.

In 1970, Arden formed the radical feminist theatre group Holocaust and then wrote the play  ''A New Communion for Freaks, Prophets and Witches''. The play would later be adapted for the screen as ''[[The Other Side of the Underneath]]'' (1972). Arden directed the film and appeared in it uncredited; screenings at film festivals, including the 1972 [[London Film Festival]], caused a considerable stir. The film depicts a woman's mental breakdown and rebirth in scenes at times violent and highly shocking; the writer and critic [[George Melly]] described it as "a most illuminating season in Hell",&lt;ref&gt;[http://vertigomagazine.co.uk/showarticle.php?sel=bac&amp;siz=1&amp;id=836  Vertigo Magazine:] Unknown pleasures: By [[Sean Kaye-Smith]]. Retrieved August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[BBC Radio]] journalist David Will declared the film to be "a major breakthrough for the British cinema".&lt;ref&gt;[http://microplex.cubecinema.com/cgi-bin/diary/archive.pl?action=view_event&amp;new_month=07&amp;new_year=2009&amp;new_day=21&amp;new_hour=20&amp;new_minute=00  CUBE archive].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2010}}

Throughout her life Arden's interest in other cultures and belief systems increasingly took the form of a personal spiritual quest.

Following ''The Other Side of the Underneath'', there were two further collaborations with Jack Bond in the 1970s: ''Vibration'' (1974), described by Geoff Brown and Robert Murphy in their book ''Film Directors in Britain and Ireland'' ([[British Film Institute]] 2006) as "an exercise in meditation utilising experimental film and video techniques",&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.aftrs.edu.au/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=E26163B25718F.33284&amp;profile=nfts&amp;uri=link=3100006~!259374~!3100001~!3100002&amp;aspect=subtab13&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!horizon&amp;term=Anti-clock&amp;index=  Horizon Information Portal:] Summary.&lt;/ref&gt; and the futuristic ''[[Anti-Clock]]'' (1979), which featured Arden's songs on the soundtrack and starred Sebastian Saville. The latter opened the 1979 [[London Film Festival]].

In 1978, Arden published the book ''You Don't Know What You Want, Do You?'', and supported its publication with public readings and discussions, such as that at [[The King's Head Theatre]] in London on 1 October 1978. Although loosely defined as poetry the book is also a radical social and psychological manifesto which has been compared with [[R.D. Laing]]'s ''Knots''. By this time, Arden had moved on from [[feminism]] to a view that all people needed to be set free from the tyranny of rationality.

==Personal life==
She had two sons with Philip Saville: Sebastian and Dominic. Sebastian runs [http://www.release.org.uk Release] the British centre of expertise on drugs, the law and human rights.  Dominic is the chief executive officer of [http://www.3ddgroup.com 3DD Entertainment], a British film distribution and production company.

===Death and legacy===
Arden took her own life at Hindlethwaite Hall in [[Coverdale (dale)|Coverdale]], [[Yorkshire]] on 20 December 1982. She was initially buried in [[Darlington]] West Cemetery, but on 14 February 2011, her remains were exhumed and moved by her family to [[Highgate Cemetery]] in London.

In July 2008, Arden was one of the topics discussed in the Conference of 1970s British Culture and Society held at the [[University of Portsmouth]].

In 2009, the [[British Film Institute]] restored the three major feature films Arden made with her creative associate [[Jack Bond (director)|Jack Bond]]: ''[[Separation (1967 film)|Separation]]'' (1967), ''[[The Other Side of the Underneath]]'' (1972) and ''[[Anti-Clock]]'' (1979). The films became available on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in July 2009. Bond was involved in the restoration and reissue processes, and the release of the films was accompanied by exhibition of the restored features at the [[National Film Theatre]] and The Cube Microplex in [[Bristol]]. Her books{{spaced ndash}} poetry and plays{{spaced ndash}} remain out of print.

As a tribute to Arden, the [[experimental music|experimental-music]] group [[Hwyl Nofio]], fronted by [[Steve Parry (musician)|Steve Parry]] from Pontypool, included the song "Anti-Clock" on their album ''[[Dark (album)|Dark]]'' (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2106">The {{nihongo|'''Japan Professional Photographers Society'''|日本写真家協会|Nihon Shashinka Kyōkai}} is a Tokyo-based organization of photographers founded in 1950. Its logo reads “JPS”.&lt;!-- No, not “JPPS”, instead, just one “P”. I've no idea why. --&gt; It was formed from the combination of three earlier organizations, none more than two years old: Seinen Hōdō Shashin Kenkyūkai (青年報道写真研究会), Seinen Shashinka Kyōkai (青年写真家協会, Young Photographers' Association), and Shashinka Shūdan (写真家集団, Photographers' Group), 

The organization exists to maintain professional standards and to protect the interests of professional photographers. It also sponsors exhibitions of interest to the general public, and, since 2005, the [[Yōnosuke Natori|Younosuke &lt;!-- Yes, this is how they romanize it. --&gt; Natori]] Photography Award for photographers under 30. Its current President (2007) is [[Takeyoshi Tanuma]].

The '''Kruithof curve''' describes a region of [[illuminance]] levels and [[color temperature]]s that are often viewed as comfortable or pleasing to an observer. The curve was constructed from [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] data collected by Dutch physicist [[Arie Andries Kruithof]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Arie Andries|last=Kruithof|url=http://dap.library.uu.nl/cgi-bin/dap/dap?diss_id=7789|title=Aanslag van het waterstofmolecuulspectrum door electronen|date=December 12, 1934}} (PhD dissertation at [[Utrecht University]] under [[Leonard Ornstein]]) {{nl icon}}
&lt;/ref&gt; though the original experimental data is not present on the curve itself. Lighting conditions within the bounded region were [[Empirical evidence|empirically]] assessed as being pleasing or natural, whereas conditions outside the region were considered uncomfortable, displeasing or unnatural.&lt;ref name=Kruithof1941&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kruithof|first=Arie Andries|title=Tubular Luminescence Lamps for General Illumination |journal=Philips Technical Review| volume=6|issue=3|pages=65–96|year=1941|issn=0031-7926}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cnspan|1=The Kruithof curve is a sufficient model for describing pleasing|date=March 2017}} [[Light#Light source|sources]] that are considered [[Sunlight|natural]] or closely resemble [[Planck's law|Planckian]] [[Black body|black bodies]], but its value in describing human preference has been consistently questioned by further studies on interior lighting.&lt;ref name="Davis &amp; Ginthner 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce &amp; Cuttle 1990"/&gt;

For example, natural daylight has a color temperature of 6500 [[Kelvin|K]] and an illuminance of about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[lux]]. This color temperature–illuminance pair results in natural [[Color Rendering Index|color rendition]], but if viewed at a low illuminance, would appear bluish. At typical indoor office illuminance levels of about 400 lux, pleasing color temperatures are lower (between 3000 and 6000 K), and at typical home illuminance levels of about 75 lux, pleasing color temperatures are even lower (between 2400 and 2700 K). These color temperature-illuminance pairs are often achieved with [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] and [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent sources]], respectively. It is noteworthy that the pleasing region of the curve contains color temperatures and illuminance levels comparable to naturally lit environments.

==History==
At the emergence of fluorescent lighting in 1941, Kruithof conducted psychophysical experiments to provide a technical guide to design artificial [[lighting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viénot|first=Françoise |author2=Marie-Lucie Durand |author3=Elodie Mahler|title=Kruithof's rule revisited using LED illumination|journal=Journal of Modern Optics|date=20 July 2009|volume=56|issue=13|pages=1433–1446|doi=10.1080/09500340903151278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Gas-discharge lamp|gas-discharge fluorescent lamps]], Kruithof was able to manipulate the color of emitted light and ask observers to report as to whether or not the source was pleasing to them. The sketch of his curve as presented consists of three major regions: the middle region, which corresponds to light sources considered pleasing; the lower region, which corresponds to colors that are considered cold and dim; and the upper region, which corresponds to colors that are warm and unnaturally colorful. These regions, while approximate, are still used to determine appropriate lighting configurations for homes or offices.

==Perception and adaptation==
[[File:Red geranium photoic mesopic scotopic.jpg|thumb|right|Simulated appearance of a red geranium and foliage in normal bright-light ([[Photopic vision|photopic]]) vision, dusk ([[Mesopic vision|mesopic]]) vision, and night ([[Scotopic vision|scotopic]]) vision. The blueish flower centers are still [[Perception|perceived]] as bright in the image of the flower viewed at dusk and at night.]]
Kruithof's findings are directly related to human [[Adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] to changes in illumination. As illuminance decreases, human [[Spectral sensitivity|sensitivity]] to blue light increases. This is known as the [[Purkinje effect]].&lt;ref name="frisby1980"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Frisby, John P. | title=Seeing: Illusion, Brain and Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford | year=1980|isbn=978-0-19-217672-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The human [[visual system]] switches from photopic ([[Cone cell|cone]]-dominated) vision to scotopic ([[Rod cell|rod]]-dominated) vision when [[luminance]] levels decrease. Rods have a very high spectral sensitivity to blue energy, whereas cones have varying spectral sensitivities to reds, greens and blues. Since the dominating [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] in scotopic vision is most sensitive to blue, human sensitivity to blue light is therefore increased. Because of this, intense sources of higher (bluer) color temperatures are all generally considered to be displeasing at low luminance levels, and a narrow range of pleasing sources exist. Subsequently, the range of pleasing sources increases in photopic vision as luminance levels are increased.

==Criticism==
While the curve has been used as a guide to design artificial lighting for indoor spaces, with the general suggestion to use sources with low correlated color temperatures at low illuminances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=Peter R.|title=Human factors in lighting|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=978-0-7484-0950-1|pages=245–250|edition=2|chapter=Lighting for offices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kruithof did not describe the method of evaluation, the independent variables, nor the test sample that were used to develop the curve. Without these data, nor other validation, the conclusions should not be considered credible. The relationship between illuminance and CCT was not supported by subsequent work.&lt;ref name="Boyce &amp; Cuttle 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyce|first1=P.R.|last2=Cuttle|first2=C.|title=Effect of correlated colour temperature on the perception of interiors and colour discrimination|journal=Lighting Research &amp; Technology|date=1990|volume=22|issue=1|pages=19–36|doi=10.1177/096032719002200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis &amp; Ginthner 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=RG|last2=Ginthner|first2=DN|title=Correlated color temperature, illuminance level and the Kruithof curve|journal=Journal of the Illuminating Engineering Society|date=1990|volume=Winter|pages=27–38|doi=10.1080/00994480.1990.10747937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illuminance and CCT has been examined in many studies of interior lighting &lt;ref name="Davis &amp; Ginthner 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce &amp; Cuttle 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vienot|first1=F|last2=Durand|first2=M|last3=Mahler|first3=E|title=Kruithof's rule revisited using LED illumination|journal=Journal of Modern Optics|date=2009|volume=56|issue=13|pages=1433–1466|doi=10.1080/09500340903151278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Islam et al 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Islam|first1=MS|last2=Dangol|first2=R|last3=Hyvärinen|first3=M|last4=Bhusal|first4=P|last5=Ouolakka|first5=M|last6=Halonen|first6=L|title=User acceptance studies for LED office lighting: Lamp spectrum, spatial brightness and illuminance|journal=Lighting Research and Technology|date=2015|volume=47|pages=54–79|doi=10.1177/1477153513514425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wei et al 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wei|first1=Minchen|last2=Houser|first2=Kevin W.|last3=Orland|first3=Brian|last4=Lang|first4=Dean H.|last5=Ram|first5=Nilam|last6=Sliwinskiwinski|first6=Martin J.|last7=Bose|first7=Mallika|title=Field study of office worker responses to fluorescent lighting of different CCT and lumen output|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=39|pages=62–76|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2014.04.009|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these studies consistently demonstrate a different relationship to that suggested by Kruithof.&lt;ref name="Fotios 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fotios|first1=Steve|title=A Revised Kruithof Graph Based on Empirical Data|journal=LEUKOS|date=2 January 2017|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3–17|doi=10.1080/15502724.2016.1159137|issn=1550-2724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than having upper and lower boundaries, these studies do not suggest CCT to have significant effect and for illuminance suggest only to avoid levels below 300 lux.

==Further studies==
The Kruithof curve, as presented, does not contain experimental data points and serves as an approximation for desirable lighting conditions. Therefore, its scientific accuracy has been reassessed.

Color rendering index is a [[Units of measurement|metric]] for describing the [[Visual appearance|appearance]] of a source and whether or not it is considered pleasing. The color rendering index of a given source is a measure of that source's ability to faithfully reproduce colors of an object. Light sources, like [[candle]]s or incandescent light bulbs produce spectrums of [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic]] energy that closely resemble Plankian black bodies; they look much like natural sources. Many fluorescent lamps or [[LED lamp|LED light bulbs]] have spectrums that do not match those of Plankian blackbodies and are considered unnatural. Therefore, the way that they render the perceived colors of an environment may be also considered unnatural. While these newer sources can still achieve correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels that are within the comfortable region of the Kruithof curve, variability in their color rendering indices may cause these sources to ultimately be displeasing.

Different activities or scenarios call for different color temperature-illuminance pairs: preferred light sources change depending on the scenario the source is illuminating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|url=http://naoyuki-oi.la.coocan.jp/Research/CIE_2007_proceeding.pdf|first=Naoyuki|last=Oi|author2=Hironobu Takahashi|title=Preferred Combinations Between Illuminance and Color Temperature in Several Settings for Daily Living Activities|institution=Kyushu University|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals did prefer color temperature-illuminance pairs within the comfortable region for [[Eating|dining]], [[Socialization|socializing]] and [[Study skills|studying]], but also preferred color temperature-illuminance pairs that were in the lower uncomfortable region for night time activities and preparing for bed. This is linked to the Purkinje effect; individuals who desire some light at night time desire lower (redder) color temperatures even if luminance levels are very low.

Kruithof's findings may also vary as a function of [[culture]] or [[Geography|geographic]] location. Desirable sources are based on an individual's previous experiences of perceiving color, and as different regions of the world may have their own lighting standards, each culture would likely have its own acceptable light sources.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The illuminance of a source is the dominating factor for deciding as to whether or not a source is pleasing or comfortable, as viewers participating in this experiment evaluated a range of correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels, yet their impressions remained generally unchanged as correlated color temperature changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bodmann|first=H.W.|author2=G. Sollner |author3=E. Voit |title=Evaluation of lighting level with various kinds of light|journal=Proceedings of the CIE|year=1963|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is a relationship between correlated color temperature and appeared brightness of a source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Han|first=S.|title=Effect of Illuminance, CCT and Decor on the Perception of Lighting|degree=M.S.|publicationplace=[[Troy, New York]]|institution = [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these findings, it is evident that color rendering index, in place of correlated color temperature, may be a more appropriate metric for determining as to whether or not a certain source is considered pleasing.

'''The London Sketch Club''' was founded by members of the Langham Sketching Club on 1 April 1898 as a social club for artists working in the field of commercial graphic art, mainly for newspapers, periodicals and books.  The founder members were [[Dudley Hardy]], [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]], Walter Fowler, [[Lance Thackeray]], [[Cecil Aldin]], W Sanders Fiske, Walter Churcher, [[Tom Browne (illustrator)|Tom Browne]], [[George Charles Haité]], its first president, and [[Frederick Hamilton Jackson]], its first Honorary Secretary. By 1903, it had established itself in permanent premises in Wells Street. However, the club relocated to 7 Dilke Street in 1957. Members still meet each other there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/london-sketch-club|title=London Sketch Club {{!}} Artist Biographies|website=www.artbiogs.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Club have included [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]], [[H.M. Bateman]], [[Salomon van Abbé]], [[Terence Cuneo]], [[Alfred Leete]], and [[David Langdon (cartoonist)|David Langdon]].

'''''Modern Language Notes''''' is an [[academic journal]] established in 1886 at the [[Johns Hopkins University]], where it is still edited and published, with the intention of introducing continental [[Europe]]an [[literary criticism]] into American scholarship. Each year, one issue is devoted to each of the four languages of concern. The fifth issue focuses on comparative literature.

The journal is published five times each year in January ([[Italian language|Italian]]), March ([[Spanish language|Hispanic]]), April ([[German language|German]]), September ([[French language|French]]), and December ([[Comparative literature]]). Circulation is 1,173 and the average length of an issue is 240 pages.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The '''''Montini Altarpiece''''' (Italian: ''Pala Montini'') is an [[oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by the  Italian Renaissance artist [[Cima da Conegliano]], dating from around  1506-1507 and housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale di Parma|Galleria Nazionale]] of [[Parma]], [[Italy]].

The work adopts the same scheme of several altarpieces by [[Giovanni Bellini]], such as the ''[[San Giobbe Altarpiece]]''. It was originally executed for the [[Parma Cathedral]].

It shows the Virgin Mary on a high throne in a mosaic-decorated [[apse]], while offering a hand towards the bowing [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.fr/detail/illustration/pala-montini-by-giovanni-battista-cima-da-conegliano-known-graphisme/132701818?Language=fr Fondation Getty]&lt;/ref&gt; A bearded Saint [[John the Baptist]], in a sleeveless vest, is portrayed on the left. On the right, the Christ Child is blessing [[Saint Apollonia]] (whose attribute of the pincer with tooth is in the plinth before her), Saint Catherine of Alexandria (with her attribute, the broken wheel), and Saint [[John the Evangelist]] (with a book). An angel sits at the foot of the throne in the centre foreground and holds a stringed musical instrument.

Many of the novels and short stories written or co-written by [[Stephen King]] take place in a [[multiverse]] created by the author.

== Fictional history, structure and worlds of Stephen King's multiverse ==
In the beginning, there was a magical presence known as the Prim—also referred as the "darkness behind everything"–from which [[List of The Dark Tower characters#Gan|Gan]] arose. When All-World was created, Gan appeared in metaphysical form as a giant edifice known as the Dark Tower, alongside six Beams, which are protected by twelve Guardians.

It is said that one of the Guardians, Maturin the Turtle, vomited out a universe as the result of a stomach ache. This universe includes the Keystone Earth, which is a reflection of the "real world" and also includes a fictional version of Stephen King himself. It is the universe of the Rose too.

Some people have the ability to travel between universes by "going Todash"; other ways are through rare artifacts like the Wizard's Rainbow, the Talisman, and the Lil Pink.

Gan uses Stephen King as a facilitator to tell the tale of the Gunslinger, so [[Roland Deschain]] could successfully go about his task of reaching the Tower. If the author died before completing his task, Roland would not have "known" how to further proceed on his quest to the Tower and, without any significant remaining opposition, the [[Crimson King]] would have finally toppled the Dark Tower and initiated "Discordia"—the event which all universes would have ceased to exist—and there would be no story created.

== ''Ka'' ==
''Ka'' is a plot element in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series. It is a word of the [[fictional language]] High Speech.

In the books, it is a mysterious force that leads all living (and unliving) creatures. It is the will of [[List of The Dark Tower characters#Gan|Gan]], the approximate equivalent of [[destiny]] or [[fate]], in King's fictional language of High Speech. ''Ka'' can be considered to be a guide, a destination, but is certainly not a plan—at least, not one that is known to mortals. Ka is not necessarily a force of [[good and evil|good or evil]]; it manipulates both sides, and seems to have no definite [[morality]] of its own. To this end, Ka resonates with the concept of [[karma]].

=== Concepts involving ''ka'' ===
Because of the importance of ''ka'' to the world of King's ''Dark Tower'', many phrases in the High Speech use the word ka, such as:

*ka-babbies: young ka-tet members.
*ka-tel: a class of apprentice gunslingers.
*ka-mai: ka's fool.
*ka-me: ka's wiseman; the opposite of ka-mai.
*kas-ka: a prophet
*ka-shume: a unique feeling that a ka-tet is destined to break soon.
*te-ka: ka's friend.
*Can'-Ka No Rey: the red fields of none, where the Dark Tower lies.
*tet-ka can Gan: the [[navel]] (specifically, the navel of [[Gan (Stephen King)|Gan]]).
*kas-ka Gan: singer of Gan's song/ prophet of Gan.
*ves-ka Gan: Song of the Turtle

==== ''Ka-tet'' ====
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted:[[Image:Book7-06-algul-siento-destroyed.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Roland's Ka-tet. Art by [[Michael Whelan]].]]--&gt; 
A ''ka-tet'' is a group of beings brought together by ''ka''. "We are ''ka-tet''. We are one from many," says [[Roland Deschain]] on the day before the Battle of Algul Siento.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower VII]]''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ka-tet'' is the belief that a group of people can be tied together by fate, or ''ka''. It is said that a group has shared "khef" or the water of life. Sometimes the symbol of water is used literally, as in a ritual Roland and his ''ka-tet'' performs the night before the battle of Algul Siento. In the seventh novel, Susannah Dean, who ends up understanding ka maybe more than Roland himself, comes to the understanding that in simple terms, "ka-tet" means family.

Roland's ''ka-tet'' includes himself, [[Eddie Dean (The Dark Tower)|Eddie Dean]], [[Susannah Dean]], [[Oy (Dark Tower)|Oy]], and [[Jake Chambers]]. Roland's previous ''ka-tet'' included himself, [[Cuthbert Allgood]], [[Jamie De Curry]], and [[Alain Johns]].

=== References in other works by King ===
{{wiktionary|ka}}
''Ka'' is mentioned in some of King's other books, including ''[[Hearts in Atlantis]]'', ''[[Desperation (novel)|Desperation]]'' and ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]''. The characters James Eric Gardener in ''[[The Tommyknockers]]'' and Rosie McClendon in ''[[Rose Madder (novel)|Rose Madder]]'' also ponder about ''ka''. It is mentioned in ''[[The Stand]]'' by Judge Farris when he observes a crow outside his window that he believes is [[Randall Flagg]] shortly before he is killed by Flagg's men. However, in this context it appears that "ka" refers to the [[Egypt]]ian word for life force.

The ''ka-tet'' concept has been frequently used by King, even in books that do not use the terms ''ka'' or ''ka-tet'', such as ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', ''[[The Stand]]'', ''[[Desperation (novel)|Desperation]]'', ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]'', ''[[Dreamcatcher (novel)|Dreamcatcher]]'', and ''[[Duma Key]]''. This may be compared to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s "[[karass]]".

== The Random and the Purpose ==
{{quote|''The Random and the Purpose are like the red and the black squares on a checker board, defining each other by contrast.''|Lachesis}}

The Random and the Purpose are concepts elaborating the "grammar" of All-World introduced in ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]''. The Purpose and the Random are driving forces on the different levels (worlds or realities) the Dark Tower connects. There are even stronger forms like the Higher Purpose and the Higher Random. It is not totally clear whether these higher forms are multiple individual beings sharing a common aim, or if they are underlying forces not bound to personal forms. Both Purpose and Random have so-called agents, middlemen between ordinary human beings ("Short-Timers") and the god-like All-Timers. Clotho and Lachesis are agents of the Purpose, while Atropos is an agent of the Random. Central is the idea that Purpose and Random need to be in balance.

=== The Higher Random and the Higher Purpose ===
For each field exist higher beings which seem to be god-like. While arguably Gan or Maturin would belong to the Higher Purpose , the Crimson King or It are beings of the Higher Random .

{{quote|''[...] beyond the Short-Time levels of existence and the Long-Time levels on which Lachesis, Atropos and I exist, there are yet other levels. These are inhabited by creatures we could call All-Timers, beings which are either eternal or so close to it as to make no difference. Short-Timers and Long-Timers live in overlapping spheres of existence - on connected floors of the same building, if you like - ruled by the Random and the Purpose. Above these floors, inaccessible to us but very much a part of the same tower of existence, live other beings. Some of them are marvellous and wonderful; other are hideous beyond our ability to comprehend, let alone yours. These beings might be called the Higher Purpose and the Higher Random...or perhaps there is no Random beyond a certain level; we suspect that may be the case, but we have no real way of telling. We do know that it is something from one of these higher levels that has interested itself in Ed, and that something else from up there made a countermove. That countermove is you, Ralph and Louis.''|Clotho}}

'''Musicology''' ({{ety|gre|''μουσική'' (mousikē)|music||''-λογία'' (-logia)|study of}}) is the scholarly analysis and research-based study of [[music]]. Musicology is part of the [[humanities]]. A scholar who participates in musical research is a '''musicologist'''.&lt;ref&gt;John Haines, ''Eight Centuries of Troubadours and Trouvères: The Changing Identity of Medieval Music'' (Cambridge, 2004), '55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For broad treatments, see the entry on "musicology" in [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's dictionary]], the entry on "Musikwissenschaft" in ''Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', and the classic approach of Adler (1885).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Guido (1885). Umfang, Methode und Ziel der Musikwissenschaft. Vierteljahresschrift für Musikwissenschaft, 1, 5-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[historical musicology]] (commonly termed "music history") has been the most prominent sub-discipline of musicology. In the 2010s, historical musicology is one of several large musicology sub-disciplines. Historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and [[systematic musicology]] are approximately equal in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=whatisethnomusicol|title=What is Ethnomusicology? - Society for Ethnomusicology|website=The Society for Ethnomusicology|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnomusicology is the study of music in its cultural context. Systematic musicology includes music acoustics, the science and technology of acoustical musical instruments, and the musical implications of physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and computing. [[Cognitive musicology]] is the set of phenomena surrounding the computational modeling of music. In some countries, [[music education]] is a prominent sub-field of musicology, while in others it is regarded as a distinct academic field, or one more closely affiliated with [[teacher education]], [[educational research]], and related fields. Like music education, [[music therapy]] is a specialized form of applied musicology which is sometimes considered more closely affiliated with health fields, and other times regarded as part of musicology proper.

==Parent disciplines==
The parent disciplines of musicology include:
* General [[history]]
* [[Cultural studies]]
* [[Philosophy]] (particularly [[aesthetics]] and [[semiotics]])
* [[Ethnology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]
* [[Archeology]] and [[prehistory]]
* [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]]
* [[Physiology]] and [[neuroscience]]
* [[Acoustics]] and [[psychoacoustics]]
* Computer/[[information sciences]] and [[mathematics]]

Musicology also has two central, practically oriented sub-disciplines with no parent discipline: [[performance practice]] and research (sometimes viewed as a form of [[Research#Artistic research|artistic research]]), and the [[music theory|theory]], [[musical analysis|analysis]] and composition of music. The disciplinary neighbors of musicology address other forms of [[art]], [[performance]], [[ritual]] and [[communication]], including the history and theory of the visual and plastic arts and of architecture; [[linguistics]], [[literature]] and [[theater]]; religion and [[theology]]; and sport. Musical knowledge is applied in medicine, [[education]], and [[music therapy]]—which, effectively, are parent disciplines of applied musicology.

==Subdisciplines==

===Historical musicology===
{{Main|Music history}}
[[File:Beethoven opus 101 manuscript.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Historical musicology, which was traditionally the most prominent subdiscipline of musicology, studies the history of music. Central to this study is the examination of historical [[sheet music|scores]], such as this original manuscript sketch by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] for [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 28]], Movement IV, ''Geschwind, doch nicht zu sehr und mit Entschlossenheit'' ([[Tempo|Allegro]]), in his own handwriting. The piece was completed in 1816.]]
'''Music history''' or '''historical musicology''' is concerned with the composition, performance, reception, and criticism of [[music]] over [[time]]. Historical studies of music are for example concerned with a composer's life and works, the developments of styles and genres, ''e.g.'', baroque concertos, the social function of music for a particular group of people, ''e.g.'', court music, or modes of performance at a particular place and time, ''e.g.'', Johann Sebastian Bach's choir in Leipzig. Like the comparable field of [[art history]], different branches and schools of historical musicology emphasize different types of musical works and approaches to music.  There are also national differences in various definitions of historical musicology.  In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music, ''e.g.'', the history of [[Music of India|Indian music]] or the history of [[Rock music|rock]]. In practice, these research topics are more often considered within [[ethnomusicology]] (see below) and "historical musicology" is typically assumed to imply Western Art music of the European tradition.

The methods of historical musicology include source studies (especially [[manuscript]] studies), [[Palaeography|paleography]], [[philology]] (especially [[textual criticism]]), style criticism, historiography (the choice of [[historical method]]), musical analysis (analysis of music to find "inner coherence"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beard, David | author2=Gloag, Kenneth | title=Musicology: The Key Concepts | year=2005 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-31692-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iconography]]. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of [[music theory]]. Music historians create a number of written products, ranging from journal articles describing their current research, new editions of musical works, [[Biography|biographies]] of composers and other musicians, book-length studies or university textbook chapters or entire textbooks. Music historians may examine issues in a close focus, as in the case of scholars who examine the relationship between [[word]]s and music for a given composer's [[art song]]s. On the other hand, some scholars take a broader view, and assess the place of a given type of music, such as the [[symphony]] in [[society]] using techniques drawn from other fields, such as economics, sociology, or philosophy.

''[[New musicology]]'' is a term applied since the late 1980s to a wide body of work emphasizing [[cultural studies|cultural study]], analysis, and criticism of music. Such work may be based on [[Feminism|feminist]], [[gender studies]], [[queer theory]], or [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] theory, or the work of [[Theodor W. Adorno]]. Although New Musicology emerged from within historical musicology, the emphasis on cultural study within the Western art music tradition places New Musicology at the junction between historical, ethnological and sociological research in music.

New musicology was a reaction against traditional historical musicology, which according to [[Susan McClary]], "fastidiously declares issues of musical signification off-limits to those engaged in legitimate scholarship." [[Charles Rosen]], however, retorts that McClary, "sets up, like so many of the 'new musicologists', a [[straw man]] to knock down, the [[dogma]] that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance."&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Rosen | first=Charles | chapter=The New Musicology&lt;!--pp.&amp;nbsp;255–272.--&gt; | title=Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-674-00684-3 | page=264}} "(I doubt that anyone, except perhaps the nineteenth-century critic Hanslick, has ever really believed that, although some musicians have been goaded into proclaiming it by the sillier interpretations of music with which we are often assailed.)"&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many musicologists no longer distinguish between musicology and new musicology, since many of the scholarly concerns once associated with new musicology have now become mainstream, and they feel the term "new" no longer applies.

===Ethnomusicology===
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}

[[Ethnomusicology]], formerly '''comparative musicology''', is the study of [[music]] in its [[cultural]] context.  It is often considered the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. [[Jeff Todd Titon]] has called it the study of "people making music". Although it is most often concerned with the study of non-[[Western world|Western]] musics, it also includes the study of Western music from an anthropological or sociological perspective, [[cultural studies]] and [[sociology]] as well as other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Some ethnomusicologists primarily conduct historical studies,&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David, Eds., (2014). ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology'' Lanham, MD: Rowman&amp;Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; but the majority are involved in long-term participant observation, or combine ethnographic and historical approaches in their fieldwork. Therefore, ethnomusiological scholarship can be characterized as featuring a substantial, intensive fieldwork component, often involving long-term residence within the community studied.
Closely related to ethnomusiology is the emerging branch of [[sociomusicology]]. For instance, Ko (2011) proposed the hypothesis of "Biliterate and Trimusical" in Hong Kong sociomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;Ko, C. K. S. (2011). ''An analysis of sociomusicology, its issues; and the music and society in Hong Kong''. Hong Kong: Ko Ka Shing. {{ISBN|978-9-881-58021-4}}. This book has been selected for inclusion in the Association for Chinese Music Research Bibliography in 2012, see [http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/23174].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music studies===
 &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Popular musicology]] --&gt;

Popular music studies, known, "misleadingly,"&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Allan, ed. (2003). ''Analyzing Popular Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;2. {{ISBN|978-0-521-77120-7}}. p.&amp;nbsp;2n2 reads: "'Popular musicology' should be read as the musicological investigation of popular music, rather than the accessible investigation of music!"&lt;/ref&gt; as ''popular musicology'', emerged in the 1980s as an increasing number of musicologists, ethnomusicologists, and other varieties of historians of American and European culture began to write about popular musics past and present. The first journal focusing on popular music studies was [https://web.archive.org/web/20080411140144/http://www.cambridge.org/journals/journal_catalogue.asp?mnemonic=pmu Popular Music], which began publication in 1981. The same year an academic society solely devoted to the topic was formed, the [http://www.iaspm.net/ International Association for the Study of Popular Music]. The Association's founding was partly motivated by the interdisciplinary agenda of popular musicology though the group has been characterized by a polarized 'musicological' and 'sociological' approach also typical of popular musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music theory''' is a field of study that describes the elements of [[music]] and includes the development and application of methods for composing and for analyzing music through both [[musical notation|notation]] and, on occasion, musical sound itself.  Broadly, theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music ([[Benjamin Boretz|Boretz]], 1995).  A person who studies or practices music theory is a '''music theorist'''.

Some music theorists attempt to explain the techniques composers use by establishing rules and patterns.  Others model the experience of listening to or performing music.  Though extremely diverse in their interests and commitments, many Western music theorists are united in their belief that the acts of composing, performing, and listening to music may be explicated to a high degree of detail (this, as opposed to a conception of musical expression as fundamentally ineffable except in musical sounds). Generally, works of music theory are both descriptive and prescriptive, attempting both to define practice and to influence later practice.  Thus, music theory generally lags behind practice but also points towards future exploration, composition, and performance.

Musicians study music theory to understand the structural relationships in the (nearly always notated) music. Composers study music theory to understand how to produce effects and structure their own works.  Composers may study music theory to guide their [[precompositional]] and compositional decisions.  Broadly speaking, music theory in the Western tradition focuses on [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]], and then uses these to explain large scale structure and the creation of [[melody]].

===Music psychology===
{{Main|Music psychology|Cognitive musicology|Cognitive neuroscience of music|Music therapy}}

Music psychology applies the content and methods of all subdisciplines of [[psychology]] ([[perception]], [[cognition]], [[motivation]], etc.) to understand how music is created, perceived, responded to, and incorporated into individuals' and societies' daily lives.&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |pages=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary branches include [[cognitive musicology]], which emphasizes the use of computational models for human musical abilities and cognition, and the [[cognitive neuroscience of music]], which studies the way that music perception and production manifests in the brain using the methodologies of [[cognitive neuroscience]]. While aspects of the field can be highly theoretical, much of modern music psychology seeks to optimize the practices and professions of music performance, composition, education, and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ockelford |first=Adam |chapter=Beyond music psychology |editor1-last=Hallam |editor1-first=Susan |editor2-last=Cross |editor2-first=Ian |editor3-last=Thaut |editor3-first=Michael |title=The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology |date=2009 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929845-7 |page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance practice and research===
{{Main|Authentic performance}}

Performance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Although previously confined to early music, recent research in performance practice has embraced questions such as how the early history of recording affected the use of [[vibrato]] in classical music, or instruments in [[Klezmer]].

Within the rubric of musicology, performance practice tends to emphasize the collection and synthesis of evidence about how music should be performed.  The important other side, learning how to sing authentically or perform a historical instrument is usually part of [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] or other performance training.  However, many top researchers in performance practice are also excellent musicians.

Music performance research (or music performance science) is strongly associated with music psychology. It aims to document and explain the psychological, physiological, sociological and cultural details of how music is actually performed (rather than how it should be performed). The approach to research tends to be systematic and empirical, and to involve the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings of music performance research can often be applied in [[music education]].

==Education and careers==
[[File:Satchmofest07JackStewartSpeaks.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Music historian Jack Stewart lectures at a conference.]]
Musicologists in tenure track professor positions typically hold a [[Ph.D]] in musicology. In the 1960s and 1970s, some musicologists obtained [[professor]] positions with an [[M.A.]] as their highest degree, but in the 2010s, the Ph.D is the [[terminal degree|standard minimum credential]] for [[tenure track]] professor positions. As part of their initial training, musicologists typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[B.A.]] in music (or a related field such as history) and in many cases an [[M.A.]] in musicology. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for musicology Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and an M.A. in psychology). In music education, individuals may hold an [[M.Ed]] and an [[Ed.D]].

Most musicologists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure track professor positions is very competitive. Entry-level applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree and applicants to more senior professor positions must have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding musicologists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a musicologist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: she teaches undergraduate and/or graduate classes in her area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music History), conducts research in her area of expertise, publishes articles about her research in peer-reviewed journals, authors book chapters, books or textbooks, travels to conferences to give talks on her research and learn about research in her field, and, if her program includes a [[graduate school]], supervises M.A. and Ph.D students and gives them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some musicology professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.

==Role of women==
[[File:Rosetta Reitz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rosetta Reitz]] (1924–2008) was an American [[jazz]] historian who established a record label producing 18 albums of the music of the early women of jazz and the blues.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008. Accessed 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The vast majority of major musicologists and music historians from past generations have been men, as in the 19th century and early 20th century; women's involvement in teaching music was mainly in [[Women in music education|elementary and secondary music teaching]].&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015) When looking beyond bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

The '''Niğde Stele''' is a [[Neo-Hittite]] monument from the modern Turkish city of [[Niğde]], which dates from the end of the 8th century BC.

== Discovery ==
[[File:NigdeMuseumSteleNigde4.jpg|thumb|left|Detail]]
[[File:NigdeMuseumSteleNigde3.jpg|thumb|Hieroglyphic inscription]]
The stele was found on 27 September 1975 near the [[Citadel of Niğde]] in the Çelebi Hüsamettin Bey Mosque (now Dışarı Camii), where it was lying carved side down in a doorway as a lintel stone.&lt;ref name="John David Hawkins, Halet Çambel"&gt;{{cite book| author  = John David Hawkins, Halet Çambel | title= Corpus of hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions. | ISBN = 311010864-X | page= 527 }}{{Google books|kl4s-G2b3p0C |Corpus of hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions|527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is displayed in the [[Niğde Archaeological Museum]] with inventory number 22.1.75.

== Description ==
The black basalt stele is 2.18 metres high and about a metre wide and belongs to a type which developed in the 10th century BC. It depicts the weather god [[Tarhunzas]], holding an axe and a thunderbolt in his raised hands. Vines sprout from the ground to his left and grain to the right, similar to the [[İvriz relief]]. A very similar depiction of the same god appears on the [[Gökbez relief|relief]] in the village of [[Gökbez, Bor|Gökbez]], some 22&amp;nbsp;km to the south. The figure is depicted with clothing, hair and beard of the [[Assyrian art|Assyrian style]]. The winged [[solar disk]], a traditional symbol of the ruler, hovers over his head.

On the right edge of the stone block is an inscription in [[Luwian hieroglyphs]]. On it the author, Muwaharanis, writes that he had the stele erected in honour of Tarhunzas and identifies himself as a king and son of king [[Warpalawas]]. [[John David Hawkins]] gives the following translation:

''This Tarhunzas Muwaharanis [ma]de (?), the Hero, the King, loved by Tarhunzas (and) the gods, the son of Warpalawas, the Ruler, the Hero.''&lt;ref name="John David Hawkins, Halet Çambel"/&gt;

Muwaharanis was the successor of his father Warpalawas on the throne of the late Luwian kingdom of [[Tuwana]], a successor state of the Hittite {{Interlanguage link multi|Tuwanuwa|de}}, in the southern part of the modern [[Niğde Province]]. Since it is known that Warpalawas was reigning in 709 BC, the relief must date some time after that year. Thus the stele is the latest known and datable example such a relief and possibly the latest known Luwian inscription - only the [[Karatepe Bilingual]] might be later.

'''Núria Perpinyà Filella''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈnuɾiə pəɾpiˈɲa fiˈleʎə}}; born 1961) is a Spanish novelist, a playwright and an essayist who works as a professor at the University of [[Lleida]] in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Her novels deal with unusual topics and are characterized by their intellectual irony, formal rigor and experimentalism. In her books, she defends the philosophy of [[Perspectivism]] and reflects on the fact that the phenomena have multiple interpretations. Her creative work is written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], but most of the essays are published in Spanish or in English.

==Biography==

Núria Perpinyà Filella was born in [[Lleida, Spain]], May 25, 1961 and lived in this town until she finished her degree in Catalan Studies in 1984. She moved to Cáceres, then to London, Madrid and Barcelona. Despite her changes of residence, she worked as a professor at the University of Lleida. First, she taught [[Catalan literature]] and then [[literary theory]] and [[comparative literature]]. In 1986, at the age of 25, she published her first book: an essay about a Catalan realist poet from the 1960s, [[Gabriel Ferrater]], written in collaboration with Xavier Macià, under the title ''The poetry of Gabriel Ferrater''. This work won the Catalan Essay Prize Josep Vallverdú. In 1989, Perpinyà received the Extraordinary Prize for her PhD thesis from the [[University of Barcelona]] for research on Ferrater. She became one of his main specialists. In 1998, she published her first novel, ''[[A Good Mistake]]'', where was already shown "the complexity and the elaboration that will characterize the rest of her novels”.&lt;ref&gt;Ramon Vidal, Abel, Web Associació Escriptors en Llengua Catalana (AELC) http://www.escriptors.cat/autors/perpinyan&lt;/ref&gt; In A ''[[House to Compose]]'' (2001), Perpinyà developed a new genre half way between a story and a novel. ''[[Mistana]]'' (2005), much more fantastic, was awarded a National Critics Prize. In ''[[The Privileged]]'' (2007), she opted, once more, for a renovation of literary genres with a dramatic novel. In the year 2010, she launched her first theatre play, ''[[The Calligraphers]]''. After her [[Alpinist]] novel ''[[To the vertigo]]'' (2013), Perpinya publishes ''And, suddenly, Paradise'' (2018), an experimental novel on the [[addiction]] to [[Internet]]. 

==Style and subjects==

The work of Núria Perpinyà is a mixture of intellectual reflections and [[irony]]. Her style has been labelled as “a magmatic writing style”,&lt;ref&gt;Bou, Enric, «Para supervivientes», ''El Periódico'', 14-VII-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been characterized by “a control of the composition, a linguistic precision and originality of the actions”.&lt;ref&gt;Pagès, Vicenç, «Temàtica helicoïdal», ''Presència'', 14-III-98.&lt;/ref&gt; In each of her books, Perpinyà has challenged herself with different experiments: ''A Good Mistake'' is a thriller based on readers’ false suppositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.goucher.edu/eng215/reader_response_terms.htm "Reader-Response Criticism Terms and Principles"] goucher.edu&lt;/ref&gt; In ''A House to compose'', she explored a new literary genre: a “fragmented novel” which, even though belonging to a Composite Novel or [[Short story cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Maggie, Morris, Ann, ''The composite novel. The Short Story Cycle in Transition'', New York: Twayne, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; it provided the novelty of a chain of stories that they turned over into chapters of a novel. This fusion of genres reappeared in ''The Privileged'' where the narrative and the dramatic style cohabited side by side.

Regarding the themes, Perpinyà has dedicated each book to a concrete topic. ''A Good Mistake'' is a love story in the world of science; ''A House to Compose'' recreates the world of music and [[architecture]]; ''The Privileged'' is about art and museums; ''The Calligraphers'' is about the university; and ''Mistana'' deals with the madness. Her novel, ''To the Vertigo'', the most romantic and pictorial one, is another important twist in her trajectory. She substituted – at least apparently – her intellectual world for the sport.
Her novel and her play on the Internet are an online collective writing experiment. These books are written as a [[collage]] of [[Twitter]] sentences.

==Novels==

The first book of fiction by Perpinyà, ''Un bon error'' (''A Good Mistake'') related the life of a young man who moved to laboratory in [[London]] and fell in love with a black scientist. The protagonist, Joan Xammar, must overcome two obstacles: the one of the gender and the one of race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Núria|last=Perpinyà|author-link=Núria Perpinyà|archiveurl=http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=172&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2014-08-27|url=http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=172&amp;lang=en|title=A Good Mistake|accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A House to Compose'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=170&amp;lang=en A House to Compose]&lt;/ref&gt; is a story about a [[Pianist]] who was looking for a flat. In this novel about music, Perpinyà “dares to weave a multi-faceted plot”, and “while the protagonist passes through different kinds of housing – a garret, a duplex, an attic – (…) there is a kind of a musical whirlwind in her head”.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Bustos, Ernesto, «Nuevo Talento FNAC 2002» http://www.clubcultura.com/nuevotalento/nuevo talento.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The book had also an unusual structure: chained stories that ended up merging into a novel. The plot was the ''quête'' of the protagonist, Olivia Kesler, who was “a misanthrope of her art and a female [[Odysseus]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Miquel, Dolors, Entrevista a La Verge Peluda, ''1 i mig'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is a crossword of genres and worlds: music, architecture and literature. ''A House to Compose'' is a harsh but comical critic to the architectonic dictatorship and suggested a romantic opposition between the artist and the society. The composer Olivia Kesler did not find her creative space in a society that was architectonically hostile to her.

In the third novel by Perpinyà, ''Mistana'' (National Critics Prize 2005),&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=167&amp;lang=en Mistana]&lt;/ref&gt; the realism was abandoned and the author opted for a fantastic style. The book narrated a story about a meteorologist with mental disorders who fell into misfortune when he arrived at a phantasmal town called Mistana with an everlasting [[Fog]], inhabited by eccentric characters. An extreme climatology that evoked her home town, Lleida. The novel was “a tragedy about madness written in crescendo rhythm of delirious verses in prose” that has been labelled as “vertiginous and breathtaking” &lt;ref&gt;Guillamon, Julià. «Vértigo en la niebla», ''La Vanguardia'', 6-07-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a “hypnotic and radical novel”.&lt;ref&gt;Castells, Ada, «Núria Perpinyà novel·la l'absurd enmig de la boira», ''Avui'', 23-VII-2005; Isern, Joan Josep, «Una novel.la hipnòtica i radical», ''Avui'', 12-X-05.&lt;/ref&gt; As Maria Dasca said, Mistana was “an unbridled fiction, tragic and comic at the same time” with a philosophical fog where “the things lose appearances and a man does not know who he is anymore”.&lt;ref&gt;Dasca, Maria, «Mistana / Guia de Lectura», ''Revista de Catalunya'', 210, novembre 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 ''To the Vertigo'' appeared, a novel about love between mountaineers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=98&amp;lang=en To the Vertigo]&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonists were obsessive idealists isolated from the society. The plot revolved around loves of a solitary mountain climber, Irena Besikova. The novel suggested two important discussions: the one of passion and [[Feminism]]. The epistolary style developed until it became an adventure novel that, in the last chapters, adopted an unexpected metaliterary dimension. ''To the Vertigo'' was critically acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Juanico, Núria, “El vertigen de Irena Besikova”, ''Núvol'', 15-X-2013; Ruiz  Guillamon, Julià, “Duelo en la cima”, ''La Vanguardia'', 4-XII-2013; Nopca, Jordi, “Núria Perpinyà reescriu el Romanticisme”, ''Ara'', 5-X-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Perpinyà publishes the experimental novel ''And, suddenly, Paradise'' on [[Internet Addiction Disorder]]. The action takes place in a psychiatric. The work raises a debate about the advantages and disadvantages of the network, as well as discussing other behavioral disorders such as [[anorexia nervosa]].

==Theatre==

In 2007, ''The Privileged'' appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=164&amp;lang=en The Privileged]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a comical dramatic novel in which the author thought about art, adopting a point of view of the guards in a [[Museum]]. The story narrated a restructuring of an old-fashioned museum into an [[Avant-garde]] museum, the sceptical attitudes of the guards towards the modern art, and the labour conflicts. The plot passed through vicissitudes of the main character, Mr. Serivà, a genuine, tragic and anti-heroic guard. The irony of the book is addressed to the ignorant audience and the art as a business and political platform.&lt;ref&gt;Jaruchik, Esdres, «Rient de l'art i de qui el vetlla», ''Benzina'', octubre 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As Ponç Puigdevall said, the novel proofed the effort of the author “to discover new literary territories where the accuracy does not contradict the entertainment”.&lt;ref&gt;Puigdevall, Ponç, «Horrors silenciosos», ''El País'', 6-IX-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Calligraphers'' (2010) is a tragicomedy about [[Philosophy of Education]] in Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=160&amp;lang=en The Calligraphers]&lt;/ref&gt; The plot revolved around the closure of a University Department of Ancient [[Calligraphy]] and its substitution for a new degree in criminal calligraphic studies. This modernization of the University provoked tensions between the professors and it revealed jealousy and revenges. The play was opened in Lleida, at Escorxador Theatre, December 15, 2010, under the direction of Óscar Sánchez and it was performed by Imma Colomer, Pep Planas, Núria Casado and Ferran Farré.

''The Calligraphers'' is the staging of her essay ''More Than a Machine''. Both books are about [[education]].

This twinning between [[genres]] occurs again in 2018 where the same story about the [[internet]] appears in a theatrical version (''The Vice'') and in a novelistic version (''And, suddenly, Paradise'').

==Essay: a humanistic relativism==

Among Perpinyà’s academic researches, it is worth to mention the studies on a Catalan poet of the sixties, [[Gabriel Ferrater]], a friend of [[Gil de Biedma]] and [[Carlos Barral]]. An atypical intellectual who had an important influence on the following generations similar to [[Robert Graves]], [[Robert Frost]] or [[W.H. Auden]]. In her study ''[[Gabriel Ferrater: Reception and Contradiction]]'' (1997), Perpinyà analyzed the myth of Ferrater and did a [[deconstruction]] of the Catalan criticism. A polemic book “dedicated to all the sceptical readers who realize that, in the literary criticism, nothing completely innocent is ever said”.&lt;ref&gt;Alonso, H., «Recepció, contradicció i biografia: més sobre Ferrater», ''Llengua i Literatura'', 10, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perpinyà reappeared in 2008 with “a demythologizing essay”.&lt;ref&gt;Rojo, José Andrés, «Ulises, el primer turista sexual», ''El País'', 18-II-08.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Crypts of Criticism: Twenty Readings of The Odyssey]]''; this book offered a wide view on different schools of [[Literary Theory]]. Written in “a casual style”,&lt;ref&gt;Villanueva, Darío, «Las criptas de la crítica. 20 interpretaciones de la Odisea», ''El Mundo'', 17-IV-08.&lt;/ref&gt; this essay particularly exemplified the theory with examples: twenty different interpretations about the Greek masterpiece.

The defense of humanistic [[Relativism]] can also be observed in her novels in which a kaleidoscope of attitudes related to a particular topic often appeared. In 2010, Perpinyà won an international essay prize&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigloxxieditores.com.mx/index.php?main_page=page_3 International essay]&lt;/ref&gt; for 21st-century editorial of Mexico for her work ''[[More than a Machine]]''. This essay is about education that extended from the [[Age of Enlightenment]] to the present days, and it pleaded for a creative learning against a routine one.

In 2014, Perpinya published her essay on [[Romanticism]]: "Ruins, Nostalgia and Ugliness" (2014)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/buch/isbn/3794 Ruins, Nostalgia and Ugliness]&lt;/ref&gt; which analyzes the Romantic interest in the [[Middle Ages]], from the eighteenth century to the successful series [[Game of Thrones|''Game of Thrones'']]. Also, one of the theses of the book is considered Romantic, [[Ruins]]'s pictures as a precedent of [[Avant-garde]]'s [[Ugliness]].

[[File:Ruins, Nostalgia &amp; Ugliness.jpg|300px|thumb|Ruins, Nostalgia &amp; Ugliness|alt=Ruins, Nostalgia &amp; Ugliness.jpg]]

In 2018, appears her essay on the Catalan [[Avant-garde]] and [[Experimental Theatre]], ''The Broken Chair''. The book analyzes the hundred years of Catalan, Russian, European Avant-garde Theatre and [[Theatre of the Absurd]] from the beginning of twentieth century to the present. It deals with [[scenography]], politics and [[dramaturgy]] topics.

A '''registrar (museum)''' is responsible for implementing policies and procedures that relate to [[collections care|caring for collections]] of [[cultural institutions]] like [[archives]], [[libraries]], and [[museums]].  These policies are found in the museum's collections policy, the guiding tenet of the museum explaining why the institution is in operation, dictating the museum's professional standards regarding the objects left in its care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collections Management |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-11283-4 |editor=Fahy, A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Registrars focus on sections that include acquisitions, loans, exhibitions, deaccessions, storage, packing and shipping, security of objects in transit, insurance policies, and risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Registrar|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/office-of-the-director/office-of-the-registrar|work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate= April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[collections care]] professional, they work with [[collection manager]]s, [[conservator-restorer|conservators]], and [[curators]] to balance public access to objects with the conditions needed to maintain preservation.   Focusing on documentation, registrars are responsible for developing and maintaining records management systems, with individual files for each object in the collection.  Smaller and mid-sized institutions may combine the role of registrar with that of collections manager, while large institutions often have multiple registrars, each overseeing a different curatorial department.

==Responsibilities and duties==
The role of registrar was first defined in the early 1900s, and while the job description has not changed appreciably over time, the responsibilities have evolved with technology and increasing global awareness.   Successful registrars deftly manage many projects at once, maintain calm focus, and diligent attention to detail. Collaborating with other departments and community associations is key.&lt;ref&gt;Schlatter, Elizabeth (2008)Museum Careers: A Practical Guide for Students and Novices. Left Coast Press, California. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A selection of the most critical responsibilities include: 
*'''Documentation''':  From the position's creation, registrars are most concerned with documentation and record keeping.  This documentation includes information about an object's condition, its [[Accession number (library science)|accession number]] (or identification number, depending on its status at the museum), provenance, materials, and all of its movement within the museum or out on loan.  Paper registers have been replaced by Collection Management Software, and this data is stored in multiple locations as a safeguard.   
*'''Acquisitions''':  When an object arrives at the museum for the first time as a prospective addition to the collection, a registrar immediately begins the documentation and tracking process by assigning a temporary [[Accession number (library science)|identification number]] and assembling records that include the object's condition, date of arrival, the reason for its arrival at the museum, and a photograph documenting its physical appearance.  This information follows the object through the acquisition process, tracking its movements.  If the museum decides to accept the object, the registrar will then update the record, assigning a permanent [[Accession number (library science)|accession number]] to the object.  The registrar also makes recommendations to the Collections Committee.  Using the museum's Collections Management Policy, the registrar assesses whether or not the object fits the collection, determines whether the museum has the necessary resources to properly care for the object, and ascertains that [[provenance]] can be established to protect the museum from potential litigation.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Museum Registration Methods |year=2010 |publisher=The AAM Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-933253-15-2 |edition=5th |editor=Buck, R. |editor2=Gilmore, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Loans''':  Objects are loaned between [[museums]] for a variety of reasons, typically for special exhibitions.  As with acquisitions, the registrar assigns a temporary [[Accession number (library science)|identification number]] to objects on loan to the museum, documents their condition, and creates a file to follow the object's movement while it is in the museum.  Registrars are also present at the loading dock upon arrival to supervise the unloading, condition of packing material, and ensure that the objects are handled properly.  In the case of outgoing loans, the registrar documents which objects are leaving the museum and either carries out or oversees their packing for shipment, and loading into the shipping vehicle.
*'''Exhibitions''':  Working together with [[curators]] and [[collection manager]]s, the registrar helps select objects for display or loan.  This means occasionally saying 'no' to colleagues to safeguard objects for the future.  If an object will not withstand the stresses of travel and/or an exhibition, it is the registrar's duty to make that clear and stand behind their decision.  Once objects are selected and agreed upon, the registrar updates the records to reflect the display location.&lt;ref name="MRM5"/&gt; 
*'''Deaccessions''':  Registrars are also involved in carrying out [[wikt:deaccession|deaccessions]].  Historically, museums did not follow strict guidelines for accepting donations.  As a result, objects that have little or nothing to do with the institution's mission statement sit in storage until they can be deaccessioned, or removed from the museum's collection.  Storage space and resources are valuable, and therefore it does not make sense to maintain objects that the museum cannot display.  Registrars assess these objects, make recommendations, and verify that all legal conditions are met to deaccession the object, and document every step of the process.  Since this process can be controversial, it is critical that every step, as described by the museum's policy, are carried out diligently and openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deaccessioning Activity|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/deaccessioning-activity.pdf?sfvrsn=2|work=American Association of Museums|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Packing and Shipping''':  When objects are sent out of the [[museum]], either being returned to the institution that provided them or as an outgoing loan to another museum, the registrar updates the registration system to documents which objects are leaving the museum.  The Condition report is updated to reflect the pre-shipping state of the object, and the registrar either carries out or oversees the packing for shipment, and loading into the shipping vehicle.
*'''Security in Transit''':  Most, if not all, objects on outgoing loan are accompanied by a courier.  The registrar selects and trains this individual, and, in the case of extremely important objects, the registrar may accompany the shipment, acting as a [[courier]] themselves.
*'''Risk Management''':  A main task for a registrar is also determining risk factors to a collection and mitigating them. Risk factors include vandalism, theft, pests, emergencies, and natural disasters. It is the responsibility of the registrar to develop and implement strategies to minimize these risks, such as [[integrated pest management]], guards, and secure display cases.  Additionally registrars oversee the development and implementation of a [[Emergency response (museum)|disaster management policy]] to safeguard both staff and collections objects in case of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Disaster Preparedness in Museums|url=http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Guidelines/guidelinesdisasters_eng.pdf|work=International Council of Museums|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
A registrar should show strength and skill when handling objects. From physically moving an object to being able to identify any stress points or cultural significance, a registrar must take the initiative to study the museum's collection. They must be calm, flexible, resourceful, and focus on the details.  Registrars can be described as academic generalists, who, over time, can develop specializations.&lt;ref name =MRM5/&gt;

Working knowledge of American Association of Museum's Code of Ethics as well as the Collecting Guidelines for Museums should be required to be successful and respectful of any cultural or intrinsic objects. A registrar should be familiar with the AAM Guide to Provenance Research, as well as the Nazi-Era Provenance Internet Portal. A registrar should also be familiar with Digital Fair Use and the US Indemnity Program. In addition, a registrar should understand repatriation processes, both nationally and internationally.

As a member of a unique institution, a registrar must possess the ability to be successful in a team-oriented environment. Teaching qualities and customer service skills are helpful when trying to relay the importance of a collection's protection or access to a different department within the museum.

==Education and training==
Individuals looking to begin a career in the Collections Management field generally possess a bachelor's degree in history, art history, fine arts, or a field related to museum interests.  Many institutions now require a graduate education in museum studies or field relating to the museum's collections in this competitive job market.  Candidates are also expected to have hands-on experience in museum collection database management, object packing and handling, digitization, collections cataloging, and accession and loan procedures.

Internships and volunteer work in cultural institutions are excellent ways to gain experience and make connections with museum professionals.  By taking initiative to acquire experience, paid or unpaid, a candidate will also develop their organizational skills, familiarity with procedure, and the inherent flexibility needed to succeed as a registrar.

==Related positions==
Smaller museums tend to combine the role of registrar with that of [[collection manager]], in which case one person (or team) would oversee the traditional responsibilities of a registrar with the addition of a more hands-on role in [[collections care]].  Added duties include:  overseeing and maintaining environmental conditions in storage and exhibition facilities, taking a more active role in conditions assessments and contacting [[conservator-restorer|conservators]] directly, managing physical storage needs, and taking inventory of the collection at regular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Management|url=https://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation-and-collections-care/collections-management|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts Boston|accessdate=April 20, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416030603/http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation-and-collections-care/collections-management|archivedate=April 16, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Riot grrrl''' is an [[underground music|underground]] [[feminist]] [[punk subculture|punk]] movement that began  in the early 1990s in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1080646/its-riot-grrrl-day-in-boston-here-are-songs-to-rock-out-to-at-work |title=It's Riot Grrrl Day in Boston: 13 Songs to rock out to at work |publisher=Sheknows.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (particularly [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the greater [[Pacific Northwest]].

It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of [[indie rock]], with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Leonard. "Riot grrrl." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 20 Jul. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as [[rape]], [[domestic abuse]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[racism]], [[patriarchy]], and female [[empowerment]]. Primary bands associated with the movement include [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Skinned Teen]], [[Emily's Sassy Lime]] and [[Sleater-Kinney]], as well as [[queercore]] groups like [[Team Dresch]] and [[The Third Sex (band)|The Third Sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223012118/http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13|archivedate=February 23, 2009|title=List of Riot Girl Bands |publisher=Hot-topic.org |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqSn0jMJAQC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=Dickless%20riot&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=Dickless&amp;f=false|author=Marisa Meltzer|page=42|title=Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429933285|date=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a [[Indie music scenes|music scene]] and [[genre]], riot grrrl is a subculture involving a [[DIY ethic]], [[zine]]s, art, political action, and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = W.W.

==Origins==

During the late 1970s and early and mid-1980s there were a number of groundbreaking female [[punk music|punk]] and [[rock music|rock]] musicians who later influenced the riot grrrl ethos. These included [[Siouxsie Sioux]], [[Poly Styrene]], [[The Slits]], [[Au Pairs (band)|Au Pairs]], [[The Raincoats]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[The Runaways]]/[[Joan Jett]], [[The B-52's]], [[LiLiPUT]], [[Lydia Lunch]], [[Exene Cervenka]], [[Kim Gordon]], [[Ut (band)|Ut]], [[Neo Boys]], [[Bush Tetras]], [[Y Pants]], [[ESG (band)|ESG]], [[Chalk Circle (American band)|Chalk Circle]], [[Fifth Column (band)|Fifth Column]], [[Frightwig]], [[X-Ray Spex]], [[Scrawl]], and [[Anti-Scrunti Faction]].&lt;ref name="Rabin" /&gt; The 1980s also featured a number of female [[folk singer]]s from New York whose lyrics were realistic and socio-political, but also personally intimate.&lt;ref name="Rabin"&gt;R. Sabin, ''Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk'', (Routledge, 1999), {{ISBN|0415170303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1980s in [[Vancouver]] the influential [[Mecca Normal]] fronted by poet [[Jean Smith]] formed, followed by Sugar Baby Doll in San Francisco whose members would all wind up in hardcore female bands.&lt;ref name="Donnell" /&gt; In 1987, the magazine ''[[Sassy (magazine)|Sassy]]'' premiered and dealt with tough subjects that conventional magazines aimed at teenage girls did not.&lt;ref name="Donnell" /&gt; An article "Women, sex and rock and roll" published by ''Puncture, edited by Katherine Spielmann,'' in 1989 became the first [[manifesto]] of the movement.&lt;ref name="Donnell"&gt;E. McDonnell, ''Rock She Wrote'' (Cooper Square Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0815410182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, a radio program hosted by [[Lois Maffeo]] entitled ''Your Dream Girl'' aimed at angry young women debuted on [[Olympia, Washington]] radio station [[KAOS (FM)|KAOS]].&lt;ref name="Donnell" /&gt;

During the early 1990s the [[Seattle]]/[[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] Washington area had a sophisticated [[do it yourself]] infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Rabin" /&gt; Young women involved in [[underground music]] scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock [[fanzines]] and forming [[garage band]]s. The political model of [[collage]]-based, [[photocopied]] [[handbill]]s and booklets was already used by the [[Punk subculture|punk movement]] as a way to activate underground music, [[leftist]] politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Jessica|last2=Garofalo|first2=Gitana|title=Riot Grrrl: Revolutions from Within|url=http://xerxes.calstate.edu/fullerton/articles/record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-c2461-ed3d32db9732bc240071d00840bace5d4a76b6d2a5f9e623a77376ea96f07c5e3|publisher=Signs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, young women coalesced in an unorganized collective response to several women's issues, such as the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]]'s [[Right to Life]] attack on legal abortion and the Senate Judiciary Hearings into [[Anita Hill]]'s accusations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Girls to the Front|last = Marcus|first = Sara|publisher = Harper|year = 2010|isbn = 9780061806360|location = |page = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young feminist voices were heard through multiple protests, actions, and events such as the formative opening night of the [[International Pop Underground Convention]]&lt;ref name="Girls to the Front"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Sara|title=Girls to the Front: The true story of the riot grrrl revolution|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780061806360|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[L7 (band)|L7]]'s [[Rock for Choice]].

Uses and meanings of the term "riot grrrl" developed slowly over time, but its etymological origins can be traced to the actual [[Washington, D.C. riot of 1991|Mount Pleasant race riots]] in spring 1991. Bratmobile member [[Jen Smith]] (later of Rastro! and The Quails), used the phrase "girl riot" in a letter to [[Allison Wolfe]] describing the atmosphere among women in the city.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital|last = Andersen|first = Mark|publisher = Soft Skull Press|year = 2001|isbn = 1887128492|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, Wolfe and [[Molly Neuman]] collaborated with [[Kathleen Hanna]] and [[Tobi Vail]] to create a new zine and called it ''Riot Grrrl'', combining the "riot" with an oft-used phrase that first appeared in Vail's fanzine ''Jigsaw'' "Revolution Grrrl Style Now".&lt;ref name=amBk&gt;{{cite news

===Bikini Kill===

{{main article|Bikini Kill}}
Kathleen Hanna had been studying at [[The Evergreen State College]] in Olympia. She participated in a small collective [[art gallery]] called Reko Muse, which would frequently host bands like [[The Go Team]] and [[Some Velvet Sidewalk]] to play in between art exhibitions (partially just to keep the gallery running). Hanna started a band, Amy Carter (named after [[Amy Carter|the daughter of]] the [[US President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]), with fellow gallery-founders Heidi Arbogast and [[Tammy Rae Carland]].  After touring with some other projects like [[Viva Knievel (band)|Viva Knievel]], she hooked up with [[The Go Team]] drummer and [[zinester]] Tobi Vail, who had been writing of her own experiences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel completely left out of the realm of everything that is so important to me.  And I know that this is partly because punk rock is for and by boys mostly and partly because punk rock of this generation is coming of age in a time of mindless career-goal bands.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They started working together on another fanzine called ''Bikini Kill'', which, after recruiting friends [[Kathi Wilcox]] and [[Billy Karren|Billy "Boredom" Karren]], would eventually become a band.&lt;ref name=amBk/&gt;&lt;ref name=KRSbk&gt;{{cite news

===Bratmobile===

{{main article|Bratmobile}}
[[File:Allison Wolfe, Anna Oxygen &amp; Jen Smith 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Allison Wolfe]], [[Anna Oxygen]] and [[Jen Smith]] at a 2011 conference]]
Allison Wolfe met Molly Neuman at the [[University of Oregon]]. Wolfe introduced Neuman to bands such as [[Beat Happening]] and [[The Melvins]], Neuman introduced Wolfe to sociology classes and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]].

They began working on zines called ''[[Girl Germs]]'', and later ''riot grrrl'' with Tobi Vail, Kathleen Hanna and Jen Smith.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a really [[hippie]] town, and we were getting really politicized, but also really into this DIY thing, so we kinda started creating. 'Let's make our own fanzine!'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raha|first=Maria|title=Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground|year=2004|publisher=Seal Press|location=Emeryville, CA|isbn=978-1-58005-116-3|author2=Gordon, Kim }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wolfe and Neuman started frequenting shows by bands like [[Fugazi]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. In 1990, [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] called them up and asked them to play a show on [[Valentine's Day]] with Some Velvet Sidewalk and the newly formed Bikini Kill. They accepted it as a dare and played the show at Olympia's North Shore Surf club. Guitarist Erin Smith joined in March 1991.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===International Pop Underground Convention===
From August 20 – 25, 1991, [[K Records]] held an indie music festival called the [[International Pop Underground Convention]]. A promotional poster reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the corporate ogre expands its creeping influence on the minds of industrialized youth, the time has come for the International Rockers of the World to convene in celebration of our grand independence.  Hangman [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]]s, new [[mod (subculture)|mod]] rockers, sidestreet walkers, [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]-mounted dream girls, punks, [[teddy boy|ted]]s, the instigators of the Love Rock Explosion, the editors of every angry grrrl zine, the plotters of youth rebellion in every form, the midwestern librarians and Scottish [[ski]] instructors who live by night, all are setting aside August 20–25, 1991 as the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Love Rock Revolution: K Records and the rise of independent music|last = Baumgarten|first = Mark|publisher = Sasquatch Books|year = 2012|isbn = 1570618224|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An all-female bill on the first night, called "Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now!" signalled a major step in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The day the music didn't die|url = http://www.seattleweekly.com/2001-08-08/music/the-day-the-music-didn-t-die/|accessdate = 2015-05-30|last = Nelson|first = Chris|publisher = Seattle Weekly|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sells Like Teen Spirit: Music, Youth Culture, and Social Crisis|last = Moore|first = Ryan|publisher = NYU Press|year = 2009|isbn = 9780814796030|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lineup featured Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, [[Nikki McClure]], [[Lois Maffeo]], Jean Smith of Mecca Normal, [[7 Year Bitch]], and two [[side project]]s of Kathleen Hanna: the first was Suture with [[Sharon Cheslow]] of Chalk Circle (DC's first [[all-women band|all-women]] punk band) and Dug E. Bird of [[beefeater (band)|Beefeater]], the second was the Wondertwins with Tim Green of [[Nation of Ulysses]].  It was here that so many [[zinester]] people who'd only known each other from networking, mail, or talking on the phone, finally met and were brought together by an entire night of music dedicated to, for, and by women.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The convention featured other bands such as [[Unwound]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[The Fastbacks]], [[The Spinanes]], [[Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet]], [[Girl Trouble (band)|Girl Trouble]], [[The Pastels]], Kicking Giant, [[Rose Melberg]], [[seaweed (band)|Seaweed]], Kreviss, I Scream Truck, [[Scrawl]], [[Nation of Ulysses]], [[Jad Fair]], [[Thee Headcoats]], and [[Steve Fisk]], and spoken-word artist [[Juliana Luecking]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Decline and later developments ===
By the mid-nineties, riot grrrl had severely splintered.  Many within the movement felt that the mainstream media had completely misrepresented their message, and that the politically radical aspects of riot grrrl had been subverted by the likes of the [[Spice Girls]] and their "[[girl power]]" message, or co-opted by ostensibly women-centered bands (though sometimes with only one female performer per band) and festivals like [[Lilith Fair]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Of the original riot grrrl bands, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy and Huggy Bear had split in 1994, Excuse 17 and most of the UK bands had split by 1995, and Bikini Kill and Emily’s Sassy Lime released their last records in 1996. However, Team Dresch were active as late as 1998, [[The Gossip]] were active from 1999, Bratmobile reformed in 2000 and, perhaps most prolific of all, Sleater-Kinney were active - initially - from 1994 to 2006, releasing 7 albums.

Many of the women involved in riot grrrl are still active in creating politically charged music. Kathleen Hanna went on to found the electro-feminist [[post-punk]] "protest [[pop music|pop]]" group [[Le Tigre]] and later [[The Julie Ruin]], Kathi Wilcox joined The Casual Dots with [[Christina Billotte]] of Slant 6, and Tobi Vail formed Spider and the Webs. Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and [[Carrie Brownstein]] of Excuse 17 co-founded Sleater-Kinney at the tail end of the original movement, and reformed the band again in 2014 after an 8-year hiatus, while Bratmobile reunited to release two albums, before Allison Wolfe began singing with other all-women bands, Cold Cold Hearts, and [[Partyline]]. Molly Neuman went on to play with New York punk band Love Or Perish and run her own indie label called Simple Social Graces Discos, as well as co-owning [[Lookout! Records]] and managing [[The Donnas]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Some Girls (band)|Some Girls]], and [[The Locust]]. [[Kaia Wilson]] of Team Dresch and [[multimedia artist]] Tammy Rae Carland went on to form the now-defunct [[Mr. Lady Records]] which released albums by [[The Butchies]], The Need, [[Kiki and Herb]], and [[Tracy + the Plastics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Feminism and riot grrrl culture==
Riot grrrl culture is often associated with [[third wave feminism|third wave feminism]], which also grew rapidly during the same early nineties timeframe. The movement of third-wave feminism focused less on laws and the political process and more on individual identity. The movement of third-wave feminism is said to have arisen out of the realization that women are of many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions and cultural backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://beingfeministblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/todays-feminism-a-brief-look-at-third-wave-feminism/|title = Today's Feminism: A Brief Look at Third-Wave Feminism." Being Feminist|date = 16 May 2013|accessdate = 6 Dec 2015|website = |publisher = Wordpress|last = Fisher|first = J.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot grrrl movement allowed women their own space to create music and make political statements about the issues they were facing in the punk rock community and in society. They used their music and publications to express their views on issues such as patriarchy, double standards against women, rape, [[domestic abuse]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and female [[empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schilt|first1=Kristen|title=The History of Riot Grrls in Music|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/music/The-History-of-Riot-Grrls-in-Music.html|publisher=The Feminist eZine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier answers the question "What is Riot grrrl?" with: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Riot Grrrl is ...] Because we girls want to create mediums that speak to US.  We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy... Because we need to talk to each other. Communication and inclusion are key.  We will never know if we don't break the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit."&lt;ref name="Darms" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms.  All three of these forms were claimed to be a source of empowerment for women in the movement.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The riot grrrl movement encouraged women to develop their own place in a male-dominated punk scene. Punk shows had come to be understood as places where "women could make their way to the front of the crowd into the [[mosh pit]], but had to 'fight ten times harder' because they were female, and sexually charged violence such as groping and rape had been reported."&lt;ref name="Belzer"&gt;{{cite web|last = Belzer|first = Hillary|title = Words + Guitar: The Riot Grrrl Movement and Third-Wave Feminism|url = http://www8.georgetown.edu/cct/thesis/HillaryBelzer.pdf|work = Communication, Culture &amp; Technology Program|publisher = Georgetown University|accessdate = December 6, 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121215065347/http://www8.georgetown.edu/cct/thesis/HillaryBelzer.pdf|archivedate = December 15, 2012|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, riot grrrl bands would often actively invite members of the audience to talk about their personal experiences with sensitive issues such as sexual abuse, pass out lyric sheets to everyone in the audience, and often demand that the mosh boys move to the back or side to allow space in front for the girls in the audience.&lt;ref name=amBk/&gt; The bands weren't always enthusiastically received at shows by male audience members. ''[[Punk Planet]]'' editor Daniel Sinker wrote in ''We Owe You Nothing'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The vehemence fanzines large and small reserved for riot grrrl – and Bikini Kill in particular – was shocking.  The [[punk zine]] editors' use of '[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]es', '[[cunt]]s', '[[misandry|man-haters]]', and '[[dyke (lesbian)|dyke]]s' was proof-positive that sexism was still strong in the punk scene.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kathi Wilcox said in a fanzine interview:
[[File:Khanna2.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill in 1996]]

{{quote|I've been in a state of surprise for several years about this very thing. I don't know why so-called punk rockers are so threatened by a little shake-up of the truly boring dynamic of the standard show atmosphere. How fresh is the idea of fifty sweaty hardcore boys slamming into each other or jumping on each others' heads? Granted, it's kind of cool to be on stage and have action in the front, much more inspiring than to look out at a crowd of zombies, but so often the survival-of-the-fittest principle is in operation in the pit, and what girl wants to go up against a pack of [[Henry Rollins|Rollins]] boys who usually only want to be extra mean to her anyway just to make her "prove" her place in the pit. This was the case when I was first going to shows, and it's sad that things haven't changed at all since. ... But it would have been so cool if at one of these shows someone onstage would have said, hey let's have more girls up in the front, just so I could have had more company and girls over to side could have seen better/been in the action. So yeah, we do encourage girls to the front, and sometimes when shows have gotten really violent (like when we were in England) we had to ask the boys to move to the side or the back because it was just too fucking scary for us, after several attacks and threats, to face another sea of hostile boy-faces right in the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=154041389&amp;size=l |title=zine scan |publisher=Flickr.com |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kathleen Hanna would later write: "It was also super schizo to play shows where guys threw stuff at us, called us cunts and yelled "take it off" during our set, and then the next night perform for throngs of amazing girls singing along to every lyric and cheering after every song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanna|first=Kathleen|title=My Herstory |url=http://www.letigreworld.com/sweepstakes/html_site/fact/khfacts.html|publisher=Letigreworld.com|accessdate=September 30, 2012|authorlink=Kathleen Hanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many men were supporters of riot grrrl culture and acts. Calvin Johnson and [[Slim Moon]] have been instrumental in publishing riot grrrl bands on the labels they founded, K Records and [[Kill Rock Stars]] respectively. [[Alec Empire]] of [[Atari Teenage Riot]] said, "I was totally into the riot grrrl music, I see it as a very important form of expression. I learned a lot from that, way more maybe than from 'male' punk rock."&lt;ref name="The Punk Years - Typical Girls"/&gt; [[Dave Grohl]] and [[Kurt Cobain]] dated Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail (also respectively), and often played with Bikini Kill even after splitting with them; Kurt was a big fan of [[The Slits]] and even convinced [[The Raincoats]] to reform. He once said, "The future of rock belongs to women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = St. Martin's Griffin| isbn = 978-0-312-14109-7| last = Raphael| first = Amy| title = Grrrls: Viva Rock Divas| location = New York| year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many riot grrrl bands included male band members, such as Billy Karren of Bikini Kill or Jon Slade and Chris Rawley of Huggy Bear.

Molly Neuman once summarized:  "We're not anti-boy, we're pro-girl."&lt;ref name="The Punk Years - Typical Girls"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJmvaPdPG5Y&amp;mode=related&amp;search= The Punk Years – Typical Girls].

For example, in Bikini Kill's "Don't Need You", they sing: "don’t need you to say we’re cute/don’t need you to say we’re alright/don’t need your protection/don’t need your kiss goodnight", rejecting stereotypical heterosexual relationship dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schilt|first=Kristen|title="A Little Too Ironic": The Appropriation and packaging of Riot Grrrl Politics by Mainstream Female Musicians|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kleong/staffpage/course/riottgrrl%20analysis.pdf|work=Popular Music and Society|publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced heavily by [[DIY culture]], most bands' presentation subverted traditional or classically trained 'musicianship' in favor of raw, primitive, [[avant-punk|avant]]-[[lo-fi]] passion and fiercely deliberate amateurism:  an idea growing rapidly in popularity, especially in the [[Olympia music scene]], with bands like [[Beat Happening]] coining the slogans:  "Learn how to NOT play your instrument" and "hey, you don't have to sound like the flavor of the month, all you have to do is sound like yourselves"{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}, arguing that traditional musical skill doesn't ultimately matter and should always be subservient to the passion, the fun and ideas in their music.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  This argument is similar to the ideological origins of punk rock itself, which started partially as an attempt to dissolve the growing division between audience and performer.  These indie-punk bands (and riot grrrl bands in particular) were often ridiculed for "not being able to play their instruments", but fans are quick to counter that identical criticisms were often faced by the first-wave of punk rock bands in the 1970s, and that this DIY garage amateurism "play just 'cause you wanna, no matter what" attitude was one of the most appealing and liberating aspects of both movements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Music==
Other bands and artists associated with the riot grrrl movement in one way or another include - in the [[US]] - [[Slant 6]], [[Sta-Prest (band)|Sta-Prest]], Sue P. Fox, [[Jenny Toomey]], [[Adickdid]], [[Tattle Tale]], [[Jack Off Jill]], [[The Need]], [[Nomy Lamm]], [[Lucid Nation]], [[The Frumpies]], [[Bangs (band)|Bangs]], Crown for Athena, TummyAche, [[The Third Sex (band)|The Third Sex]], Canopy, Cheesecake, Clever Boy (Annika Bentley) Growing Up Skipper, The Fucking Angels, Pagan Holiday, [[The Quails (US band)|The Quails]], [http://www.giantkitty.com Giant Kitty]; in the UK, bands like [[Blood Sausage (band)|Blood Sausage]], [[Mambo Taxi]], [[Voodoo Queens]], [[Red Monkey (band)|Pussycat Trash]], Golden Starlet, Witchknot, [[Charley Stone|Frantic Spiders]], [[Linus (band)|Linus]], [[Sister George]], [[Lungleg]], Sally Skull,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karren Ablaze! |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/18/riot-grrrl-music-female-rebels |title=Riot grrrl: searching for music's young female revolutionaries &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hello Skinny and Coping Saw (who featured Leeds fanzine writer [[Ablaze!

Dacio identified with the riot grrrl movement. Letters between the band's drummer "Sloth" and Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill would soon see the bands share a stage in [[Hobart, Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tigerbomb.net/pages/bkpages/bikigigs.html |title=bikini kill concert chronology |publisher=Tigerbomb.net |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also many girl-centric or all-women punk and queercore bands of this era, such as [[Calamity Jane (90s band)|Calamity Jane]], 7 Year Bitch, [[Red Aunts]], [[Autoclave (band)|Autoclave]], [[Thee Headcoatees]], [[Spitboy]], [[Scissor Girls]], and [[Tribe 8]], who did not self-identify with the 'riot grrrl' label, despite sharing similar DIY tactics and feminist ideologies.

==Media misconceptions==
As media attention increasingly focused on Grunge and Alternative Rock in the early nineties, the term "Riot Grrrl" was often applied to less political female or female-fronted [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], [[The Breeders]], [[The Gits]], [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Lunachicks]], [[Dickless]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[Liz Phair]], [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]], and even [[No Doubt]] - although the latter band formed and performed during this era, they began as a SoCal-based and non-Alternative
Ska/Punk/Oí group. They retained this style prior to, and after, their major label signing with [[The Beacon Street Collection]] and breakout album [[Tragic Kingdom]], remaining as such through their debut studio album release, the assotiated and frontline solo tours, Festivals, plus the longtime collaborations with [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] before the initial sound and style drifted into the other genres and the ultimate solo act from [[Gwen Stefani]] - and – although the term could arguably apply to [[L7 (band)|L7]] due to their involvement in the creation of [[Rock for Choice]], a series of concerts and compilation albums designed to raise money and awareness for abortion rights and protection of women's health clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rock for Choice|url=http://feminist.org/rock4c/index.html|publisher=Feminist Majority Foundation|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To their chagrin, riot grrrls found themselves in the media spotlight during 1992, accused of dragging feminism into the [[mosh pit]] in magazines from ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' to ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malkin|first1=Nina|title=It's A Girl Thing|url=http://www.cs.xu.edu/~tankgirl/twelvelittlegrrrls/articles/seventeen.html|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revolution, Girl Style|url=http://www.newsweek.com/revolution-girl-style-196998|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fallout from the media coverage led to resignations from the movement of people like Jessica Hopper, who was at the center of the ''Newsweek'' article.  Kathleen Hanna called that year for "a press block". In an essay from January 1994, included in the CD version of Bikini Kill's first two records, Tobi Vail responded to media simplifications and mis-characterization of Riot Grrrl:
&lt;blockquote&gt;one huge misconception for instance that has been repeated over and over again in magazines we have never spoken to and also by those who believe these sources without checking things out themselves is that Bikini Kill is the definitive 'riot girl band' ... We are not in anyway 'leaders of' or authorities on the 'Riot Girl' movement. In fact, as individuals we have each had different experiences with, feelings on, opinions of and varying degrees of involvement with 'Riot Girl' and though we totally respect those who still feel that label is important and meaningful to them, we have never used that term to describe ourselves AS A BAND. As individuals we respect and utilize and subscribe to a variety of different aesthetics, strategies, and beliefs, both political and punk-wise, some of which are probably considered 'riot girl.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writer/musician/historian/artist Sharon Cheslow said in [[Experience Music Project|EMP's]] ''Riot Grrrl Retrospective'' documentary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There were a lot of very important ideas that I think the mainstream media couldn't handle, so it was easier to focus on the fact that these were girls who were wearing [[barrette]]s in their hair or writing 'slut' on their stomach.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Corin Tucker]] of Heavens to Betsy and Sleater-Kinney said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it was deliberate that we were made to look like we were just ridiculous girls parading around in our underwear.  They refused to do serious interviews with us, they misprinted what we had to say, they would take our articles, and our fanzines, and our essays and take them [[Fallacy of quoting out of context|out of context]].  We wrote a lot about [[sexual abuse]] and [[sexual assault]] for teenagers and young women.  I think those are really important concepts that the media ''never'' addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw3aIijPXws] YouTube. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719142124/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw3aIijPXws |date=July 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Zines and publications==
[[File:Girl Power zine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The second amateur [[zine]] for riot grrrls put out by the [[feminist]] band [[Bikini Kill]] in 1991, entitled ''GirlPower''.]]
Even as the Seattle-area rock scene came to international [[Mass media|mainstream media]] attention, riot grrrl remained a willfully underground phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Darms"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Darms|first1 = Lisa|title = The Riot Grrrl Collection|publisher = Feminist Press (CUNY)|isbn = 1558618228|page = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most musicians shunned the [[Big Five record labels|major record labels]], devotedly working instead with [[Independent record label|indie labels]] such as Kill Rock Stars, K Records, [[Slampt]], Piao! Records, [[Simple Machines]], Catcall, [[WIIIJA]] and [[Chainsaw Records]].  The movement also figured fairly prominently in [[cassette culture]], with artists often starting their own [[DIY cassette label]]s by as basic and spartan a means as recording their music onto cheap off-the-shelf [[boom-box]]es and passing the cassettes out to friends, seldom charging anything beyond the cost of the actual tapes themselves.

Riot grrrl's momentum was also hugely supported by an explosion of creativity in defiantly homemade cut and paste, [[xerox]]ed, [[collage]]y [[zine]]s that covered a variety of feminist topics, frequently attempting to draw out the political implications of intensely personal experiences in a "privately public" space.&lt;ref name=Darms /&gt; Zines often described experiences with [[sexism]], [[mental illness]], [[body image]] and [[eating disorders]], [[sexual abuse]], racism, rape, discrimination, [[stalking]], [[domestic violence]], [[incest]], [[homophobia]], and sometimes vegetarianism. Grrrl zine editors are collectively engaged in forms of writing and writing instruction that challenge both dominant notions of the author as an individualized, bodiless space and notions of feminism as primarily an adult political project.&lt;ref&gt;Comstock, Michelle. Grrl Zine Networks: Re-Composing Spaces of Authority, Gender, and Culture. La Jolla: n.p., September 3, 2013. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

These zines were archived by zinewiki.com, and Riot Grrrl Press, started in Washington DC in 1992 by Erika Reinstein &amp; May Summer.  Others can be found anthologized in ''A Girl's Guide to Taking over the World:  Writings from the Girl Zine Revolution'', for which actress/singer/musician/writer/performance artist [[Ann Magnuson]] of [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]] fame wrote as a foreword:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I think of how much benefit my teenage self could have gained from the multitude of zines that have proliferated over the past decade, I weep for all the lost potential.  Except for [[Joan of Arc]] and [[Anne Frank]], the thoughts of teenage girls have rarely been taken seriously.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bands would often attempt to [[reappropriation|reappropriate]] derogatory phrases like "cunt", "bitch", "dyke", and "[[slut]]", writing them proudly on their skin with lipstick or fat [[marker pen|markers]]. Kathleen Hanna was writing "slut" on her stomach at shows as early as 1992, intentionally fusing feminist art and activist practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Riot grrrls making political statements to reclaim phrases is a common theme among third-wave feminists.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Not only did their music address the same issues as third-wave feminism, but they took a political stance against the oppression they were feeling.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Many of the women involved with queercore were also interested in riot grrrl, and zines such as ''Chainsaw'' by [[Donna Dresch]], ''Sister Nobody'', ''Jane Gets A Divorce'' and ''I (heart) Amy Carter'' by Tammy Rae Carland embody both movements. There were also national conventions like in Washington, D.C.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}, or the Pussystock festival in New York City, as well as various subsequent indie-documentaries like ''Don't Need You:  the [[Herstory]] of Riot Grrrl''.

Starting during the fall of 2010, the "Riot Grrrl Collection" has been housed at [[New York University]]'s Fales Library and Special Collections, as "The Fales Riot Grrrl Collection". The collection's primary mandate is "to collect unique materials that provide documentation of the creative process of individuals and the chronology of the [Riot Grrrl] movement overall".&lt;ref name="nyu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales/riotgrrrltest.html |title=The Riot Grrrl Collection |publisher=Fales Library &amp; Special Collections |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Hanna, [[Johanna Fateman]], and Becca Albee have donated [[primary source]] material, while Molly Neuman, Allison Wolfe, Kathi Wilcox, and Carrie Brownstein are expected to donate material shortly. The collection is the brainchild of Lisa Darms, Senior Archivist at the Fales Library. According to Jenna Freedman, a librarian who maintains a zine collection at [[Barnard College]], "It's just essential to preserve the activist voices in their own unmediated work, especially because of the media blackout that they called for". Kathleen Hanna, while understanding no collection can replicate the concert experience, feels the collection is a safe place that will be "free from feminist erasure".&lt;ref name="nyu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYU&gt;{{cite news|last=Soloski|first=Alexis|title=Revolution, Girl-Style—Shhh!|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-04-06/news/revolution-girl-style-mdash-shhh/|newspaper=Village Voice|date=April 6, 2010|quote=In one corner of the hushed reading room of the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections, housed on the third floor of New York University's Bobst Library, squats a strange object.

== Criticism ==
The "Riot Grrrl" movement has received criticism for not being inclusive enough. Riot Girls are often accused of being [[Separatist feminism|separatists]]: they want to form a life away from men and invent "girl culture".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/revolution-girl-style-now/Content?oid=880507|title = Revolution Girl-Style Now!

&lt;blockquote&gt;Riot grrrl calls for change, but I question who it's including ... I see Riot Grrrl growing very closed to a very few i.e. white middle class punk girls.&lt;ref name="Darms" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Musician [[Courtney Love]] has criticized the movement for being too doctrinaire and censorious:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Look, you've got these highly intelligent imperious girls, but who told them it was their undeniable American right not to be offended? Being offended is part of being in the real world. I'm offended every time I see George Bush on TV!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Phoebe|title=Courtney Love: Let the healing begin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOIh4tn8TGYC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA70&amp;ots=sTV_1yLjXx&amp;dq=Courtney%20Love%3A%20Let%20the%20healing%20begin&amp;pg=RA1-PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|newspaper=Spin|date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some have suggested that, while riot grrrl bands worked to ensure their shows were safe spaces in which women could find solidarity and create their own subculture, they have excluded transwomen from events such as The [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|Michigan's Womyn's Music Festival]], which has a [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival and transgender people|womyn born-womyn policy]]. Former members of [[Le Tigre]] have seen protests at shows for participating in the festival.&lt;ref name="Chart Attack"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trapunski|first1=Richard|title=Fans demand an apology from Kathleen Hanna in Toronto Julie Ruin concert banner drop|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/2014/04/07/apologize-michigan-julie-ruin-kathleen-hanna-michfest/|publisher=Chart Attack|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of riot grrrl is clearly visible in numerous girls and women worldwide who cite the movement as an interest or an influence on their lives and/or their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Cherie|title=Everything You Need to Know About the Riot Grrrl Movement: The Feminism of a New Generation|year=2001|publisher=Rosen Pub.

Not only do these online platforms capture discussion regarding larger topics of systemic oppression, but they also provide space for girls to express smaller issues—the successes and challenges of their everyday lives. It is a forum that allows for self-determined feminism and genuine, open expression, a core part of the Riot Grrrl message that’s greatest power is giving girls the room to decide for themselves who they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3175311|title = Riot Grrrl: Revolutions From Within|last = Garofalo|first = Gitana|date = 1998|journal = University of Chicago Press|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As both a purported musical genre and as a subculture, riot grrrl has been acclaimed as an influence on contemporary groups as varied as [[Kitten Forever]], [[Skating Polly]], [[The Shondes]] and [[The Ethical Debating Society]]. Besides that, the Riot Grrrl movement has been a strong influence not only for the punk-rock scene but also for other kinds of music. 

In the foreword to ''Riot Grrrl: Revolution Girl Style Now!'' [[Beth Ditto]] writes of riot grrrl,
&lt;blockquote&gt;A movement formed by a handful of girls who felt empowered, who were angry, hilarious, and extreme through and for each other. Built on the floors of strangers' living rooms, tops of Xerox machines, snail mail, word of mouth and mixtapes, riot grrrl reinvented punk.&lt;ref name="Monem, Nadine 2007 P.8"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing about riot grrrl's personal influence on her and her music, she muses on the meaning of the movement for her generation, &lt;blockquote&gt;Until I found riot grrrl, or riot grrrl found me I was just another [[Gloria Steinem]] NOW feminist trying to take a stand in shop class. Now I am a musician, a writer, a whole person.&lt;ref name="Monem, Nadine 2007 P.8"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many women write to Hanna in hopes of reviving the Riot Grrrl Movement. Hanna says, “Don’t revive it, make something better".&lt;ref&gt;Frere-Jones, Sasha. "Hanna And Her Sisters."

In 2013 [[Astria Suparak]] and Ceci Moss curated ''Alien She'', an exhibition examining the impact of Riot Grrrl on artists and cultural producers. Alien She focuses on seven people whose visual art practices were informed by their contact with Riot Grrrl. Many of them work in multiple disciplines, such as sculpture, installation, video, documentary film, photography, drawing, printmaking, new media, social practice,  curation, music, writing and performance—a reflection of the movement's artistic diversity and mutability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://astriasuparak.com/2013/09/20/alien_she/|title = Alien She [curators statement]|date = |accessdate = December 31, 2015|website = Astriasuparak.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Katherine|title=First Riot Grrrl Exhibition Explores The Lasting Impact Of The Punk Feminist Movement|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/28/alien-she_n_3908938.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss Suparak|first=Ceci Astria|title=Riot Grrrl, redux|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/11/06/riot-grrrl-redux.html|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened September 2013 at the Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and ran through February the following year.

The term "grrrl" (or "grrl") itself has since been co-opted or used by agencies as diverse as advocacy on behalf of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (GRRL POWER 1.0 5-PACK / Memetics for the Ladies)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onemillionbuttonsfordigitalfreedom.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Onemillionbuttonsfordigitalfreedom.com |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[roller derby]] league in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechillipadis.wordpress.com/about/ |title=About &amp;#124; Chilli Padi Derby Girls |publisher=thechillipadis.wordpress.com |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Historie und Leben der berühmtesten europäischen Mahler frontispiece 1710.jpg|thumb|
Roger de Piles, [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to ''History and life of the famous European Painters'', Hamburg, Benj. Schiller, 1710]]
'''Roger de Piles''' (7 October 1635 – 5 April 1709) was a French painter, engraver, art critic and diplomat.

==Life==
Born in [[Clamecy, Nievre|Clamecy]], Roger de Piles studied philosophy and theology, and devoted himself to painting.

In 1662 he became tutor to [[Michel Amelot de Gournay]],  whom he was to follow throughout his life, acting as secretary to his various missions as French ambassador to Venice, Portugal, Spain.

In [[Venice]] (1682–1685) he started a famous collection of prints, drawings and paintings of [[Giorgione]], [[Correggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Antoine Coypel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Forest]].

He also acquired a taste for political intrigue using his travels ostensibly undertaken to study the European collections, as a buyer for [[Louis XIV]], as  cover for confidential missions - for example in Germany and Austria (1685) on behalf of Louis' minister, the [[marquis de Louvois]].

He was not always fortunate as a spy. In 1692, during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], he was arrested in [[the Hague]] carrying a false passport and imprisoned for the next five years. He spent his time writing ''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres ...avec un traité du peintre parfait''.&lt;ref&gt;"Epitome of the life of the painters... with a treaty on the perfect painter".&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1699 following his appointement as Conseiller Honoraire to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]].

In 1705 he followed Amelot de Gournay to Spain but illness forced him to return to Paris, where he died in 1709.

==Art critic==
His important contribution to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]] rests on his ''Dialogue sur le coloris'' ("Dialogue on colours"), in which he initiated his famous defence of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] in the argument started in 1671 by [[Philippe de Champaigne]] on the relative merits of [[drawing]] and [[color]] in the work of [[Titian]] (in a lecture to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] on Titian's ''Virgin and Child with St John''.)

The argument is most fascinating as an early debate on classic vs modern in painting; in essence on the mathematics of [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]] and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in [[drawing]]&amp;mdash;the classic approach&amp;mdash; as opposed to the colored [[brush]] stroke&amp;mdash;the approach of the moderns. In his detailed study of the argument, ''Roger de Piles et les débats sur le coloris au siècle de Louis XIV'' (1965), B. Teyssèdre gives a touching account of the ''bohème'' of the "modern" ''réfusés'' in seventeenth century Paris, a history that was to repeat itself with the [[Impressionists]].

In the course of the argument Roger de Piles introduced the term  "''clair-obscur''" ([[Chiaroscuro]]) to highlight the effect of color in accentuating the tension between light and dark in a painting.

The way Roger de Piles documented his argument with Venetian and northern European examples was of influence to [[Antoine Coypel]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], [[Nicolas de Largillière]] and [[François de Troy]].

==Balance of painters==
To his last published work: ''Cours de peinture par principes avec un balance de peintres'' (1708) de Piles appended a list of fifty-six major painters with whose work he had acquainted himself as a connoisseur during his travels.

To each painter in the list he gave marks from 0 to 18 for composition, drawing, color and expression. This gave an overview of aesthetic appreciation hinging on the balance between color and design. The highest marks went to [[Raffaello Sanzio]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], with a slight bias on color for Rubens, a slight bias on drawing for Raphaël. Painters who scored very badly in anything but color were [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]] and remarkably [[Michelangelo Caravaggio]] with 16 on color and 0 (zero) on expression. Painters who fell far behind Rubens and Raphaël but whose balance between color and design was perfect were [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Sebastian Bourdon]], [[Albrecht Dürer]].

==List==

The complete list is transcribed here from Manlio Brusatin:''Histoire des couleurs'' (Paris: Flammarion, 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–104), reproduced in Elisabeth G. Holt ''Literary Sources of Art History'', (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;415–416

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11235">The '''Seattle Camera Club''' (SCC) was an organization of photographers active in [[Seattle]], Washington, during the 1920s. It was founded in 1924 by Japanese immigrants and thrived for the next five years. The SCC was the only Japanese American photography club to include both Caucasians and women photographers as members, and because of their inclusivity their members were among the most exhibited photographers in the world at that time.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=158}}

==History==

The 39 charter members of the club were all Japanese men. Unlike other prominent clubs of Japanese photographers, they decided at the beginning to welcome women and Caucasian members.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=19}} The driving force behind the club’s formation was Dr. Kyo Koike, who was a well‒respected medical doctor in Seattle’s [[Issei]] community.

They held monthly meetings at 508½ Main Street near Dr. Koike’s office. At these meetings members critiqued each other’s prints and discussed current ideas about photography. Dr. Koike wrote about these discussions in their monthly bulletin, as well as descriptions of photography trips the members had taken, names of those members who had exhibited recently, and commentaries about photography in general.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=157}}

The club’s bulletin was called ''Notan'', which is a Japanese term that roughly translates as “light and shade”. These were qualities that defined the primary elements of a Japanese style of [[pictorialism]] that most of the original members prized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Shelley Sang‒Hee|title=Claiming the Oriental Gateway: Prewar Seattle and Japanese America|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2010|page=84|ISBN=9781439902134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their photographs contained strong lighting and rhythmical patterns that emphasized the artistic quality of a scene.

In 1925 the club began its own salon, which originally featured photographs by its own members but later expanded to an international field of photographers. The artistic strength of their membership is indicated by the fact that in 1926 members of the club showed a collective 589 prints in different exhibitions around the world.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=158}} That same year ''Photo‒Era'' magazine offered a trophy for the photography club whose members won the most awards in the magazine’s competitions. The first winner of the trophy was the Seattle Camera Club.{{sfn|Martin|2011|p=66}}

The club reached its peak membership in 1925 with 85 members, including several photographers who in lived in other areas of the country.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=158}} Two prominent Seattle women, [[Ella E. McBride|Ella McBride]] and [[Virna Haffer]], were among the club’s members by that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://henryart.org/exhibitions/shadows-of-a-fleeting-world-pictorial-photography-and-seattle-camera-club|title=Shadows of a Fleeting World: Pictorial Photography and Seattle Camera Club|accessdate=May 20, 2016|author=Henry Art Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one‒quarter of the members then were Japanese Americans.{{sfn|Tsutakawa|1993|p=55}}

Soon thereafter the membership in the club began to decline, primarily due to increasing economic difficulties that led up to the 1929 [[Great Depression]]. Many members held low-paying jobs, and with increased prices and a scarcity of jobs they could no longer afford to buy film or other photographic supplies.{{sfn|Martin|2011|p=71}} On October 11, 1929 the club held a farewell meeting. Only 7 members attended, and they formally disbanded the club at that time.

Some of the more well-to-do members, like Koike and Matsushita, continued to make photographs and exhibit them when they could. All of their efforts ended with the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] in December, 1941. Soon thereafter almost all of the Japanese American community in Seattle was transported to the Japanese American internment camps in [[Minidoka National Historic Site|Idaho]] or [[Fort Missoula Internment Camp|Montana]].{{sfn|Martin|2011|p=72}}

==Prominent Members==

'''Kyo Koike''' was a medical doctor who had a thriving practice in the Japanese community in Seattle. His professional income allowed him not only to concentrate on his photography but to underwrite many of the expenses of forming the club. He was the editor of the club's newsletter ''Notan''. During World War II all of his photographic equipment was confiscated by the U.S. government, and he was taken to the [[Minidoka War Relocation Center|Minidoka National Historic Site]] in Idaho. He remained there until the end of the war, but while there he fell ill and never recovered. He died shortly after he was allowed to return to Seattle in 1947. He left all of his photographs and extensive records of the Seattle Camera Club to fellow club member Iwao Matsushita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/what-became-of-the-members-and-the-work-of-the-seattle-camera-club/ |title=What became of the members and the work of the Seattle Camera Club?|accessdate=May 20, 2016|first=Michael|last=Upchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hideo Onishi''' (1890‒after 1934) was employed as a restaurant cook, but he was a prolific and very successful photographer. In 1926 he was the club’s top exhibitor for the year, and that same year more than 1,000 people attended an exhibition of his photographs at the Japanese Commercial Club in Seattle. He sold 233 copies of his prints at that exhibition and gave the profits to SCC.&lt;ref name=MW2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/exhibits/making-waves/photographers/|title=Making Waves: Japanese American Photography 1920‒1940|author=Japanese American National Museum|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Asakichi Kunishige''' (1978‒1960) was one of the original members of SCC and one of only a few club members who had formal training in photography. In 1911 he attended photography school in Illinois, and after moving to Seattle he worked in the darkrooms of [[Edward Curtis]] and Ella McBride.{{sfn|Tsutakawa|1993|p=73}} Because of his training and experience he was one of the technical experts of the club. He created and sold his own photographic paper, Textura Tissue, which was a favorite of club members because it emphasized the soft qualities that Pictorial photographers prized.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=153}} During World War II he and his wife were sent to the Minidoka Internment Camp in Idaho. After their release they returned to Seattle, but he did not take up photography again.

'''Soichi Sunami''' (1885‒1971) learned photography in Seattle while working as an assistant at the studio of Ella McBride. In 1922 he moved to New York to study at [[Art Students League]], where there he photographed student dancers and artists. He also continued showing his photographs at SCC and was one of the most active non‒resident members of the club. Later he became of the main photographers for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and continued to work there for 38 years.&lt;ref name=MW2016/&gt;

'''Virna Haffer''' (1899-1974) was an accomplished, innovative, internationally renowned photographer, printmaker, painter, musician, and published author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/virna-haffers-photos-resurrected-at-tam/ |title=Virna Haffer’s photos resurrected at TAM.|accessdate=May 9, 2018|first=Michael|last=Upchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in 1899 in Aurora, Illinois, Virna Haffer and her family made the move to the Utopian community of Home, in South Puget Sound in Washington State in 1907.&lt;ref name="Henderson, Christina S. 2011"&gt;Henderson, Christina S., Francis, David F., Bullock, Margaret E., Haffer, Virna A. A Turbulent Lens: The Photographic Art of Virna Haffer. Tacoma Art Museum. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Haffer began her journey as a professional photographer when she was just 15 years old when she became the apprentice of the accomplished photographer, Harriette H. Ihrig.&lt;ref name="Henderson, Christina S. 2011"/&gt; She opened her own portrait photography studio in Tacoma, Washington and began publishing her photographs in 1924. Haffer was known for experimenting with unusual, quirky techniques and created her own artistic style that stretched the boundaries of artistic classifications in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40491806 |title= Good American Subjects Done Through Japanese Eyes: Race, Nationality, and The Seattle Camera Club, 1924-1929.|first= Shelly|last=Sang-Hee Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haffer's work was eccentric; she produced pictorialist, modern, surreal, and documentary style work. Virna Haffer's work was first exhibited in 1924 in the Fifth Annual F&amp;N Salon of Pictorial Photography, and in 1928 at the Seattle Camera Club's Fourth International Exhibition. By 1930 her work was internationally recognized, and often appeared in publications such as the ''American Annual of Photography''. In addition, she won recognition and prizes in photographic competitions in the United States in the 1930's.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Martin W. Against The Odds: Women Pioneers in The First Hundred Years Of Photography. St. Martins Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960's she took an interest in producing photograms, and was so successful that in 1969 she published a book about the process of making a photogram called ''Making Photograms: The Creative Process of Painting With Light''.&lt;ref name=BNWR2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cascadiavolunteers.org/PDFarticles/BiographyNWRealism.pdf|title=Biography NW Realism|author=Cascadia Art Museum Volunteers|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haffer's work was also the subject of several solo exhibitions not limited to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960; Museum of Science &amp; Industry, Los Angeles, 1964; New York Camera Club, 1967 and the Museum of Contemporary Arts &amp; Crafts, NYC, 1968.&lt;ref name=VH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlecameraclub.com/virna_haffer.html|title=Virna Haffer|author=Seattle Camera Club|accessdate= May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speedtest.net''' is a web service that provides free analysis of [[Internet access]] performance metrics, such as connection data rate and latency. It was founded by Ookla in 2006, and is based in [[Seattle, Washington]].

The service measures the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] (''speed'') and [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of a visitor's Internet connection against one of 4,759 geographically dispersed [[Server (computing)|servers]] (as of August 2016) located around the world. Each test measures the data rate for the [[download]] direction, i.e. from the server to the user computer, and the [[upload]] data rate, i.e. from the user's computer to the server. The tests are performed within the user's web browser or within [[Mobile app|apps]].  {{As of|September 2018}}, over 21 billion speed tests have been completed.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://speedtest.net See tests completed on page.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tests were previously performed using the [[HTTP|HTTP]] protocol at Layer 7 of the [[OSI model]]. To further improve accuracy, Speedtest.net now performs tests via direct [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] sockets and uses a custom protocol for communication between servers and clients.

The site also offers detailed statistics based on test results. This data has been used by numerous publications in the analysis of Internet access data rates around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7098992.stm |title=Broadband speeds around the world |date=December 2, 2007 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10454199"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10454199 |title=The truth about Kiwi broadband |author=Greenop, Matt |date=July 27, 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/hey-telstra-forget-about-broadband/2007/06/23/1182019431084.html |title=Hey Telstra, forget about broadband |author=Lane, Terry |authorlink=Terry Lane |date=June 24, 2007 |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The owner and operator of Speedtest.net, Ookla, was established in 2006 by a small team of internet and technology veterans. Ookla was acquired by [[Ziff Davis]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investor.j2global.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=885561|title=Ziff Davis Acquires Ookla...

==Technology==
The technology of Speedtest.net is similar to that of Ookla NetGauge, which is provided to a wide variety of companies and organizations on a licensed basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ookla.com/netmetrics/|title=NetMetrics from Ookla - Internet performance database|work=ookla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speedtest.net Mini was a free, stripped-down Flash version of the speed test technology used on Speedtest.net that users could run on their own web server, however it was replaced in 2016 with Speedtest Custom, an HTML5-based tool. Together, over 20 million speed tests are generated each month using Ookla's software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ookla.com/about.php|title=Ookla - About|work=ookla.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026002139/http://www.ookla.com/about.php|archivedate=2017-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ceramic Tile Tessellations in Marrakech.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Zellige]] [[terracotta]] tiles in [[Marrakech]], forming edge-to-edge, regular and other tessellations]]
[[File:Leeuwarden - Tegeltableau Escher.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A wall sculpture in [[Leeuwarden]] celebrating the artistic tessellations of [[M. C. Escher]] ]]

A '''tessellation''' of a flat surface is the tiling of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] using one or more [[geometric shape]]s, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In [[mathematics]], tessellations can be generalized to [[high-dimensional spaces|higher dimensions]] and a variety of geometries.

A periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include [[Euclidean tilings by convex regular polygons|regular tilings]] with [[regular polygon]]al tiles all of the same shape, and [[semiregular tiling]]s with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 [[wallpaper groups]]. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called "non-periodic". An [[aperiodic tiling]] uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern. In the geometry of higher dimensions, a space-filling or [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb]] is also called a ''tessellation of space''.

A real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as [[cement]]ed [[ceramic]] squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative [[patterns]], or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant [[pavement (architecture)|pavement]], floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in [[Ancient Rome]] and in [[Islamic art]] such as in the [[Islamic geometric patterns|decorative geometric tiling]] of the [[Alhambra]] palace. In the twentieth century, the work of [[M. C. Escher]] often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]] and in [[hyperbolic geometry]], for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in [[quilting]]. Tessellations form a class of [[patterns in nature]], for example in the arrays of [[Hexagonal tiling|hexagonal cells]] found in [[honeycomb]]s.

==History==
[[File:Stone-Cone Temple mosaics, Pergamon Museum.JPG|thumb|left|A temple mosaic from the ancient Sumerian city of [[Uruk]] IV (3400–3100 BC), showing a tessellation pattern in coloured tiles]]

Tessellations were used by the [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Sumerians]] (about 4000 BC) in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles.&lt;ref name="Pickover2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pickover |first=Clifford A. |title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics |year=2009 |publisher=Sterling |isbn=9781402757969 |page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative [[mosaic]] tilings made of small squared blocks called [[tessera]]e were widely employed in [[classical antiquity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunbabin | first1=Katherine M. D. | title=Mosaics of the Greek and Roman world | date=2006 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes displaying geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Brantingham Geometric Mosaics | url=http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/museumcollections/collections/storydetail.php?irn=410 | publisher=Hull City Council | accessdate=26 May 2015 | date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Field1988/&gt;

In 1619 [[Johannes Kepler]] made an early documented study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]''; he was possibly the first to explore and to explain the hexagonal structures of honeycomb and [[snowflakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Johannes Kepler | author=Kepler, Johannes | date=1619 | titlelink=Harmonices Mundi | title=Harmonices Mundi |trans-title=Harmony of the Worlds }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gullberg|1997|p=395}}{{sfn|Stewart|2001|p=13}}

Some two hundred years later in 1891, the Russian crystallographer [[Yevgraf Fyodorov]] proved that every periodic tiling of the plane features one of seventeen different groups of isometries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://public.lanl.gov/djidjev/papers/coverage_chapter.pdf | title=Dynamic Coverage Problems in Sensor Networks | publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory | year=2012 | accessdate=6 April 2013 |author1=Djidjev, Hristo |author2=Potkonjak, Miodrag |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fyodorov, Y. | authorlink=Yevgraf Fyodorov | date=1891 | title=Simmetrija na ploskosti [Symmetry in the plane] | journal=Zapiski Imperatorskogo Sant-Petersburgskogo Mineralogicheskogo Obshchestva [Proceedings of the Imperial St. Petersburg Mineralogical Society], series 2 | volume=28 | pages=245–291| language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fyodorov's work marked the unofficial beginning of the mathematical study of tessellations.

===Etymology===
In Latin, ''tessella'' is a small cubical piece of [[clay]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[glass]] used to make mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/tessellate | title=Tessellate | publisher=Merriam-Webster Online | accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "tessella" means "small square" (from ''tessera'', square, which in turn is from the Greek word τέσσερα for ''four''). It corresponds to the everyday term ''tiling'', which refers to applications of tessellations, often made of [[ceramic glaze|glazed]] clay.

==Overview==
[[File:Semi-regular-floor-3464.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A [[rhombitrihexagonal tiling]]: tiled floor in the [[Archeological Museum of Seville]], Spain, using square, triangle and hexagon prototiles]]

Tessellation in two dimensions, also called planar tiling, is a topic in geometry that studies how shapes, known as ''tiles'', can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are that there must be no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Conway, R. |author2=Burgiel, H. |author3=Goodman-Strauss, G. | title=The Symmetries of Things | publisher=Peters | date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tessellations created by [[Bond (brick)|bonded brickwork]] do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a [[regular tessellation]] has both identical{{efn|The mathematical term for identical shapes is "congruent" – in mathematics, "identical" means they are the same tile.}} [[regular polygon|regular tiles]] and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Coxeter, H. S. M. | title=Regular Polytopes | edition=3rd | publisher=Dover | date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral [[triangle]], [[square]], and regular [[hexagon]]. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] with no gaps.{{sfn|Gullberg|1997|p=395}}

Many other types of tessellation are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made with more than one kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cundy and Rollett | title=Mathematical Models | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford | date=1961 | pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as [[pentagons]], [[polyominoes]] and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist [[M. C. Escher]] is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects.{{sfn|Escher|1974|pp=11–12, 15–16}} If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/basilica/architettura/il-pavimento-tessulare/?lang=en | title=Basilica di San Marco | publisher=Basilica di San Marco | work=Section: Tessellated floor | accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tassellatura alhambra.jpg|thumb|Elaborate and colourful [[zellige]] tessellations of glazed tiles at the [[Alhambra]] in Spain]]

More formally, a tessellation or tiling is a [[cover (topology)|cover]] of the Euclidean plane by a [[countable]] number of closed sets, called ''tiles'', such that the tiles intersect only on their [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]]. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes.{{efn|The tiles are usually required to be [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (topologically equivalent) to a [[closed disk]], which means bizarre shapes with holes, dangling line segments or infinite areas are excluded.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;}} Many tessellations are formed from a finite number of [[prototile]]s in which all tiles in the tessellation are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape can be used as a prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to ''tessellate'' or to ''tile the plane''. The [[Conway criterion]] is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Will It Tile? Try the Conway Criterion! | author=Schattschneider, Doris |magazine=Mathematics Magazine | volume=53 | issue=4 | date=September 1980 |pages=224–233 | doi=10.2307/2689617}}&lt;/ref&gt; No general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;

Mathematically, tessellations can be extended to spaces other than the Euclidean plane.{{sfn|Gullberg|1997|p=395}} The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[geometry|geometer]] [[Ludwig Schläfli]] pioneered this by defining ''polyschemes'', which mathematicians nowadays call [[polytopes]]. These are the analogues to polygons and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the [[Schläfli symbol]] notation to make it easy to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWvXsVInpgMC&amp;lpg=PP1 | title=Regular Polytopes | publisher=Methuen | author=Coxeter, H. S. M. | year=1948 |pages=14, 69, 149| isbn=9780486614809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.&lt;ref name="MathWorldTessellation"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Tessellation|id=Tessellation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods also exist for describing polygonal tilings. When the tessellation is made of regular polygons, the most common notation is the [[vertex configuration]], which is simply a list of the number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 4&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 6&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum&gt;{{cite book | last=Grünbaum |first=Branko | title=Tilings and Patterns | year=1987 | publisher=W.

===Introduction to tessellations===
{{Further|Euclidean tilings of regular polygons|Uniform tiling||List of convex uniform tilings}}

Mathematicians use some technical terms when discussing tilings. An ''[[edge (geometry)|edge]]'' is the intersection between two bordering tiles; it is often a straight line. A ''[[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]'' is the point of intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an ''isogonal'' or [[vertex-transitive]] tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of [[polygon]]s about each vertex is the same.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt; The [[fundamental domain|fundamental region]] is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation.&lt;ref name="EmmerSchattschneider2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Emmer |first1=Michele |last2=Schattschneider |first2=Doris |title=M.C. Escher's Legacy: A Centennial Celebration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DDyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA325 |date=8 May 2007 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-540-28849-7 |page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of [[square tiling|four squares at every vertex]].&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;

The sides of the polygons are not necessarily identical to the edges of the tiles. An '''edge-to-edge tiling''' is any polygonal tessellation where adjacent tiles only share one full side, i.e., no tile shares a partial side or more than one side with any other tile. In an edge-to-edge tiling, the sides of the polygons and the edges of the tiles are the same. The familiar "brick wall" tiling is not edge-to-edge because the long side of each rectangular brick is shared with two bordering bricks.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;

A ''normal tiling'' is a tessellation for which every tile is [[topologically]] equivalent to a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]], the intersection of any two tiles is a single [[connected set]] or the [[empty set]], and all tiles are [[uniformly bounded]]. This means that a single circumscribing radius and a single inscribing radius can be used for all the tiles in the whole tiling; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin.&lt;ref name=Horne2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Horne | first=Clare E. | title=Geometric Symmetry in Patterns and Tilings | year=2000 |publisher=Woodhead Publishing |isbn=9781855734920 |pages=172, 175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P5-type15-chiral_coloring.png|thumb|left|upright|The 15th convex monohedral [[pentagonal tiling]], discovered in 2015]]

A &lt;span id="Monohedral" style="white-pace:nowrap;font-weight:bold"&gt;monohedral tiling&lt;/span&gt; is a tessellation in which all tiles are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]; it has only one prototile.

[[File:2005-06-25 Tiles together.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Pythagorean tiling]] ]]

An isohedral tiling is a special variation of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles belong to the same transitivity class, that is, all tiles are transforms of the same prototile under the [[symmetry]] group of the tiling.&lt;ref name=Horne2000/&gt; If a prototile admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral, then the prototile is called anisohedral and forms [[anisohedral tiling]]s.

A [[Tiling by regular polygons|regular tessellation]] is a highly [[symmetry|symmetric]], edge-to-edge tiling made up of [[regular polygon]]s, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of [[equilateral triangle]]s, [[square (geometry)|squares]], or regular [[hexagon]]s. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.&lt;ref name=threeregular&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Regular Tessellations|id=RegularTessellations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Tiling by regular polygons#Archimedean, uniform or semiregular tilings|semi-regular (or Archimedean) tessellation]] uses more than one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|p=75}} These can be described by their [[vertex configuration]]; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (each vertex has one square and two octagons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrich.maths.org/1556 | title=Schläfli Tessellations | publisher=University of Cambridge | date=1997–2012 | accessdate=26 April 2013 | author=NRICH (Millennium Maths Project)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of [[Pythagorean tiling]]s, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wells | first=David | year=1991 | title=The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry | publisher=Penguin Books | location=New York | isbn=0-14-011813-6 | pages=260–261 | contribution=two squares tessellation}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[edge tessellation]] is one in which each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kirby, Matthew; Umble, Ronald |title=Edge Tessellations and Stamp Folding Puzzles |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=84 |issue=4 |date=2011 |pages=283–89 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.84.4.283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Penrose Tiling (Rhombi).svg|thumb|upright|A [[Penrose tiling]], with several symmetries but no periodic repetitions]]

[[Penrose tiling]]s, which use two different quadrilateral prototiles, are the best known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of [[aperiodic tiling]]s, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The [[recursion|recursive process]] of [[substitution tiling]] is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated in this way is the [[rep-tile]]s; these tilings have surprising [[self-replication|self-replicating]] properties.{{sfn|Gardner|1989|pp=1-18}} [[Pinwheel tiling]]s are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Radin, C. | title=The Pinwheel Tilings of the Plane | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=139 | issue=3 | pages=661–702 | date=May 1994 | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.44.9723 | doi=10.2307/2118575 | jstor=2118575}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so.

[[Wang tile]]s are squares coloured on each edge, and placed so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles have the same colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang [[dominoes]]. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any [[Turing machine]] can be represented as a set of Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt.

===Tessellations and colour===
{{further|Four color theorem|l1=Four colour theorem}}

[[File:Torus with seven colours.svg|thumb|right|If the colours of this tiling are to form a pattern by repeating this rectangle as the [[fundamental domain]], at least seven colours are required; more generally, at least [[four color theorem|four colours]] are needed.]]

Sometimes the colour of a tile is understood as part of the tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The [[four color theorem|four colour theorem]] states that for every tessellation of a normal [[Euclidean plane]], with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.&lt;ref name=Hazewinkel2001&gt;{{springer | title=Four-colour problem|id=p/f040970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any triangle or [[quadrilateral]] (even [[concave polygon|non-convex]]) can be used as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, often in more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary [[quadrilateral]] can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to [[Wallpaper group#Group p2|wallpaper group p2]]. As [[fundamental domain]] we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a [[parallelogram]] subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/DLDecArts.GramOrnJones | title=The Grammar of Ornament | publisher=Bernard Quaritch | last=Jones | first=Owen | authorlink=Owen Jones (architect) | year=1910 |edition=folio | origyear=1856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If only one shape of tile is allowed, tilings exists with convex ''N''-gons for ''N'' equal to 3, 4, 5 and 6.

===Voronoi tilings===
[[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi or Dirichlet]] tilings are tessellations where each tile is defined as the set of points closest to one of the points in a discrete set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all the points closest to a given city or post office.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Aurenhammer, Franz |authorlink= Franz Aurenhammer | date=1991 | title=Voronoi Diagrams – A Survey of a Fundamental Geometric Data Structure | journal=ACM Computing Surveys | volume=23| issue =3 | pages=345–405 | doi=10.1145/116873.116880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Okabe, Atsuyuki |author2=Boots, Barry |author3=Sugihara, Kokichi |author4=Chiu, Sung Nok | date=2000 | title=Spatial Tessellations – Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams | edition=2nd | publisher=John Wiley | isbn=0-471-98635-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Voronoi cell'' for each defining point is a convex polygon. The [[Delaunay triangulation]] is a tessellation that is the [[dual graph]] of a Voronoi tessellation.

Tessellation can be extended to three dimensions. Certain [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] can be stacked in a regular [[Bravais lattice|crystal pattern]] to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the [[cube]] (the only [[Platonic polyhedron]] to do so), the [[rhombic dodecahedron]], the [[truncated octahedron]], and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Grünbaum, Branko | date=1994 | title=Uniform tilings of 3-space | journal= Geombinatorics | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=49–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any polyhedron that fits this criterion is known as a [[plesiohedron]], and may possess between 4 and 38 faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Engel | first=Peter | doi=10.1524/zkri.1981.154.3-4.199 | issue=3–4 | journal=Zeitschrift für Kristallographie, Kristallgeometrie, Kristallphysik, Kristallchemie | mr=598811 | pages=199–215

Tessellations in three or more dimensions are called [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]]. In three dimensions there is just one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular{{efn|In this context, quasiregular means that the cells are regular (solids), and the vertex figures are semiregular.}} honeycomb, which has eight [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] and six [[octahedron|octahedra]] at each polyhedron vertex.

===Tessellations in non-Euclidean geometries===

It is possible to tessellate in [[non-Euclidean]] geometries such as [[hyperbolic geometry]]. A [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane]] (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with [[regular polygon]]s as [[Face (geometry)|faces]]; these are [[vertex-transitive]] ([[Transitive group action|transitive]] on its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]), and isogonal (there is an [[isometry]] mapping any vertex onto any other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last1=Margenstern | first1=Maurice | title=Coordinates for a new triangular tiling of the hyperbolic plane | date=4 January 2011 | eprint=1101.0530 | class=cs.FL }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tiling the Hyperbolic Plane with Regular Polygons | author=Zadnik,  Gašper | url=http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TilingTheHyperbolicPlaneWithRegularPolygons/  | publisher=Wolfram | accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic space|uniform honeycomb in hyperbolic space]] is a uniform tessellation of [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedral]] [[Cell (geometry)|cells]]. In 3-dimensional hyperbolic space there are nine [[Coxeter group]] families of compact [[convex uniform honeycomb]]s, generated as [[Wythoff construction]]s, and represented by [[permutation]]s of [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram#Application with uniform polytopes|rings]] of the [[Coxeter diagram]]s for each family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Coxeter, H.S.M. | work=The Beauty of Geometry: Twelve Essays | publisher=Dover Publications | date=1999 | isbn=0-486-40919-8 | title=Chapter 10: Regular honeycombs in hyperbolic space | pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosaic floor panel - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman [[mosaic]] floor panel of stone, tile and glass, from a villa near [[Antakya|Antioch]] in Roman Syria. 2nd century AD]]

In architecture, tessellations have been used to create decorative motifs since ancient times. [[Mosaic]] tilings often had geometric patterns.&lt;ref name=Field1988&gt;{{cite book | title=Geometric Patterns from Roman Mosaics | publisher=Tarquin | author=Field, Robert | year=1988 | isbn=978-0-906-21263-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later civilisations also used larger tiles, either plain or individually decorated. Some of the most decorative were the [[Moorish]] wall tilings of [[Islamic architecture]], using [[Girih tiles|Girih]] and [[Zellige]] tiles in buildings such as the [[Alhambra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/math-art-arch.shtml#Symmetry | title=Mathematics in Art and Architecture | publisher=National University of Singapore |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|La Mezquita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Whittaker | first=Andrew |title=Speak the Culture: Spain | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rZS8SWMroUC&amp;pg=PT153 | year=2008 | publisher=Thorogood Publishing | isbn=978-1-85418-605-8 | page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessellations frequently appeared in the graphic art of [[M. C. Escher]]; he was inspired by the Moorish use of symmetry in places such as the Alhambra when he visited [[Spain]] in 1936.{{sfn|Escher|1974|pp=5, 17}} Escher made four "[[Circle Limit III|Circle Limit]]" drawings of tilings that use hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Gersten |first1=S.

Tessellated designs often appear on textiles, whether woven, stitched in or printed. Tessellation patterns have been used to design interlocking [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] of patch shapes in [[quilt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Porter | first=Christine | title=Tessellation Quilts: Sensational Designs From Interlocking Patterns | year=2006 | publisher=F+W Media | isbn=9780715319413 | pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beyer |first=Jinny | title=Designing tessellations: the secrets of interlocking patterns |year=1999 |publisher=Contemporary Book |isbn=9780809228669 |pages=Ch. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessellations are also a main genre in [[origami#tessellation|origami]] (paper folding), where pleats are used to connect molecules such as twist folds together in a repeating fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Origami Tessellations |last=Gjerde |first=Eric |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=2008|isbn=978-1-568-81451-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In manufacturing==
Tessellation is used in [[manufacturing industry]] to reduce the wastage of material (yield losses) such as [[sheet metal]] when cutting out shapes for objects like [[car door]]s or [[drinks can]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Reducing yield losses: using less metal to make the same thing | url=http://www.withbotheyesopen.com/pdftransponder.php?c=13|publisher=UIT Cambridge | accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[honeycomb]] provides a well-known example of tessellation in nature with its hexagonal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Ball | first1=Philip | title=How honeycombs can build themselves | url=http://www.nature.com/news/how-honeycombs-can-build-themselves-1.13398 | website=Nature.com | publisher=Nature | accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In botany, the term "tessellate" describes a checkered pattern, for example on a flower petal, tree bark, or fruit. Flowers including the [[Fritillaria|fritillary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary | edition=6th | year=2007 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=United Kingdom |isbn=0199206872 |page=3804}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species of ''Colchicum'' are characteristically tessellate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Purdy | first1=Kathy | title=Colchicums: autumn's best-kept secret | journal=American Gardener | date=2007 | issue=September/October | pages=18–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[patterns in nature]] are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns can be described by [[Gilbert tessellation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last1=Schreiber | first1=Tomasz | last2=Soja | first2=Natalia | eprint=1005.0023 | title=Limit theory for planar Gilbert tessellations | year=2010| class=math.PR }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as random crack networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gray | first1=N.

The model, named after [[Edgar Gilbert]], allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gilbert | first=E.

Other natural patterns occur in [[foam]]s; these are packed according to [[Plateau's laws]], which require [[minimal surface]]s. Such foams present a problem in how to pack cells as tightly as possible: in 1887, [[Lord Kelvin]] proposed a packing using only one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]], which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ball, Philip | title=Shapes | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2009 | pages=73–76 | isbn=978-0-199-60486-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Centre of Attention''' is a [[London]]-based contemporary art organisation set up in 1999. Projects are shown internationally and constitute an ongoing enquiry into the phenomenon of art production, presentation and consumption.

The Centre’s participatory or [[Gonzo journalism|Gonzo]] curating approach include controversial exhibitions such as "Viva la republique" set during the [[Golden Jubilee]] with [[Banksy]], [[Jamie Reid]] and [[Genesis P-Orridge]]; "The curators" which entirely eliminated the artists from the exhibition by putting the curators on display, as well as in-depth solo projects with artists such as a [[Fluxus]] concert with [[Ken Friedman]] or a [[kinetic art]] retrospective of [[Nicolas Schöffer]].

The Centre of Attention was selected for the 51st [[Venice Biennale]] by curator [[Rosa Martinez]] and presented Swansong/Schwanengesang an installation with works from [[Benedict Carpenter]], House of O'Dwyer, Damien Roach and [[Wolfgang Tillmans]]. In this piece, also presented in MousonTurm Frankfurt and [[Mercer Union]] in Toronto, the audience is given an opportunity to rehearse its own funeral: participants select a song; then lay on a plinth, performing death, while the song is webstreamed, formally, reversing the viewer/art-object dynamic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2423">[[Image:LotAndAberham.jpg|thumb|''The Parting of Lot and Abraham'' mosaic from Santa Maria Maggiore]]

'''''The Parting of Lot and Abraham''''' is one in a series of [[mosaic]] scenes, probably dating to the 430s, that decorate the nave wall of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the most prominent [[basilica]]n churches in [[Rome]].  The mosaic shows the story in the biblical [[Book of Genesis]] of the parting of [[Abraham]] from his nephew, [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]], as they choose opposing paths.  Abraham (on the left) with [[Isaac]] and the rest of his family, chooses the road to [[Canaan]], 
as God intends him to, and Lot chooses to take his followers to [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages : A Global History. 13th ed. Belmont: Wadsworth, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is a [[tessera]] mosaic, tessera describing the material making up the surface of the work. Most tessera works during this time would be made up of small pieces of limestone or marble, cut to shape, and arranged by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;"tessera." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 03 Feb. 2009 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/588629/tessera&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
The artist uses several conventions of the time.  The grouping of the characters is varied,  meant to create the illusion of space. This "shorthand" way of depicting a crowd is sometimes called a "head cluster".  There is a hieratic abandonment of consistent and realistic proportions and scale, allowing the artist to put emphasis on the characters of his choosing using attributes like size. The main characters we are intended to focus on are made extremely clear through this method, and the picture itself becomes less illustrative and more symbolic. Eventually this style comes to a refined maturity during the Middle Ages. The move towards completely two-dimensional representative images has already started, and although this mosaic implements the use of lights and darks, with shadows corresponding to the figures, there is a good indication as to what direction religious art is heading.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages : A Global History. 13th ed. Belmont: Wadsworth, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10249">[[File:The last Jew in Vinnitsa, 1941.jpg|thumb|''The last Jew in Vinnitsa'']]'''''The last Jew in Vinnitsa''''' is a photograph taken during [[the Holocaust in Ukraine]] showing a Jewish man near the town of Vinnitsa ([[Vinnytsia]]) about to be shot dead by a member of ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]]'', a mobile [[death squad]] of the Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. The victim is kneeling beside a mass grave already containing many bodies; behind a crowd of SS and [[Reich Labour Service]] men watch.&lt;ref name="pa5355"/&gt;

==History==
The photograph dates from some time between mid-1941, when [[Operation Barbarossa#Ukraine and Moldavia|the Germans occupied]] the [[Vinnytsia Oblast|oblast (region) of Vinnytsia]], and 1943.&lt;ref name="pa5355"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa5355|title=Photograph Number 64407: German soldiers of the Waffen-SS and the Reich Labor Service look on as a member of an Einsatzgruppe prepares to shoot a Ukrainian Jew kneeling on the edge of a mass grave filled with corpses.|work=Collections Search|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period there were numerous massacres of Jews in the oblast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/about/institute/killing_sites_catalog_details_full.asp?region=Vinnitsa|title=Vinnitsa|work=Online Guide of Murder Sites of Jews in the Former USSR|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in the town itself on 16 and 22 September 1941 and April 1942, after which those spared were sent to labour camps and the [[Yerusalimka]] quarter largely razed.&lt;ref name="pa5355"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=686 |title=Vinnitsa, Vinnitsa County, Vinnitsa District, Ukraine |work=The Untold Stories |publisher=Yad Vashem |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.rtrfoundation.org/webart/UK-arch-d2.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Holocaust in Vinnitsa Oblast |last=Vinokurova |first=Faina A. |date=2002 |work=Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova |publisher=Routes to Roots Foundation |pages=332–335 |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photograph was circulated in 1961 by [[United Press]] (UP) during the [[trial of Adolf Eichmann]].&lt;ref name="bulmash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.kenyon.edu/bulmash/1085/|title=2012.1.397 : "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa"|year=2016|work=Bulmash Family Holocaust Collection|publisher=[[Kenyon College]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; UP had received it from Al Moss (b.1910) a Polish Jew who acquired it in May 1945 shortly after he was liberated from [[Allach (concentration camp)|Allach concentration camp]] by the [[American 3rd Army]].&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/vha3081|title=USC Shoah Foundation Institute testimony of Al Moss|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moss, living in Chicago in 1961, wanted people "to know what went on in Eichmann's time".&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt; The UP copy was published over a full page of ''[[The Forward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouzan|first1=Francoise S.|last2=Mikhman|first2=Dan|title=De la mémoire de la Shoah dans le monde juif|year=2008|publisher=CNRS éditions|language=French|isbn=9782271067630|page=306|chapter=La mémoire de la Shoah dans le vécu des Juifs aux Etats-Unis jusqu'au procès Eichmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later sources say that the original physical image was in an ''Einsatzgruppe'' member's photograph album,&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt; or removed from the pocket of a dead soldier;&lt;ref name="Knopp2014"/&gt; and that written on its reverse side was "Last Jew in Vinnitsa",&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson2016"/&gt; now sometimes used as the image's name.&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knopp2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanneh2015"/&gt;

==Significance==
The photograph has become iconic.  Some features are unusual among well-known Holocaust pictures: it was taken during the Holocaust rather than after its end, and presumably by someone complicit in the killing; it depicts ''Einsatzgruppen'' rather than [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration]] or [[extermination camp]]s; the focus is on a solitary victim rather than a multitude.&lt;ref name="Patterson2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gee2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rakitova2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staines2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wollaston2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SollbergerBöning2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boehlke |first=Erik |editor-last1=Sollberger|editor-first1=Daniel |editor-last2=Böning|editor-first2=Jobst |editor-last3=Boehlke|editor-first3=Erik |editor-first4=Gerhard |editor-last4=Schindler |title=Das Geheimnis: Psychologische, psychopathologische und künstlerische Ausdrucksformen im Spektrum zwischen Verheimlichen und Geheimnisvollem |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WgA-DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate=5 April 2018 |date=2016-10-10 |publisher=Frank &amp; Timme  |language=German |isbn=9783732903016 |pages=238–239 |chapter=Geheime Botschaften in Bildern; 5 Entdeckungen bei genauem Hinsehen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tristan Tzara''' ({{IPA-fr|tʁistɑ̃ dzaʁa|lang}}; {{IPA-ro|trisˈtan ˈt͡sara|lang}}; born '''Samuel''' or '''Samy Rosenstock''', also known as '''S. Samyro'''; {{OldStyleDate|16 April|1896|4 April}} &amp;ndash; 25 December 1963) was a Romanian and French [[avant-garde]] poet, essayist and [[performance art]]ist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the [[anti-establishment]] [[Dada]] movement. Under the influence of [[Adrian Maniu]], the adolescent Tzara became interested in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and co-founded the magazine ''[[Simbolul]]'' with [[Ion Vinea]] (with whom he also wrote [[Experimental literature|experimental]] poetry) and painter [[Marcel Janco]]. During [[World War I]], after briefly collaborating on Vinea's ''[[Chemarea]]'', he joined Janco in Switzerland. There, Tzara's shows at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]], as well as his poetry and [[art manifesto]]s, became a main feature of early Dadaism. His work represented Dada's [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by [[Hugo Ball]].

After moving to Paris in 1919, Tzara, by then one of the "presidents of Dada", joined the staff of ''[[Littérature]]'' magazine, which marked the first step in the movement's evolution toward [[Surrealism]]. He was involved in the major polemics which led to Dada's split, defending his principles against [[André Breton]] and [[Francis Picabia]], and, in Romania, against the [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[modernism]] of Vinea and Janco. This personal vision on art defined his Dadaist plays ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (1921) and ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' (1924). A forerunner of [[Surrealist automatism|automatist techniques]], Tzara eventually aligned himself with Breton's Surrealism, and under its influence wrote his celebrated [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian poem]] ''[[The Approximate Man]]''.

During the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a [[Communism|communist]] vision, joining the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the [[Algerian War]].

Tristan Tzara was an influential author and performer, whose contribution is credited with having created a connection from [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] to the [[Beat Generation]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]] and various currents in [[rock music]]. The friend and collaborator of many modernist figures, he was the lover of dancer [[Maja Kruscek]] in his early youth and was later married to Swedish artist and poet [[Greta Knutson]].

==Name==
''S. Samyro'', a partial [[anagram]] of ''Samy Rosenstock'', was used by Tzara from his debut and throughout the early 1910s.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.108-109"&gt;Cernat, p.108-109&lt;/ref&gt; A number of undated writings, which he probably authored as early as 1913, bear the signature ''Tristan Ruia'', and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his pieces with the name ''Tristan''.&lt;ref name="pcern109"&gt;Cernat, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"&gt;{{fr icon}} Jacques-Yves Conrad, [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm ''Promenade surréaliste sur la colline de Montmartre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915053946/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm |date=15 September 2008 }}, at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]] [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ Center for the Study of Surrealism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327041319/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ |date=27 March 2008 }}; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Rosenstock's collaborator and later rival Ion Vinea claimed that he was responsible for coining the ''Tzara'' part of his pseudonym in 1915.&lt;ref name="pcern109"/&gt; Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep ''Tristan'' as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the "infamous pun" ''Triste Âne Tzara'' ([[French language|French]] for "Sad Donkey Tzara").&lt;ref name="pcern109"/&gt; This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations ''Tristan Țara'' and ''Tr. Tzara'', in 1913-1914 (although there is a possibility that he was signing his texts long after committing them to paper).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, art historian [[Serge Fauchereau]], based on information received from Colomba, the wife of avant-garde poet [[Ilarie Voronca]], recounted that Tzara himself had explained his chosen name was a pun in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''trist în țară'', meaning "sad in the country"; Colomba Voronca was also dismissing rumors that Tzara had selected ''Tristan'' as a tribute to poet [[Tristan Corbière]] or to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' opera.&lt;ref name="pcern110"&gt;Cernat, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Samy Rosenstock legally adopted his new name in 1925, after filing a request with Romania's [[Minister of Interior and Administrative Reform (Romania)|Ministry of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="pcern110"/&gt; The French pronunciation of his name has become commonplace in Romania, where it replaces its more natural reading as ''țara'' ("the land", {{IPA-ro|ˈt͡sara}}).&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Andra Matzal, [http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/node/2948 "România-fantomă o să mai existe în forma unei suferințe psihice" (interview with Andrei Codrescu)]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, at [http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/ Club Literatura]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613075708/http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/ |date=13 June 2009 }}, ''[[Cotidianul]]''; retrieved 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and ''Simbolul'' years===
Tzara was born in [[Moinești]], [[Bacău County]], in the [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Western Moldavia]]. His parents were [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanians]] who reportedly spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as their first language;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; his father Filip and grandfather Ilie were entrepreneurs in the forestry business.&lt;ref name="iliv241"&gt;Livezeanu, p.241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vmttcl"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Macarie, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MACARIEnov4.html "Inedit: Tristan Tzara"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309001230/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MACARIEnov4.html |date=9 March 2009 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's mother was Emilia Rosenstock, ''née'' Zibalis.&lt;ref name="vmttcl"/&gt; Owing to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s discrimination laws, the Rosenstocks were not [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipated]], and thus Tzara was not a full citizen of the country until after 1918.&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;

He moved to [[Bucharest]] at the age of 11, and attended the Schemitz-Tierin [[boarding school]].&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt; It is believed that the young Tzara completed his secondary education at a state-run high school, which is identified as the [[Saint Sava National College]]&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt; or as the Sfântul Gheorghe High School.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.48-51&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1912, when Tzara was aged 16, he joined his friends Vinea and Marcel Janco in editing ''[[Simbolul]]''. Reputedly, Janco and Vinea provided the funds.&lt;ref name="pcern99"&gt;Cernat, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Like Vinea, Tzara was also close to their young colleague [[Jacques G. Costin]], who was later his self-declared promoter and admirer.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.186-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their young age, the three editors were able to attract collaborations from established [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] authors, active within [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's own Symbolist movement]]. Alongside their close friend and mentor [[Adrian Maniu]] (an [[Imagism|Imagist]] who had been Vinea's tutor),&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; they included [[N. Davidescu]], [[Alfred Hefter|Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]], [[Emil Isac]], [[Claudia Millian]], [[Ion Minulescu]], [[I. M. Rașcu]], [[Eugeniu Sperantia]], [[Al. T. Stamatiad]], [[Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est]], [[Constantin T. Stoika]], as well as the journalist and lawyer [[Poldi Chapier]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"&gt;Cernat, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; In its inaugural issue, the journal even printed a poem by one of the leading figures in Romanian Symbolism, [[Alexandru Macedonski]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; ''Simbolul'' also featured illustrations by Maniu, Millian and [[Iosif Iser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tzara, Maxy, Vinea, Costin (1915).jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Chemarea]]'' circle in 1915. From left: Tzara, [[M. H. Maxy]], [[Ion Vinea]], and [[Jacques G. Costin]]]]
Although the magazine ceased print in December 1912, it played an important part in shaping [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] of the period. Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] sees ''Simbolul'' as a main stage in Romania's [[modernism]], and credits it with having brought about the first changes from Symbolism to the radical avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49-54, 397-398, 412&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Cernat, the collaboration between Samyro, Vinea and Janco was an early instance of literature becoming "an interface between arts", which had for its contemporary equivalent the collaboration between Iser and writers such as [[Ion Minulescu]] and [[Tudor Arghezi]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maniu parted with the group and sought a change in style which brought him closer to traditionalist tenets, Tzara, Janco and Vinea continued their collaboration. Between 1913 and 1915, they were frequently vacationing together, either on the [[Black Sea]] coast or at the Rosenstock family property in [[Gârceni]], [[Vaslui County]]; during this time, Vinea and Samyro wrote poems with similar themes and alluding to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116-121&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Chemarea'' and 1915 departure===
Tzara's career changed course between 1914 and 1916, during a period when the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] kept out of [[World War I]]. In autumn 1915, as founder and editor of the short-lived journal ''[[Chemarea]]'', Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature ''Tristan Tzara''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97, 106, 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an [[anti-war]] and anti-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] current, which progressively accommodated [[anti-establishment]] messages.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.99, 100-108&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chemarea'', which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea.&lt;ref name="pcern99"/&gt; According to Romanian avant-garde writer [[Claude Sernet]], the journal was "totally different from everything that had been printed in Romania before that moment."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'', and, in June 1915, [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]'s ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'' published Samyro's known poem ''Verișoară, fată de pension'' ("Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl").&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.108-109"/&gt;

Tzara had enrolled at the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1914, studying mathematics and philosophy, but did not graduate.&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ttunifi"&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1020.html "Tristan Tzara"], biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 1915, he left Romania for Zürich, in neutral Switzerland. Janco, together with his brother [[Jules Janco|Jules]], had settled there a few months before, and was later joined by his other brother [[Georges Janco|Georges]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110-111&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara, who may have applied for the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Zurich|local university]],&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrdada"&gt;Marta Ragozzino, "Tristan Tzara", in ''Art e Dossier'', March 1994, Giunti, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; shared lodging with Marcel Janco, who was a student at the ''[[ETH Zurich|Technische Hochschule]]'', in the Altinger Guest House&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; (by 1918, Tzara had moved to the Limmatquai Hotel).&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; His departure from Romania, like that of the Janco brothers, may have been in part a [[Pacifism|pacifist]] political statement.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.132; Livezeanu, p.241, 249&lt;/ref&gt; After settling in Switzerland, the young poet almost completely discarded Romanian as his language of expression, writing most of his subsequent works in French.&lt;ref name="ttunifi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The poems he had written before, which were the result of poetic dialogues between him and his friend, were left in Vinea's care.&lt;ref name="pcern116"&gt;Cernat, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these pieces were first printed only in the [[interwar period]].&lt;ref name="ttunifi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116, 130, 138, 153&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Zürich that the Romanian group met with the [[German Empire|German]] [[Hugo Ball]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] poet and pianist, and his young wife [[Emmy Hennings]], a [[music hall]] performer. In February 1916, Ball had rented the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] from its owner, Jan Ephraim, and intended to use the venue for [[performance art]] and exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110-111; Hofman, p.2; Richter, p.12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo Ball recorded this period, noting that Tzara and Marcel Janco, like [[Hans Arp]], [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]], [[Otto van Rees]], [[Max Oppenheimer]], and [[Marcel Słodki]], "readily agreed to take part in the cabaret."&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14"&gt;Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ball, among the performances of songs mimicking or taking inspiration from various national [[folklore]]s, "Herr Tristan Tzara recited Rumanian poetry&lt;!-- sic --&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111; Gendron, p.73; Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; In late March, Ball recounted, the group was joined by German writer and drummer [[Richard Huelsenbeck]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14"/&gt; He was soon after involved in Tzara's "simultaneist verse" performance, "the first in Zürich and in the world", also including renditions of poems by two promoters of [[Cubism]], [[Fernand Divoire]] and [[Henri Barzun]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of Dada===
[[File:Placa en Cabaret Voltaire retouched.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] plaque commemorating the birth of Dada]]
It was in this milieu that [[Dada]] was born, at some point before May 1916, when a publication of the same name first saw print. The story of its establishment was the subject of a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a [[monocle]], entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his "scandalized spectators", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on [[stilts]], and returning in clown attire.&lt;ref name="pcern112"&gt;Cernat, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; The same type of performances took place at the [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]] beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Gendron, p.73-75; Hofman, p.3; Richter, p.39, 41-44, 48&lt;/ref&gt; According to music historian Bernard Gendron, for as long as it lasted, "the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired."&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[André Gide]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Jean-Pierre Brisset]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jacques Vaché]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] or [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.11, 71-72, 81-100, 168-173&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first of the movement's manifestos, Ball wrote: "[The booklet] is intended to present to the Public the activities and interests of the Cabaret Voltaire, which has as its sole purpose to draw attention, across the barriers of war and nationalism, to the few independent spirits who live for other ideals. The next objective of the artists who are assembled here is to publish a ''revue internationale'' [French for "international magazine"]."&lt;ref name="hrich14"&gt;Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Ball completed his message in French, and the paragraph translates as: "The magazine shall be published in Zürich and shall carry the name 'Dada' ('Dada'). Dada Dada Dada Dada."&lt;ref name="hrich14"/&gt; The view according to which Ball had created the movement was notably supported by writer [[Walter Serner]], who directly accused Tzara of having abused Ball's initiative.&lt;ref name="hrich123"&gt;Richter, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary point of contention between the founders of Dada regarded the paternity for the movement's name, which, according to visual artist and essayist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], was first adopted in print in June 1916.&lt;ref name="hrich32"&gt;Richter, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Ball, who claimed authorship and stated that he picked the word randomly from a dictionary, indicated that it stood for both the French-language equivalent of "[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]" and a [[German language|German-language]] term reflecting the joy of children being rocked to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115-116; Richter, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara himself declined interest in the matter, but Marcel Janco credited him with having coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115-116&lt;/ref&gt; Dada manifestos, written or co-authored by Tzara, record that the name shares its form with various other terms, including a word used in the [[Kru languages]] of [[West Africa]] to designate the tail of a sacred cow; a toy and the name for "mother" in an unspecified [[Regional Italian|Italian dialect]]; and the double affirmative in Romanian and in various [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116; Londré, p.397; Richter, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dadaist promoter===
Before the end of the war, Tzara had assumed a position as Dada's main promoter and manager, helping the Swiss group establish branches in other European countries.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529; Hofman, p.3-4; Cernat, p.115; Livezeanu, p.249-251; Londré, p.396; Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the first conflict within the group: citing irreconcilable differences with Tzara, Ball left the group.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.43, 59&lt;/ref&gt; With his departure, Gendron argues, Tzara was able to move Dada [[vaudeville]]-like performances into more of "an incendiary and yet jocularly provocative theater."&lt;ref name="bgend77"&gt;Gendron, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

He is often credited with having inspired many young modernist authors from outside Switzerland to affiliate with the group, in particular the Frenchmen [[Louis Aragon]], [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] and [[Philippe Soupault]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrich33"&gt;Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who also came into contact with Dada at this stage in its history, notes that these intellectuals often had a "very cool and distant attitude to this new movement" before being approached by the Romanian author.&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; In June 1916, he began editing and managing the periodical ''Dada'' as a successor of the short-lived magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire''—Richter describes his "energy, passion and talent for the job", which he claims satisfied all Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.4; Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the time the lover of [[Maja Kruscek]], who was a student of [[Rudolf Laban]]; in Richter's account, their relationship was always tottering.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.45, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1916, Tristan Tzara took distance from the Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]], rejecting the [[Militarism|militarist]] and proto-[[Italian fascism|fascist]] stance of their leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism as the leader of modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: "we had swallowed Futurism—bones, feathers and all. It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated."&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] and [[Alberto Savinio]], painters [[Gino Cantarelli]] and [[Aldo Fiozzi]], as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.199, 201 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.217)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist [[Julius Evola]], who became a personal friend of Tzara.&lt;ref name="buddevo"&gt;S. Batchelor, "Existence, Enlightenment and Suicide: The Dilemma of Nanavira Thera", in Tadeusz Skorupski (ed.), ''The Buddhist Forum'', Vol. IV (Seminar Papers 1994-1996), [[Routledge]], London, 1996, p.11-13. {{ISBN|0-7286-0255-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, Tzara and Ball opened the ''Galerie Dada'' permanent exhibit, through which they set contacts with the independent Italian visual artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and with the German [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] journal ''[[Der Sturm]]'', all of whom were described as "fathers of Dada".&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.39-40, 46&lt;/ref&gt; During the same months, and probably owing to Tzara's intervention, the Dada group organized a performance of ''Sphinx and Strawman'', a puppet play by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]], whom he advertised as an example of "Dada theater".&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; He was also in touch with ''[[Nord-Sud]]'', the magazine of French poet [[Pierre Reverdy]] (who sought to unify all avant-garde trends),&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; and contributed articles on [[African art]] to both ''Nord-Sud'' and [[Pierre Albert-Birot]]'s ''SIC'' magazine.&lt;ref name="hrich167"&gt;Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1918, through Huelsenbeck, Zürich Dadaists established contacts with their more explicitly [[left-wing]] disciples in the German Empire—[[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Carl Einstein]], [[Franz Jung]], and Heartfield's brother [[Wieland Herzfelde]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.7-8; Richter, p.102-114&lt;/ref&gt; With Breton, Soupault and Aragon, Tzara traveled [[Cologne]], where he became familiarized with the elaborate [[collage]] works of Schwitters and [[Max Ernst]], which he showed to his colleagues in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.137, 155, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Huelsenbeck nonetheless declined to Schwitters membership in Berlin Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.397; Richter, p.137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his campaigning, Tzara created a list of so-called "Dada presidents", who represented various regions of Europe. According to Hans Richter, it included, alongside Tzara himself, figures ranging from Ernst, Arp, Baader, Breton and Aragon to Kruscek, Evola, [[Rafael Lasso de la Vega]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Francesco Meriano]] and [[Théodore Fraenkel]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes: "I'm not sure if all the names who appear here would agree with the description."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.200-201&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of World War I===
The shows Tzara staged in Zürich often turned into scandals or riots, and he was in permanent conflict with the [[Law enforcement in Switzerland|Swiss law enforcers]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.16, 19, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Richter speaks of a "pleasure of letting fly at the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence" (''see [[Épater la bourgeoisie]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized that they were going to fight a [[duel]] in Rehalp, near Zürich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist [[Jakob Christoph Heer]] for their witness.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt; Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective [[propaganda]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.47-48&lt;/ref&gt; While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 ''Vingt-cinq poèmes'' ("Twenty-five Poems").&lt;ref name="rcard530"&gt;Cardinal, p.530&lt;/ref&gt;

A major event took place in autumn 1918, when [[Francis Picabia]], who was then publisher of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' magazine and a distant Dada affiliate, visited Zürich and introduced his colleagues there to his [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] views on art and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.70-74&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], Picabia, [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] had earlier set up their own version of Dada. This circle, based in New York City, sought affiliation with Tzara's only in 1921, when they jokingly asked him to grant them permission to use "Dada" as their own name (to which Tzara replied: "Dada belongs to everybody").&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The visit was credited by Richter with boosting the Romanian author's status, but also with making Tzara himself "switch suddenly from a position of balance between art and [[anti-art]] into the [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] regions of pure and joyful nothingness."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The movement subsequently organized its last major Swiss show, held at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, with choreography by [[Susanne Perrottet]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], and with the participation of [[Käthe Wulff]], [[Hans Heusser]], Tzara, Hans Richter and [[Walter Serner]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.74-78&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that Serner read from his 1918 essay, whose very title advocated ''Letzte Lockerung'' ("Final Dissolution"): this part is believed to have caused the subsequent mêlée, during which the public attacked the performers and succeeded in interrupting, but not canceling, the show.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.78-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the November 1918 [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]], Dada's evolution was marked by political developments. In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and [[Otto Flake]] began publishing ''[[Der Zeltweg]]'', a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"&gt;Richter, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who admits that the magazine was "rather tame", also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing with the impact of [[communist revolution]]s, in particular the [[October Revolution]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German revolts of 1918]], which "had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"/&gt; The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that ''Der Zeltweg'' was "an association of revolutionary artists."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"/&gt; According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of Romanian [[Communism|communist]] students, and, as such, may have met with [[Ana Pauker]], who was later one of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s most prominent activists.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Levy, ''Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, p.37. {{ISBN|0-520-22395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arp and Janco drifted away from the movement ca. 1919, when they created the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]]-inspired workshop ''[[Das Neue Leben]]''.&lt;ref name="pcern115"&gt;Cernat, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.121-123, 181-183&lt;/ref&gt; When Vinea submitted his poem ''Doleanțe'' ("Grievances") to be published by Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Dada===
[[File:Jane Heap, John Rodker, Martha Dennison, Tristan Tzara, Margaret Anderson, ca. 1920s.jpg|thumb|330px|Tzara (second from right) in the 1920s, with [[Margaret C. Anderson]], [[Jane Heap]], and [[John Rodker]]]]
In late 1919, Tristan Tzara left Switzerland to join Breton, Soupault and [[Claude Rivière]] in editing the Paris-based magazine ''[[Littérature]]''.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529-530; Hofman, p.12-14; Richter, p.167, 173&lt;/ref&gt; Already a mentor for the French avant-garde, he was, according to Hans Richter, perceived as an "Anti-[[Messiah]]" and a "prophet".&lt;ref name="hrich168"&gt;Richter, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Dada mythology had it that he entered the French capital in a snow-white or lilac-colored car, passing down [[Boulevard Raspail]] through a [[triumphal arch]] made from his own pamphlets, being greeted by cheering crowds and a fireworks display.&lt;ref name="hrich168"/&gt; Richter dismisses this account, indicating that Tzara actually walked from [[Gare de l'Est]] to Picabia's home, without anyone expecting him to arrive.&lt;ref name="hrich168"/&gt;

He is often described as the main figure in the ''Littérature'' circle, and credited with having more firmly set its artistic principles in the line of Dada.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; When Picabia began publishing a new series of ''391'' in Paris, Tzara seconded him and, Richter says, produced issues of the magazine "decked out [...] in all the colors of Dada."&lt;ref name="hrich167"/&gt; He was also issuing his ''Dada'' magazine, printed in Paris but using the same format, renaming it ''Bulletin Dada'' and later ''Dadaphone''.&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13-14; Richter, p.173, 179-180&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, he met American author [[Gertrude Stein]], who wrote about him in ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"''Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''", in ''The Cambridge Handbook of American Literature'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1986 p.13. {{ISBN|0-521-30703-1}}; Armstrong, p.496&lt;/ref&gt; and the artist couple [[Robert Delaunay|Robert]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]] (with whom he worked in tandem for "poem-dresses" and other simultaneist literary pieces).&lt;ref name="tgdelau"&gt;Tag Gronberg, "Sonia Delaunay's Simultaneous Fashions and the Modern Woman", in Whitney Chadwick, Tirza True Latimer (eds.), ''The Modern Woman Revisited: Paris between the Wars'', [[Rutgers University Press]], Piscataway, p.114-115. {{ISBN|0-8135-3292-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzara became involved in a number of Dada experiments, on which he collaborated with Breton, Aragon, Soupault, Picabia or [[Paul Éluard]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/tzara-tristan "Tristan Tzara 1896–1963"], in Susan Salas, Laura Wisner-Broyles, ''Poetry Criticism'', Vol. 27, Gale Group Inc., 2000, [http://www.enotes.com/ eNotes.com]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.173-176&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors who came into contact with Dada at that stage were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Dermée]] and [[Raymond Radiguet]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; The performances staged by Dada were often meant to popularize its principles, and Dada continued to draw attention on itself by [[hoax]]es and [[false advertising]], announcing that the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film star [[Charlie Chaplin]] was going to appear on stage at its show,&lt;ref name="bgend77"/&gt; or that its members were going to have their heads shaved or their hair cut off on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the ''[[Université populaire]]'' in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.175-176"&gt;Richter, p.175-176&lt;/ref&gt; Richter believes that, ideologically, Tzara was still in tribute to Picabia's nihilistic and anarchic views (which made the Dadaists attack all political and cultural ideologies), but that this also implied a measure of sympathy for the [[working class]].&lt;ref name="Richter, p.175-176"/&gt;

Dada activities in Paris culminated in the March 1920 [[variety show]] at the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]], which featured readings from Breton, Picabia, Dermée and Tzara's earlier work, ''La Première aventure céleste de M. Antipyrine'' ("The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine").&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.398; Richter, p.179-183&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's melody, ''Vaseline symphonique'' ("Symphonic Vaseline"), which required ten or twenty people to shout "cra" and "cri" on a rising scale, was also performed.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; A scandal erupted when Breton read Picabia's ''Manifeste cannibale'' ("Cannibal Manifesto"), lashing out at the audience and mocking them, to which they answered by aiming rotten fruit at the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.180-182&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dada phenomenon was only noticed in Romania beginning in 1920, and its overall reception was negative. Traditionalist historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], Symbolist promoter [[Ovid Densusianu]], the more reserved modernists [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[Benjamin Fondane]] all refused to accept it as a valid artistic manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; Although he rallied with tradition, Vinea defended the subversive current in front of more serious criticism, and rejected the widespread rumor that Tzara had acted as an [[agent of influence]] for the [[Central Powers]] during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugen Lovinescu]], editor of ''[[Sburătorul]]'' and one of Vinea's rivals on the modernist scene, acknowledged the influence exercised by Tzara on the younger avant-garde authors, but analyzed his work only briefly, using as an example one of his pre-Dada poems, and depicting him as an advocate of literary "extremism".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.126-127, 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada stagnation===
[[File:St-Julien-le-Pauvre &amp; houses.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]], site of the 1921 "Dada excursion"]]
By 1921, Tzara had become involved in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted with the spirit of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127-128; Richter, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt; He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with [[Raoul Hausmann]] over leadership status.&lt;ref name="hrich123"/&gt; According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.182-183, 192-193&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;

A more serious crisis occurred in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of [[Maurice Barrès]], whose early affiliation with the Symbolists had been shadowed by his [[antisemitism]] and [[reactionary]] stance: [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, [[Benjamin Péret]] and others as witnesses (a [[mannequin]] stood in for Barrès).&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184-186&lt;/ref&gt; Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184-185&lt;/ref&gt; During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, [[Maja Kruschek]] and Tzara were in Austria, at [[Imst]], where they published their last manifesto as a group, ''Dada au grand air'' ("Dada in the Open Air") or ''Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol'' ("The Battle of the Singers in [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]").&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.186 (illustration 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara also visited [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Czechoslovakia]], where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1921, Ion Vinea wrote an article for the Romanian newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]'', arguing that the movement had exhausted itself (although, in his letters to Tzara, he continued to ask his friend to return home and spread his message there).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127-128&lt;/ref&gt; After July 1922, Marcel Janco rallied with Vinea in editing ''[[Contimporanul]]'', which published some of Tzara's earliest poems but never offered space to any Dadaist manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.130, 138, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the conflict between Tzara and Janco had a personal note: Janco later mentioned "some dramatic quarrels" between his colleague and him.&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; They avoided each other for the rest of their lives and Tzara even struck out the dedications to Janco from his early poems.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115, 137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Evola]] also grew disappointed by the movement's total rejection of tradition and began his personal search for an alternative, pursuing a path which later led him to [[esotericism]] and fascism.&lt;ref name="buddevo"/&gt;

===''Evening of the Bearded Heart''===
[[File:Theo van Doesburg kleine Dada soirée.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Theo van Doesburg]]'s poster for a Dada soirée (ca.1923)]]
Tzara was openly attacked by Breton in a February 1922 article for ''[[Le Journal de Peuple]]'', where the Romanian writer was denounced as "an impostor" avid for "publicity".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.114; Richter, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Breton initiated the ''Congress for the Determination and Defense of the Modern Spirit''. The French writer used the occasion to strike out Tzara's name from among the Dadaists, citing in his support Dada's Huelsenbeck, Serner, and [[Christian Schad]].&lt;ref name="pcern114"&gt;Cernat, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Basing his statement on a note supposedly authored by Huelsenbeck, Breton also accused Tzara of opportunism, claiming that he had planned wartime editions of Dada works in such a manner as not to upset actors on the political stage, making sure that German Dadaists were not made available to the public in countries subject to the [[Supreme War Council]].&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; Tzara, who attended the Congress only as a means to subvert it,&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; responded to the accusations the same month, arguing that Huelsenbeck's note was fabricated and that Schad had not been one of the original Dadaists.&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; Rumors reported much later by American writer [[Brion Gysin]] had it that Breton's claims also depicted Tzara as an informer for the [[Prefecture of Police]].&lt;ref name="nzgysin"&gt;[[Nicholas Zurbrugg]], "Brion Gysin", in ''Art, Performance, Media: 31 Interviews'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], Minneapolis, p.190. {{ISBN|0-8166-3832-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1922, Dada staged its own funeral.&lt;ref name="Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191"&gt;Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hans Richter, the main part of this took place in [[Weimar]], where the Dadaists attended a festival of the [[Bauhaus]] art school, during which Tzara proclaimed the elusive nature of his art: "Dada is useless, like everything else in life. [...] Dada is a virgin microbe which penetrates with the insistence of air into all those spaces that reason has failed to fill with words and conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Bearded Heart" manifesto a number of artists backed the marginalization of Breton in support of Tzara. Alongside Cocteau, Arp, Ribemont-Dessaignes, and Éluard, the pro-Tzara faction included [[Erik Satie]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Serge Charchoune]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Ilia Zdanevich]], and [[Man Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; During an associated soirée, ''Evening of the Bearded Heart'', which began on 6 July 1923, Tzara presented a re-staging of his play ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (which had been first performed two years earlier to howls of derision from its audience), for which [[Sonia Delaunay]] designed the costumes.&lt;ref name="tgdelau"/&gt; Breton interrupted its performance and reportedly fought with several of his former associates and broke furniture, prompting a theatre riot that only the intervention of the police halted.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Dada's vaudeville declined in importance and disappeared altogether after that date.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

Picabia took Breton's side against Tzara,&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.15; Richter, p.188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced the staff of his ''391'', enlisting collaborations from [[Clément Pansaers]] and [[Ezra Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; Breton marked the end of Dada in 1924, when he issued the first ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. Richter suggests that "Surrealism devoured and digested Dada."&lt;ref name="Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191"/&gt; Tzara distanced himself from new trend, disagreeing with its methods and, increasingly, with its politics.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239-240&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, he and a few other former Dadaists collaborated with Richter and the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] artist [[El Lissitzky]] on the magazine ''G'',&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, in Richter, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; and, the following year, he wrote pieces for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]-[[Slovenia]]n magazine ''Tank'' (edited by [[Ferdinand Delak]]).&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to Surrealism===
[[File:Paris 18 - Maison Tristan Tzara -1.JPG|thumb|230px|''Maison Tzara'', designed by [[Adolf Loos]]]]
Tzara continued to write, becoming more seriously interested in the theater. In 1924, he published and staged the play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', which was soon included in the repertoire of [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s ''[[Ballets Russes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Garafola, ''Legacies of Twentieth-century Dance'', [[Wesleyan University Press]], Middletown, 2005, p.172. {{ISBN|0-8195-6674-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also collected his earlier Dada texts as the ''Seven Dada Manifestos''. [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinker [[Henri Lefebvre]] reviewed them enthusiastically; he later became one of the author's friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Jay]], ''Marxism and Totality: the Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1984, p.293 {{ISBN|0-520-05742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, Tzara's work was partly recuperated by ''Contimporanul'', which notably staged public readings of his works during the international art exhibit it organized in 1924, and again during the "new art demonstration" of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.153, 156, 159, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the short-lived magazine ''Integral'', where [[Ilarie Voronca]] and [[Ion Călugăru]] were the main animators, took significant interest in Tzara's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239-240, 277, 279, 287&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1927 interview with the publication, he voiced his opposition to the Surrealist group's adoption of communism, indicating that such politics could only result in a "new bourgeoisie" being created, and explaining that he had opted for a personal "[[permanent revolution]]", which would preserve "the holiness of the ego".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in [[Stockholm]], where he married [[Greta Knutson]], with whom he had a son, Christophe (born 1927).&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; A former student of painter [[André Lhote]], she was known for her interest in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[abstract art]].&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"&gt;"Greta Knutson", in [[Penelope Rosemont]], ''[[Surrealist Women]]'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], London &amp; New York, 1998, p.69. {{ISBN|0-485-30088-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned [[Austria]]n architect [[Adolf Loos]], a former representative of the [[Vienna Secession]] whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; The rigidly [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] ''Maison Tristan Tzara'', built in [[Montmartre]], was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of [[African art]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;

In 1929, he reconciled with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris.&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; The same year, he issued the poetry book ''De nos oiseaux'' ("Of Our Birds").&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; This period saw the publication of ''[[The Approximate Man]]'' (1931), alongside the volumes ''L'Arbre des voyageurs'' ("The Travelers' Tree", 1930), ''Où boivent les loups'' ("Where Wolves Drink", 1932), ''L'Antitête'' ("The Antihead", 1933) and ''Grains et issues'' ("Seed and Bran", 1935).&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; By then, it was also announced that Tzara had started work on a screenplay.&lt;ref name="pcern277"&gt;Cernat, p.277&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he directed and produced a cinematic version of ''Le Cœur à barbe'', starring Breton and other leading Surrealists.&lt;ref name="ttzimdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0879262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, he signed his name to ''The Testimony against [[Gertrude Stein]]'', published by [[Eugene Jolas]]'s magazine ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]'' in reply to Stein's memoir ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',&lt;!-- sic --&gt; in which he accused his former friend of being a [[megalomania]]c.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p.496&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet became involved in further developing [[Surrealist techniques]], and, together with Breton and [[Valentine Hugo]], drew one of the better-known examples of "[[exquisite corpse]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ion Biberi]], ''Arta suprarealistă'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1973, p.53. {{OCLC|22905196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara also prefaced a 1934 collection of Surrealist poems by his friend [[René Char]], and the following year he and Greta Knutson visited Char in [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]].&lt;ref&gt;"René Char Bio-Bibliography", in ''Selected Poems of René Char'' (edited by [[Mary Ann Caws]] and Tina Jolas), [[New Directions Publishers]], New York, 1992, p.xii. {{ISBN|0-8112-1191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's wife was also affiliated with the Surrealist group at around the same time.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"/&gt; This association ended when she parted with Tzara late in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"/&gt;

At home, Tzara's works were collected and edited by the Surrealist promoter [[Sașa Pană]], who corresponded with him over several years.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 106, 109, 116; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.154-155&lt;/ref&gt; The first such edition saw print in 1934, and featured the 1913-1915 poems Tzara had left in Vinea's care.&lt;ref name="pcern116"/&gt; In 1928-1929, Tzara exchanged letters with his friend [[Jacques G. Costin]], a ''Contimporanul'' affiliate who did not share all of Vinea's views on literature, who offered to organize his visit to Romania and asked him to translate his work into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.192-194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliation with communism and Spanish Civil War===

Alarmed by the establishment of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of [[anti-fascism]], and was close to the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by [[Kurt Schwitters]] in [[Hanover]], works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, [[ration stamp]] with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he briefly left France and joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican forces]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.245-246&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] reporter [[Ilya Ehrenburg]], Tzara visited [[Madrid]], which was besieged by the [[Spain under Franco|Nationalists]] (''see [[Siege of Madrid]]'').&lt;ref name="iliv246"&gt;Livezeanu, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, he published the collection of poems ''Midis gagnés'' ("Conquered Southern Regions").&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; Some of them had previously been printed in the brochure ''Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol'' ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists, [[Nancy Cunard]] and the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Robin Suleiman, "Committed Painting", in Denis Hollier (ed.), ''A New History of French Literature'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 1994, p.938. {{ISBN|0-674-61566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara had also signed Cunard's June 1937 call to intervention against [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster, ''Brian Howard: Portrait of a Failure'', Timewell Press, London, 2005, p.221. {{ISBN|1-85725-211-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he and Nancy Cunard were romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Weber, "Nancy Cunard: a Troubled Heiress with an Ideological Mission", in ''[[Int. Her. Trib.|The International Herald Tribune]]'', 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the poet was moving away from Surrealism,&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; his adherence to strict [[Marxism-Leninism]] was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="pbeit49"&gt;Beitchman, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics|Semiotician]] Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of [[Utopia]], which combined communist messages with [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] [[psychoanalysis]] and made use of particularly violent imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.48-49&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the [[party line (politics)|party line]], maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.&lt;ref name="spbuot"&gt;{{ro icon}} Sorin Pop, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/*articleID_9669-articles_details.html "François Buot, Tristan Tzara. Omul care a pus la cale revoluția Dada"] (book review), in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 195, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others note that the former Dadaist leader would often show himself a follower of political guidelines. As early as 1934, Tzara, together with Breton, Éluard and communist writer [[René Crevel]], organized an informal trial of independent-minded Surrealist [[Salvador Dalí]], who was at the time a confessed admirer of Hitler, and whose portrait of [[William Tell]] had alarmed them because it shared likeness with [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Rojas, ''Salvador Dalí, or the Art of Spitting on Your Mother's Portrait'', [[Penn State University Press]], University Park, 1993, p.98. {{ISBN|0-271-00842-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Irina Livezeanu]] notes that Tzara, who agreed with [[Stalinism]] and shunned [[Trotskyism]], submitted to the PCF cultural demands during the writers' congress of 1935, even when his friend Crevel committed suicide to protest the adoption of [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="iliv251"&gt;Livezeanu, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; At a later stage, Livezeanu remarks, Tzara reinterpreted Dada and Surrealism as revolutionary currents, and presented them as such to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.247-249&lt;/ref&gt; This stance she contrasts with that of Breton, who was more reserved in his attitudes.&lt;ref name="iliv251"/&gt;

===World War II and Resistance===
During [[World War II]], Tzara took refuge from the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation forces]], moving to the southern areas, controlled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; On one occasion, the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] publication ''[[Je Suis Partout]]'' made his whereabouts known to the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.marianne2.fr/Tristan-Tzara,-radical,-mondain-et-anticonformiste_a41229.html?PHPSESSID=c3682e2fb29f923d2fc35498af3a6907 "Tristan Tzara, radical, mondain et anticonformiste"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'', 13 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

He was in [[Marseille]] in late 1940-early 1941, joining the group of anti-fascist and Jewish refugees who, protected by American diplomat [[Varian Fry]], were seeking to escape [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]. Among the people present there were the anti-[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] socialist [[Victor Serge]], anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], playwright [[Arthur Adamov]], philosopher and poet [[René Daumal]], and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and [[Benjamin Péret]], as well as artists [[Max Ernst]], [[André Masson]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Jacques Hérold]], [[Victor Brauner]] and [[Óscar Domínguez]].&lt;ref name="dgmarse"&gt;Danièle Giraudy, Musée de Marseille (eds.), ''Le jeu de Marseille: autour d'André Breton et des surréalistes à Marseille en 1940-1941'', Éditions Alors Hors du Temps, Marseille, p.79sqq&lt;/ref&gt; During the months spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new [[card game]], on which traditional card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.&lt;ref name="dgmarse"/&gt;

Some time after his stay in Marseille, Tzara joined the [[French Resistance]], rallying with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]. A contributor to magazines published by the Resistance, Tzara also took charge of the cultural broadcast for the [[Free French Forces]] clandestine radio station.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He lived in [[Aix-en-Provence]], then in [[Souillac, Lot|Souillac]], and ultimately in [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; His son Cristophe was at the time a Resistant in northern France, having joined the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]''.&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt; In [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-allied and antisemitic Romania (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), the regime of [[Ion Antonescu]] ordered bookstores not to sell works by Tzara and 44 other Jewish-Romanian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radu Ioanid]], "The Romanian Press: Preparing the Ground for the Holocaust and Reporting on Its Implementation", in Robert Moses Shapiro, ''Why Didn't the Press Shout?: American and International Journalism during the Holocaust'', Ktav, Hoboken, 2003, p.404. {{ISBN|0-88125-775-3}}; {{ro icon}} Liviu Rotman (ed.), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110818231335/http://jewishfed.ro/fcer/public_html/downloads/carti/Demnitate.pdf Demnitate în vremuri de restriște]'', [[Editura Hasefer]], [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] &amp; [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]], Bucharest, 2008, p.174-175. {{ISBN|978-973-630-189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, with the generalization of antisemitic measures, Tzara was also stripped of his Romanian citizenship rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Niculescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=23639 "Destinul excepțional al lui Alexandru Șafran"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 523, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1944, five months after the [[Liberation of Paris]], he was contributing to ''[[L'Éternelle Revue]]'', a pro-communist newspaper edited by philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], through which Sartre was publicizing the heroic image of a France united in resistance, as opposed to the perception that it had passively accepted German control.&lt;ref name="srsmemor"&gt;Susan Rubin Suleiman, ''Crises of Memory and the Second World War'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 2006, p.30-31. {{ISBN|0-674-02206-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributors included writers Aragon, Char, Éluard, [[Elsa Triolet]], [[Eugène Guillevic]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Francis Ponge]], [[Jacques Prévert]] and painter [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref name="srsmemor"/&gt;

Upon the end of the war and the restoration of French independence, Tzara was [[Naturalization|naturalized]] a French citizen.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; During 1945, under the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], he was a representative of the Sud-Ouest region to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name="iliv246"/&gt; According to Livezeanu, he "helped reclaim the [[Southern France|South]] from the cultural figures who had associated themselves to Vichy [France]."&lt;ref name="iliv251"/&gt; In April 1946, his early poems, alongside similar pieces by Breton, Éluard, Aragon and Dalí, were the subject of a midnight broadcast on [[Radio in Paris|Parisian Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;"Drop Everything, Drop Dado", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 8 April 1946&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he became a full member of the PCF&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; (according to some sources, he had been one since 1934).&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;

===International leftism===
Over the following decade, Tzara lent his support to political causes. Pursuing his interest in [[primitivism]], he became a critic of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]'s [[French colonial empires|colonial policy]], and joined his voice to those who supported [[decolonization]].&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; Nevertheless, he was appointed [[cultural ambassador]] of the Republic by the [[Paul Ramadier]] cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.244, 246, 247&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in the PCF-organized Congress of Writers, but, unlike Éluard and Aragon, again avoided adapting his style to [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;

He returned to Romania on an official visit in late 1946-early 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.113; Livezeanu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"&gt;{{ro icon}} János Farkas, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=154 "Tristan Tzara în Ungaria.

In 1949-1950, Tzara answered Aragon's call and become active in the international campaign to liberate [[Nazım Hikmet]], a [[Turkey|Turkish]] poet whose 1938 arrest for communist activities had created a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' for the pro-Soviet public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.212, 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcmusic"&gt;Mark Carroll, ''Music and Ideology in Cold War Europe'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2003, p.52. {{ISBN|0-521-82072-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara chaired the Committee for the Liberation of Nazım Hikmet, which issued petitions to national governments&lt;ref name="mcmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned works in honor of Hikmet (including musical pieces by [[Louis Durey]] and [[Serge Nigg]]).&lt;ref name="mcmusic"/&gt; Hikmet was eventually released in July 1950, and publicly thanked Tzara during his subsequent visit to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.318&lt;/ref&gt;

His works of the period include, among others: ''Le Signe de vie'' ("Sign of Life", 1946), ''Terre sur terre'' ("Earth on Earth", 1946), ''Sans coup férir'' ("Without a Need to Fight", 1949), ''De mémoire d'homme'' ("From a Man's Memory", 1950), ''Parler seul'' ("Speaking Alone", 1950), and ''La Face intérieure'' ("The Inner Face", 1953), followed in 1955 by ''À haute flamme'' ("Flame out Loud") and ''Le Temps naissant'' ("The Nascent Time"), and the 1956 ''Le Fruit permis'' ("The Permitted Fruit").&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="imjbokks"&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/dada_surrealism/pdf/books%20from%20schwarz%20catalog-3.pdf ''Books in the Vera and Arturo Schwarz Collection''], at the [[Israel Museum]]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara continued to be an active promoter of modernist culture. Around 1949, having read [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[Samuel Beckett]]'s manuscript of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', Tzara facilitated the play's staging by approaching producer [[Roger Blin]].&lt;ref name="dbgodot"&gt;[[David Bradby]], ''Beckett: Waiting for Godot'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2001, p.46. {{ISBN|0-521-59510-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated into French some poems by Hikmet&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Vargaftig (ed.), ''Poésies de Résistence'', J'ai lu, Paris, 1994. {{ISBN|2-277-23767-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hungarian author [[Attila József]].&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; In 1949, he introduced Picasso to art dealer [[Heinz Berggruen]] (thus helping start their lifelong partnership),&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding
"Obituary: Heinz Berggruen, Noted Art Dealer and Collector", in ''[[Int. Her. Trib.|The International Herald Tribune]]'', 26 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1951, wrote the catalog for an exhibit of works by his friend [[Max Ernst]]; the text celebrated the artist's "free use of stimuli" and "his discovery of a new kind of humor."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

===1956 protest and final years===
[[File:Tristan Tzara grave.jpg|thumb|240px|Tzara's grave in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]
In October 1956, Tzara visited the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], where the government of [[Imre Nagy]] was coming into conflict with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; This followed an invitation on the part of Hungarian writer [[Gyula Illyés]], who wanted his colleague to be present at ceremonies marking the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of [[László Rajk]] (a local communist leader whose prosecution had been ordered by [[Joseph Stalin]]).&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; Tzara was receptive of the Hungarians' demand for [[liberalization]],&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; contacted the anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and former Dadaist [[Lajos Kassák]], and deemed the anti-Soviet movement "revolutionary".&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; However, unlike much of Hungarian public opinion, the poet did not recommend emancipation from Soviet control, and described the independence demanded by local writers as "an abstract notion".&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; The statement he issued, widely quoted in the Hungarian and international press, forced a reaction from the PCF: through Aragon's reply, the party deplored the fact that one of its members was being used in support of "[[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and anti-Soviet campaigns."&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt;

His return to France coincided with the outbreak of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], which ended with a Soviet military intervention. On 24 October, Tzara was ordered to a PCF meeting, where activist [[Laurent Casanova]] reportedly ordered him to keep silent, which Tzara did.&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; Tzara's apparent dissidence and the crisis he helped provoke within the Communist Party were celebrated by Breton, who had adopted a pro-Hungarian stance, and who defined his friend and rival as "the first spokesman of the Hungarian demand."&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt;

He was thereafter mostly withdrawn from public life, dedicating himself to researching the work of 15th-century poet [[François Villon]],&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; and, like his fellow Surrealist [[Michel Leiris]], to promoting [[Primitivism|primitive]] and [[African art]], which he had been collecting for years.&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt; In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the [[Rive Gauche]], which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde [[Mouvement Jariviste]], an outcome which reportedly pleased him.&lt;ref&gt;"Battle of the Nihilists", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 8 April 1957&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1960, one year after the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] had been established by [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], French forces were confronting the Algerian rebels (''see [[Algerian War]]''). Together with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Jérôme Lindon]], [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and other intellectuals, he addressed [[Prime Minister of France|Premier]] [[Michel Debré]] a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence.&lt;ref name="laduras"&gt;[[Laure Adler]], ''Marguerite Duras: A Life'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 2000, p.233-234. {{ISBN|0-226-00758-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[André Malraux]] announced that his cabinet would not subsidize any films to which Tzara and the others might contribute, and the signatories could no longer appear on stations managed by the state-owned [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|French Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref name="laduras"/&gt;

In 1961, as recognition for his work as a poet, Tzara was awarded the prestigious [[Taormina Prize]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; One of his final public activities took place in 1962, when he attended the [[International Congress on African Culture]], organized by English curator [[Frank McEwen]] and held at the [[National Gallery of Zimbabwe|National Gallery]] in [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], ''Africa Remix: Contemporary Art of a Continent'', [[Jacana Media]], 2007, p.227. {{ISBN|1-77009-363-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died one year later in his Paris home, and was buried at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;

==Literary contributions==

===Identity issues===
Much critical commentary about Tzara surrounds the measure to which the poet identified with the national cultures which he represented. Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] colleagues, was one sign of a cultural dialogue, in which "the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity" was stimulated by "young emancipated Jewish writers."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of [[Yiddish literature]], argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and [[Hasidic philosophy]] shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35-36&lt;/ref&gt; while American poet [[Andrei Codrescu]] speaks of Tzara as one in a [[Balkans|Balkan]] line of "absurdist writing", which also includes the Romanians [[Urmuz]], [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Emil Cioran]].&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Samyro's early poems deal with "the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into [[ghetto]]s."&lt;ref name="gcal887"&gt;Călinescu, p.887&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzara himself used elements alluding to his homeland in his early Dadaist performances. His collaboration with [[Maja Kruscek]] at [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zuntfhaus zür Waag]] featured samples of [[African literature]], to which Tzara added Romanian-language fragments.&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt; He is also known to have mixed elements of [[Romanian folklore]], and to have sung the native suburban [[romanza]] ''La moară la Hârța'' ("At the Mill in Hârța") during at least one staging for Cabaret Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.182, 405&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the Romanian public in 1947, he claimed to have been captivated by "the sweet language of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavian]] peasants".&lt;ref name="iliv246"/&gt;

Tzara nonetheless rebelled against his birthplace and upbringing. His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place. In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also belonged to the avant-garde trend, notably [[Benjamin Fondane]] and [[George Bacovia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; Like in the cases of Eugène Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to [[Western Europe]] as a "modern, [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]]" means of breaking with "the peripheral condition",&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; which may also serve to explain the pun he selected for a pseudonym.&lt;ref name="pcern110"/&gt; According to the same author, two important elements in this process were "a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority", an "[[Oedipus complex]]" which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to [[Mateiu Caragiale]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Vinea and the ''[[Contimporanul]]'' group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.398, 403-405&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing nationalisms, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with [[Zürich]] serving as a stage on his way to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt; The 1916 ''Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto'' featured a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] appeal: "DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates."&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt;

With time, Tristan Tzara came to be regarded by his Dada associates as an exotic character, whose attitudes were intrinsically linked with [[Eastern Europe]]. Early on, Ball referred to him and the Janco brothers as "Orientals".&lt;ref name="pcern112"/&gt; [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] believed him to be a fiery and impulsive figure, having little in common with his German collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.112; Richter, p.18-20, 24, 36, 37, 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cernat, Richter's perspective seems to indicate a vision of Tzara having a "[[Italic peoples|Latin]]" temperament.&lt;ref name="pcern112"/&gt; This type of perception also had negative implications for Tzara, particularly after the 1922 split within Dada. In the 1940s, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] alleged that his former colleague had always been separated from other Dadaists by his failure to appreciate the legacy of "[[Humanism in Germany|German humanism]]", and that, compared to his German colleagues, he was "a barbarian".&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; In his polemic with Tzara, Breton also repeatedly placed stress on his rival's foreign origin.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.114, 115; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

At home, Tzara was occasionally targeted for his Jewishness, culminating in the ban enforced by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime. In 1931, [[Const. I. Emilian]], the first Romanian to write an academic study on the avant-garde, attacked him from a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] position. He depicted Dadaists as "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Judaeo-Bolsheviks]]" who corrupted [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and included Tzara among the main proponents of "literary anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.296, 299, 307, 309-310, 329&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Tzara's only merit was to establish a literary fashion, while recognizing his "formal virtuosity and artistic intelligence", he claimed to prefer Tzara in his ''[[Simbolul]]'' stage.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.310&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective was deplored early on by the modernist critic [[Perpessicius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years after Emilian's polemic text, [[Fascism|fascist]] poet and journalist [[Radu Gyr]] published an article in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', in which he attacked Tzara as a representative of the "[[Judaism|Judaic]] spirit", of the "foreign plague" and of "[[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]-[[Historical materialism|historical dialectics]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptă românească'', [[Editura Fundației Culturale Române]], Bucharest, 1995, p.457. {{ISBN|973-9155-43-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist poetry===
Tzara's earliest [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolist poems]], published in ''Simbolul'' during 1912, were later rejected by their author, who asked [[Sașa Pană]] not to include them in editions of his works.&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; The influence of French Symbolists on the young Samyro was particularly important, and surfaced in both his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Prose poetry|prose poems]].&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to Symbolist [[musicality]] at that stage, he was indebted to his ''Simbolul'' colleague [[Ion Minulescu]]&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49; Emil Manu, "Actualitatea lui Ion Minulescu", in [[Ion Minulescu]], ''Versuri și proză'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1986, p.8. {{OCLC|18090790}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Belgian [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; Philip Beitchman argues that "Tristan Tzara is one of the writers of the twentieth century who was most profoundly influenced by symbolism—and utilized many of its methods and ideas in the pursuit of his own artistic and social ends."&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cernat believes, the young poet was by then already breaking with the [[syntax]] of conventional poetry, and that, in subsequent experimental pieces, he progressively stripped his style of its Symbolist elements.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s, Samyro experimented with Symbolist imagery, in particular with the "hanged man" motif, which served as the basis for his poem ''Se spânzură un om'' ("A Man Hangs Himself"), and which built on the legacy of similar pieces authored by [[Christian Morgenstern]] and [[Jules Laforgue]].&lt;ref name="pcern52"&gt;Cernat, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; ''Se spânzură un om'' was also in many ways similar to ones authored by his collaborators [[Adrian Maniu]] (''Balada spânzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Ballad") and Vinea (''Visul spânzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Dream"): all three poets, who were all in the process of discarding Symbolism, interpreted the theme from a [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] and [[iconoclastic]] perspective.&lt;ref name="pcern52"/&gt; These pieces also include ''Vacanță în provincie'' ("Provincial Holiday") and the [[anti-war]] fragment ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' ("The Storm and the Deserter's Song"), which Vinea published in his ''Chemarea''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97-98, 106&lt;/ref&gt; The series is seen by Cernat as "the general rehearsal for the Dada adventure."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; The complete text of ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' was published at a later stage, after the missing text was discovered by Pană.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he became interested in the [[free verse]] work of the American [[Walt Whitman]], and his translation of Whitman's [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Song of Myself]]'', probably completed before [[World War I]], was published by [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]] in his magazine ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

Beitchman notes that, throughout his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism. Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate a memory of historical events, "since it deludes man into thinking that there was something when there was nothing."&lt;ref name="pbeit29"&gt;Beitchman, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Cernat notes: "That which essentially unifies, during [the 1910s], the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to [[Aestheticism|calophile]] literature, which they perceived as exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Comte de Lautréamont]].&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.38-39, 46&lt;/ref&gt; According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, "the birthright [of humans] has been sold for a mess of porridge", taking it "into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back."&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with Vinea===
The transition to a more radical form of poetry seems to have taken place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.117, 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the lyrics were they both speak of provincial holidays and love affairs with local girls, both friends intended to reinterpret [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' from a modernist perspective, and wrote incomplete texts with this as their subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.109, 119, 160&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul Cernat notes, the texts also evidence a difference in approach, with Vinea's work being "meditative and melancholic", while Tzara's is "[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]".&lt;ref name="pcern117"&gt;Cernat, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara often appealed to revolutionary and ironic images, portraying provincial and [[middle class]] environments as places of artificiality and decay, demystifying [[pastoral]] themes and evidencing a will to break free.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.117-119&lt;/ref&gt; His literature took a more radical perspective on life, and featured lyrics with subversive intent:

care-i Dumnezeu când cască}}&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;
|
let's descend into the precipice

In his ''Înserează'' (roughly, "Night Falling"), probably authored in [[Mangalia]], Tzara writes:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|[...] deschide-te fereastră, prin urmare
și ieși noapte din odaie ca din piersică sâmburul, 
ca preotul din biserică
[...] hai în parcul communal

să se scandalizeze orașul [...].}}&lt;ref name="pcern117"/&gt;

[...] open yourself therefore, window
and you night, spring out of the room like a kernel from the peach,
like a priest from the church
[...] let's go to the community park
before the rooster starts crowing
so that the city will be scandalized [...]}}

Vinea's similar poem, written in [[Tuzla, Constanța|Tuzla]] and named after that village, reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|seara bate semne pe far
peste goarnele vagi de apă
când se întorc pescarii cu stele pe mâini
și trec vapoarele și planetele}}&lt;ref name="pcern117"/&gt;

over the vague bugles of water
when fishermen return with stars on their arms
and ships and planets pass by}}

Cernat notes that ''Nocturnă'' ("Nocturne") and ''Înserează'' were the pieces originally performed at [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], identified by [[Hugo Ball]] as "Rumanian poetry",&lt;!-- sic --&gt; and that they were recited in Tzara's own spontaneous French translation.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111, 120&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are noted for their radical break with the traditional form of Romanian verse,&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dennis Deletant]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-01-12&amp;art=3373 "Întoarcerea României în Europa: între politică și cultură"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021120445/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=3373&amp;nr=2007-01-12 |date=21 October 2007 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 879, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ball's diary entry of 5 February 1916, indicates that Tzara's works were still "conservative in style".&lt;ref name="hrich16"&gt;Richter, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; In Călinescu's view, they announce Dadaism, given that "bypassing the relations which lead to a realistic vision, the poet associates unimaginably dissipated images that will surprise consciousness."&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; In 1922, Tzara himself wrote: "As early as 1914, I tried to strip the words of their proper meaning and use them in such a way as to give the verse a completely new, general, meaning [...]."&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"/&gt;

Alongside pieces depicting a Jewish cemetery in which graves "crawl like worms" on the edge of a town, chestnut trees "heavy-laden like people returning from hospitals", or wind wailing "with all the hopelessness of an orphanage",&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; Samyro's poetry includes ''Verișoară, fată de pension'', which, Cernat argues, displays "playful detachment [for] the musicality of [[internal rhyme]]s".&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; It opens with the lyrics:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Verișoară, fată de pension, îmbrăcată în negru, guler alb,
Te iubesc pentru că ești simplă și visezi
Și ești bună, plângi, și rupi scrisori ce nu au înțeles
Și-ți pare rău că ești departe de ai tăi și că înveți 
La Călugărițe unde noaptea nu e cald.}}&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt;
|
Little cousin, boarding school girl, dressed in black, white collar,
I love you because you are simple and you dream
And you are kind, you cry, you tear up letters that have no meaning
And you feel bad because you are far from yours and you study
At the Nuns where at night it's not warm.}}

The [[Gârceni]] pieces were treasured by the moderate wing of the Romanian avant-garde movement. In contrast to his previous rejection of Dada, ''[[Contimporanul]]'' collaborator [[Benjamin Fondane]] used them as an example of "pure poetry", and compared them to the elaborate writings of French poet [[Paul Valéry]], thus recuperating them in line with the magazine's ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.153, 288; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.62-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada synthesis and "simultaneism"===
Tzara the Dadaist was inspired by the contributions of his experimental modernist predecessors. Among them were the literary promoters of [[Cubism]]: in addition to [[Henri Barzun]] and [[Fernand Divoire]], Tzara cherished the works of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, in Richter, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Dada's condemnation of [[Futurism]], various authors note the influence [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and his circle exercised on Tzara's group.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396; Richter, p.19, 191 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.216-217)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, he was in correspondence with both Apollinaire&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529; Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; and Marinetti.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Tzara is also seen as indebted to the early avant-garde and [[black comedy]] writings of Romania's [[Urmuz]].&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.128-129, 341, 343, 346; Amy D. Colin, "Paul Celan's Poetics of Destruction", in Amy D. Colin (ed.), ''Argumentum E Silentio'', [[Walter de Gruyter]], Berlin, 1987, p.158. {{ISBN|3-11-010555-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a large part, Dada focused on performances and [[satire]], with shows that often had Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbeck for their main protagonists. Often dressed up as [[German Tyrol|Tyrolian]] peasants or wearing dark robes, they improvised poetry sessions at the Cabaret Voltaire, reciting the works of others or their spontaneous creations, which were or pretended to be in [[Esperanto]] or [[Māori language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.113, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Gendron describes these soirées as marked by "heterogeneity and [[eclecticism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; and Richter notes that the songs, often punctuated by loud shrieks or other unsettling sounds, built on the legacy of [[noise music]] and [[Futurism (music)|Futurist compositions]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

With time, Tristan Tzara merged his performances and his literature, taking part in developing Dada's "simultaneist poetry", which was meant to be read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to [[Hans Arp]], the first instance of [[Surrealist automatism]].&lt;ref name="hrich16"/&gt; Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was "the value of the human voice."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Arp, Tzara and [[Walter Serner]] produced the [[German language|German-language]] ''Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock'' ("The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick"), in which, Arp stated, "the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, [[Yodeling|yodels]], as he pleases. His poems are like Nature [where] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Another noted simultaneist poem was ''L'Amiral cherche une maison à louer'' ("The Admiral Is Looking for a House to Rent"), co-authored by Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbach.&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt;

Art historian Roger Cardinal describes Tristan Tzara's Dada poetry as marked by "extreme semantic and syntactic incoherence".&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; Tzara, who recommended destroying just as it is created,&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396-397&lt;/ref&gt; had devised a personal system for writing poetry, which implied a seemingly chaotic reassembling of words that had been randomly cut out of newspapers.&lt;ref name="nzgysin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.887; Londré, p.397; Richter, p.54, 60, 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rlword"&gt;Robin Lydenberg, ''Word Cultures: Radical Theory and Practice in William S. Burroughs'', [[University of Illinois Press]], Urbana &amp; Chicago, p.45. {{ISBN|0-252-01413-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada and anti-art===
The Romanian writer also spent the Dada period issuing a long series of manifestos, which were often authored as [[prose poetry]],&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected "the language of a sophisticated savage".&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for "compress[ing] what we think and feel",&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Hans Richter, the genre "suited Tzara perfectly."&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.33-35&lt;/ref&gt; His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: "Dada means nothing", adding "Thought is produced in the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396, 397; Richter, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara indicated: "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none."&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; In addition, Tzara, who once stated that "[[logic]] is always false",&lt;ref name="ipuranus"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf "Un urmuzian: Ionathan X. Uranus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074348/http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}, in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Vol. V, Nr. 96, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; probably approved of Serner's vision of a "final dissolution".&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.48, 49&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that "as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society."&lt;ref name="pbeit29"/&gt;

Despite adopting such [[anti-art]]istic principles, Richter argues, Tzara, like many of his fellow Dadaists, did not initially discard the mission of "furthening the cause of art."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.54"&gt;Richter, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; He saw this evident in ''La Revue Dada 2'', a poem "as exquisite as freshly-picked flowers", which included the lyrics:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|Cinq négresses dans une auto
ont explosé suivant les 5 directions de mes doigts
quand je pose la main sur la poitrine pour prier Dieu (parfois)

[[File:Guillaume Apollinaire Calligramme.JPG|thumb|190px|One of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s [[calligram]]s, shaped like the [[Eiffel Tower]]]]
''La Revue Dada 2'', which also includes the [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] line ''tralalalalalalalalalalala'', is one example where Tzara applies his principles of chance to sounds themselves.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.54"/&gt; This sort of arrangement, treasured by many Dadaists, was probably connected with Apollinaire's [[calligram]]s, and with his announcement that "Man is in search of a new language."&lt;ref name="mlsconcr"&gt;Mary Lewis Shaw, "Concrete and Abstract Poetry: The World as Text and the Text as World", in Leonard M. Trawick (ed.), ''World, Self, Poem: Essays on Contemporary Poetry from the "Jubliation of Poets"'', [[Kent State University Press]], Kent, 1990, p.169. {{ISBN|0-87338-419-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu proposed that Tzara willingly limited the impact of chance: taking as his example a short [[parody]] piece which depicts the love affair between cyclist and a Dadaist, which ends with their decapitation by a jealous husband, the critic notes that Tzara transparently intended to "shock the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]".&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; Late in his career, Huelsenbeck alleged that Tzara never actually applied the experimental methods he had devised.&lt;ref name="hrich123"/&gt;

The Dada series makes ample use of contrast, [[Ellipse (figure of speech)|ellipses]], ridiculous imagery and nonsensical verdicts.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; Tzara was aware that the public could find it difficult to follow his intentions, and, in a piece titled ''Le géant blanc lépreux du paysage'' ("The White Leprous Giant in the Landscape") even alluded to the "skinny, idiotic, dirty" reader who "does not understand my poetry."&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He called some of his own poems ''lampisteries'', from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.530; Hofman, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] poet [[Isidore Isou]] included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by [[Charles Baudelaire]] with the "destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem", a process which, with Tzara, became "destruction of the word for nothing".&lt;ref name="dwslettr"&gt;David W. Seaman, "French Lettrisme—Discontinuity and the Nature of the Avant-Garde", in Freeman G. Henry (ed.), ''Discontinuity and Fragmentation'', [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]], Amsterdam, 1994, p.163. {{ISBN|90-5183-634-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to American literary historian [[Mary Ann Caws]], Tzara's poems may be seen as having an "internal order", and read as "a simple spectacle, as creation complete in itself and completely obvious."&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;

===Plays of the 1920s===
Tristan Tzara's first play, ''[[The Gas Heart]]'', dates from the final period of Paris Dada. Created with what Enoch Brater calls a "peculiar verbal strategy", it is a dialogue between characters called Ear, Mouth, Eye, Nose, Neck, and Eyebrow.&lt;ref name="ebra25"&gt;Brater, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; They seem unwilling to actually communicate to each other and their reliance on proverbs and idiotisms willingly creates confusion between metaphorical and literal speech.&lt;ref name="ebra25"/&gt; The play ends with a dance performance that recalls similar devices used by the proto-Dadaist [[Alfred Jarry]]. The text culminates in a series of doodles and illegible words.&lt;ref name="ebra26"&gt;Brater, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Brater describes ''The Gas Heart'' as a "parod[y] of theatrical conventions".&lt;ref name="ebra26"/&gt;

In his 1924 play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', Tzara explores the relation between perception, the [[subconscious]] and memory. Largely through exchanges between commentators who act as third parties, the text presents the tribulations of a [[love triangle]] (a poet, a bored woman, and her banker husband, whose character traits borrow the clichés of conventional drama), and in part reproduces settings and lines from ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara mocks classical theater, which demands from characters to be inspiring, believable, and to function as a whole: ''Handkerchief of Clouds'' requires actors in the role of commentators to address each other by their real names,&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.32-34; Cernat, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; and their lines include dismissive comments on the play itself, while the [[protagonist]], who in the end dies, is not assigned any name.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.32-34&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Integral'', Tzara defined his play as a note on "the relativity of things, sentiments and events."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; Among the conventions ridiculed by the dramatist, Philip Beitchman notes, is that of a "privileged position for art": in what Beitchman sees as a comment on [[Marxism]], poet and banker are interchangeable [[Capitalism|capitalists]] who invest in different fields.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1925, Fondane rendered a pronouncement by [[Jean Cocteau]], who, while commenting that Tzara was one of his "most beloved" writers and a "great poet", argued: "''Handkerchief of Clouds'' was poetry, and great poetry for that matter—but not theater."&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; The work was nonetheless praised by [[Ion Călugăru]] at ''Integral'', who saw in it one example that modernist performance could rely not just on props, but also on a solid text.&lt;ref name="pcern277"/&gt;

===''The Approximate Man'' and later works===
After 1929, with the adoption of Surrealism, Tzara's literary works discard much of their satirical purpose, and begin to explore universal themes relating to the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; According to Cardinal, the period also signified the definitive move from "a studied inconsequentiality" and "unreadable gibberish" to "a seductive and fertile surrealist idiom."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; The critic also remarks: "Tzara arrived at a mature style of transparent simplicity, in which disparate entities could be held together in a unifying vision."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; In a 1930 essay, Fondane had given a similar verdict: arguing that Tzara had infused his work with "suffering", had discovered humanity, and had become a "[[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]" among poets.&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

This period in Tzara's creative activity centers on ''[[The Approximate Man]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] which is reportedly recognized as his most accomplished contribution to [[French literature]].&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; While maintaining some of Tzara's preoccupation with language experimentation, it is mainly a study in [[social alienation]] and the search for an escape.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.37-42&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal calls the piece "an extended meditation on mental and elemental impulses [...] with images of stunning beauty",&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; while Breitchman, who notes Tzara's rebellion against the "excess baggage of [man's] past and the notions [...] with which he has hitherto tried to control his life", remarks his portrayal of poets as voices who can prevent human beings from destroying themselves with their own intellects.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is a new man who lets intuition and spontaneity guide him through life, and who rejects measure.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.40-45&lt;/ref&gt; One of the appeals in the text reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|je parle de qui parle qui parle je suis seul
je ne suis qu'un petit bruit j'ai plusieurs bruits en moi
un bruit glacé froissé au carrefour jeté sur le trottoir humide
aux pieds des hommes pressés courant avec leurs morts
autour de la mort qui étend ses bras
sur le cadran de l'heure seule vivante au soleil.}}&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;
|
I speak of the one who speaks who speaks I am alone
I am but a small noise I have several noises in me
a ruffled noise frozen with the crossroads thrown on the wet pavement
with the feet of the men in a hurry running with their dead
around death which extends its arms
on the dial of the hour only alive in the sun}}

The next stage in Tzara's career saw a merger of his literary and political views. His poems of the period blend a [[Humanism|humanist]] vision with [[Communism|communist]] theses.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbeit49"/&gt; The 1935 ''Grains et issues'', described by Beitchman as "fascinating",&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; was a prose poem of [[social criticism]] connected with ''The Approximate Man'', expanding on the vision of a possible society, in which haste has been abandoned in favor of [[oblivion (eternal)|oblivion]]. The world imagined by Tzara abandons symbols of the past, from literature to public transportation and currency, while, like psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], the poet depicts violence as a natural means of human expression.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.46-50&lt;/ref&gt; People of the future live in a state which combines waking life and the realm of dreams, and life itself turns into revery.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grains et issues'' was accompanied by ''Personage d'insomnie'' ("Personage of Insomnia"), which went unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal notes: "In retrospect, harmony and contact had been Tzara's goals all along."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; The post-[[World War II]] volumes in the series focus on political subjects related to the conflict.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; In his last writings, Tzara toned down experimentation, exercising more control over the lyrical aspects.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He was by then undertaking a [[Hermeneutics|hermeutic]] research into the work of [[Goliard]]s and [[François Villon]], whom he deeply admired.&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Influence===
Beside the many authors who were attracted into Dada through his promotional activities, Tzara was able to influence successive generations of writers. This was the case in his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by ''[[unu]]''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; magazine, written by [[Sașa Pană]] and [[Moldov]], cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and [[Tudor Arghezi]], as well as artists [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.889&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was [[Jacques G. Costin]], who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and [[Futurism]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.174, 193, 409&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ilarie Voronca]]'s ''Zodiac'' cycle, first published in France, is traditionally seen as indebted to ''The Approximate Man''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.328&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] and Surrealist author [[Mihail (Marcel) Avramescu|Marcel Avramescu]], who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art.&lt;ref name="ipuranus"/&gt; Other authors from that generation to have been inspired by Tzara were [[Poland|Polish]] Futurist writer [[Bruno Jasieński]],&lt;ref&gt;Nina Kolesnikoff, ''Bruno Jasieński: His Evolution from Futurism to Socialist Realism'', [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]], Waterloo, 1982, p.15. {{ISBN|0-88920-110-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]ese poet and [[Zen]] thinker [[Takahashi Shinkichi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Makoto Ueda (poetry critic)|Makoto Ueda]], ''Modern Japanese Poets and the Nature of Literature'', [[Stanford University Press]], Palo Alto, 1983, p.335-336. {{ISBN|0-8047-1166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chile]]an poet and Dadaist sympathizer [[Vicente Huidobro]], who cited him as a precursor for his own ''[[Creacionismo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [[Vicente Huidobro]], [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/manifiesto1.htm ''El Creacionismo''], at the [[University of Chile]] [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/ Vicente Huidobro site]; retrieved 4 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An immediate precursor of [[Theater of the Absurd|Absurdism]], he was acknowledged as a mentor by [[Eugène Ionesco]], who developed on his principles for his early essays of literary and social criticism, as well as in tragic farces such as ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosette C. Lamont, ''Ionesco's Imperatives: The Politics of Culture'', [[University of Michigan Press]], Ann Arbor, 1993, p.4. {{ISBN|0-472-10310-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's poetry influenced [[Samuel Beckett]] (who translated some of it into English);&lt;ref name="dbgodot"/&gt; the Irish author's 1972 play ''[[Not I]]'' shares some elements with ''[[The Gas Heart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brater, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Romanian author is cited as an influence on [[Beat Generation]] members. Beat writer [[Allen Ginsberg]], who made his acquaintance in Paris, cites him among the Europeans who influenced him and [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref&gt;Josef Jařab, "When All Met Together in One Room: Josef Jařab Interviews Allen Ginsberg", in Heather Hathaway, Josef Jařab, Jeffrey Melnick (eds.), ''Race and the Modern Artist'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York, p.242-243. {{ISBN|0-19-512324-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter also mentioned Tzara's use of chance in writing poetry as an early example of what became the [[cut-up technique]], adopted by [[Brion Gysin]] and Burroughs himself.&lt;ref name="rlword"/&gt; Gysin, who conversed with Tzara in the late 1950s, records the latter's indignation that Beat poets were "going back over the ground we [Dadaists] covered in 1920", and accuses Tzara of having consumed his creative energies into becoming a "Communist Party bureaucrat".&lt;ref name="nzgysin"/&gt;

Among the late 20th-century writers who acknowledged Tzara as an inspiration are [[Jerome Rothenberg]],&lt;ref name="camroth"&gt;Christine A.

In France, Tzara's work was collected as ''Oeuvres complètes'' ("Complete Works"), of which the first volume saw print in 1975,&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; and an international poetry award is named after him (''Prix International de Poésie Tristan Tzara''). An international periodical titled ''Caietele Tristan Tzara'', edited by the Tristan Tzara Cultural-Literary Foundation, has been published in [[Moinești]] since 1998.&lt;ref name="ocprofesor"&gt;{{ro icon}} Oltița Cîntec, [http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/un-profesor-inimos-din.html "Un profesor inimos din Moinești și o societate cultural-literară atrag atenția întregii lumii asupra României"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213452/http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/un-profesor-inimos-din.html |date=27 September 2007 }}, in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', 10 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Oana Tănase, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Pic-Adrian-artist-esentialist*articleID_9309-articles_details.html "Pic Adrian: artist esențialist"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 189, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Paul Cernat, ''Aliluia'', one of the few avant-garde texts authored by Ion Vinea features a "transparent allusion" to Tristan Tzara.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; Vinea's fragment speaks of "the [[Wandering Jew]]", a character whom people notice because he sings ''La moară la Hârța'', "a suspicious song from [[Greater Romania]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.181-182&lt;/ref&gt; The poet is a character in [[India]]n novelist [[Mulk Raj Anand]]'s ''Thieves of Fire'', part four of his ''The Bubble'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;Suresh Chandra, ''Fresh Perspectives on Fiction'', Anmol Publications, New Delhi, 2005, p.78. {{ISBN|81-261-2126-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''The Prince of West End Avenue'', a 1994 book by the American [[Alan Isler]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bette Pesetsky]], "Shakespeare Meets Emma Lazarus", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 29 May 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberg dedicated several of his poems to Tzara,&lt;ref name="camroth"/&gt; as did the [[Neo-Dada]]ist [[Valery Oișteanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Valery Oișteanu]], [http://www.respiro.org/Issue10/poezie_oisteanu.htm "Poeme din exil"] in [http://www.respiro.org/ ''Respiro''], Issue 10/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's legacy in literature also covers specific episodes of his biography, beginning with [[Gertrude Stein]]'s controversial memoir. One of his performances is enthusiastically recorded by [[Malcolm Cowley]] in his autobiographical book of 1934, ''Exile's Return'',&lt;ref&gt;"Lost Generation", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 4 June 1934&lt;/ref&gt; and he is also mentioned in [[Harold Loeb]]'s memoir ''The Way It Was''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Sun Also Rises (Contd.)", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 22 June 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Among his biographers is the French author François Buot, who records some of the lesser-known aspects of Tzara's life.&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt;

At some point between 1915 and 1917, Tzara is believed to have played chess in a coffeehouse that was also frequented by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Hoberman]], ''The Red Atlantis: Communist Culture in the Absence of Communism'', [[Temple University Press]], Philadelphia, p.100. {{ISBN|1-56639-767-7}}; Olson, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; While Richter himself recorded the incidental proximity of Lenin's lodging to the Dadaist milieu,&lt;ref name="hrich16"/&gt; no record exists of an actual conversation between the two figures.&lt;ref name="kols43"&gt;Olson, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstsbh"&gt;Jenna Scherer, [http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/arts_culture/view.bg?articleid=1087112 "''Travesties'' Shows Importance of Being Stoppard"], in ''[[Boston Herald]]'', 15 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei Codrescu believes that Lenin and Tzara did play against each other, noting that an image of their encounter would be "the proper icon of the beginning of [modern] times."&lt;ref name="kols43"/&gt; This meeting is mentioned as a fact in ''Harlequin at the Chessboard'', a poem by Tzara's acquaintance [[Kurt Schwitters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://capa.conncoll.edu/morton.merzbook.html ''The Merzbook: Kurt Schwitters Poems''], translated by [[Colin Morton]], at the [http://capa.conncoll.edu/ Contemporary American Poetry Archive]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; German playwright and novelist [[Peter Weiss]], who has introduced Tzara as a character in his 1969 play about [[Leon Trotsky]] (''Trotzki im Exil''), recreated the scene in his 1975-1981 cycle ''[[The Aesthetics of Resistance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Cohen (acting theorist)|Robert Cohen]], ''Understanding Peter Weiss'', [[University of South Carolina Press]], Columbia, 1993, p.130. {{ISBN|0-87249-898-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imagined episode also inspired much of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'', which also depicts conversations between Tzara, Lenin, and the Irish modernist author [[James Joyce]] (who is also known to have resided in Zürich after 1915).&lt;ref name="jstsbh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcovusu"&gt;[[Michael Coveney]], "Usurpation Supreme", in ''[[The Observer]]'', 19 March 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cilenin"&gt;Charles Isherwood, "Lenin, Joyce and Philosophy with Vaudevillian Verve", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; His role was notably played by [[David Westhead]] in the 1993 British production,&lt;ref name="mcovusu"/&gt; and by [[Tom Hewitt (actor)|Tom Hewitt]] in the 2005 American version.&lt;ref name="cilenin"/&gt;

Alongside his collaborations with Dada artists on various pieces, Tzara himself was a subject for visual artists. [[Max Ernst]] depicts him as the only mobile character in the Dadaists' group portrait ''Au Rendez-vous des Amis'' ("A Friends' Reunion", 1922),&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; while, in one of [[Man Ray]]'s photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an [[androgynous]] [[Nancy Cunard]].&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Moynagh, introduction to [[Nancy Cunard]], ''Essays on Race and Empire'', Broadview Press, Peterborough &amp; Orchard Park, p.24. {{ISBN|1-55111-230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years before their split, [[Francis Picabia]] used Tzara's [[Calligraphy|calligraphed]] name in ''Moléculaire'' ("Molecular"), a composition printed on the cover of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; The same artist also completed his schematic portrait, which showed a series of circles connected by two perpendicular arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist [[Alberto Giacometti]] made Tzara the subject of one of his first experiments with [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bnf.fr/PAGES/presse/dossiers/giacometti.pdf ''Dossier de presse.

===Posthumous controversies===
The many polemics which surrounded Tzara in his lifetime left traces after his death, and determine contemporary perceptions of his work. The controversy regarding Tzara's role as a founder of Dada extended into several milieus, and continued long after the writer died. Richter, who discusses the lengthy conflict between Huelsenbeck and Tzara over the issue of Dada foundation, speaks of the movement as being torn apart by "petty jealousies".&lt;ref name="hrich32"/&gt; In Romania, similar debates often involved the supposed founding role of [[Urmuz]], who wrote his avant-garde texts before [[World War I]], and Tzara's status as a communicator between Romania and the rest of Europe. Vinea, who claimed that Dada had been invented by Tzara in [[Gârceni]] ca. 1915 and thus sought to legitimize his own modernist vision, also saw Urmuz as the ignored precursor of radical modernism, from Dada to Surrealism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.121-122, 128-129, 177, 212, 343, 346, 359, 409&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 the young, modernist literary critic [[Lucian Boz]] evidenced that he partly shared Vinea's perspective on the matter, crediting Tzara and [[Constantin Brâncuși]] with having, each on his own, invented the avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.331&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugène Ionesco]] argued that "before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism", and, after [[World War II]], sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.367&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly because the public could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110, 367-368&lt;/ref&gt;

A more radical questioning of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist [[Petre Pandrea]]. In his personal diary, published long after he and Tzara had died, Pandrea depicted the poet as an opportunist, accusing him of adapting his style to political requirements, of dodging military service during [[World War I]], and of being a "[[Lumpenproletariat|Lumpenproletarian]]".&lt;ref name="pcern113"&gt;Cernat, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea's text, completed just after Tzara's visit to Romania, claimed that his founding role within the avant-garde was an "illusion [...] which has swelled up like a multicolored balloon", and denounced him as "the [[Balkans|Balkan]] provider of interlope [[odalisque]]s, [together] with narcotics and a sort of scandalous literature."&lt;ref name="pcern113"/&gt; Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a [[political prisoner]] in [[Communist Romania]]. Vinea's own grudge probably shows up in his 1964 novel ''Lunatecii'', where Tzara is identifiable as "Dr. Barbu", a thick-hided charlatan.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Sanda Cordoș, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Lunatecii-un-mare-roman-de-redescoperit*articleID_28954-articles_details.html "''Lunatecii'' – un mare roman de redescoperit"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 683, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s to 1989, after a period when it ignored or attacked the avant-garde movement, the Romanian communist regime sought to recuperate Tzara, in order to validate its newly adopted emphasis on nationalist and [[National communism|national communist]] tenets. In 1977, literary historian [[Edgar Papu]], whose controversial theories were linked to "[[protochronism]]", which presumes that Romanians took precedence in various areas of world culture, mentioned Tzara, Urmuz, Ionesco and Isou as representatives of "Romanian initiatives" and "road openers at a universal level."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.359&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of protochronism in this area, Paul Cernat argues, could be traced back to Vinea's claim that his friend had single-handedly created the worldwide avant-garde movement on the basis of models already present at home.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally created by Rockwell in 1942 for the 1944 [[Brown &amp; Bigelow]] Boy Scout Calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = We, Too, Have a Job To Do|url = https://history.lds.org/media/we-too-have-a-job-to-do-brown-and-bigelow?lang=eng#1|website = Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints History|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model, Bob Hamilton, won a contest to be in the painting and personally delivered a print to the [[Vice President of the United States]] at the time, [[Henry A. Wallace]].
 
== Creation ==
The painting was created to encourage Scouts to participate in the [[war effort]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The name of the painting, ''We, Too, Have a Job to Do'', comes from a slogan that the Boy Scouts of America used in 1942 to rally scouts to support the troops by collecting metal and planting [[victory garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = We Too Have A Job To Do!|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aQteiT0ObU8C|publisher = Boy Scouts of America|date = 1942-03-01|first = James E|last = West|work = Boys' Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model, Bob Hamilton, won a contest with his local council in [[Albany, New York]], to be depicted in the painting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = World War II icon dies at 82: Rockwell model inspired scouts to aid country, community|last = Monteleone|first = James|date = August 3, 2008|work = Farmington Daily Times|access-date = |via = LexisNexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled to Rockwell's studio in [[Arlington, Vermont]], to model for Rockwell.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since Hamilton was a scout, the uniform shown in the painting was his, unlike some of Rockwell's other models. Originally, he wore a turtle shell [[Woggle|neckerchief slide]] with his uniform that he had made. Rockwell did not like it and asked Hamilton to swap it for a simpler [[Turk's head knot|Turk's head]] slide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1944, Hamilton personally delivered a copy of the painting to Vice President Henry A. Wallace.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hamilton later became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], served in the [[US Navy|Navy]], and worked for the Boy Scouts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He died in July 2008, at the age of 82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/news/state/aprockwell08-04-08.htm |title=Model for Rockwell Boy Scout Painting Dies at 82  |newspaper=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 4, 2008  |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wrocław Opera''' is an opera company and opera house in [[Wrocław]], Poland. The opera house was opened in 1841 and up to 1945 was known as the '''Breslau Opera'''.

==History==
An Italian opera company was established in Wroclaw (Breslau) in 1725 by Antonio Maria Peruzzi, following a split with Antonio Denzio with whom he had collaborated in the Peruzzi-Denzio company at the [[Sporck theatre]] in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;''The Opera Theater of Count [[Franz Anton von Sporck]] in Prague'', p. 44, Daniel E. Freeman (1992). "The final outcome was the establishment of an opera company in Breslau, with Peruzzi as impresario, and the defection of a number of members of Denzio's company to Peruzzi's company."&lt;/ref&gt; The Theater on the Cold Ashes was opened in 1755 by Franz von Schuch (1716–1764) and performed operas till his death in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Fischer-Lichte ''History of European Drama and Theatre'', p. 150, 2002. "After Schuch was brutally rejected by the city council in the merchant city, Frankfurt, because of bitter controversy between religious leaders, he succeeded in gaining citizen's rights in Breslau in 1754. He built a theatre there on his own land, and performed regularly from 1755 to 1764."&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Schuch the younger, brought the first operas of [[Johann Adam Hiller]] to the Theodor Lobe's theatre in Breslau in 1770. His successor Johann Christian Wäser introduced more, including local Singspiel translations of works by [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny]].&lt;ref&gt;''North German Opera in the Age of Goethe'', p. 83, Thomas Bauman (1985). "Breslau in Silesia offered German companies an attractive alternative to Leipzig or Berlin. Like them, it could support a company from autumn ... the charming name Theater on the Cold Ashes. Schuch brought the first Hiller operas to Breslau in 1770, and his successor Johann Christian Waser introduced many more. In addition, Breslau saw the premieres of three new operas of its own in 1771 and 1772."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804 [[Abbé Vogler]] invited [[Carl Maria von Weber]] to conduct the Breslau Opera when he was only 18.&lt;ref&gt;''Pianoforte Music Its History, with Biographical Sketches'', p. 105, John Comfort Fillmore (2005). "Before he was quite eighteen years old, he was called, on the recommendation of the Abbe Vogler, to be conductor of the opera in Breslau. He showed marked talent in his new position of responsibility, and gained invaluable experience."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Opera and its Future in America'', p. 149, Herbert Graf (1941). "Weber had worked hard for the organization of German opera in Breslau, Prague, and Dresden. He was not only conductor, but stage director as well, supervising the unity of the whole performance, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The opera house was constructed in 1841 to designs by [[Carl Gotthard Langhans]], supervised by his son [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans|Carl Ferdinand]]. It was remodelled twice after fires in 1865 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Johann Lüdecke|de}} and 1871 by Karl Schmidt. After the first fire Theodor Lobe in 1867 invited the young conductor [[Ernst Schuch]] (1846–1914) to begin his career at the theatre.

After World War I notable productions during the interwar years included Schönberg's ''[[Die glückliche Hand]]'' (1928). The music directors in this period included [[Franz von Hoesslin]] who was forced to leave the city, and Germany, in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Huener, Francis R. Nicosia "The arts in Nazi Germany: continuity, conformity, change", p. 102, 2006. "Alfred Einstein, 'Opera in Breslau: Schönberg's ''Die glückliche Hand'' [The Favored Hand], Handel's ''Joshua'', and Ballet", ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', 26 March 1928, trans. in ''[[Alfred Einstein]] on Music: Selected Music Criticisms''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|inclusion of Breslau into Poland in 1945]], the Lower Silesian Opera made its inaugural performance in Polish Wrocław on September 8, 1945 with [[Stanisław Moniuszko]]'s ''[[Halka]]'' directed by Stanislaw Drabik.&lt;ref&gt;''Uprooted: How Breslau Became Wroclaw During the Century of Expulsions'', p. 200, Gregor Thum (2011). "The Lower Silesian Opera, for example, turned its inaugural performance in Polish Wrocław on September 8, 1945, into an act of patriotism: The premiere of the Polish national opera ''Halka'', whose composer Stanisław Moniuszko is regarded as the founder of ..."&lt;/ref&gt; From 1945 to 1950 the building housed not only the Opera, but also theater, puppet theater and operetta performances. In 1997 the current Director Ewa Michnik, undertook the idea to use other venues during the complete rehab of the building (1997-2006). She created a series of mega-productions that took place around the city including the Centennial Hall, The National Museum courtyard and banks of the Oder River. This tradition became a trademark of Wroclaw Opera and continues to this day. The super productions are famous for interesting surroundings, attractive decorations and guest actors. The Opera also organized Wagner festivals building on the tradition of Wagner's involvement with Wroclaw Opera. The current repertoire of the Opera House includes ''Kot w butach'' (Puss in Boots) by Bogdan Pawłowski and ''Matka czarnoskrzydłych snów'' by [[Hanna Kulenty]]. The list of current productions is growing by the year. Several productions were rewarded both in Poland and Abroad. Wroclaw Opera is one of the leading Opera companies in Europe.
