The '''Kharkiv supermarket bombings''' took place around noon on 22 April 2006 in the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] city of [[Kharkiv]].  Two [[homemade bomb]]s exploded in supermarkets about one kilometer apart.  The blasts were about eight minutes apart and apparently came from lockers where customers store packages.  14 people were wounded, at least four seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ukraine supermarket blasts injure 14 - unconfirmed reports |url=http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11502894 |work=[[Interfax]] |date=2006-04-22 |accessdate=2007-01-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924073850/http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11502894 |archivedate=2006-09-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''21ème Siècle ''''' is a [[2004 in film|2004 film]] from [[Senegal]].

==Synopsis==
The city of [[Dakar]] grows at an infernal pace. Everywhere buildings are being constructed. Occasionally, the deafening noise of the [[Airplane|planes]] disturbs the stillness of the birds that stay on the top of the buildings; they take off and fly back to rest. [[Africa]] wants to develop itself at all costs; but we do not need to lock ourselves inside buildings, since the sun shines almost all year round.

'''"Boum-Badaboum"''' was the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1967]], performed in [[French language|French]] by [[Minouche Barelli]].

The song was composed by [[Serge Gainsbourg]], who previously had written [[France Gall]]'s winning entry "[[Poupée de cire, poupée de son]]" in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1965|1965]], representing [[Luxembourg]]. Gainsbourg would also go on to write [[Joëlle Ursull]]'s entry for France, "[[White and Black Blues]]", which finished 2nd in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]].

"Boum Badadoum" is part of the long Eurovision tradition of nonsensical titles and lyrics.  However, instead of the usual Eurovision cannons of love and happiness associated with the genre, Barelli instead asks to be allowed to live a full life before she is killed in a bomb attack.  In this regard, the song could actually regarded as critical of the normal nonsensical "boom-boom" lyrics of Eurovision entries.  The phrases ''"boum-badaboum"'' and ''"boum boum"'' and a countdown are repeated throughout the lyrics. Barelli recorded the song in four languages; French, [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] - all versions with the same title.

The song was performed fourteenth on the night, following [[Norway]]'s [[Kirsti Sparboe]] with "[[Dukkemann]]" and preceding [[Yugoslavia]]'s [[Lado Leskovar]] with "[[Vse rože sveta]]". At the close of voting, it had received 10 points, placing 5th in a field of 17.

It was succeeded as [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monegasque representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1968|1968 Contest]] by [[Line &amp; Willy]] with "[[À chacun sa chanson]]".

==Policy influence and lobbying==
Every election cycle, the Council endorses congressional candidates who are arms control advocates and who support the Council's outlook on national security issues. Since its inception, the Council has helped elect 134 U.S. arms control advocates to the Senate and 226 to the House of Representatives. Council supporters raised over $1.6 million in 2014. Candidates seeking endorsements are required to answer questionnaires on issues and to defend their positions in interviews. The Council endorses candidates for the House of Representatives through PeacePAC. The Council endorsed both President [[Barack Obama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Broad, William J.  |author2=Sanger, David E.|title=Obama's Youth Shaped His Nuclear-Free Vision|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/world/05nuclear.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vice President [[Joe Biden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Witcover|first=Jules|title=Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption|year=2010|publisher=William Morrow|isbn=0061791989}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their first runs for U.S. Senate seats.

'''Dawn Yvonne Sumner''' is an American [[geologist]], [[planetary scientist]], and [[astrobiologist]]. She is a professor at the [[University of California, Davis]]. Sumner’s research includes evaluating [[microbial communities]] in [[List of lakes#Antarctica|Antarctic lakes]], exploration of [[Mars]] via the [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity rover]], and characterization of microbial communities in the lab and from ancient geologic samples. She is an investigator on the [[Mars Science Laboratory|NASA Mars Science Laboratory]] (MSL) and was Chair of the UC Davis Department of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geology.ucdavis.edu/|title=Department of Geology, UC Davis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2014-2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://geology.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk2851/files/inline-files/F15news_online.pdf|title=UC Davis Earth and Planetary Science department; Chair's letter by Dawn Sumner|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is  Fellow of the [[Geological Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geosociety.org/GSA/About/awards/GSA_Fellows/GSA/Awards/Fellowship.aspx|title=GSA Fellow|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early life and education ==
Sumner was born near [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and spent part of her childhood on the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/mars-needs-this-woman/content?oid=17298240|title=Mars needs this woman|last=Leibrock|first=Rachel|date=6 April 2015|website=newsreview.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, she earned a B.S. with Honors in geology from the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), then attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for her Ph.D. which she completed in 1995. Sumner then returned Caltech for postdoctoral research, supported by an O.K. Earl Postdoctoral Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gradfund.rutgers.edu/blog/awards/6216/|title=California Institute of Technology: The O.K.

== Career  ==

*Ancient Microbial Communities - Sumner’s research includes understanding microbial evolution and ecology, and Earth history,  through understanding microbial signatures in the rock record. Her publications feature new developments in how to interpret ancient biological responses to environmental factors, tracing oxygenation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sumner|first=Dawn Y.|last2=Grotzinger|first2=John P.|date=1996|title=Were kinetics of Archean calcium carbonate precipitation related to oxygen concentration?|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/24/2/119/206445|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=119|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0119:WKOACC&gt;2.3.CO;2|issn=0091-7613}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the impact on carbonate microbial biological signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sumner|first=Dawn Y.|date=1997-05-01|title=Carbonate precipitation and oxygen stratification in late Archean seawater as deduced from facies and stratigraphy of the Gamohaan and Frisco formations, Transvaal Supergroup, South Africa|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/297/5/455|journal=American Journal of Science|language=en|volume=297|issue=5|pages=455–487|doi=10.2475/ajs.297.5.455|issn=0002-9599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Antarctic Lakes Sumner’s research utilizes Antarctic lakes as a model system for understanding microbial processes, early oxygenic photosynthesis, and life on other planets. This work includes the discovery of pinnacles of microbial growth under ice-covered lakes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sumner|first=D. Y.|last2=Jungblut|first2=A.

'''Demain dès l'aube''' is one of French writer [[Victor Hugo]]'s most famous poems. It was published in his 1856 collection ''[[Les Contemplations]]''. It consists of three [[quatrains]] of rhyming [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s. The poem describes a visit to his daughter [[Léopoldine Hugo]]'s grave.

==Text and translation==
{{Verse translation|lang=fr|
Demain, dès l'aube, à l'heure où blanchit la campagne,
Je partirai. Vois-tu, je sais que tu m'attends.
J'irai par la forêt, j'irai par la montagne.
Je ne puis demeurer loin de toi plus longtemps.

Je marcherai les yeux fixés sur mes pensées,
Sans rien voir au dehors, sans entendre aucun bruit,
Seul, inconnu, le dos courbé, les mains croisées,
Triste, et le jour pour moi sera comme la nuit.

Je ne regarderai ni l'or du soir qui tombe,
Ni les voiles au loin descendant vers Harfleur,
Et, quand j'arriverai, je mettrai sur ta tombe
Un bouquet de houx vert et de bruyère en fleur.
|
Tomorrow, at dawn, at the moment when the land whitens,
I will leave. You see, I know that you wait for me.
I will go by the forest, I will go by the mountain.
I cannot stay any longer, far away from you.

I will walk eyes fixed on my thoughts,
Seeing nothing outside, not hearing a noise,
Alone, unknown, back hunched, hands crossed,
Sorrowed, for the day for me will be like night.

I will not look at the golden evening that falls,
Nor the faraway sails descending upon [[Harfleur]].
And when I arrive, I will put on your tomb
A bouquet of green holly and heather in bloom.&lt;ref&gt;picmots.wordpress.com/2017/12/01/demain-des-laube-de-victor-hugo/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''''Federal Gazette''''' ({{lang-de|Bundesblatt}}, BBl; {{lang-fr|Feuille fédérale}}, FF; {{lang-it|Foglio federale}}, FF) publishes various official texts of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] federal government, including:

*  reports of the [[Swiss Federal Council]] to the [[Swiss Federal Assembly]], most notably the drafts of proposed laws with usually extensive explanations, 
* laws enacted by Parliament that are subject to an obligatory or facultative [[popular referendum]],
* reports and notifications by the Federal Council, parliamentary committees and various government agencies.

It is issued in the [[Languages of Switzerland|three official languages of Switzerland]]: German, French and [[Italian language|Italian]]. All three language editions are equally valid. It is published by the [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] in the form of weekly supplements to [[loose leaf]] binders.

Since 1999, they are also made available on the internet in [[PDF]] format. Since 1 January 2016, the electronic version (and not any more the printed one) of the ''Official Compilation'' and of the ''Federal Gazette'' is deemed authentic.

The '''Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards''', based in [[Greeley, Colorado]], is a non-profit organization which facilitates the coordination and communication of the 50 individual United States' chiropractic licensing boards.&lt;ref name="AHCPR"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cherkin|first1=Daniel C|last2=Mootz|first2=Robert D|title=Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice, and Research|date=December 1997|publisher=AHCPR Publication|pages=34–36|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faass|first=Nancy|title=Integrating Complementary Medicine Into Health Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTx6kPjXt3EC&amp;pg=PA562|year=2001|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-8342-1216-9|page=562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest ancestor of the FCLB was chartered in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in September 1926 as the International Congress of Chiropractic Examining Boards.&lt;ref name="Illustrated"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Dennis|last2=Wiese|first2=Glenda|title=Chiropractic: An Illustrated History|date=1995|publisher=Mosby|isbn=978-0801677359|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fclb.org/AboutFCLB.aspx|title=FCLB|first=FCLB Home|last=Website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this organization, Congress created the Council of State Chiropractic Examining Boards (CSCEB) in 1933.&lt;ref name="AHCPR" /&gt; This board was originally associated with the [[American Chiropractic Association|National Chiropractic Association]], but by 1947 decided to withdraw itself from the influence of any national association and formed its own independently-run organization. Incorporating itself in Wyoming it received federal tax-exempt status in 1968.&lt;ref name="Illustrated" /&gt;

By 1974 the name of the organization was changed to its present-day name, the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards.&lt;ref name="Illustrated" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Keating |first= Joseph Jr |title= Milestones in the history of Chiropractic |url= http://www.chiroweb.com/mpacms/dc_ca/article.php?id=51278 |publisher= Dynamic Chiropractic |website= Chiroweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed FCLB first sought to arbitrate the merger of the [[Association of Chiropractic Colleges]] with the [[Council on Chiropractic Education – USA|Council on Chiropractic Education]] (CCE) as both were attempting to earn national accreditation from the [[United States Department of Education|United States Office of Education]]. As arbitration drew near the CCE secured accreditation from the U.S. government, and quickly thereafter the FCLB supported its claim on the government petition.&lt;ref name="Illustrated" /&gt;

==Mission==
The mission of the FCLB is to maintain high, uniform standards in areas related to [[chiropractic]] licensure, regulation, discipline, and education. The organization provides services to member chiropractic licensing boards to fulfill their statutory obligations and regulate the profession within the interest of public protection.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fclb.org/AboutFCLB/ArticlesofIncorporation.aspx|title=Articles of Incorporation|first=FCLB Home|last=Website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= United States. Department of Health and Human Services. Office of Inspector General. Office of Analysis and Inspections, and Richard P.

==Affiliations==
The Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards collaborates closely with the [[National Board of Chiropractic Examiners]] (NBCE) and [[Council on Chiropractic Education]] (CCE) because of their shared mission of public protection. The FCLB also works closely with the NBCE and to develop uniform standards of education and examination for its national board exams parts 1-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Eisenberg |first1= DM |last2= Cohen |first2= MH |last3= Hrbek |first3= A |last4= Grayzel |first4= J |last5= Van Rompay |first5= MI |last6= Cooper |first6= RA |display-authors= 2| title = Credentialing complementary and alternative medical providers | journal = [[Annals of Internal Medicine]] | volume = 137 | issue = 12 | pages = 965–73 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12484712 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-137-12-200212170-00010 | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.692.9014&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A database of providers called CIN-BAD (Chiropractic Information Network - Board Action Database) provides member boards and other subscribers access to information regarding licensed chiropractors in the US, Canada, and Australia. CIN-BAD's ever-expanding databases are increasingly significant resources for regulatory boards, chiropractic colleges, managed care providers, law enforcement agencies, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer System Will Allow Licensing Boards to Network Information|url=http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=42328|accessdate=20 October 2017|issue=Vol. 11, Issue 12|publisher=Dynamic Chiropractic|date=June 4, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A service called PACE (Providers of Approved Chiropractic Education) assists the member regulatory boards in validating quality educational courses for licensed chiropractors as well as tracking obtained continuing education credit hours for compliance purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Engebretson|first1=Julie|title=FCLB Officially Launches PACE Program|url=http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=51083|accessdate=20 October 2017|issue=Vol. 24, Issue 05|publisher=Dynamic Chiropractic|date=February 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCLB also manages a program for Certified Chiropractic Clinical Assistants, which is a certification program for competent office assistants who may legally provide certain limited clinical services in a chiropractic setting. The program establishes minimal testing, training and character standards for chiropractic assistants to best protect the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schmitt|first1=Richard|title=National Certification for Chiropractic Assistants|url=http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=55975|accessdate=20 October 2017|issue=Vol. 30, Issue 14|publisher=Dynamic Chiropractic|date=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Members include boards having jurisdiction to license or regulate the practice of chiropractic in the states, provinces, commonwealths, and territories of the United States of America, Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, New Zealand and other jurisdictions.

Current regulatory board members, as well as those who have served on a board within the last five years, may participate as Fellows in FCLB activities, including holding office or serving on standing committees. Those who have ever served on a chiropractic regulatory board are Honorary Fellows, privileged to attend the annual business meeting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1109">'''Fishing in Benin''', which had been carried on largely by [[Ghana]]ian fishermen, is gaining importance at [[Cotonou]] (where a fishing port was opened in 1971) and other coastal centers. Under an agreement with the [[Senegal]] government, Senegalese fishermen introduced deep-sea-fishing methods to the Beninese, and a national fishing company was established as a joint venture with [[Libya]].

Exports of fish commodities amounted to nearly $1.9 million in 2003. Lagoon and river fishing remain of primary importance; of an estimated catch of 41,900 tons in 2003, 30,000 tons were from inland waters. The production of fish steadily declined during the 1980s due to over fishing and ecological degradation, but started increasing by the mid-1990s. In 2003, fishery products accounted for 2.8% of agricultural exports.

The '''Global Biodiversity Information Facility''' ('''GBIF''') is an [[international organisation]] that focuses on making scientific data on [[biodiversity]] available via the [[Internet]] using [[web services]]. The data are provided by many institutions from around the world; GBIF's information architecture makes these data accessible and searchable through a single portal. Data available through the GBIF portal are primarily distribution data on plants, animals, fungi, and microbes for the world, and scientific names data.

The mission of the Global Biodiversity information Facility (GBIF) is to facilitate free and open access to biodiversity data worldwide to underpin [[sustainable development]]. Priorities, with an emphasis on promoting participation and working through partners, include mobilising biodiversity data, developing protocols and standards to ensure scientific integrity and interoperability, building an informatics architecture to allow the interlinking of diverse data types from disparate sources, promoting capacity building and catalysing development of analytical tools for improved decision-making.

GBIF strives to form informatics linkages among digital data resources from across the spectrum of biological organisation, from genes to [[ecosystem]]s, and to connect these to issues important to science, society and sustainability by using georeferencing and [[Geographic information system|GIS]] tools. It works in partnership with other international organisations such as the [[Catalogue of Life]] partnership, [[Biodiversity Information Standards]], the [[Consortium for the Barcode of Life]] (CBOL), the [[Encyclopedia of Life]] (EOL), and [[GEOSS]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">'''Greater Budapest''' is the name of [[Budapest]] in its present, extended size, as it was created by the ''Law No. XXVI of 1949'' passed on December 15, 1949 and it came into force on January 1, 1950. By attaching 7 towns and 16 villages to the former Budapest, its area enlarged from 207&amp;nbsp;km² to 525&amp;nbsp;km² (154%), the number of its inhabitants increased from 1.05 million to 1.6 million (52%), and the number of the districts augmented from 14 to 22 (57%), thus becoming the seventh metropolis of Europe in its time.

The only difference between the 1950s Greater Budapest and {{As of|2008|alt=today's}} Budapest is that [[List of districts in Budapest|Soroksár]], a part of District 20, voted for its independence in 1992, and in 1994 it became a separate District 23. The total area of Budapest remained the same.

In 1950, Inner Budapest (former [[Budapest|Little Budapest]]) had 1.05 million inhabitants and the annexed suburbs 0.55 million. Now Inner Budapest has only 0.95 million inhabitants while the former suburb's population increased to 0.75 million. In the 1960s neighbouring villages became the new suburbs (second suburban belt) with rapidly increasing population (from 1950 to 2009 these former villages and small towns population increased from 300,000 to nearly 800,000). Suburbanization and motorization generated traffic jams on urban multi-lane highways. 1 million cars run in Budapest on a weekday.

==Plot==
A romantic story in gypsy family makes a last, desperate effort to find its way out of the Balkan absurdity and misfortune. Their story mirrors the universal story of the rejected and the maladjusted, the forgotten street heroes who make the news only in the obituaries or crime sections... &lt;br /&gt; A romantic story about a gypsy family, living on the periphery of the Macedonian capital. It talks about their efforts through everyday life, colorfully describing their ambitions and their honest and sweet dreams (for the modern world maybe seemingly ridiculous). It is a film about the warm and always hopeful gypsy spirit and performing actual gypsy magic curses. Even though the story is placed in a rural area, it is an everywhere story, with everywhere problems and situations, some of it from every level of society. Big dreams, love, family, acceptance of diversity – are spices of this honest and touching story, which gone make you laugh, and cry, from time to time. A bed is an object of a big dream, does it's gone release?{{clarify|date=August 2012}} Someone dream is to be what is.{{clarify|date=August 2012}} Their dreams are maybe usual and boring but painfully honest.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2122">The '''International Festivals of the Sea''' are a series of maritime festivals, which have been held in various [[United Kingdom|British]] port cities since 1996. The festivals are intended to be celebrations of the sea, bringing together sailors, musicians, artists, entertainers, ships and boats from all points of the compass.

==History==
The first International Festival of the Sea took place in [[Bristol]] in 1996, and the key theme was [[John Cabot]]'s pioneering voyage of discovery to the [[Americas]]. As part of the festival, a replica of Cabot's ship, the ''[[Matthew (ship)|Matthew]]'', was dedicated prior to its reenactment of Cabot's voyage the following year.

The relative success of the first festival, taken with the declining numbers of visitors to [[Navy Day]]s, encouraged the [[Royal Navy]] to invite the festival to [[Portsmouth]] in 1998 and 2001. Unlike the Bristol event, the Portsmouth events had a strong [[navy|naval]] component, and effectively combined the maritime heritage aspects of the first festival with the naval public relations aspects of the old Navy Days. Both events were highly successful with over 200,000 visitors to each.

The 2003 festival was held in [[Edinburgh]]'s port district of [[Leith]]. The 2005 International Festival of the Sea returned to Portsmouth as part of the [[Trafalgar 200]] and Sea Britain 2005 festivities to mark the 200th Anniversary of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

The 2005 Festival of the Sea was sadly the last major event of its type, however, the 2017 Poole Maritime Festival in conjunction with European Maritime Day is set to revive the tradition of popular maritime festivals on 18th to 21st May 2017.

'''''Iqra Institute for Higher Education''''' is a Somali institute for higher education situated in the town of [[Badhan, Sanaag|Badhan]], in the [[Sanaag]] ([[Maakhir]]) Region of [[Somalia]]. The institute was established in 2008 on the basis of providing opportunities for destitute youth in the region of [[Sanaag]], focusing on vocational courses and other short courses in Management and languages, for its students to reduce poverty, and develop educated individuals who, in return, will help the community with their struggle against poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://somalitalk.com/2010/02/14/warbixin-xaggee-marayaa-machadka-iqra-institute-for-higher-education-kana-qayb-qaadoo-dhameystirkiisa- Xagee marayaa Machadka Iqra (Somali)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Sanaag]] ([[Maakhir]]) region has been subjected to a prolonged lack of any higher educational entity, possibly as a result of the long and devastating [[Somali civil war]], which have had multiple impacts on the local youth, and devastating effects on career developments and the possibility of youth receiving sustainable income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beps.net/publications/SomaliaEducationSectorAssessmentFinalReport.doc.pdf Education in Somalia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Youths have become destitute in high numbers. Harsh socio-economic conditions and lack of higher education have, in turn, escalated their poverty and increased the likelihood of the youths immigrating to other regions of [[Somalia]] to seek further education. The area is huge and lacks basic community institutions in surrounding towns or cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/somalia/education.html UNICEF's assessment on education in Somalia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute offers different types of courses and vocational skill lessons on its main campus in [[Badhan, Sanaag|Badhan]]. The institute has joined the Union of Somali institutes, a consortium of Somalia's institutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spr.fm/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2444:dhegeyso-machadka-iqra-ee-magaalada-badhan-oo-ku-biray-midawga-macaahida-soomaliyeed&amp;Itemid=139- Iqra joins Union of Somali institutes (Somali)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1949">'''Jan Janszoon de Heem''' (bapt. 2 July 1650, [[Antwerp]] – after 1695) was a [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] [[still-life]] painter and the son of [[Jan Davidszoon de Heem]] (1606–1684) and the half-brother of [[Cornelis de Heem]] (1631–1995).&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Sam Segal, "Jan [Johannes] Jansz. de Heem," ''[[Grove Art Online]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] [accessed 21 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many sources, including the [http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Jan+de+heem&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;page=1&amp;subjectid=500049493 Getty Union name Index], have conflicting information about two Jans, both with the same birth and death dates, but ''one being the child of the other''.)&lt;/ref&gt; This family of still-life specialists, of which father Jan Davidszoon de Heem is the most significant, had a strong impact on the [[genre]] throughout the [[Dutch republic|north]] and [[Southern Netherlands|south]] [[Netherlands (terminology)|Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Sam Segal, "Jan Davidsz. de Heem," ''[[Grove Art Online]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] [accessed 21 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Janszoon de Heem Nature morte aux fleurs.jpg|thumb|Jan Janszoon de Heem, [[still life]] (1685).]]

Jan was [[baptise]]d in [[Antwerp]] on 2 July 1650, but was trained by his father in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; His works, in fact, are nearly indistinguishable from his father's, and the fact that they both signed them as ''J de Heem'' have meant that many paintings in major collections attributed to Jan Davidszoon are actually by Jan Janszoon.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;

'''Khonvoum''' is the supreme god and creator of the [[Mbuti|Bambuti]] [[Pygmy]] people in [[central Africa]]. He is the 'great hunter', god of the hunt, and carries a bow made of two snakes which appears to mortals as a rainbow. He rules the heavens and when the sun sets, he gathers pieces of the stars and throws it at the sun so that it may rise the next day in its full splendor. He contacts people by means of the mythical elephant [[Gor (mythology)|Gor]] (the thunderer) or through a [[chameleon]].
Khonvoum created black and white people from black and white clay, and the Pygmies from red clay. For them he also created the jungle with its lush vegetation and animal life.

'''Kumarcilar Han''' (Gambler's Inn) is a [[caravansarai]] located in [[North Nicosia]], [[Northern Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="Dubin 2002 loc=98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubin|Morris|2002|loc=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown when exactly it was built, however it is thought to be built around the end of the 17th century, is much smaller and modest when compared with [[Büyük Han]] (Great Inn). Similar to all caravansarai, the entrance leads to an open air courtyard, which is surrounded by a two storey building, originally containing 56 rooms. Those on the upper story were used by the travelers, while those on the ground floor were used for their animals and belongings. Since then, the Kumarcilar Han has entered into a state of disrepair, is in danger of collapse. Efforts to restore the building have been hampered, due to lack of funds. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatson-northcyprus.com/interest/nicosia/north_nicosia/kumarcilar.htm|title=Kumarcilar Han (Gamblers' Inn), Nicosia, North Cyprus|publisher=northcyprus.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at January 2018, the Kumarcilar Han has been fully restored, and is used as a cafe/restaurant, as well as small shops selling local items.

According to Haşmet Muzaffer Gürkan, the door of the caravenserai "indubitably" used to belong to a Latin building. A hypothesis about its name states that it was originally called "Kumbaracılar Hanı", after a subdivision of the Ottoman army, "kumbaracılar". It was recorded with different names at different times, in 1881, it was called "Kuchuk Khan" ("Small Inn") in a map and Rupert Gunnis wrote in 1936 that it was called the "Khan of Itinerant Musicians".&lt;ref name=gurkan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gürkan|first1=Haşmet Muzaffer|title=Dünkü ve Bugünkü Lefkoşa|publisher=Galeri Kültür|isbn=9963660037|pages=161|edition=3rd|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the total number of votes is lower than the total for the parties, as each voter has as many votes as there are seats in a constituency, and thus can cast multiple votes.

'''Rajac''' is a mountain in western [[Serbia]]. The summit of the mountain lies at {{convert|847|m}}.

The mountain is touristically the best developed and most accessible in the vicinity of [[Belgrade]]. On Rajac the [[battle of Kolubara]] was fought during [[World War I]]. [[Trench]]es dug by the [[Royal Serbian Army|Serbian army]] in November 1914 are still visible.&lt;ref name="nature of serbia"&gt;{{cite book|title=NATURE OF SERBIA - Holiday on the move|date=2013|publisher=National Tourism Organisation of Serbia|location=Belgrade|isbn=978-86-6005-295-9|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[https://www.na-tsa.org/ North American Taiwan Studies Association (NATSA)]''' is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit academic organization established in 1994. It is operated by overseas Taiwanese students, North American doctoral students, and recent graduates who are interested in [[Taiwan studies]].&lt;ref name=NATSAWeb&gt;http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/21/institutes/21PP10.html&lt;/ref&gt; The NATSA annual conferences are the largest academic events on Taiwan Studies in North America. The NATSA conferences not only provide scholars and students of [[Taiwan]] Studies a regular forum to meet and exchange intellectual ideas, but also allow researchers on East-Asia and beyond to receive dynamic feedback and broaden their academic horizons. 

== Early history ==
When NATSA was founded, it was known as the North American Taiwan Studies Conference and was located on the web at www.natsc.org until August 2006 when it switched to its current address.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060803202034/http://natsc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ooredoo Algeria''' (formerly Nedjma)  is a telecommunications company in [[Algeria]].

== History ==
Ooredoo Algeria’s operations began in 2004 as Nedjma, positioned as the first multimedia operator in Algeria. In November 2013, Nedjma officially rebranded as Ooredoo Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Qatar’s Ooredoo rebrands Algerian telco Nedjma|url = http://www.arabianbusiness.com/qatar-s-ooredoo-rebrands-algerian-telco-nedjma-526519.html|website = Arabian Business|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ooredoo Algeria introduced the first EDGE network in the country in 2004 and launched 3G services in Algeria in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ooredoo: Best 3G+ network in Algeria|url = http://www.telecomreview.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1063:ooredoo-best-3g-network-in-algeria&amp;catid=72&amp;Itemid=399|website = www.telecomreview.com|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ooredoo completed Algeria’s first 4G trial with Nokia in Tlemcen reaching speeds of up to 75Mb/s.

[[Image:PACE logo 75ppi.png|thumb|The emblem of the PACE]]
{{Politics of the Council of Europe}}
The '''Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe''' ('''PACE''') is the parliamentary arm of the [[Council of Europe]], a 47-nation international organisation dedicated to upholding human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The Council of Europe is an older and wider circle of nations than the 28-member [[European Union]] &amp;ndash; it includes, for example, Russia and Turkey among its member states &amp;ndash; and oversees the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

The Assembly is made up of 324 members drawn from the national parliaments of the Council of Europe's member states, and generally meets four times a year for week-long plenary sessions in [[Strasbourg]]. It is one of the two statutory bodies of the Council of Europe, along with the [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe|Committee of Ministers,]] the executive body representing governments, with which it holds an ongoing dialogue. However, it is the Assembly which is usually regarded as the "motor" of the organisation, holding governments to account on human rights issues, pressing states to maintain democratic standards, proposing fresh ideas and generating the momentum for reform.

The Assembly held its first session in [[Strasbourg]] on 10 August 1949, making it one of the oldest international assemblies in Europe. Among its main achievements are: 
* ending the death penalty in Europe by requiring new members to stop all executions
* making possible, and shaping, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]
* high-profile reports exposing violations of human rights in Council of Europe member states
* assisting former Soviet countries to embrace democracy after 1989
* inspiring and helping to shape many progressive new national laws
* helping member states to overcome conflict or reach consensus on divisive political or social issues

== Powers ==

{{double image|right|Plenary chamber of the Council of Europe's Palace of Europe 2014 01.JPG|150|Session of the Congress.jpg|150|The [[hemicycle]] of the PACE at the [[Palace of Europe]]}}
Unlike the [[European Parliament]] (an institution of the [[European Union]]), the Assembly does not have the power to create binding laws. However, it speaks on behalf of 820 million Europeans and has the power to:
* demand action from the 47 Council of Europe governments, who &amp;ndash; acting through the organisation's executive body &amp;ndash; must jointly reply
* probe human rights violations in any of the member states
* question Prime Ministers and Heads of State on any subject
* send parliamentarians to observe elections and mediate over crises
* set the terms on which states may join the Council of Europe, through its power of veto
* inspire, propose and help to shape new national laws
* request legal evaluations of the laws and constitutions of member states
* sanction a member state by recommending its exclusion or suspension
Important statutory functions of PACE are the election of the judges of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], the Council of Europe's [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] and its [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe|Secretary General]], as well as the members of the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]].

In general the Assembly meets four times per year in [[Strasbourg]] at the [[Palace of Europe]] for week-long plenary sessions. The nine permanent committees of the Assembly meet all year long to prepare reports and draft resolutions in their respective fields of expertise.

The Assembly sets its own agenda, but its debates and reports are primarily focused on the [[Council of Europe]]'s three core statutory aims, defending [[human rights]], promoting [[democracy]] and upholding the [[rule of law]].

===Election of judges to the European Court of Human Rights===
Judges of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] are elected by PACE from a list of three candidates nominated by each member state which has ratified the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. A 20-member committee made up of parliamentarians with legal experience – meeting [[in camera]] – interviews all candidates for judge on the Court and assesses their CVs before making recommendations to the full Assembly, which elects one judge from each shortlist in a secret vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=5106&amp;lang=2&amp;cat=8 PACE creates a special committee for the election of judges to the European Court of Human Rights], 24/06/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Judges are elected for a period of nine years and may not be re-elected.

Although the European Convention does not, in itself, require member states to present a multi-sex shortlist of potential appointees, in a 2004 resolution PACE decided that it "will not consider lists of candidates where the list does not include at least one candidate of each sex" unless there are exceptional circumstances .&lt;ref&gt;Adelaide Remiche (August 12, 2012), [http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/election-of-the-new-belgian-judge-to-the-ecthr-an-all-male-short-list-demonstrates-questionable-commitment-to-gender-equality/ Election of the new Belgian Judge to the ECtHR: An all-male short list demonstrates questionable commitment to gender equality] Oxford Human Rights Hub, [[University of Oxford]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, around one third of the current bench of [http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=court/judges&amp;c=#n1368718271710_pointer 47 judges] are women, making the Court a leader among international courts on gender balance.

== Achievements ==

=== Birthplace of the European Convention on Human Rights ===
At its very first meeting, in the summer of 1949, the Parliamentary Assembly adopted the essential blueprint of what became the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], selecting which rights should be protected and defining the outline of the judicial mechanism to enforce them. Its detailed proposal, with some changes, was eventually adopted by the [[Council of Europe]]'s ministerial body, and entered into force in 1953. Today, more than sixty years later, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] - given shape and form during the Assembly's historic post-war debates - is regarded as a global standard-bearer for justice, protecting the rights of citizens in 47 European nations and beyond, and paving the way for the gradual convergence of human rights laws and practice across the continent. The Assembly continues to elect the judges of the Court.

=== A helping hand for emerging democracies ===
Over the decades, the Assembly has been at the forefront of supporting democratic change in successive waves of European nations at key moments in their history, negotiating their entry into the Council of Europe "club of democracies" (as the Assembly has a veto on any new member joining the organisation, it has used this power to negotiate with applicant countries the conditions on which they join). In the 1950s it led the way in embracing recently-defeated Germany, in the 1960s it took a strong stand during the Greek crisis, and in the 1970s it welcomed post-Franco Spain and Portugal into the democratic fold. Above all, it played a key role after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, creating a path towards membership for former Communist countries with its "Special Guest status", paving the way for the historic reconciliation of European nations under one roof.

=== Exposing torture in CIA secret prisons in Europe: the "Marty reports" ===
In two reports for the Assembly in 2006 and 2007, Swiss Senator and former Prosecutor [[Dick Marty]] revealed convincing evidence [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-en.asp?newsid=5722&amp;lang=2] that terror suspects were being transported to, held and tortured in CIA-run “secret prisons” on European soil. The evidence in his first report [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewPDF.asp?FileID=11527&amp;lang=en] in 2006 - gathered with the help of investigative journalists and plane-spotters among others - suggested that a number of Council of Europe member states had permitted CIA "rendition flights" across their airspace, enabling the secret transfer of terror suspects without any legal rights. In a second report [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewPDF.asp?FileID=11555&amp;lang=en] in 2007, Marty showed how two member states - Poland and Romania - had allowed "secret prisons" to be established on their territory, where torture took place. His main conclusions - subsequently confirmed in a series of rulings by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], as well as a comprehensive US Senate report - threw the first real light on a dark chapter in US and European history in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, kicked off a series of national probes, and helped to make torture on European soil less likely.

== Historic speeches made to PACE ==
In 2018 an online archive of all speeches made to the Parliamentary Assembly by heads of state or government since its creation in 1949 appeared on the Assembly's website, the fruit of a two-year project entitled [http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-By-Country-EN.asp "Voices of Europe"]. At the time of its [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-en.asp?newsid=7112&amp;lang=2 launch], the archive comprised 263 speeches delivered over a 70-year period by some 216 Presidents, Prime Ministers, monarchs and religious leaders from 45 countries - though it continues to expand, as new speeches are added every few months.

Some very early speeches by individuals considered to be "founding fathers" of the European institutions, even if they were not heads of state or government at the time, are also included (such as Sir [[Winston Churchill]] or [[Robert Schuman]]). Addresses by eight monarchs appear in the list (such as King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], King [[Albert II of Belgium]] and Grand Duke [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Henri of Luxembourg]]) as well as the speeches given by religious figures (such as [[Pope John Paul II]]) and several leaders from countries in the Middle East and North Africa (such as [[Shimon Peres]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Hosni Mubarak]], [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] or King [[Hussein of Jordan]]).

The full text of the speeches is given in both English and [http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-By-Country-FR.asp French], regardless of the original language used. The archive is searchable by country, by name, and chronologically.

== Languages ==
The official languages of the Council of Europe are [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], but the Assembly also uses [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] as working languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/eu-affairs/2015/05/24/turkeys-presence-at-council-of-europe-increased|title=Turkey’s presence at Council of Europe increased|date=24 May 2015|work=DailySabah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each parliamentarian has separate earphones and a desk on which they are able to select the language which they would like to listen to. When foreign guests wish to address the Assembly in languages other than its working languages, they must bring their own interpreters.

== Controversies ==

===Sanctions against the Russian delegation===

In April 2014, after the Russian parliament's backing for the occupation of Crimea and [[2014–16 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], the Assembly decided to suspend the Russian delegation's voting rights as well as the right of Russian members to be represented in the Assembly's leading bodies and to participate in election observation missions. However, the Russian delegation remained members of the Assembly. The sanction applied throughout the remainder of the 2014 session and was renewed for a full year in January 2015, lapsing in January 2016.

In response, the Russian parliamentary delegation suspended its co-operation with PACE in June 2014, and in January 2016 - despite the lapsing of the sanctions - the Russian parliament decided not to submit its delegation's credentials for ratification, effectively leaving its seats empty. It did so again in January 2017 and again in January 2018. Russia's seats remain empty,

The sanctions applied only to Russian parliamentarians in PACE, the Council of Europe's parliamentary body. Russia continues to be a full member of the Council of Europe, and retains full rights in the organisation's other bodies, including its statutory executive body, the [[Committee of Ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2014/april/russia-suspended-from-council-of-europe-body/80516.aspx|title=Russia suspended from Council of Europe body|date=10 April 2014|publisher=EuropeanVoice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alleged corruption ===
In 2013, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that “some council members, notably Central Asian states and Russia, have tried to influence the organisation’s parliamentary assembly with lavish gifts and trips”.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Dempsey (February 4, 2013),  [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/world/europe/05iht-letter05.html Corruption Undermining Democracy in Europe] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, said member states also hire lobbyists to fend off criticism of their human rights records.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Dempsey (April 27, 2012),  [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/28/world/europe/28iht-letter28.html Where a Glitzy Pop Contest Takes Priority Over Rights] [[International Herald Tribune]]''.''&lt;/ref&gt; German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' had earlier revealed details about the strategies of [[Azerbaijan]]’s government to influence the voting behaviour of selected members of the Parliamentary Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Neukirch (January 4, 2012),  [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-dictator-s-dream-azerbaijan-seeks-to-burnish-image-ahead-of-eurovision-a-806769.html A Dictator's Dream: Azerbaijan Seeks to Burnish Image Ahead of Eurovision] [[Der Spiegel]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, following a series of critical reports by the [[European Stability Initiative]] (ESI) NGO, and concern expressed by many members of the Assembly, the Assembly's Bureau decided on a three-step response to these allegations, including the setting up of an independent, external investigation body. In May 2017, three distinguished former judges were named to conduct the investigation: Sir [[Nicolas Bratza]], a British former President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]]; [[Jean-Louis Bruguière]], a French former anti-terrorist judge and investigator; and Elisabet Fura, a former Swedish parliamentary Ombudsman and judge on the Strasbourg Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=6663&amp;lang=2&amp;cat=13|title=Allegations of corruption within PACE: appointment of the members of the external investigation body|date=May 30, 2017|website=PACE: News|publisher=Council of Europe|access-date=September 6, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no other known examples in recent history of an international organisation setting up an independent, external anti-corruption probe into itself.

The investigation body, which was [http://semantic-pace.net/tools/pdf.aspx?doc=aHR0cDovL2Fzc2VtYmx5LmNvZS5pbnQvbncveG1sL1hSZWYvWDJILURXLWV4dHIuYXNwP2ZpbGVpZD0yMzYxMiZsYW5nPUVO&amp;xsl=aHR0cDovL3NlbWFudGljcGFjZS5uZXQvWHNsdC9QZGYvWFJlZi1XRC1BVC1YTUwyUERGLnhzbA==&amp;xsltparams=ZmlsZWlkPTIzNjEy invited] to carry out its task "in the utmost confidence", appealed for anyone with information relevant to its mandate to [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=6792&amp;cat=401 come forward], and held a series of hearings with witnesses. The investigation body's final [http://assembly.coe.int/Communication/IBAC/IBAC-GIAC-Report-EN.pdf report] was published on 22 April 2018 after nine months of work, finding "strong suspicions of corruptive conduct involving members of the Assembly" and naming a number of members and former members as having breached the Assembly's Code of Conduct.

The Assembly responded by declaring, in a [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=7053&amp;lang=2 resolution], "zero tolerance for corruption". Following a series of hearings, it sanctioned many of the members or former members mentioned in the Investigative Body's report, either by [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-en.asp?newsid=7066&amp;lang=2 depriving] them of certain rights, or by [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-en.asp?newsid=7142&amp;lang=2 excluding] them from the Assembly's premises for life. It also undertook a major overhaul of its [http://website-pace.net/en_GB/web/apce/transparency-and-integrity integrity framework] and Code of Conduct.

=== Cultural divisions ===
Although the Council of Europe is a human rights [[wikt:watchdog|watchdog]] and a guardian against discrimination, it is widely regarded as becoming increasingly divided on moral issues because its membership includes mainly Muslim Turkey as well as East European countries, among them Russia, where social conservatism is strong.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Stephen Castle (October 4, 2007),  [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/world/europe/04iht-schools.4.7755476.html European lawmakers condemn efforts to teach creationism] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, this became evident when the Parliamentary Assembly voted on a report compiled by [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Liberal Democrat]] [[Anne Brasseur]] on the rise of Christian [[creationism]], bolstered by right-wing and populist parties in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

== Members ==
The Assembly has a total of 648 members in total – 324 principal members and 324 substitutes&lt;ref&gt;This number is fixed by article 26.&lt;/ref&gt; – who are appointed or elected by the parliaments of each [[Council of Europe#Membership, observers, partners|member state]]. Delegations must reflect the balance in the national parliament, so contain members of both ruling parties and oppositions. The population of each country determines its number of representatives and number of votes. This is in contrast to the Committee of Ministers, the Council of Europe's executive body, where each country has one vote. While not full members, the parliaments of [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] hold "Partner for Democracy" status with the Assembly - which allows their delegations to take part in the Assembly's work, but without the right to vote - and there are also observer delegates from the [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Israel]]i and [[Mexico|Mexican]] parliaments.

Some notable former members of PACE include:
* former heads of state or government such as Britain's wartime leader Sir [[Winston Churchill]], former German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], former Turkish President [[Abdullah Gül]], former Cypriot President [[Glafcos Clerides]], former Finnish President [[Tarja Halonen]], former Georgian President [[Mikhail Saakashvili]], former Albanian President [[Sali Berisha]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/AssemblyList/MP-Search-Alpha-Archives-EN.asp|title=Members since 1949|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dick Marty]] ([[Switzerland]]), appointed in late 2005 as [[rapporteur]] to investigate the [[CIA]] [[extraordinary rendition]]s scandal and [[organ theft in Kosovo]] by the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] from the [[Kosovo war]], in 1998–2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR968%282010%29&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=DC&amp;BackColorInternet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorLogged=A9BACE|title=Council of Europe|work=coe.int|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marcello Dell'Utri]] ([[Italy]]), convicted for complicity in conspiracy with [[the Mafia]] ({{lang-it|concorso in associazione mafiosa}}), a crime for which he was found guilty on appeal and sentenced to 7 years in 2010.&lt;ref name="rep111204"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainews24.rai.it/it/news.php?newsid=142469|title=Rai News: le ultime notizie in tempo reale – news, attualità e aggiornamenti|website=www.rainews24.rai.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Scottish soldier, adventurer, writer and MP Sir [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] (United Kingdom), author of the autobiographical memoir and trevelogue ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'', who was a member of PACE on two separate occasions, in [http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/AssemblyList/MP-Details-EN.asp?MemberID=1559 1972-3 and 1951-2][http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/AssemblyList/MP-Details-EN.asp?MemberID=1559].

=== Parliaments with Partner for Democracy status ===

Parliaments with Partner for Democracy status, pledge to work towards certain basic values of the Council of Europe, and agree to occasional assessments of their progress. In return, they are able to send delegations to take part in the work of the Assembly and its committees, but without the right to vote.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1374">'''Rada''' is a major family of [[loa]] in [[Haitian Vodou]]. 
==Scope==
They include older, beneficent spirits who can be directly traced to [[Dahomey]] [[West African Vodun|Vudus]] of West Africa. 

==Etymology==
"Rada" is a [[cognate]] of [[Arará]], and also [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] [[orisha]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.manigua.org/resources/orishas/legba_ghede.html |title= Manigua.org: Loa of Vodou |accessdate= June 9, 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060720164803/http://www.manigua.org/resources/orishas/legba_ghede.html |archivedate= July 20, 2006 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Rada loas are guardians of [[ethics|morals and principles]], related to Africa, whereas [[Petro loa]]s are connected to the [[New World]] of the [[Western hemisphere|West]], and are considered more aggressive. Some loas (such as [[Erzulie]]) have both Rada and Petro manifestations.

==Identities==
Some Rada loa are: [[Papa Legba|Legba]], [[Loco (loa)|Loco]], [[Ayizan]], [[Anaisa Pye]], [[Damballa]], [[Ayida-Weddo]], [[Erzulie]], and [[Agwé]].

'''RaiSat''' was a subsidiary of [[RAI]] created in 1997 to produce thematic TV channels for satellite television that are now available in IPTV and digital terrestrial television with various providers.

== History ==
Rai Sat was created as external company in 1997 to create the first satellite channels of public service.

In July 1999, with the transfer from Rai's staff that was employed towards thematic channels, the company began to produce the first pay satellite platform networks for Tele+, then reorganized under Sky.

In 2009, following the non-renewal of the contract with Sky (Platform for which RaiSat produced exclusively its channels) it was announced that the parent company was preparing to fold RaiSat.

Until 18 March 2010, the shareholders of RaiSat were Rai (with 95% shares) and [[RCS MediaGroup]] (with 5% shares), On that date, the proportion of shares owned by RCS (equivalent to three million €) was liquidated.

On 18 May 2010, RaiSat was folded into Rai.

== Television channels ==
===The first free channels===
Activities started under Rai's ownership with 4 channels in September–October 1997, followed by a fifth in 1999:
* Rai Sat 1 - Cultura e spettacolo
* Rai Sat 2 - Ragazzi
* Rai Sat 3 - Enciclopedia
* Rai Sat Nettuno (now Uninettuno Università TV)
* Rai Sport Satellite (1 February 1999)

On 29 July 1998, the channels were outsourced to RaiSat S.p.A.

===Transformation into pay-TV===
In 1999, Rai's satellite channels were encrypted and Rai Sat 3 was changed to RaiSat Educational.

The other 2 channels became 7 and were available on D+ (later TELE+ DIGITALE):
* Raisat Ragazzi dedicated to children and teens
* Raisat Gambero Rosso devoted to cooking
* Raisat Cinema devoted to cinema
* Raisat Album dedicated to the memory of the past
* Raisat Show devoted to the show
* Raisat Art dedicated to the art and cultural heritage
* Raisat Fiction devoted to TV series

===Sky era===
In 2003, when Sky launched, Rai Sat reorganized its channels. Raisat Art, Raisat Fiction, Raisat Album and Raisat Show were sacrificed.

5 channels were included in the Mondo Sky package:
* Raisat Ragazzi
* Raisat Gambero Rosso
* Raisat Cinema World (former Raisat Cinema)
* Raisat Prem1um (merger of Raisat Album and Raisat Fiction)
* Raisat Extra (former Raisat Show)

On 1 November 2006, RaiSat Cinema World reverted to the old name RaiSat Cinema, and RaiSat Ragazzi and was divided into:
* Raisat YOYO
* Raisat Smash

On 1 January 2009, RaiSat Smash rebranded to RaiSat Smash Girls.

===Return to free to air===
On 31 July 2009, at the end of lengthy negotiations, Rai wasn't able to renew the contract with Sky for the transmission of RaiSat channels. The bouquet was thus forced to abandon the satellite platform for a fee and was brought resized on DTT and on the nascent Tivùsat satellite platform.

As a result, RaiSat Gambero Rosso was sold, while RaiSat Smash Girls was closed down.

The available channels spared down to 4 and they were no longer visible in the Sky bouquet, but on terretrial television and the Tivùsat satellite platform as well as streaming on Rai.tv:

* RaiSat Extra
* RaiSat Prem1um
* RaiSat Cinema
* RaiSat YOYO

On 18 May 2010, Rai absorbed the company, and reorganized all channels by changing their name (with the removal of the word Sat) and directly overseeing the program schedules, as a result:
* RaiSat Extra was changed to [[Rai Extra]].
* RaiSat Prem1um was changed to [[Rai Premium]].
* RaiSat Cinema was changed to [[Rai Movie]].
* RaiSat YOYO was changed to [[Rai Yoyo]].

On 26 November 2010, Rai Extra was closed and replaced by [[Rai 5]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5290">"'''Stately quadrille'''" is a term popularly used to describe the constantly shifting alliances between the [[Great Powers]] of Europe during the 18th century. The ultimate objective was to maintain the [[balance of power in Europe]] to stop any one alliance or country becoming too strong. It takes its name from the [[quadrille]], a dance in which the participants constantly swap partners.

The most widely cited instance was in 1756, when Britain and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] abandoned their 25-year-long [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance]] and instead made new alliances with their former enemies, [[Prussia]] and France, respectively. That was known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].

==Background==
Shifting alliances had long been a factor in European politics and were often regarded as responses to shifting power and threat. During the 16th century and the early 17th century, much of the emphasis in European politics had been on restricting the power of Spain. 

In the second half of the 17th century, Spain was replaced by France as Europe's leading power. Several European coalitions were formed against Spain and France, culminating in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], from 1702 to 1713.

==Quadrille==
[[Image:Quadrille-Ete-Lebas-ca1820.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[quadrille]] was a popular dance of the 18th century. Because of its similarity to the way in which Great Powers swapped partners, the term was swiftly applied to describe it.]]
In the years immediately after the war, Britain and France, which were widely considered to have been the leaders of opposing coalitions in the last war, formed an [[Anglo-French Alliance (1716–31)|Anglo-French Alliance]] and recognised that they shared temporary, mutual interests. In the years that followed, they managed to defeat a resurgent Spain, formerly a French ally, in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]]. Spain sought an alliance with Austria and gained it in 1725. 

By 1731 Britain and France were clearly drifting apart. A diplomatic initiative with Austria was begun by the British government, and a new [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance]] was created. Spain withdrew its friendship with Austria and eventually ended up allied to France again. 

In 1733, however the [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance]] seemed under threat, when the British failed to assist the Austrians in the [[War of the Polish Succession]]. Austria had to rely heavily on Russia for assistance and was forced to make huge concessions to France in the 1738 peace treaty. Britain realised that its failure to intervene had allowed France to become too strong.

[[Image:Carte Guerre de Sept Ans Europe.PNG|thumb|280px|The stately quadrille reached its height in 1756, when several new alliances formed as a result of the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].]]

In 1740, Prussia, an emerging power, attacked Austria. Britain and France soon became embroiled in the war, which ended in a stalemate in 1748, but Austria appeared to have lost most in the war. Despite extensive British funding, it was increasingly disillusioned about the [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance]] and began looking for a replacement.

In 1756, Austria did what was considered unthinkable by many by abandoning its British connection to form a new alliance with France. Fearing that Continental Europe would be destabilised and led to war, Britain made an alliance with Prussia at the [[Convention of Westminster]] in the hope that a new [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] would prevent war.

==Decline==
The concept began to fade in the second half of the 18th century, as Britain and France became the dominant European powers. The failure to prevent the [[Seven Years' War]], in which over a million died, was a major factor. States began to seek a more stable and longlasting series of alliances: one of the most successful in the second half of the century was the [[Bourbon Family Compact]] between France and Spain, which endured throughout a number of major European conflicts, including the Wars of [[War Of The Austrian Succession|Austrian]] and [[War Of The Polish Succession|Polish]] Successions and the [[Seven Years' War]] and endured past the [[American War of Independence]] in which French and Spanish support contributed towards British defeat.

After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a [[Concert of Europe]] was set up to create a forum for discussion rather than create shifting alliance patterns, which had a tendency to cause major wars. This was successful through most of the 19th century, until the [[First World War]] collapsed the post-Napoleonic system amid increasingly acute nationalist tensions, which led to the formation of Germany and the collapse of the Austrian, Russian, and Ottoman empires.

'''USA-117''', also known as '''GPS IIA-16''', '''GPS II-25''' and '''GPS SVN-33''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the sixteenth of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-117 was launched at 00:21:00 UTC on 28 March 1996, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D234, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-117 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 1996, USA-117 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20080|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20284|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.96 minutes, and 54.7 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcasts the PRN 03 signal, and operates in slot 2 of plane C of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite has a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}. It had a design life of 7.5 years;&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; however, it actually remained in service until August 2, 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7876">"'''Why The Future Doesn't Need Us'''" is an article written by [[Bill Joy]] (then Chief Scientist at [[Sun Microsystems]]) in the April 2000 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine. In the article, he argues (quoting the sub title) that "Our most powerful 21st-century technologies&amp;mdash;[[robotics]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[nanotechnology|nanotech]]&amp;mdash;are threatening to make humans an [[endangered species]]." Joy warns:

{{cquote|The experiences of the [[History of nuclear weapons|atomic scientists]] clearly show the need to take personal responsibility, the danger that things will move too fast, and the way in which a process can take on a life of its own. We can, as they did, create insurmountable problems in almost no time flat. We must do more thinking up front if we are not to be similarly surprised and shocked by the consequences of our inventions.}}

While some critics  have characterized Joy's stance as [[obscurantism]] or [[neo-Luddism]], others share his concerns about the consequences of rapidly expanding technology.&lt;ref&gt;Khushf, George (2004). "The Ethics of Nanotechnology: Vision and Values for a New Generation of Science and Engineering", ''Emerging Technologies and Ethical Issues in Engineering'', National Academy of Engineering, pp. 31–32. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. {{ISBN|030909271X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Joy argues that developing technologies provide a much greater danger to humanity than any technology before has ever presented. In particular, he focuses on [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]]. He argues that 20th-century technologies of destruction such as the [[nuclear bomb]] were limited to large governments, due to the complexity and cost of such devices, as well as the difficulty in acquiring the required materials. He uses the novel ''[[The White Plague]]'' as a potential nightmare scenario, in which a [[mad scientist]] creates a virus capable of wiping out humanity.

Joy also voices concern about increasing computer power. His worry is that computers will eventually become more intelligent than we are, leading to such [[dystopian]] scenarios as [[cybernetic revolt|robot rebellion]]. He notably quotes [[Ted Kaczynski]] (the Unabomber) on this topic.

==Criticisms==
In ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', [[Ray Kurzweil]] questioned the regulation of potentially dangerous technology, asking "Should we tell the millions of people afflicted with [[cancer]] and other devastating conditions that we are canceling the development of all [[bioengineering|bioengineered]] treatments because there is a risk that these same technologies may someday be used for malevolent purposes?".  However [[John Zerzan]] and [[Chellis Glendinning]] believe that modern technologies are bad for both freedom and the problem of cancer, and that the two issues are connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=What Ails Us? | first = John | last= Zerzan | authorlink= John Zerzan | work= Green Anarchy | issue = 10 | url= https://archive.org/stream/GreenAnarchy10/GA10_djvu.txt |publisher= Federated Anarchy Inc |date= 31 October 2002  |accessdate=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/age-of-grief.htm |title=Age of Grief |publisher=Primitivism.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and the Rise of Civilization |first=Mark Nathan | last=Cohen| url=http://www.primitivism.com/health-civilization.htm |publisher=Primitivism.com (excerpt);  Yale University Press |year= 1991 |accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001 article "A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists", Bill Joy was criticized for having technological [[tunnel vision]] on his prediction by failing to consider social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink1=John Seely Brown | first1=John Seely | last1=Brown | authorlink2=Paul Duguid |first2= Paul | last2=Duguid |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists | publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science | work= Science and Technology Policy Yearbook | year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McGinnis]] argues that Joy's proposal for "relinquishment" of technologies that might lead to [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) would fail because "prohibitions, at least under current technology and current geopolitics, are certain to be ineffective". Verification of AGI-limitation agreements would be difficult due to AGI's [[Dual-use technology|dual-use]] nature and ease of being hidden. Similarly, Joy's "Hippocratic oath" proposal of voluntary abstention by scientists from harmful research would not be effective either, because scientists might be pressured by governments, tempted by profits, uncertain which technologies would lead to harm down the road, or opposed to Joy's premise in the first place. Rather than relinquishment of AGI, McGinnis argues for a kind of [[differential technological development]] in which [[friendly artificial intelligence]] is advanced faster than other kinds.&lt;ref name=McGinnis2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGinnis|first1=John O.|title=Accelerating AI|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|date=Summer 2010|volume=104|issue=3|pages=1253–1270|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=nulr_online|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Extropian]] futurist [[Max More]] shares Kurzweil's viewpoint on matters of the impractical and ineffective nature of "technological relinquishment," but adds a larger moral and philosophical component to the argument, arguing that the perfection and evolution of humanity is not "losing our humanity" and that voluntarily-sought increased capacity in any domain does not even represent "a loss" of any kind.&lt;ref name=More2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=More|first1=Max |title=Embrace, Don't Relinquish the Future|journal=Extropy|date=May 7, 2000|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/embrace-dont-relinquish-the-future|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the publication of the article, Bill Joy suggested assessing technologies to gauge their implicit dangers, as well as having scientists refuse to work on technologies that have the potential to cause harm.

In the 15th Anniversary issue of ''Wired'' in 2008, Lucas Graves's article reported that the genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics technologies have not reached the level that would make Bill Joy's scenario come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Graves |first=Lucas |url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/16-04/st_15joy |title=15th Anniversary: Why the Future Still Needs Us a While Longer |work=Wired | publisher=Wired.com |date= 24 March 2008 |accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
