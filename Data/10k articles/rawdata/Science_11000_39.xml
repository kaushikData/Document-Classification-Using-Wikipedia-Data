'''''400 Years of the Telescope: A Journey of Science, Technology and Thought''''' is a 2009 American [[documentary film]] that was created to coincide with the [[International Year of Astronomy]] in 2009. Directed by [[Kris Koenig]], it chronicles the history of the [[telescope]] from the time of [[Galileo]] and features interviews with leading [[astrophysicists]] and [[cosmologists]] from around the world, who explain concepts ranging from Galileo's first use of the telescope to view the moons of Jupiter, to the latest discoveries in space, including new ideas about life on other planets and [[dark energy]], a mysterious vacuum energy that is accelerating the expansion of the [[universe]].

The '''BSSN formalism''' is a [[Scientific formalism#In modern physics|formalism]] of [[general relativity]] that was developed by Thomas W. &lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;aumgarte, Stuart L. &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;hapiro, Masaru &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;hibata and Takashi &lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;akamura between 1987 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ksc.re.kr/kcnr/Presentations/26thNR/26thNRJKim.pdf |title=General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Using BSSN formalism |date=2008-07-28 |author=Jinho Kim |publisher=[[Seoul National University]] |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66TbfxEOa?url=http://www.ksc.re.kr/kcnr/Presentations/26thNR/26thNRJKim.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the [[ADM formalism]] developed during the 1950s.

The ADM formalism is a [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalism that does not permit stable and long-term numerical simulations. In the BSSN formalism, the ADM equations are modified by introducing auxiliary variables. The formalism has been tested for a long-term evolution of linear gravitational waves and used for a variety of purposes such as simulating the non-linear evolution of [[gravitational wave]]s or the evolution and collision of [[black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/listing/bibliography/pram/Masaru_Shibata/ |title=Status of numerical relativity |date=October 2004 |author=Masaru Shibata |publisher=[[Indian Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=4338837 |title=Formation of black hole and emission of gravitational waves |year=2006 |author=Takashi Nakamura |journal=[[Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B]] |volume=82 |issue=9 |pages=311–327 |bibcode=2006PJAB...82..311N |doi=10.2183/pjab.82.311 |pmid=25792793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12156">[[File:LA LEY DE MURPHY.jpg|thumb|This is an example of toast that has landed butter-side down.]]
The '''buttered toast phenomenon''' is an [[observation]] that [[butter]]ed [[toast]] tends to land butter-side down after it falls. It is used an [[idiom]] representing pessimistic outlooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/butter-side-down.html|title='Why does bread always fall buttered side down?' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|last=Martin|first=Gary|website=Phrasefinder|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various people have attempted to determine whether there is an actual tendency for bread to fall in this fashion, with varying results.

==Origins==

The phenomenon is said to be an old proverb from "the north country." Written accounts can be traced to the mid-19th century. The phenomenon is often attributed to a parodic poem of [[James Payn]] from 1884:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apperson|first1=George Latimer|title=Dictionary of Proverbs|date=2005|publisher=Wordsworth Editions Ltd.|location=Ware|isbn=1840223111|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7PMZJqSR4sAC&amp;dq=I%27ve+never+had+a+piece+of+toast+Particularly+long+and+wide%2C+But+fell+upon+the+sanded+floor%2C+And+always+on+the+buttered+side.&amp;q=buttered+toast#v=onepage&amp;q=buttered&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgaUQc8NbTYC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%C2%A0James+Payn+from+1884+butter+side+down&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eUG4bkloJ2&amp;sig=SAta2G677ttPbqmzrWIsGij9iIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE6L-pw7vUAhUR92MKHQOHAhcQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0James%20Payn%20from%201884%20butter%20side%20down&amp;f=false|title=The Facts on File Dictionary of Proverbs|last=Manser|first=Martin H.|date=2007|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|isbn=9780816066735|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation
|
I never had a slice of bread,&lt;br /&gt;
Particularly large and wide,&lt;br /&gt;
That did not fall upon the floor,&lt;br /&gt;
And always on the buttered side!
}}

In the past, this has often been considered just a pessimistic belief. A study by the [[BBC]]'s television series ''[[Q.E.D. (BBC TV series)|Q.E.D.]]'' found that when toast is thrown in the air, it lands butter-side down just one-half of the time (as would be predicted by chance).&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic /&gt; However, several scientific studies have found that when toast is dropped from a table (as opposed to being thrown in the air), it does fall butter-side down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breakfast at Murphy's (or why the toast lands butter-side down) |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1331810/Breakfast-at-Murphys-or-why-the-toast-lands-butter-side-down.html |accessdate=19 December 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=27 May 2001 |first=Robert |last=Matthews |author-link=Robert Matthews (scientist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=R.

== Explanation ==

When toast falls out of one's hand, it does so at an angle, by nature of it having slipped from its previous position, then the toast rotates. Given that tables are usually between two and six feet (0.7 to 1.83 meters), there is enough time for the toast to rotate about one-half of a turn, and thus lands upside down relative to its original position. Since the original position is usually butter-side up, the toast lands butter-side down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buttered Toast and Other Patterns |url=https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_july_98.html |date=July 1998 |website=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |first=Keith |last=Devlin |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the table is over 10 feet (3 meters) tall, the toast will rotate a full 360 degrees, and land butter-side up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite show |title=Butter Side Down |url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/butter-side-down/ |series=[[The Naked Scientists]] |network=[[BBC]] |date=16 December 2007 |first1=Ben |last1=Valsler |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if the toast travels horizontally at over 3.6 miles per hour (1.6&amp;nbsp;m/s), the toast will not rotate enough to land butter-side down.&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic&gt;{{cite web |title=The Anthropomurphic Principle |url=http://www.whydomath.org/Reading_Room_Material/ian_stewart/anthro/anthro.html |website=Why Do Math? |publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] |first=Ian |last=Stewart |date=1995 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the phenomenon is caused by fundamental [[physical constant]]s.&lt;ref name="European-Journal"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matthews |first=R A J |author-link=Robert Matthews (scientist) |title=Tumbling toast, Murphy's Law and the fundamental constants|journal=[[European Journal of Physics]] |date=18 July 1995 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=172–176 |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/16/4/005 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/16/4/005 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |bibcode = 1995EJPh...16..172M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other factors==

The added weight of the butter has no effect on the falling process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why does a falling piece of toast always seem to land on the buttered side? |url=http://www.how-come.net/2009/08/17/why-does-a-falling-piece-of-toast-always-seem-to-land-on-the-buttered-side/ |publisher=How Come? |date=2009-08-17 |first=Kathy |last=Wollard |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830231610/http://www.how-come.net/2009/08/17/why-does-a-falling-piece-of-toast-always-seem-to-land-on-the-buttered-side/ |archivedate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the butter spreads throughout the slice.&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic /&gt;

{{quote
|text=The mass of butter added to toast ( ~4g ) is small compared to the mass of the typical slice of toast (~35g), is spread thinly, and passes into the body of the toast. Its contribution to the total movement of inertia of the toast and rotational dynamics, thus its effect on the toast is negligible.

The following findings are from Mythbusters:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythbusterstheexhibition.com/science-content/butter-side-up/#article|title=Mythbusters Museum|website=Mythbusters Museum|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Period of Rotation''': The usual scenario for a falling piece of toast is that a non-rotating slice slides or careens off a horizontal surface, such as a plate or table, over a fairly straight lip, which serves as a momentary fulcrum. In this scenario, the leading edge (or corner) is subject to the downward acceleration of gravity—without a countering force from the horizontal surface—sooner than the trailing edge (or corner). The interval where the leading edge of the toast is accelerating downward faster than the trailing edge imparts angular momentum. Once the toast begins to fall freely, air resistance governs any further change in angular momentum, with the toast serving as a complex airfoil (extremely difficult to analyze, especially if the toast has large, irregular holes). For a short fall, the initial angular momentum will dominate. The period of rotation is the time it takes for the toast to complete a full 360 degree spin. The problem for toast, in the typical case, is that the floor interrupts its fall somewhere in between a 90 degree and 270 toast rotation—this will cause the toast to go from butter-side-up to butter-side-down. With a higher the release point, there is a greater the chance for it to rotate beyond 270 degrees and consequently land butter-side-up. An even higher release point could cause the toast to rotate more than once, and again land butter-side down, but this is no longer a short fall at low velocity, and turbulence in this case should not be neglected. (Frisbee toast would resist the fulcrum torque due to [[gyroscopic effect]]s and probably not accord with this analysis.) 
* '''Moment of Inertia''': At the moment a piece of toast begins flipping towards the kitchen floor, it has inertia—it doesn’t want to stop flipping if it doesn’t have to. Its moment of inertia is determined by the speed at which the toast is flipping, combined with the size and mass of the toast. Most breakfast toast is about the same size and mass, unless you’re in Texas—home of the giant slices that carry the state name. But any way you slice it, the same rules apply. Add a little velocity to the spin as your breakfast goes sliding off your plate—give it a smack to add some inertia and see how it lands.
* '''Angular Momentum''': Just like a frisbee or a gyroscope, your toast gains stability when it spins. In fact, the faster it spins, the more stable it gets. This is angular momentum, or mass in motion around a single point, in action. Newton once claimed that a mass in motion likes to stay that way, and this is definitely true for toast. Once your toast is spinning, it wants to keep spinning—that is, until some other force acts on it, like the floor.

[[File:RamirezJelly.png|thumb|right|Ramirez's demonstration of the buttered toast phenomenon to prove that the devil is nearby.]]
In the 2010 [[M. Night Shyamalan]] film ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'', a group of adults in an elevator become trapped by unknown forces. Slowly over the course of the film, people begin to die in the elevator as the power blinks on and off, pinning the people against each other and creating a false narrative that the others are murderers (However, it is common opinion that the name of the film spoiled this false narrative). In the film, supporting cast member and fictional security guard Ramirez, in his suspicion that there may be unholy forces at play, dropped a slice of toast with jelly on one side, and dropped it on the floor. The toast landed on the jelly-side, after which Ramirez coined the phrase "Jelly Side Down," and subsequently 'proved' that the devil was nearby. However, there is some dispute in the film about whether or not this did actually prove the devil was near.

This phenomenon was also demonstrated and parodied in the October 29, 2013 ''[[Nostalgia Critic]]'' review of ''Devil'', (Reuploaded on July 23, 2016 by [[Channel Awesome]] on YouTube) in which actor [[Doug Walker (actor)|Doug Walker]] plays a priest who uses multiple food items to determine whether or not the Devil is near. After the other items show no sign of the Devil, the priest tosses a piece of toast as the last test. The toast lands jelly side down which means the Devil is near and the end of the world is imminent. Everybody in the church screams and panics as the priest repeatedly shouts, "Jelly side down!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFmdbXvLvI|title=Devil - Nostalgia Critic season 6, episode 40|last=|first=|date=July 23, 2016|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 7, 2018|author=Doug and Rob Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charlier''' is a crater in the northwest of [[Mare Australe quadrangle]] of Mars, located in the south of [[Terra Sirenum]] and east of the 180th meridian. The crater is  located at 68.56°S latitude and 168.67°W longitude.  It is 106.28&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after [[Henri A. Perrotin]], a French astronomer who studied dark lineations on the planet. Its name was approved in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature (USGS)|title=Charlier|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/1154|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearby prominent craters are  [[Reynolds (Martian crater)|Reynolds]] further south, [[Richardson (Martian crater)|Richardson]] almost southwest and [[Suess (Martian crater)|Suess]] to the west.  East is Chico Valles, the approximate area marking the boundaries of the terrae (lands) Sirenum and Aonia.

Dunes are dominant inside the crater, gullies are not commonly founded as to craters to the north. Most of the northern portion are mare up of layered material made by earlier glaciations.

The crater was first imaged by [[Mariner 9]] in 1972, more detailed images were made later including the Viking Orbiters.

[[File:Pangolin's tail.jpg|thumb|The Chinese pangolin has a [[prehensile tail]]]]
The '''Chinese pangolin''' (''Manis pentadactyla'') is a [[pangolin]] found in northern [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], northern [[Indochina]], through most of [[Taiwan]], and southern [[China]] (including the islands of [[Hainan]]).&lt;ref name=msw3&gt;{{MSW3 Pholidota | id = 13900013 | page = 531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese pangolin is one of eight species of pangolins. All eight of these shy and secretive animals are facing moderate to severe population scarcity in recent times. Asian pangolin species, especially the Chinese pangolin and the [[Sunda pangolin]], are the most endangered of all the pangolin species.&lt;ref name="PROJECT PANGOLIN 2014"&gt;"PROJECT PANGOLIN." PROJECT PANGOLIN RSS. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] reports that the number of Chinese pangolins has declined greatly over the past 15 years. Despite being listed as critically endangered by the IUCN and being protected by [[CITES]], poaching continues to be the main cause of their decline in numbers. Deforestation has also contributed to their depletion.&lt;ref&gt;Pietersen, D., Waterman, C., Hywood, L., Rankin, P. &amp; Soewu, D. 2014. Smutsia temminckii. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

==Appearance and behavior==

{{Unreferenced section|date = November 2014}}

The Chinese pangolin has the appearance of a scaly anteater. Its head and body measure about 40–58&amp;nbsp;cm and its tail measures about {{Convert|25-38|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Naturalist's Guide to the Mammals of Southeast Asia|last = Shepherd|first = Chris R.|publisher = John Beaufoy Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-906780-71-5|location = Wiltshire, UK|pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mature Chinese pangolin weighs from {{convert|2|to|7|kg}}. It has 18 rows of overlapping scales accompanied by hair, a rare combination in mammals. It has a small, narrow mouth and a little, pointed head. Also its claws grow in as it grows older. The female gives birth to a single offspring at a time.

A newborn pangolin weighs about {{Convert|93|g|oz|abbr=on}}, its length is about {{Convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The Chinese pangolin reproduces in April and May when the weather warms. The young also have scales; however, they remain very soft for at least two days, then harden. Although the young pangolin can walk on its first day, the mother carries it on her back or tail. If the mother feels threatened, she immediately folds her baby onto her belly with the help of her tail. Male pangolins have been observed allowing the female and baby to share his burrow.
[[Image:Chinese pangolin skeleton.jpg|thumb|Chinese pangolin [[skeleton]] on display at [[the Museum of Osteology]]]]

Chinese pangolins are rather secretive, nocturnal creatures. They move very slowly and are known for their nonaggressive behavior. Their hard scales work as a protective cover from predators, and when they feel threatened, they curl themselves into balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Bin |title=Pangolin armor: Overlapping, structure, and mechanical properties of the keratinous scales |journal=Acta Biomaterialia |year=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2016.05.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; For further defense, they can climb trees, although this is uncommon.

They mainly eat insects, particularly termites and ants. They dig into ant nests and termite mounds with their large fore claws and extract their prey with their long, sticky tongues.

In Vietnam and Hong Kong, Chinese pangolins are considered a delicacy. They are hunted on a wide scale for human consumption. Factors such as habitat destruction and hunting constantly challenge their survival. Chinese pangolins are now on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, however, since the forests they inhabit are difficult to patrol, preventing people from hunting these animals is difficult.

==Habitats==
The Chinese pangolin digs long burrows in the ground, which they use to sleep and hunt termites.&lt;ref&gt;Challender, D., Baillie, J., Ades, G., Kaspal, P., Chan, B., Khatiwada, A., Xu, L., Chin, S., KC, R., Nash, H. &amp; Hsieh, H. 2014.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dietary needs and eating habits ==
A study done by the ''Chinese Journal of Applied and Environmental Biology'' identified the Chinese pangolin as a "susceptible species due to its food specialization and stenophagy (only eating several species of ants and termites)”.&lt;ref name="en.cnki.com.cn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shibao|first1=Wu|last2=Naifa|first2=Liu|last3=Yingmei|first3=Zahng|last4=Guangzhi|first4=MA|title=Assessment of Threatened Status of Chinese Pangolin|journal=Chinese Journal of Applied and Environmental Biology|date=2004|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-YYHS200404013.htm|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the pangolin's very specific diet, it can become arduous to provide the appropriate food for them while they are being observed and maintained. Pangolins are typically held in zoos due to their abilities to feed and preserve the rare animals.  However, since the 1970s, "pangolins are now almost unknown to visitors and are exhibited infrequently in zoos", and have "historically been difficult to maintain, with most captive animals dying within a short period after capture". When in their natural habitat, this species lives "on a diet of ants, termites, and various other invertebrates including bee larvae, flies, worms, earthworms, and crickets”.  After carefully creating new, more sustainable recipes in zoos, some of the ingredients used have included "egg, meat (ground beef, horse, canned feline diet), evaporated milk products, milk powder, fish protein, orchid leaves, commercial chows, psyllium seed, carrots, yeast, multivitamins, and insects (mixtures of silkworm larvae, earth, ants, termites, meal worms, or crickets)".  A number of zoos that have kept pangolins under observation have found that the animals died most commonly after a few years, without breeding successfully.  Researchers claim this outcome is correlated to the "poor acceptance of captive diets and digestive problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=History and Dietary Husbandry of Pangolins in Captivity|journal=Zoo Biology|date=2007|volume=26|pages=223–230|doi=10.1002/zoo.20134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Pangolin is considered to be high risk in terms of extinction.&lt;ref name="en.cnki.com.cn"/&gt;

==Poaching and trafficking==
The [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] in 2002 prohibited selling pangolins across national borders. Although China has already passed laws to protect the pangolin, it might not be enough to save the species. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora reports that pangolins are the most trafficked and poached mammal.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, James A. "Plight of the Pangolin: The Most Trafficked Animal on Earth Needs More Protection." Nature World News RSS. N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese pangolin is hunted for its meat, claws, and scales. Pangolin meat, which is considered a delicacy in parts of China and Vietnam, has been reported to sell for as high as US$200/kg. Pangolin scales and blood are in demand in Asia for their supposed medicinal qualities.&lt;ref name="PROJECT PANGOLIN 2014"/&gt;  Chinese pangolin scales are sold to treat a wide variety of ailments, from cancer to upset stomach to asthma.  Other pangolin body parts are also used in traditional Chinese medicine. According to one survey composed in 2013, certain Nepalese natives believe pangolin scales are also good-luck charms.&lt;ref&gt;Katuwal, Hem Bahadur, et al. "Pangolins Trade, Ethnic Importance and its Conservation in Eastern Nepal." (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Each pangolin has about {{Convert|500|g|abbr=on}} of scales which can be sold for roughly US$350 on the black market.{{Citation needed|date = November 2014}}

&lt;!-- IUCN Pangolin Specialist Group is seeking to raise {{Clarification needed span|text = 6.7 million|explain = which currency?|date = November 2014}} so they can begin to implement a pangolin recovery plan. These funds would be used to protect pangolin habitat, raise global awareness, and reduce demand for Chinese and Vietnamese buyers.&lt;ref name="Philippine Park 2014"&gt;"12 Chinese Men Whose Boat Had Frozen Pangolin Meat Convicted Of Poaching In Philippine Park." Canadian Press, The (n.d.): Points of View Reference Center. Web. 23 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; 
Though pangolins have been protected by legislation since the 1970s and 1980s, people still choose to hunt these endangered animals. After random inspections on May 28, 2014, at the [[Kwai Chung Container Port|Kwai Chung]] cargo port in Hong Kong, officials detained scales from nearly 8,000 pangolins. Just two weeks later, Hong Kong officials seized a second shipment that contained scales from about 5,000 pangolins.&lt;ref name="Clifton, Merritt 2014"&gt;Clifton, Merritt. "Armor Is Not Enough to Protect Pangolins." Animals 247. N.p., 8 Aug. 2014. Web. 20 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal ''[[Frontiers in Ecology &amp; the Environment]]'' estimated that the remains of about 10,000 pangolins are intercepted each year.&lt;ref name="Philippine Park 2014"&gt;"12 Chinese Men Whose Boat Had Frozen Pangolin Meat Convicted Of Poaching In Philippine Park." Canadian Press, The (n.d.): Points of View Reference Center. Web. 23 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao-Min Zhou and Macdonald from ''Frontiers in Ecology &amp; the Environment'' claim from their records that 220 living pangolins and the remains of 4,909 dead pangolins were seized in 43 law enforcement actions since 2010.&lt;ref name="Clifton, Merritt 2014"/&gt;

The [[Ministry of Forestry (Indonesia)|Indonesian Forestry Ministry]] director of investigations and forest observation, Raffles Panjaitan, told the ''[[Jakarta Post]]'' that in October 2011, his agency had 587 cases of pangolin trafficking since 2006. The estimated value is US$4.3 million worth of pangolins on the illegal market.&lt;ref name="Clifton, Merritt 2014"/&gt;

In April 2013, a Philippine coast guard inspected a boat where they found {{Convert|22,000|lb|kg|abbr = on}} of pangolin meat. They also discovered 400 boxes containing thousands of frozen skinned pangolins and [[scaly anteater]]s from Indonesia. The Regional Trial Court in [[Puerto Princesa]] city in [[Palawan province|Palawan]] province sentenced the boat captain to 12 years in prison and each crew member received from six to 10 years. Each member of the crew was also fined $100,000.&lt;ref name="Philippine Park 2014"/&gt;

===Current status===

In 2016, [[CITES]] moved the Chinese pangolin from its Appendix II, designating species not directly threatened with extinction but in need of protection to prevent exploitation,&lt;ref name="iucnredlist.org"&gt;Challender, D., Baillie, J., Ades, G., Kaspal, P., Chan, B., Khatiwada, A., Xu, L., Chin, S., KC, R., Nash, H. &amp; Hsieh, H. 2014. Manis pentadactyla. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2014.2. www.iucnredlist.org. Downloaded on 22 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; to Appendix I, reserved for species most directly threatened with extinction. The Appendix I listing prohibits commercial trade in wild-caught specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''[[Theguardian.com]]''|last=Carrington|first=Damian|title=Pangolins thrown a lifeline at global wildlife summit with total trade ban|date=28 September 2016|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/pangolins-thrown-a-lifeline-at-global-wildlife-summit-with-total-trade-ban}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the countries where the Chinese pangolin resides have already passed legislation to protect them. Below is a list of the different countries' legislation in order from oldest to newest laws:
 
*1972- [[India]] fully protected the Chinese Pangolin by classifying it as a Schedule I species under the [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972|Wildlife Protection Act]].
*1973- [[Nepal]] made it a Schedule I protected animal under the National Parks and Wildlife Protection Act. 
*1976- [[Hong Kong]] implemented the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance to protect this species and others that are endangered. 
*1989- [[China]] classified the species as a State Category II protected animal with the Protection of Wildlife Act.
*1990- [[Taiwan]] added the entire ''[[Manis]]'' [[genus]] to be protected under the Wildlife Conservation Law, first passed in 1989. 
*1992- China increased protection of the species using the Regulations on the Implementation of Protection of Terrestrial Wild Animals legislation. In the same year, [[Thailand]] classified the genus ''Manis'' as protected under the Wild Animals Reservation and Protection Act B.E. 2535. 
*1994- [[Myanmar]] enacted the Protection of Wildlife and Wild Plants and Conservation of Natural Areas law, which fully protected the species.
*2000- China established more defined terms for the punishment of crimes specifically involving pangolins. 
*2006- China enacted the Regulations on Management of Import and Export of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora to meet CITES guidelines. Additionally, Hong Kong increased its protection of the Chinese pangolin with the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants law. In 2006, Vietnam classified it as a fully protected species in group IIB of Decree 32 in the Management of Endangered, Precious, and Rare Species of Wild Plants and Animals. 
*2007- China intensified its regulations for the use of pangolins in traditional medicines by terminating pangolin hunting licenses, and requiring current stockpiles of pangolin scales to be registered and subject to trade only through designated buyers, like hospitals. Meanwhile, [[Laos]] declared the species as near extinction, but of high importance in the prohibition category of the Wildlife and Aquatic Law. 
*2012- [[Bangladesh]] granted protection of the Chinese pangolin through the Wildlife Conservation and Security Act.&lt;ref name="iucnredlist.org"/&gt;

China has passed much more legislation for pangolin protection than other countries, because the species' population has drastically declined in China over the last few decades. This is the direct result of extreme [[poaching]] for pangolin scales and meat.

===Conservation efforts===

On May 2016, a poll representing 1,892 Chinese adults revealed that more than 80% of the Chinese public want pangolins to be protected. The survey was led by [http://www.tajijin.cn Aita Foundation] and [[Humane Society International]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2016/05/china-pangolin-survey-050616.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abroad====
The [[IUCN]] SSC Pangolin Specialist Group made a proposal in July 2014 to increase awareness, funding, and research for pangolin [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]]. Some of the plan's highlights include making protocols to monitor pangolin populations, establishing a consumption index of pangolin products, using [[DNA analysis]] to determine variation between and within species, and identifying species strongholds to determine best allocation of resources.&lt;ref name="Challender, DWS 2014"&gt;Challender, DWS, Waterman, C, and Baillie, JEM. 2014. Scaling up pangolin conservation. IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group Conservation Action Plan. Zoological Society of London, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the conservation plan aims to increase patrol-based monitoring around stronghold populations, increase awareness and education about the severity of the problem, and, most importantly, implement a [[demand reduction]] strategy for pangolin meat and scales.&lt;ref name="Challender, DWS 2014"/&gt;

Another alternative to legislation, proposed by IUCN, includes offering positive incentives, like monetary payments or control over land's resources, to local communities for their involvement in conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Challender, Dan. "Positive Incentives for Conserving Pangolins in Asia and the Challenges to Be Overcome." SULiNews 7 (Dec. 2013): n. pag. IUCN. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Therefore, further research is needed to find appropriate incentives for the communities near pangolin strongholds, and governments would need to approve of such incentives. --&gt; Other researchers have proposed the importance of finding biological substitutes for endangered species used in traditional medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Luo, Jiao-yang et al. "A Strategy for Trade Monitoring and Substitution of the Organs of Threatened Animals." Scientific Reports. Nature Publishing Group, 31 Oct. 2013. Web. 22 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA barcoding]] and analysis could be used to determine what common species are genetically similar enough and produce similar effects as the Chinese pangolin scales. To crack down on poaching, the barcoding technique could also be used for accurate detection of species products being imported and exported.

====In China====

The [[China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation]] ([http://cbcgdf.org CBCGDF]), a non-profit and [[non-governmental organization]] is particularly proactive in doing research and collecting field data for the conservation of Chinese pangolins. Since July 2017, the Beijing-based NGO has established three Chinese pangolin [http://www.ccafa.org Community Conservation Areas] in [[Hunan]], [[Guangxi]] and [[Jiangxi]] provinces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccafa.org&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CCAfa Jiangxi.jpg|thumb|Community Conservation Area in [[Jiangxi]] province]]
In late August 2017, CBCGDF confiscated 33 Chinese pangolins to Chinese poachers and released them to the Guangxi Wildlife Rescue Centre. Suggestions from the foundation such as the improvement of their rescue regulations and procedures; their immediate release to the wild after full recovery; keeping information open to the public; revising the endangered species conservation laws and regulations in [[Guangxi]], followed the release.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d59444e7a556a4d/share_p.html?t=1487425196258&lt;/ref&gt; However, only 14 Chinese pangolins survived.
At the [https://www.pangolins.org/world-pangolin-day/ World Pangolin Day 2017], CBCGDF called for deletion of pangolin scales from the [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] Book.
CBCGDF also called for the burning of confiscated pangolin scales illegally trafficked to China.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.youth.cn/sh/201702/t20170218_9135573.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover in July 2018, a conference organised by CBCGDF hosted the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] (GBIF). During that conference, CBCGDF openly shared recent and precious data on Chinese pangolins with GBIF.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.china.org.cn/china/2018-07/11/content_56190366.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== "The Critter" ==
[[File:Zoo Leipzig - Tou Feng.jpg|thumb|In [[Leipzig Zoo]]]] 
The Chinese pangolin is probably  "The Critter", one of the pets of the [[Raven FACs]] at their secret base in [[Long Tieng]] during the [[Operation Barrel Roll|covert war in Laos]]. It was described as a foot-long "prehistoric" beast, covered in armor plating with a long tail and a pointed nose, a "cross between a [[sloth]] and an [[armadillo]]", by the US pilots.

After its accidental death, the Critter's body was preserved in a one-gallon jar filled with alcohol. A picture taken of the preserved animal was sent to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC, as well as to the natural history department of [[La Sorbonne]] in Paris, but no positive reply was forthcoming. For a long time, nobody knew what kind of animal it was until one of the pilots stationed in Laos happened to see the animal on a Laotian postage stamp, part of a stamp series on indigenous animals from Laos, under the name "Panis Auritas".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Robbins, ''The Ravens: Pilots of the Secret War in Laos.'' Asia Books 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21945">{{Other uses|CMC (disambiguation)}}
'''Computer-mediated communication''' ('''CMC''') is defined as any human communication that occurs through the use of two or more [[Consumer electronics|electronic]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, Denis. (2005). ''Mcquail's Mass Communication Theory''. 5th ed. London: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the term has [[traditionally]] referred to those communications that occur via computer-mediated formats (e.g., [[instant messaging]], [[email]], [[chat room]]s, [[online forums]], [[social network service]]s), it has also been applied to  other forms of text-based interaction such as [[text messaging]].&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, C., Lengel, L. &amp; Tomic, A. (2004). Computer mediated communication: Social interaction and the internet. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on CMC focuses largely on the social effects of different computer-supported communication technologies. Many recent studies involve Internet-based [[social networking]] supported by [[social software]].

== Forms ==

Computer-mediated communication can be broken down into two forms: synchronous and asynchronous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newtechnocomm.wordpress.com/2016/03/05/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-computer-mediated-communication-in-the-context-of-unimas-students-and-staff/|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Computer Mediated Communication in the Context of UNIMAS Students and Staff|last=Chin|first=Leonora|date=March 5, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronous computer-mediated communication refers to communication which occurs in real time. All parties are engaged in the communication simultaneously; however, they are not necessarily all in the same location.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designingsocialinterfaces.com/patterns/Synchronous_vs._Asynchronous|title=Designing Social Interfaces|last=Malone|first=Erin|last2=Gulati|first2=Harjeet S.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of synchronous communication are video chats and FaceTime audio calls. On the contrary, asynchronous computer-mediated communication refers to communication which takes place when the parties engaged are not communicating in unison. In other words, the sender does not receive an immediate response from the receiver. Most forms of computer mediated technology are asynchronous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples of asynchronous communication are [[Text messaging|text messages]] and [[Email|emails]].

== Scope ==
Scholars from a variety of fields study phenomena that can be described under the umbrella term of computer mediated communication (CMC) (see also [[Internet studies]]). For example, many take a [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociopsychological]] approach to CMC by examining how humans use "computers" (or [[digital media]]) to manage interpersonal interaction, form impressions and  form and maintain relationships.&lt;ref name="Walther96"&gt;Walther, J. B. (1996). Computer-mediated communication: Impersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal interaction. Communication Research, 23, 3-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. B., &amp; [[Burgoon, J. K.]] (1992). Relational communication in computer-mediated interaction. Human Communication Research, 19, 50-88.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have often focused on the differences between online and offline interactions, though contemporary research is moving towards the view that CMC should be studied as embedded in everyday life .&lt;ref&gt;Haythornthwaite, C. and Wellman, B. (2002). The Internet in everyday life: An introduction. In  B. Wellman and C. Haythornthwaite (Eds.), The Internet in Everyday Life (pp. 3-41). Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Another branch of CMC research examines the use of [[paralanguage|paralinguistic]] features such as [[emoticon]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Skovholt, K., Grønning, A. and Kankaanranta, A. (2014), The Communicative Functions of Emoticons in Workplace E-Mails: :-). Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19: 780–797. {{doi|10.1111/jcc4.12063}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] rules such as [[turn-taking]]&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, A. C., &amp; Jacobs, J. B. (1999). The eyes of the beholder: Understanding the turn-taking system in quasi-synchronous computer-mediated communication. Research on Language &amp; Social Interaction, 32, 337-367.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[sequential analysis]] and organization of talk,&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S. (1999). Interactional coherence in CMC. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 4(4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. M. (2006). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1999.tb00106.x/full Computer-mediated conversation: The organization of talk in chat-based virtual team meetings.] Dissertation Abstracts International, 67 (12A), 4388. (UMI No. 3244348)&lt;/ref&gt; and the various [[sociolect]]s, [[Stylistics (linguistics)|styles]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] or sets of terminology specific to these environments (see [[Leet]]). The study of language in these contexts is typically based on text-based forms of CMC, and is sometimes referred to as "computer-mediated discourse analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S. C. (2004). Computer-mediated discourse analysis: An approach to researching online behavior. In: S. A. Barab, R. Kling, and J. H. Gray (Eds.), Designing for Virtual Communities in the Service of Learning (pp. 338-376). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way humans communicate in professional, social, and educational settings varies widely, depending upon not only the environment but also the method of communication in which the communication occurs, which in this case is through computers or other information and communication technologies ([[Information and communication technology|ICTs]]). The study of communication to achieve [[collaboration]]&amp;mdash;common work products&amp;mdash;is termed [[computer-supported collaboration]] and includes only some of the concerns of other forms of CMC research.

Popular forms of CMC include [[e-mail]], [[Video teleconference|video]], [[voice over IP|audio]] or [[text chat]] (text conferencing including "instant messaging"), [[bulletin board system]]s, [[mailing list|list-servs]] and [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]]. These settings are changing rapidly with the development of new technologies.  [[Weblog]]s (blogs) have also become popular, and the exchange of [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] data has better enabled users to each "become their own publisher".

== Characteristics ==
Communication occurring within a computer-mediated format has an effect on many different aspects of an interaction.  Some of those that have received attention in the scholarly literature include impression formation, deception, group dynamics, disclosure reciprocity, disinhibition and especially relationship formation.

CMC is examined and compared to other communication media through a number of aspects thought to be universal to all forms of communication, including (but not limited to) [[synchronicity]], [[persistence (computer science)|persistence]] or "recordability", and [[anonymity]].  The association of these aspects with different forms of communication varies widely. For example, [[instant messaging]] is intrinsically synchronous but not persistent, since one loses all the content when one closes the dialog box unless one has a message log set up or has manually copy-pasted the conversation. E-mail and message boards, on the other hand, are low in synchronicity since response time varies, but high in persistence since messages sent and received are saved. Properties that separate CMC from other media also include transience, its multimodal nature, and its relative lack of governing codes of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, Denis. (2005). Mcquail's Mass Communication Theory. 5th ed. London: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; CMC is able to overcome physical and social limitations of other forms of communication and therefore allow the interaction of people who are not physically sharing the same space.

The medium in which people choose to communicate influences the extent to which people disclose personal information. CMC is marked by higher levels of self-disclosure in conversation as opposed to face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref name="Jiang, C. 2011"&gt;Jiang, C., Bazarova, N., &amp; Hancock, J. (2011). From perception to behavior: Disclosure reciprocity and the intensification of intimacy in computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 40, 125-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Self disclosure is any verbal communication of personally relevant information, thought, and feeling which establishes and maintains interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="Jiang, C. 2011"/&gt; This is due in part to visual anonymity and the absence of nonverbal cues which reduce concern for losing positive [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]. According to Walther’s (1996) [[Hyperpersonal model|hyperpersonal communication model]], computer-mediated communication is valuable in providing a better communication and better first impressions.&lt;ref name=Walther96 /&gt; Moreover, Ramirez and Zhang (2007) indicate that computer-mediated communication allows more closeness and attraction between two individuals than a face-to-face communication.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn., R., 2013. Identity Theories and Technology. p.30. East Tennessee State University, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Online impression management, self-disclosure, attentiveness, expressivity, composure and other skills contribute to competence in computer mediated communication.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzberg, B. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00030.x/full "Preliminary Development of a Model and Measure of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) Competence"].&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there is a considerable correspondence of skills in computer-mediated and face-to-face interaction &lt;ref&gt;Bubas, G. &amp; Spitzberg, B. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306165733_The_relations_of_communication_skills_in_face-to-face_and_computer-mediated_communication "The relations of communication skills in face-to-face and computer-mediated communication"].&lt;/ref&gt; even though there is great diversity of online communication tools.

Anonymity and in part privacy and security depends more on the context and particular program being used or web page being visited. However, most researchers in the field acknowledge the importance of considering the psychological and social implications of these factors alongside the technical "limitations".

== Language learning ==
{{main|Language learning software}}
CMC is widely discussed in language learning because CMC provides opportunities for language learners to practice their language.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, Z. (2006). From Theory to Practice: [[Intracultural]] CMC in the L2 Classroom. book chapter, forthcoming in Ducate, Lara &amp; Nike Arnold (Eds.) Calling on CALL: From Theory and Research to New Directions in Foreign Language Teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Warschauer&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (1998). Electronic literacies: Language, culture and power in online education. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted several case studies on using email or discussion boards in different language classes. Warschauer&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (2006). Laptops and literacy: learning in the wireless classroom: Teachers College, Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that information and communications technology “bridge the historic divide between speech...and writing”. Thus, considerable concern has arisen over the reading and writing research in [[Second language|L2]] due to the booming of the Internet.

== Benefits ==
The nature of CMC means that it is easy for individuals to engage in communication with others regardless of time or location. CMC allows for individuals to collaborate on projects that would otherwise be impossible due to such factors as geography.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, [http://denvertechnology.blogspot.com/2012/11/advantages-and-disadvantages-of.html "Advantages and Disadvantages of Computer Mediated Communication"]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CMC can also be useful for allowing individuals who might be intimidated due to factors like character or disabilities to participate in communication. By allowing an individual to communicate in a location of their choosing, CMC call allow a person to engage in communication with minimal stress.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, [http://www.uky.edu/~drlane/techno/cmcasset.htm "Computer-Mediated Communication in the Classroom: Asset or Liability?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Making an individual comfortable through CMC also plays a role in self-disclosure, which allows a communicative partner to open up more easily and be more expressive. When communicating through an electronic medium, individuals are less likely to engage in stereotyping and are less self-conscious about physical characteristics. The role that anonymity plays in online communication can also encourage some users to be less defensive and form relationships with others more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Schouten, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, [http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2009111601&amp;article=3 "An Experimental Test of Processes Underlying Self-Disclosure in Computer-Mediated Communication"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
While computer-mediated communication can be beneficial, technological mediation can also inhibit the communication process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/disadvantage-for-communication-in-computer-technology.|title=Disadvantage for Communication in Computer Technology|last=Fennel|first=Zachary|date=|website=Techwalla|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike face-to-face communication, nonverbal cues such as tone and physical gestures, which assist in conveying the message, are lost through computer-mediated communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, the message being communicated is more vulnerable to being misunderstood due to a wrong interpretation of tone or word meaning. Moreover, according to Dr. Sobel-Lojeski of Stony Brook University and Professor Westwell of Flinders University, the virtual distance that is fundamental to computer-mediated communication can create a psychological and emotional sense of detachment, which can contribute to sentiments of societal isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/virtual-distance-technology-is-rewriting-the-rulebook-for-human-interaction-38693|title=Virtual distance: technology is rewriting the rulebook for human interaction|last=Sobel-Lojeski|first=Karen|last2=Westwell|first2=Martin|date=May 27, 2016|website=The Conversation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Northern Ireland}}

The '''Culture of Northern Ireland''' relates to the traditions of [[Northern Ireland]]. Elements of the [[Culture of Ulster]] and the [[Culture of the United Kingdom]] are to be found.

==Heritage==
Since 1998, the [[Ulster Museum]], Armagh Museum, [[Ulster Folk and Transport Museum]] and the [[Ulster American Folk Park]] have been administered by the National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland.

The [[Linenhall Library|Linen Hall Library]], the oldest library in Belfast, has endured many changes of fortune since its foundation in 1788, but has maintained a vision of providing access to literature and local studies to the population at large.

* [[Museums in Northern Ireland]]
* [[National parks of Northern Ireland]]

==Cuisine==
{{main|Northern Irish cuisine}}
[[File:Ulster Fry 2003.jpg|thumb|An Ulster fry, served in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.]]

Northern Ireland's best known chefs include [[Paul Rankin]] and [[Michael Deane]].

The best known traditional dish in [[Northern Ireland]] is the [[Ulster fry]].
Two other popular meals are [[fish and chips]] or 'Bangers and Mash' (Sausages and Creamed Potatoes)

A unique speciality to Northern Ireland is [[Yellowman (candy)|Yellowman]]. Yellowman is a chewy toffee-textured honeycomb and is sold in non-standard blocks and chips and is associated with the Ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle, County Antrim, where it is sold along with other confectionery and often [[dulse]].

Dulse is commonly used in Ireland, where it can be used to make white soda bread. It can be found in many health food stores or fish markets and can be ordered directly from local distributors. it is also traditionally sold at the Ould Lammas Fair. It is particularly popular along the Causeway Coast. Although a fast-dying tradition, many gather their own dulse. Along the Ulster coastline from [[County Down]] to [[County Donegal]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]], it is eaten dried and uncooked as a snack.

==Language==
{{main|Languages of Northern Ireland}}
[[File:Multilingual sign Department Culture Leisure Arts Northern Ireland.jpg|thumb|The brand identity of the [[Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure]] in Northern Ireland as shown on this sign is displayed in English, Irish and Ulster Scots]]
English is the most spoken language in Northern Ireland. There are also two recognised [[regional language]]s in Northern Ireland: the [[Irish language]] (''see [[Irish language in Northern Ireland]]'') and the local variety of [[Scots language|Scots]] known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]].&lt;ref name=dcal-lang-faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/frequently_asked_questions.htm|title=Language/Cultural Diversity: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure|accessdate=31 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221094546/http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/frequently_asked_questions.htm|archivedate=21 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern Ireland Sign Language]] and [[Irish Sign Language]] have been recognised since 29 March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/languages/sign_language.htm |title=Sign Language |accessdate=31 January 2011 |publisher=[[Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109104308/http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/languages/sign_language.htm |archivedate=9 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/paul-murphy-announces-recognition-for-sign-language/media-detail.htm?newsID=8540 |title=Paul Murphy announces recognition for sign language |accessdate=31 January 2011 |date=30 March 2004 |publisher=[[Northern Ireland Office]] |quote=I am pleased to announce formal recognition for both British and Irish Sign Languages in Northern Ireland. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520115301/http://www.nio.gov.uk/paul-murphy-announces-recognition-for-sign-language/media-detail.htm?newsID=8540 |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third, [[British Sign Language]] is also used.

At the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], Chinese was the most widely spoken [[minority language]] in Northern Ireland, with [[Shelta]], [[Arabic]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] also spoken by a significant number of people.&lt;ref name=dcal-lang-faq /&gt; Since the census, however, an influx of people from recent EU [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession states]] is likely to have significantly increased numbers of speakers of languages from these countries. Detailed figures on these changes are not yet available.&lt;ref name=dcal-lang-faq /&gt;

{{main|Literature of Northern Ireland}}
Despite its small geographical size, Northern Ireland prolifically produces internationally renowned writers and poets from a wide variety of disciplines.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Irish language]] literature was the predominant literature in the pre-Plantation period. The [[Ulster Cycle]] is pertinent to the history of literature in the territory of present-day Northern Ireland. Ulster Scots literature first followed models from Scotland, with the ''rhyming weavers'', such as [[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]], developing an indigenous tradition of [[vernacular literature]]. Writers in the counties which now form Northern Ireland participated in the [[Gaelic Revival]].

==Symbolism and traditions==
{{uncited section|date=February 2017}}
[[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]] tend to use the [[Union Flag]] and sometimes the [[Ulster Banner]], while [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] usually use the [[Flag of Ireland]], or sometimes the [[Flag of Ulster]]. Both sides also occasionally use the flags of secular and religious organisations they belong to. Some groups, including the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] and the [[Church of Ireland]] use the [[Flag of St. Patrick]] as a symbol of Ireland which lacks the same nationalist or unionist connotations.

The [[flax]] flower, representing the [[linen]] industry, has been used as a neutral symbol – as for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].

[[St. Patrick's Day]] is celebrated by both nationalists and unionists, while "[[The Twelfth]]" is celebrated only by unionists.

[[File:Apprentice Boys Marching Accordions.jpg|thumb|Apprentice Boys band marching in [[Bushmills]].]]
Celebrations to mark the anniversary of the [[Battle of the Boyne]] are held every [[Twelfth of July]] and draw huge crowds. The [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] also organise commemorative events. The [[bowler hat]] is a symbol of [[Orangeism]].

The '''ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter''' ('''TGO''' or '''ExoMars Orbiter''') is a collaborative project between the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and [[Roscosmos]] that sent an atmospheric research [[orbiter]] and the [[Schiaparelli EDM lander|''Schiaparelli'']] demonstration lander to [[Mars]] in 2016 as part of the European-led [[ExoMars]] programme.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161019"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=ExoMars Mission to Join Crowd of Spacecraft at Mars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/science/esa-mars-lander.html |date=19 October 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tbthStatus"&gt;{{Citation |first=J.

The Trace Gas Orbiter delivered the ''Schiaparelli'' lander on 16 October 2016, which crashed on the surface.&lt;ref name=BBC_20_Oct_2016&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37707776 |title=Fears grow for European Schiaparelli Mars lander |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |work=BBC News |date=19 October 2016 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The orbiter began [[aerobraking]] in March 2017 to lower its initial orbit of {{convert|200|by|98000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

A key goal is to gain a better understanding of [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane]] ({{chem2|CH4}}) and other trace gases present in the Martian atmosphere that could be evidence for possible biological activity. The programme will follow with the [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform|Surface Science Platform]] and the [[ExoMars rover]] in 2020,&lt;ref name="LaunchMoved2020"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.esa.int/For_Media/Press_Releases/Second_ExoMars_mission_moves_to_next_launch_opportunity_in_2020 |title=Second ExoMars mission moves to next launch opportunity in 2020 |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |date=2 May 2016 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will search for [[biomolecule]]s and [[biosignature]]s; the TGO will operate as the communication link for the 2020 ExoMars rover and the Surface Science Platform and provide communication for other Mars surface probes with Earth.

The challenge to discern the source of methane in the atmosphere of Mars prompted the independent planning by ESA and NASA of one orbiter each that would carry instruments in order to determine if its formation is of biological or geological origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Paul |last=Rincon |title=Agencies outline Mars initiative |date=9 July 2009 |publisher= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8130393.stm |website=BBC News |accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=NASA orbiter to hunt for source of Martian methane in 2016 |date=6 March 2009 |url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/health/nasa-orbiter-to-hunt-for-source-of-martian-methane-in-2016_100163335.html |website=Thaindian News |accessdate=26 July 2009 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its decomposition products such as [[formaldehyde]] and [[methanol]].

=== Origins ===
ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter was born out of the nexus of ESA's [[Aurora programme]] [[ExoMars]] flagship and NASA's 2013 and 2016 Mars Science Orbiter (MSO) concepts.&lt;ref name="smithtgm20090910"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/pages/images/stories/PSDS%20Mars1%20Smith-TGM.pdf |title=Mars Trace Gas Mission: Science Rationale &amp; Concept |series=Presentation to the NRC Decadal Survey Mars Panel |first=Michael |last=Smith |date=10 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JointInstrument"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jul-09/JIDT_for_MEPAG.pdf |title=Report to MEPAG on the ESA-NASA Joint Instrument Definition Team (JIDT) for the Proposed 2016 Orbiter-Carrier |publisher=NASA |first1=R. |last1=Zurek |first2=A. |last2=Chicarro |date=29 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730203811/http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jul-09/JIDT_for_MEPAG.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a flexible collaborative proposal within NASA and ESA to send a new orbiter-carrier to Mars in 2016 as part of the European-led ExoMars mission.&lt;ref name="Mustard" /&gt; On the ExoMars side, ESA authorised about half a billion Euros in 2005 for a rover and mini-station; eventually this evolved into being delivered by an orbiter rather than a cruise stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight101.com/exomars/project-history/ |title=Brief ExoMars Project History |website=Spaceflight101.com |date=2016 |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|MSO}}Attempted collaboration with NASA ===
[[NASA]]'s '''Mars Science Orbiter''' (MSO) was originally envisioned in 2008 as an all-NASA endeavour aiming for a late 2013 launch.&lt;ref name="smithtgm20090910" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JointInstrument" /&gt; NASA and ESA officials agreed to pool resources and technical expertise and collaborate to launch only one orbiter.&lt;ref name="split"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Michael A. |last=Taverna |title=ESA Proposes Two ExoMars Missions |date=19 October 2009 |website=[[Aviation Week]] |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/Exomars101909.xml&amp;headline=ESA%20Proposes%20Two%20ExoMars%20Missions |accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement, called the [[Mars Exploration Joint Initiative]], was signed on July 2009 and proposed to use an [[Atlas rocket]] launcher instead of a [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]], which significantly altered the technical and financial setting of the European ExoMars mission. Since the ExoMars rover was originally planned to be launched along with the TGO, a prospective agreement would require that the rover lose enough weight to fit aboard the Atlas launch vehicle with NASA's orbiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/nasa-could-take-role-european-exomars-mission.html |title=NASA Could Take Role in European ExoMars Mission |date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of reducing the rover's mass, it was nearly doubled when the mission was combined with other projects to a multi-spacecraft programme divided over two [[Atlas V]] launches:&lt;ref name="split" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oct12"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=Europe's Mars plans move forward |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8302876.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) was merged into the project, carrying a meteorological lander planned for launch in 2016. The European orbiter would carry several instruments originally meant for NASA's MSO, so NASA scaled down the objectives and focused on atmospheric trace gases detection instruments for their incorporation in ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.&lt;ref name="trace-gas-orbiter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JointInstrument" /&gt;

Under the [[2013 United States federal budget|FY2013 budget]] President [[Barack Obama]] released on 13 February 2012, NASA terminated its participation in ExoMars due to budgetary cuts in order to pay for the cost overruns of the [[James Webb Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Kremr |title=Experts React to Obama Slash to NASA's Mars and Planetary Science Exploration |date=1 February 2012 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/93512/experts-react-to-obama-slash-to-nasas-mars-and-planetary-science-exploration/ |website=Universe Today |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NASA's funding for this project cancelled, most of ExoMars' plans had to be restructured.&lt;ref name="cancellation"&gt;{{cite news |first=Megan |last=Whewell |title=Have Europe's Martian exploration plans been derailed by America? |date=15 February 2012 |website=MSN News |url=http://news.uk.msn.com/blog/the-space-blog-blogpost.aspx?post=1fac64fc-9e63-4c9c-9304-ce598c2ab71d |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2012, the ESA's ruling council announced it would press ahead with its ExoMars program in partnership with the Russian space agency [[Roscosmos]], which planned to contribute two heavy-lift [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton launch vehicles]] and an additional entry, descent and landing system to the 2020 rover mission.&lt;ref name="Svitak"&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Svitak |title=Europe Joins Russia on Robotic ExoMars |date=16 March 2012 |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/awx/2012/03/15/awx_03_15_2012_p0-437120.xml&amp;headline=Europe%20Joins%20Russia%20on%20Robotic%20ExoMars |website=Aviation Week |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Selding"&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=De Selding |title=ESA Ruling Council OKs ExoMars Funding |date=15 March 2012 |url=http://spacenews.com/15032esa-ruling-council-oks-funding-for-mars-mission-with-russia/ |website=Space News |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NASA drops ExoMars missions in 2013 budget |date=15 February 2012 |url=http://optics.org/news/3/2/23 |work=Optics |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/16/spacewatch-nasa-mars-exomars |title=Spacewatch: Uncertainties for ExoMars |date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stillKeen"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=Europe still keen on Mars missions |date=15 March 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17390576 |website=BBC News |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the collaboration proposal with Roscosmos, the ExoMars mission is split into two parts: the orbiter/lander mission in March 2016 that includes the TGO and a {{convert|2.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} diameter stationary lander built by ESA named [[Schiaparelli EDM lander|''Schiaparelli'']];&lt;ref name="ExoMars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/exomars_2016.html |title=ExoMars |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013 |work=Russian Space Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; this will be followed by the [[ExoMars rover]] mission in 2020,&lt;ref name="LaunchMoved2020"/&gt; also to be launched with a Russian Proton rocket.

[[File:Maquette Exomars Orbiter Salon du Bourget 2015 DSC 0045.jpg|thumb|Scale model of the ''ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter'' displayed during the [[Paris Air Show]], 2015]]

The TGO separated from the ExoMars [[Schiaparelli EDM lander|''Schiaparelli'']] demonstration lander and would have provided it with telecommunication relay for 8 [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sol|Martian solar days (sols)]] after landing. Then the TGO gradually underwent [[aerobraking]] for seven months into a more circular orbit for science observations and will provide [[Communications satellite|communications relay]] for the ExoMars rover to be launched in 2020, and will continue serving as a relay satellite for future landed missions.&lt;ref name="june2011" /&gt;

[[File:Martian Methane Map.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of a methane plume found in Mars' atmosphere during the northern summer season]]
The nature of the [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane source]] requires measurements of a suite of trace gases in order to characterise potential biochemical and geochemical processes at work. The orbiter has very high sensitivity to (at least) the following molecules and their [[isotopomers]]:
[[water]] ({{chem2|H2O}}), [[hydroperoxyl]] ({{chem2|HO2}}), [[nitrogen dioxide]] ({{chem2|NO2}}), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem2|N2O}}), [[methane]] ({{chem2|CH4}}), [[acetylene]] ({{chem2|C2H2}}), [[ethylene]] ({{chem2|C2H4}}), [[ethane]] ({{chem2|C2H6}}), [[formaldehyde]] ({{chem2|H2CO}}), [[hydrogen cyanide]] ({{chem2|HCN}}), [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem2|H2S}}), [[carbonyl sulfide]] ({{chem2|OCS}}), [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem2|SO2}}), [[hydrogen chloride]] ({{chem2|HCl}}), [[carbon monoxide]] ({{chem2|CO}}) and [[ozone]] ({{chem2|O3}}).

;Characterisation:
*Spatial and temporal variability: latitude–longitude coverage multiple times in a Mars year to determine regional sources and seasonal variations (reported to be large, but still controversial with present understanding of Mars gas-phase photochemistry)
*Correlation of concentration observations with environmental parameters of temperature, dust and ice aerosols (potential sites for heterogeneous chemistry)&lt;ref name="trace-gas-orbiter" /&gt;
;Localisation:
*Mapping of multiple tracers (e.g., [[aerosol]]s, [[water vapour]], [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[Methane|{{chem2|CH4}}]]) with different photochemical lifetimes and correlations helps constrain model simulations and points to source/sink regions
*To achieve the spatial resolution required to localise sources might require tracing molecules at parts-per-billion concentrations

=== Relay telecommunications ===
[[File:Pia17952 electra transceiver dsc09326 0.jpg|thumb|An [[Electra (radio)|Electra radio]], in this case the one for the ''MAVEN'' probe. Electra radios were also deployed on the ''Trace Gas Orbiter'' and on other Mars telecommunications assets.]]
Due to the challenges of entry, descent and landing, Mars landers are highly constrained in mass, volume and power. For landed missions, this places severe constraints on antenna size and transmission power, which in turn greatly reduce direct-to-Earth communication capability in comparison to orbital spacecraft. As an example, the capability downlinks on ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]'' rovers have only {{frac|1|600}} the capability of the ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'' downlink. Relay communication addresses this problem by allowing Mars surface spacecraft to communicate using higher data rates over short-range links to nearby Mars orbiters, while the orbiter takes on the task of communicating over the long-distance link back to Earth. This relay strategy offers a variety of key benefits to Mars landers: increased data return volume, reduced energy requirements, reduced communications system mass, increased communications opportunities, robust critical event communications and ''in situ'' navigation aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/decadal/CharlesDEdwards.pdf |title=Relay Orbiters for Enhancing and Enabling Mars ''In Situ'' Exploration |publisher=Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group |first1=Charles D. |last1=Edwards, Jr. |first2=William B. |last2=Banerdt |first3=David W. |last3=Beaty |first4=Leslie K. |last4=Tamppari |first5=Richard W. |last5=Zurek |date=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA provided an [[Electra (radio)|Electra telecommunications relay]] and navigation instrument to assure communications between probes and rovers on the surface of Mars and controllers on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=De Selding |title=U.S., Europe Won't Go It Alone in Mars Exploration |date=26 September 2012 |url=http://spacenews.com/us-europe-wont-go-it-alone-mars-exploration/ |website=Space News |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TGO will provide the ExoMars rover with a telecommunication relay; it will also serve as a relay satellite for future landed missions.&lt;ref name="june2011" /&gt;

'''Fityk''' is a [[curve fitting]] and data analysis application, predominantly used to fit analytical,
bell-shaped functions to experimental data. It is positioned to fill the gap between general plotting software and programs specific for one field, e.g. [[crystallography]] or [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy|XPS]].

Originally, Fityk was developed to analyse [[powder diffraction]] data. It is also used in other fields that require peak analysis and peak-fitting, like [[chromatography]] or various kinds of [[spectroscopy]].

Fityk is distributed under the terms of [[GNU General Public License]], but since version 1.0.0, subscription is required for downloading binaries. It runs on [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[FreeBSD]] and other platforms. It operates either as a [[command line]] program or with a [[graphical user interface]].

It is written in [[C++]], using [[wxWidgets]], and providing bindings for [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and other [[scripting language]]s.

==Features==
* three [[weighted least squares]] methods:
**[[Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm]],
**[[Nelder-Mead method]]
**[[Genetic algorithm]]
* about 20 built-in functions and support for user-defined functions
* equality constraints
* data manipulations,
* handling series of datasets,
* automation of common tasks with scripts.

==Alternatives==
The programs [http://lorentz.sourceforge.net/ peak-o-mat] and [[MagicPlot]] have similar scope.

More generic data analysis programs with spread-sheet capabilities include the proprietary [[Origin (data analysis software)|Origin]] and its free clones [[QtiPlot]] and [[SciDAVis]].

'''Forensic facial reconstruction''' (or '''forensic facial approximation''') is the process of recreating the face of an individual (whose identity is often not known) from their [[skeletal]] remains through an amalgamation of artistry, [[anthropology]], [[osteology]], and [[anatomy]].  It is easily the most subjective—as well as one of the most controversial—techniques in the field of [[forensic anthropology]].  Despite this controversy, facial reconstruction has proved successful frequently enough that research and methodological developments continue to be advanced.

In addition to remains involved in criminal investigations, facial reconstructions are created for remains believed to be of historical value and for remains of [[prehistoric]] [[hominids]] and [[human]]s.

== Types of identification==
There are two forms pertaining to [[forensic identification|identification]] in [[forensic anthropology]]: '''circumstantial''' and '''positive'''.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;Burns. ''Forensic Anthropology Training Manual.''&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Circumstantial identification''' is established when an individual fits the biological profile of a set of skeletal or largely skeletal remains.  This type of identification does not prove or verify identity because any number of individuals may fit the same biological description.
*'''Positive identification''', one of the foremost goals of forensic science, is established when a unique set of biological characteristics of an individual are matched with a set of skeletal remains.  This type of identification requires the skeletal remains to correspond with medical or dental records, unique ante mortem wounds or pathologies, [[DNA]] analysis, and still other means.&lt;ref&gt;Reichs and Craig. ''Facial Approximation: Procedures and Pitfalls.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction presents investigators and family members involved in criminal cases concerning unidentified remains with a unique alternative when all other identification techniques have failed.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;  Facial approximations often provide the stimuli that eventually lead to the positive identification of remains.

== Legal admissibility ==
In the U.S., the [[Daubert Standard]] is a legal precedent set in 1993 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] regarding the admissibility of [[expert witness]] [[testimony]] during legal proceedings, set in place to ensure that expert testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, derived from proper application of reliable principles and methods.&lt;ref name=Steadman&gt;Steadman&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple [[forensic]] artists produce approximations for the same set of skeletal remains, no two reconstructions are ever the same and the data from which approximations are created are largely incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer et al. ''Assessment of the Reliability of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, forensic facial reconstruction does not uphold the [[Daubert Standard]], is not considered a legally recognized technique for positive identification, and is not admissible as expert testimony. Currently, reconstructions are only produced to aid the process of positive identification in conjunction with verified methods.

== Types of reconstructions ==

=== Two-dimensional reconstructions ===
[[File:2D facial reconstruction.jpg|thumb|An example of a 2D facial reconstruction conducted by forensic artist Karen T. Taylor, and the subsequent identification, [[Murder of April Lacy|April Dawn Lacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riggs|first1=Robert|title=Robert Riggs Reports Forensic Artist Reconstructs Victims Faces May 2004|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o70ltA64lI|accessdate=13 January 2015|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Forensic facial reconstruction of Alberto di Trento.jpg|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of [[Alberto di Trento]] by Arc-Team and the 3D artist Cicero Moraes]]

Two-dimensional facial reconstructions are based on ante mortem [[photograph]]s, and the [[human skull|skull]].  Occasionally skull radiographs are used but this is not ideal since many cranial structures are not visible or at the correct scale. This method usually requires the collaboration of an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  A commonly used method of 2D facial reconstruction was pioneered by [[Karen T. Taylor]] of Austin, Texas during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, Paul. "Saving Face." Forensic Files. Prod. Paul Bourdett and Vince Sherry. Dir. Michael Jordan. 28 Nov. 2007. Television.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's method involves adhering tissue depth markers on an unidentified skull at various anthropological landmarks, then photographing the skull.  Life-size or one-to-one frontal and lateral photographic prints are then used as a foundation for facial drawings done on transparent vellum.  Recently developed, the F.A.C.E. and C.A.R.E.S. computer software programs quickly produce two-dimensional facial approximations that can be edited and manipulated with relative ease.  These programs may help speed the reconstruction process and allow subtle variations to be applied to the drawing, though they may produce more generic images than hand-drawn artwork.&lt;ref name=Reichs&gt;Reichs and Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Three-dimensional reconstructions ===
Three-dimensional facial reconstructions are either: 1) sculptures (made from casts of [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains) created with modeling clay and other materials or 2) high-resolution, [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional computer images]].  Like two-dimensional reconstructions, three-dimensional reconstructions usually require both an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  Computer programs create three-dimensional reconstructions by manipulating scanned [[photograph]]s of the unidentified cranial remains, [[stock photography|stock photographs]] of facial features, and other available reconstructions. These computer approximations are usually most effective in victim identification because they do not appear too artificial.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; This method has been adapted by the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]], which uses this method often to show approximations of an [[unidentified decedent]] to release to the public in hopes to identify the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Unidentified murder victim a 'total nightmare' case for detectives| url=http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| accessdate=9 July 2015| first=Adam| last=Rodewald| date=5 August 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714184728/http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| archivedate=14 July 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superimposition ===
[[Superimposition]] is a technique that is sometimes included among the methods of forensic facial reconstruction.  It is not always included as a technique because investigators must already have some kind of knowledge about the identity of the skeletal remains with which they are dealing (as opposed to 2D and 3D reconstructions, when the identity of the skeletal remains are generally completely unknown).  Forensic [[superimposition]]s are created by superimposing a photograph of an individual suspected of belonging to the unidentified skeletal remains over an [[X-ray]] of the unidentified [[human skull|skull]].  If the skull and the photograph are of the same individual, then the anatomical features of the face should align accurately.&lt;ref name=Lundy&gt;Lundy. ''Physical Anthropology In Forensic Medicine''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Hermann Welcker]] in 1883 and [[Wilhelm His, Sr.]] in 1895, were the first to reproduce three-dimensional facial approximations from [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains.&lt;ref&gt;Forensic Facial Reconstruction: The Final Frontier&lt;/ref&gt;  Most sources, however, acknowledge His as the forerunner in advancing the technique.  His also produced the first data on average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness followed by Kollmann and Buchly who later collected additional data and compiled tables that are still referenced in most laboratories working on facial reproductions today.&lt;ref name=Rhine&gt;Rhine. ''Facial Reproductions In Court.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction originated in two of the four major subfields of [[anthropology]].  In [[biological anthropology]], they were used to approximate the appearance of early [[Hominidae|hominid]] forms, while in [[archaeology]] they were used to validate the remains of historic figures.  In 1964, [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail Gerasimov]] was probably the first to attempt paleo-anthropological facial reconstruction to estimate the appearance of ancient peoples&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Iscan. ''Craniofacial Image Analysis and Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although students of Gerasimov later used his techniques to aid in criminal investigations, it was [[Wilton M Krogman|Wilton M. Krogman]] who popularized facial reconstruction's application to the [[forensic]] field.  [[Wilton M Krogman|Krogman]] presented his method for facial reconstruction in his 1962 book, detailing his method for approximation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Others who helped popularize three-dimensional facial reconstruction include Cherry (1977), Angel (1977), Gatliff (1984), Snow (1979), and Iscan (1986).&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;

In 2004 it was for Dr. Andrew Nelson of the [[University of Western Ontario]], Department of Anthropology that noted Canadian artist [[Christian Corbet]] created the first forensic facial reconstruction of an approximately 2,200-year-old mummy based on CT and laser scans. This reconstruction is known as the Sulman Mummy project.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Technique for creating a three-dimensional clay reconstruction ==
[[File:Skulls_for_Facial_Approximation.jpg|thumb|Skulls for Facial Approximation]]

Because a standard method for creating [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] forensic facial reconstructions has not been widely agreed upon, multiple methods and techniques are used.  The process detailed below reflects the method presented by Taylor and Angel from their chapter in Craniofacial Identification in Forensic Medicine, pgs 177-185.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor and Angel. ''Facial Reconstruction and Approximation.''&lt;/ref&gt; This method assumes that the sex, age, and race of the remains to undergo facial reconstruction have already been determined through traditional [[forensic]] [[anthropological]] techniques.

The [[human skull|skull]] is the basis of facial reconstruction; however, other physical remains that are sometimes available often prove to be valuable.  Occasionally, remnants of [[soft tissue]] are found on a set of remains.  Through close inspection, the forensic artist can easily approximate the thickness of the soft tissue over the remaining areas of the skull based on the presence of these tissues.  This eliminates one of the most difficult aspects of reconstruction, the estimation of tissue thickness.  Additionally, any other bodily or physical evidence found in association with remains (e.g. jewelry, hair, glasses, etc.) are vital to the final stages of reconstruction because they directly reflect the appearance of the individual in question.

[[File:Steps of forensic facial reconstruction - Virtual Mummy - cogitas3d.gif|left|thumb|Steps of forensic facial reconstruction of a [[mummy]]]]

Most commonly, however, only the bony skull and minimal or no other soft tissues are present on the remains presented to forensic artists.  In this case, a thorough examination of the skull is completed.  This examination focuses on, but is not limited to, the identification of any bony pathologies or unusual landmarks, ruggedness of [[muscle]] attachments, profile of the [[Human mandible|mandible]], symmetry of the [[nasal bone]]s, [[dentition]], and wear of the occlusal surfaces.  All of these features have an effect on the appearance of an individual's face.

Once the examination is complete, the skull is cleaned and any damaged or fragmented areas are repaired with wax. The mandible is then reattached, again with wax, according to the alignment of teeth, or, if no teeth are present, by averaging the vertical dimensions between the mandible and [[maxilla]].  Undercuts (like the nasal openings) are filled in with modeling clay and [[prosthetic]] eyes are inserted into the orbits centered between the superior and inferior [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] rims.  At this point, a plaster cast of the skull is prepared.  Extensive detail of the preparation of such a cast is presented in the article from which these methods are presented.

After the cast is set, colored plastics or the colored ends of safety matches are attached at twenty-one specific "landmark" areas that correspond to the reference data.  These sites represent the average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness for persons of the same sex, race, and age as that of the remains.  From this point on, all features are added using modeling clay.

First, the [[facial]] [[muscle]]s are layered onto the cast in the following order: temporalis, masseter, buccinator and occipito-frontals, and finally the soft tissues of the neck.  Next, the nose and lips are reconstructed before any of the other muscles are formed.  The lips are approximately as wide as the interpupillary distance.  However, this distance varies significantly with age, sex, race, and occlusion.  The nose is one of the most difficult facial features to reconstruct because the underlying [[bone]] is limited and the possibility of variation is expansive.  The nasal profile is constructed by first measuring the width of the nasal aperture and the nasal spine.  Using a calculation of three times the length of the spine plus the depth of tissue marker number five will yield the approximate nose length.  Next, the pitch of the nose is determined by examining the direction of the nasal spine - down, flat, or up.  A block of clay that is the proper length is then placed on the nasal spine and the remaining nasal tissue is filled in using tissue markers two and three as a guide for the bridge of the nose.  The [[Nasalis muscle|alae]] are created by first marking a point five millimeters below the bottom of the nasal aperture.  After the main part of the nose is constructed, the alae are created as small egg-shaped balls of clay, that are five millimeters in diameter at the widest point, these are positioned on the sides of the nose corresponding with the mark made previously.  The alae are then blended to the nose and the overall structure of the nose is rounded out and shaped appropriately.

The muscles of facial expression and the soft tissue around the eyes are added next.  Additional measurements are made according to race (especially for those with eye folds characteristic of Asian descent) during this stage.  Next, tissues are built up to within one millimeter of the tissue thickness markers and the ears (noted as being extremely complicated to reproduce) are added.  Finally, the face is "fleshed," meaning clay is added until the tissue thickness markers are covered, and any specific characterization is added (for example, hair, wrinkles in the skin, noted racial traits, glasses, etc.). The skull of Mozart was the basis of his facial reconstruction from anthropological data. The bust was unveiled at the "Salon du Son", Paris, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with facial reconstruction ==
There are multiple outstanding problems associated with forensic facial reconstruction.&lt;ref name=Lebedinskaya&gt;Lebedinskaya et al. ''Principles of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insufficient tissue thickness data ===
[[File:Gail Mathews.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction and actual photograph of [[Gary Ridgway|Green River victim]] Gail Mathews. The victim had distinctive lips, which could not be represented in the reconstruction, as her body was decomposed.]]
[[File:Durham, Ontario Jane Doe facial reconstructions.jpg|left|thumb|In many cases, the subject's hairstyle is unknown, which causes an artist to guess possible solutions, such as this unidentified woman found in Ontario, Canada.]]

The most pressing issue relates to the data used to average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness.  The data available to forensic artists are still very limited in ranges of ages, sexes, and body builds.  This disparity greatly affects the accuracy of reconstructions.  Until this data is expanded, the likelihood of producing the most accurate reconstruction possible is largely limited.&lt;ref name=Rathbun&gt;Rathbun. ''Personal Identification: Facial Reproductions.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of methodological standardization ===
A second problem is the lack of a methodological standardization in approximating facial features.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; A single, official method for reconstructing the face has yet to be recognized.  This also presents major setback in facial approximation because facial features like the eyes and nose and individuating characteristics like hairstyle - the features most likely to be recalled by witnesses - lack a standard way of being reconstructed.  Recent research on [[computational forensics|computer-assisted methods]], which take advantage of digital image processing, pattern recognition, promises to overcome current limitations in facial reconstruction and linkage.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Subjectivity ===
Reconstructions only reveal the type of face a person ''may'' have exhibited because of artistic subjectivity.  The position and general shape of the main facial features are mostly accurate because they are greatly determined by the skull.&lt;ref name=Helmer&gt;Helmer et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Image:National Geographic - King Tut face.jpg|thumb|The facial reconstruction of [[Tutankhamun]] as shown on the cover of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' in 2005.]]

In recent years, the presence of forensic facial reconstructions in the [[entertainment industry]] and the [[Mass media|media]] has increased.{{Or|date=November 2008}}  The way the fictional criminal investigators and forensic anthropologists utilize forensics and facial reconstructions are, however, often misrepresented{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} (an influence known as the "[[CSI effect]]").{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  For example, the fictional forensic investigators will often call for the creation of a facial reconstruction as soon as a set of skeletal remains is discovered. In many instances, facial reconstructions have been used as a last resort to stimulate the possibility of identifying an individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Crime: An Introduction to Forensic Archaeology'' {{ISBN|0-415-16612-8}} p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; 

Facial reconstruction has been featured as part of an array of forensic science methods in fictional TV shows like ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and their respective spinoffs in the [[CSI (franchise)|''CSI'']] and [[NCIS (franchise)|''NCIS'']] franchises.

In ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', a long-running TV series centered around forensic analysis of decomposed and skeletal human remains, facial reconstruction is featured in the majority of episodes, used much like a police artist sketch in police procedurals. Regular cast character Angela Montenegro, the Bones team's facial reconstruction specialist, employs 3D software and holographic projection to "give victims back their faces" (as noted in the episode, "A Boy in a Bush").

In the ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' episode "The Secret Of Parker House", MacGyver reconstructs the skull of Penny's aunt Betty while investigating her house.

The facial reconstruction of Egypt's [[Tutankhamun]], popularly known as King Tut, made the June 2005 cover of [[National Geographic Magazine]].

A variety of facial reconstruction kits toys are available, with "crime scene" versions, also, reconstructions of famous historical figures, like King Tut and the dinosaur [[T-Rex]].&lt;ref&gt;Several kits from various manufacturers are currently available, others have come and gone over the past decade or so, as evidenced by a Web search for "facial reconstruction kit." Several current models are [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games&amp;field-keywords=facial%20reconstruction at amazon.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, facial reconstruction has been part of the process used by researchers attempting to identify human remains of two Canadian Army soldiers lost in [[World War I]]. One soldier was identified through DNA analysis in 2007, but due to DNA deterioration, identifying the second using the same techniques failed. In 2011, the second of the soldiers' remains discovered at [[Avion, Pas-de-Calais|Avion]], [[France]] were identified through a combination of 3-D printing software, reconstructive sculpture and use of isotopic analysis of bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2011-06-04/article-2558929/Where-science-meets-art/1|title=Where science meets art|last=Baird|first=Moira|date=June 4, 2011|work=The Telegram|publisher=Transcontinental Media|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quiring03222011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagegamer.net/2011/03/22/3d-printing-technology-helped-identify-canadian-ww1-soldier/|title=3D Printing Technology Helped Identify Canadian WW1 Soldier|last=Quiring|first=Tami|date=March 22, 2011|work=Village Gamer|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Aldergrove, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Functional periodicity''' is a term that emerged around the late 19th century around the belief, later to be found invalid, that women suffered from physical and mental impairment during their [[menstrual cycle]]. Men held a higher status and were regarded as superior to women at this period in time. Many prominent male psychologists promoted the idea of functional periodicity. Women were not seen as being fit for certain types of work, responsibilities, and roles because of this idea.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Stetter-Hollingworth,
L. (1914). Functional periodicity: An experimental study of the mental and
motor abilities of women during menstruation. ''Contributions to Education,'' 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of functional periodicity stems from ancient taboos and rituals that were passed on from generation to generation. It then developed into an actual theory in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Functional periodicity was investigated by a female psychologist named Leta Hollingworth. She made key contributions in the research of functional periodicity, as well as in the feminist movement at the time. Hollingworth, along with her husband Harry Hollingworth, established exceptional research on the idea of functional periodicity and created research studies investigating the science of motor/learning tasks involving the human body.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fancher, R., &amp; Rutherford, A. (2012). ''Pioneers of psychology. ''(4th ed.). New York, NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Her research impacted how society viewed women, despite the patriarchal opinions held by many.

== Background and history ==

Functional periodicity was the idea of women being functionally impaired during their menstruation cycle. The untested hypothesis of the time was supported by men, because at this time they dominated society, and this idea helped to keep women in a subordinate position. Women were viewed as not qualified for certain types of work, achievements, and certain responsibilities. The belief also reinforced the stereotype of women being fragile in physical and emotional well-being.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Multiple studies were performed to look at mental and physical (motor) abilities during menstruation. Many men concluded that women were not fit for certain work and responsibilities. For example, in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, there was debate about whether or not women should participate in higher education. Many argued that women should not go on to pursue higher education because of the dangers that may be involved relating to physiological circumstances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of reasoning using functional periodicity is a quote by [[Henry Maudsley]] in 1874. He further states:

‘"This is a matter of physiology, not a matter of sentiment… not a question of two bodies and minds that are in equal physical condition, but if one body and mind capable of sustained and regular hard labor, and of another body and mind which for one quarter of each month, during the best years of life, is more or less sick and unfit for hard work."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This quote exemplifies the sexist beliefs expressed during this time period. Because of these opinions and beliefs, the idea of functional periodicity became more relevant in American society.

The idea of functional periodicity stems from past cultural superstitions. In the past, menstruation has been thought of as superstitious and taboo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of this line of thought comes from the British Medical Journal, which discusses the question of whether or not a menstruating woman can contaminate or damage food by touching it. Many individuals believed in this superstition and reinforced it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Leta Hollingworth]] was born on the Nebraska frontier in 1886. When she was an adolescent, her mother died, which lead to rough household conditions within the family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Despite the difficulties, she did exceptionally well in school. This drove her to pursue her education further, which resulted in her graduating from University of Nebraska. While studying there, she met Harry Hollingworth and married him soon after.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She began teaching while her husband enrolled in a doctoral program at Columbia University, but because she was married she could no longer teach in the state of New York. At the time, this was against the law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This barrier fueled Hollingworth's feminist activism. When she finally got the opportunity to enroll in the psychology program at Columbia University under [[Edward Thorndike]], she took it. At the end of the program, she decided to study functional periodicity for her dissertation research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hollingworth wanted to investigate the idea of functional periodicity and its assumptions about women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She started by designing two separate studies. The first study that was designed tested men and women on a series of mental and motor tasks while the second study monitored only females over a 30-day period. Her results showed there was no significant difference in physical and emotional tasks when a woman is menstruating and when she is not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The influence of Leta Hollingworth ==

Leta Hollingworth was a clinical psychologist and feminist activist who conducted psychological research on several theories involving women. Some of these theories included the [[variability hypothesis]] and functional periodicity. She was quite instrumental in disproving the theory of functional periodicity, which was widely believed to be true by scientists as well as the general public.

For her dissertation research at Columbia Teacher's College, Hollingworth decided to conduct an investigation on functional periodicity, which she considered to be an unfair assumption about women that lacked any scientific grounds to justify itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hollingworth completed her dissertation under the supervision of the psychologist Edward Thorndike, a major proponent of the variability hypothesis. Though they held conflicting views, Hollingworth thanked him for aiding her. Hollingworth saw it as her duty as a feminist to prove through scientific study that women were equally as capable and intelligent as men in all of their pursuits, even during menstruation. Her dissertation included three studies dealing with functional periodicity among women, two of which were intensive  and one which was extensive. Her studies on functional periodicity helped to expand the view of menstruation and reduce bias towards women.

== Studies examining functional periodicity ==

=== Studies relating to motor deficits ===

Leta Hollingworth decided to use tests that had been used previously by psychologists to complete her study. She decided to use a familiar tapping test and steadiness test to assess motor ability.&lt;ref&gt;Green, C.D. (2000). Functional periodicity. ''Classics in the History of Psychology,'' 1-52.&lt;/ref&gt; She had a total of 8 participants, including 6 women and 2 men. The participants ranged from 23–45 years old.

The tapping test was administered by having each participant tap a brass rod that was connected to a brass plate 400 times with their right hand to record maximal speed. It should be noted that Stanley Hall approved of this apparatus and stated how important it was for measuring muscle control. This is important because G.S. Hall is one of the leading male figures who stated, "Women... can make less accurate and energetic movements, and the mental activities are less brilliant."

After the data was analyzed, the researchers noted that there is no data from this study that suggests that women are experiencing more fatigue, less will power, and diminished energy during their menstrual cycle. Fatigue from the tests occurred similarly for men and women. The first 200 taps were faster compared to the last 200 taps.

The steadiness test was measured by having each participant hold a brass rod 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter at arms length. This rod was in a hole 6&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. While standing they were asked to hold it for 30 seconds and make the least amount of contact with the hole. Each contact was measured by an electric counter. Due to high variability of the averages the data was deemed unreliable. This was proved by the fact that outside or external forces could affect the outcome greatly. Examples of this would be if the participant coughed, took a breath or got startled by a noise.

=== Studies relating to learning deficits ===

Not only did Leta Hollingworth study motor ability, she also sought to study mental ability as well. This was done by using two specific tests, color naming and saying opposites. Color naming was observed by having a card face down laid in front of the participant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each participant was to name the color on the card as quickly as possible. The opposites test used a list of 50 words to test for mental ability as well. The words were presented to the individual in two columns and the words were typed. The participants went through the list as quickly as possible, naming the opposite to each word.

Lastly, she decided to do one more experiment involving 17 females. This study was to observe steadiness, tapping, and the opposites test. In this study, ages ranged from 20 to 40 years old. This extensive experiment was much the same as the intensive experiments involving the 8 participants. They were conducted every 3rd day for 30 days. Two trials were administered at every sitting to help with reliability. The experiment provided results that were very similar to her prior intensive experiment.

'''Georg Ludwig Engelhard Krebs''' (19 July 1792 - 11 May 1844) was a German apothecary and natural history collector who spent his entire career in South Africa.

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Wittingen]], then a part of [[History of Hanover|Hanover]], the son of Johan Krebs and Cecilia Engtlingen, and brother to Sophie Margaretha Dorothea Krebs and Georg Krebs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.com/people/Georg-Ludwig-Engelhard-Krebs/6000000018886121371 Georg Ludwig Engelhard Krebs (1792 - 1844)] (Genealogy)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Soon after qualifying as apothecary, he was recruited to work in South Africa by the firm of ''[[Pallas &amp; Poleman]]'' of Cape Town. Arriving in May 1817, Krebs started collecting, often in the company of [[Karl Heinrich Bergius]] who died at age 28 of pulmonary tuberculosis in January 1818, poverty-stricken and abandoned by his former sponsors and employers. Krebs also got to know and collected in the company of [[Mund and Maire]], [[Joachim Brehm]], [[Ludolf Karl Adelbert von Chamisso|von Chamisso]], [[Pierre Antoine Delalande|Delalande]], and Dr. William Gill, who became a close friend and medical adviser during their stay in the Eastern Cape. 

Krebs asked his brother, Georg, a medical student in Berlin, to find out whether the [[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Berlin's Natural History Museum]] was interested in purchasing natural history specimens. When [[Martin Heinrich Carl Lichtenstein|Martin Lichtenstein]] agreed to this, some large consignments were shipped in 1820 and 1821.
[[Image:Berlin_Naturkundemuseum_2.jpg|thumb|left|Opened in 1810, Berlin's Natural History Museum purchased many specimens collected by Krebs in South Africa.]]
At the end of his four year contract with Pallas &amp; Poleman, Krebs was succeeded by Carl Friedrich Drège, the brother of [[Johann Franz Drège]], leaving him free to sail to [[Algoa Bay]] where he arrived in November 1821. He left immediately for the inland town of [[Uitenhage]] where he was to stay the next three years. Back in Germany, Lichtenstein had obtained permission for Krebs to collect on behalf of the Berlin's Natural History Museum, resulting in the splendid title of "Cape Naturalist to the King of Prussia".&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;Ffolliott and Liversidge, Ludwig Krebs (Cape Town, Balkema, 1971), cited by Marian Baker in [http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol142mb.html "Ludwig Krebs: A naturalist's observations of the Sixth Frontier War (1834-5)"], ''Military History Journal'', Vol 14 No 2 - December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822 Krebs collected at Uitenhage, [[Sundays River]], Galgenbosch, [[Van Stadens River]], Zuurberg and [[Swartkops]], sending four consignments to Lichtenstein, which consisted mainly of birds, mammals and insects, but with some bulbs and succulent plants, assisted and advised by [[James Bowie (botanist)|James Bowie]]. In 1823 he roamed further afield visiting the [[Boesmans River (Eastern Cape)|Bushmans]], [[Kariega River|Kariega ]] and [[Kowie River]]s, sending off his eighth consignment of 3800 insects, some 100 birds and no plants.

In August 1823 he visited the newly established [[Fort Beaufort]], collecting for a few months along the Baviaans River, now called [[Baviaanskloof River]], and eastwards to the [[Great Fish River]], returning to Uitenhage by January 1824. His 9th and 10th consignments were shipped from Cape Town in January 1825.

In 1824 Lichtenstein warned him that his contract for supplying specimens to the Berlin Museum was about to end and that they would only accept 3 further consignments. Krebs sailed to Cape Town in November 1824 to discuss his future with Poleman. Krebs had thought of starting a pharmacy somewhere in the Cape, and wrote to his brother inviting him to join in the enterprise. Early in 1825 he returned to Algoa Bay, making his way once more to the Baviaans River, where he stayed again on the Boschfontein farm belonging to Field Cornet Cornelius van der Nest, a farm which was also periodically visited by [[Clemenz Heinrich Wehdemann|Clemenz Wehdemann]].

In the following summer Krebs explored and collected beyond the [[Winterberg, Eastern Cape|Winterberg]] in the area of present-day [[Queenstown, Eastern Cape|Queenstown]], and soon dispatched his eleventh consignment made up of six cases. By June 1826 he had started a pharmacy in [[Grahamstown]], taking on Leopold Schmidt as a partner, and hoped to persuade his two nephews, Carl and Heinrich Kemper, two trained apothecaries, to also join him. 

In March 1828 his health suffered a blow when, while on a visit to Cape Town, he was stricken by rheumatism, a condition he was to endure for the rest of his life. Consequently he convalesced for six months, staying with Pieter Heinrich Poleman. At about this time his application for citizenship was approved, enabling him to buy a farm called "Doornkroon" on the Baviaans River, and which he later renamed "Lichtenstein" in honour of his patron, Martin Lichtenstein.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; Carl Kemper arrived in Cape Town in January 1829 and joined Krebs at Baviaans River. In November of 1829 Krebs sent through his 12th consignment made up of material collected over several years; included were more than 7000 preserved plant specimens and a barrel with a complete Bushman pickled in brine, some 900 birds and over 7000 insects. These specimens had been collected from Baviaans River, [[Tembuland]], and the Tarka and [[Orange River]]s.

His brother Georg arrived in Cape Town in May 1834 and was granted a medical licence, joining the other members of the family at "Lichtenstein" in July. Much work went into building up the farm after it had been through the [[Xhosa Wars|Sixth Kaffir War]] of 1834/5. Krebs' letters about the war survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marian|last= Baker|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol142mb.html |title=Ludwig Krebs: A naturalist's observations of the Sixth Frontier War (1834-5)|journal=Military History Journal|volume= 14 |issue= 2 |date= December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georg set up a practice in [[Graaff-Reinet]], later becoming District Surgeon. Krebs' partner Leopold Scmidt died in July 1836 and Krebs disposed of all his Grahamstown interests, but continued dispensing from the farm. 

For a long time Ludwig Krebs had been thinking about an expedition north of the Orange and [[Vaal River]]s. Accordingly, accompanied by his nephew Carl Klemper, he left his farm in March 1838 with four wagons. His route was through the present-day [[Aliwal North]], Jammersberg near [[Wepener]], [[Thaba Nchu]], north-east toward [[Clocolan]], Mpharane near [[Ficksburg]], and northwards to the [[Makwassie]] area. He crossed the Sand River near the present [[Senekal]] and followed it westward, and then northwards to the [[Vals River]]. He went west again crossing the Vaal River, probably at Kommando Drift, and then northwards to the Makwassie highlands where he collected for several weeks. His return leg followed a more westerly route, and he arrived at 'Lichtenstein' toward the end of December 1838. Another expedition was planned for Natal, but his chronic rheumatism made this extremely difficult, though there is evidence that Carl Klemper may have visited the region in 1839 or 1840.

He died at "Lichtenstein" farm near [[Bedford, Eastern Cape]], South Africa at the age of 51.

==Legacy==
Ludwig Krebs put together one of the most extensive natural history collections from Africa to reach Europe. Their value was slightly debased by Lichtenstein's breaking up the collections for auctioning and citing their provenance as "Kaffraria", whereas Krebs had provided detailed notes on the localities on his original labels.&lt;ref name="GunnCodd1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gunn|first1=Mary |authorlink1=Mary Gunn|last2=Codd|first2=L. E.

Krebs is commemorated in numerous plant and animal specific names including ''[[Gazania krebsiana]]'' and uniquely in the monotypic ''Glekia krebsiana''&lt;ref&gt;[https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iQu4zfixfFttwGniZiENyg ''Glekia krebsiana'' image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130901161953/https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iQu4zfixfFttwGniZiENyg |date=2013-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to the [[Scrophulariaceae]], the genus formed from his initials by [[Olive Mary Hilliard]], and the species by [[George Bentham]] - this is an alpine species found on the high mountains of [[Lesotho]] and the [[Eastern Cape]]. 'Krebs's fat mouse', ''[[Steatomys krebsii]]'' [[Wilhelm Peters|Peters]], 1852, was also named in his honour.

In [[gravitational wave astronomy]], a '''golden binary''' is a [[binary black hole]] collision event whose inspiral and ringdown phases have been measured accurately enough to provide separate measurements of the initial and final black hole masses.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nakano/&gt;

==Testing general relativity==

Current [[LIGO]]/[[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] protocol relies on its library of several hundred thousand precomputed templates of black hole collisions conceivably detectable in their frequency range.  A putative binary black hole collision signal consists of inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases.  The complete signal is compared with the template library, and event parameters and significance are based on an analysis of such matches.

This allows for self-consistency checks of [[general relativity]].  In order to test certain [[Alternatives to general relativity|competing theories of gravity]], one faces the problem that only general relativity has been studied enough that the complete merger phase is known.  Therefore, only a signal that can be matched separately in the inspiral and ringdown phases can be used to allow or contradict such theories.

==Identified golden binaries==
[[GW150914]] was a golden binary, indeed, this led to additional internal checks done by LIGO.&lt;ref name=Ghosh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt;  [[GW151226]] and LVT151012 were not.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt;

'''Human uses of birds''' have included both economic uses such as food and symbolic uses such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years.

In terms of economic uses, birds have been hunted for food since [[Palaeolithic]] times. They have been captured and bred as [[poultry]] to provide meat and eggs since at least the time of ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with [[cormorant fishing]] and the use of [[greater honeyguide|honeyguides]]. Feathers have long been used for bedding, as well as for [[quill pen]]s and for [[Fletching|fletching arrows]].
Today, many species face [[habitat loss]] and other threats caused by humans; [[bird conservation]] groups work to protect birds and to influence governments to do so.

Birds have appeared in the mythologies and religions of many cultures since ancient [[Sumer]]. For example, the dove was the symbol of the ancient [[Mesopotamian goddess]] [[Inanna]], the [[Canaan]]ite mother goddess [[Asherah]], and the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. [[Athena]], the Greek goddess of wisdom, had a [[little owl]] as her symbol, and, in ancient India, the [[peacock]] represented [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]. Birds have often been seen as symbols, whether bringing bad luck and death, being sacred, or being used in [[heraldry]]. 
In terms of entertainment, [[Bird of prey|raptors]] have been used in [[falconry]], while [[aviculture|cagebirds]] have been kept for their [[bird vocalization|song]]. Other birds have been raised for the traditional sports of [[cockfight]]ing and [[pigeon racing]]. [[Birdwatching]], too, has grown to become a major leisure activity.
Birds feature in a wide variety of art forms, including in [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[poetry]] and [[prose]], [[film]] and [[fashion]]. [[Birds in music|Birds also appear in music]] as well as traditional [[dance]] and [[ballet]]. In certain cases, such as the [[bird-and-flower painting]] of China, birds are central to an artistic genre.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by birds in human culture, so defined.

==Economic uses==

Birds are important economically, providing substantial amounts of food, especially protein, largely but not exclusively from the domestic chicken;&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;&lt;ref name=CIWF/&gt; feathers and down are used for bedding, insulation, and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sheikh |first1=Farhan |title=Poultry feathers-how many ways they can be used for? |url=http://thepoultryguide.com/uses-of-chicken-feathers/ |website=The Poultry Guide |date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As food===

[[File:Egyptian - Vase in the Shape of a Duck - Walters 48421 - Profile.jpg|thumb|left|Ducks were common in [[Ancient Egypt]], as depicted in this 3rd century BC [[faience]] vase.]]

[[Birds]] were among the wild animals hunted for food before the [[Neolithic revolution]] and the development of agriculture. For example, in the [[Epipaleolithic]] of the [[Levant]], between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both [[waterfowl]] and [[bird migration|migratory birds]] were eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cummings |first1=Vicki |last2=Jordan |first2=Peter |last3=Zvelebil |first3=Marek|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology and Anthropology of Hunter-Gatherers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nl2yAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT239 |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-102526-6 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example, waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Robert L. |title=The Lifeways of Hunter-Gatherers: The Foraging Spectrum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDAWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-02487-8 |pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battery hens -Bastos, Sao Paulo, Brazil-31March2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Battery hens: [[poultry]] is a major source of food, the [[chicken]] alone providing 20% of the world's animal protein.&lt;ref name=Poultry/&gt;]]

Birds have been [[domestication|domesticated]] and bred as [[poultry]] for use as food for at least four thousand years. The most important species is the [[chicken]]. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |author1=Adler, Jerry |author2=Lawler, Andrew |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/ |newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Egypt]], poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1998 |author=Manuelian, Peter der |title=Egypt: The World of the Pharaohs |location=Cologne, Germany|publisher=Könemann |isbn=3-89508-913-3 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicken now provides some 20% of the animal protein eaten by the world's human population in the form of meat and [[egg]]s. [[Poultry farming|Chickens are often raised intensively]] in [[battery farm]]s; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds.&lt;ref name=CIWF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/chickens/egg-laying-hens/ |title=About egg laying hens |publisher=Compassion in World Farming |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species including [[ducks]], [[geese]], [[pheasants]], [[guineafowl]] and [[turkeys]] are significant economically around the world.&lt;ref name=Poultry&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Poultry |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/poultry/history-of-poultry/ |publisher=The Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly raised species such as the [[ostrich]] are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in [[cholesterol]]; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shanawany |first1=M.

Birds are hunted in many countries around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as [[mallard]], [[wigeon]], [[shoveler]] and [[teal]] have for centuries been captured by [[waterfowl hunting|wildfowlers]], while pheasants, [[partridges]], [[driven grouse shooting|grouse]], and [[snipe]] are among the terrestrial birds that are [[hunting|hunted]] for sport, generally with guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marchington |first1=John |title=History of Wildfowling |date=1980 |publisher=A &amp; C Black |isbn=978-0-713-62053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of the world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where [[cassowaries]], [[crowned pigeon]]s, [[hornbill]]s and [[megapode]]s are captured for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pangau-Adam |first1=Margaretha |last2=Noske |first2=Richard |editor1-last=Tideman |editor1-first=Sonia |editor2-last=Gosler |editor2-first=Andrew |title=Wildlife Hunting and Bird Trade in Northern Papua (Irian Jaya), Indonesia |work=Aboriginal stories: The riches and colour of Australian birds |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan|pages=74–85 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Whiteside/publication/236596667_Aboriginal_stories_The_riches_and_colour_of_Australian_birds/links/0046352d335d8135ea000000/Aboriginal-stories-The-riches-and-colour-of-Australian-birds.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seabird]]s such as [[Muttonbirding|muttonbirds]], [[penguin]]s and [[auks]] have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the [[great auk]], extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simeone, A.  |author2=Navarro, X. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Human exploitation of seabirds in coastal southern Chile during the mid-Holocene |journal=Rev.

===Assisting hunters and gatherers===
[[File:Greater Honeyguide, Gambia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Some peoples in Africa are guided to the nests of wild bees by the [[greater honeyguide]].]]

The archaeological and historical records suggest interdependence between humans and [[vulture]]s for millions of years. Like other animal species, early [[hominin]]s probably used these birds as beacons signalling the location of meat, in the form of [[Cadaver|carcasses]], in the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morelli |first=F. |last2=Kubicka |first2=A. | last3=Tryjanowski |first3=P. | last4=Nelson |first4=N. |year=2015 |title=The vulture in the sky and the hominin on the land: three million years of human-vulture interaction |journal=Anthrozoos  |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=449–468 |doi=10.1080/08927936.2015.1052279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cormorant fishing]] is a traditional fishing method in which trained [[cormorant]]s are used to catch fish in rivers. Historically, cormorant fishing has taken place in [[Japan]] and [[China]] since about 960 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = C.

[[Aviculture|Cagebirds]] such as [[domestic canary|canaries]], [[budgerigars]], [[cockatoo]]s, [[lovebird]]s, [[quail]]s, [[finch]]es, and [[parrot]]s are popular [[pet]]s, whether for their song, their behaviour, their colourful plumage, or their [[talking bird|ability to mimic speech]].

The nature writers Mark Cocker and [[Richard Mabey]], reviewing people's love of birds, observe that people are touched by feelings for birds in a variety of ways, such as enjoying the [[northern lapwing|lapwing's]] "joyous display",&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cocker |first1=Mark |last2=Mabey |first2=Richard |author2link=Richard Mabey |title=Birds Britannica |titlelink=Birds Britannica |date=2005 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |isbn=0-7011-6907-9 |pages=ix–x, 436–437 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "beauty and mystery" of the [[tawny owl]]'s call on a cold winter's night.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; They argue that people feel the simple companionship of birds, are inspired by them to create art, let them mark the seasons and provide a sense of place, and use them "as symbols of joy and love".&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; A former statesman, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], was able to express his feeling for birds in his 1927 book ''The Charm of Birds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Grey, Edward |authorlink1=Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon |title=The Charm of Birds |date=1927 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such feelings, in turn, have stimulated the intention to conserve birds and their habitats.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; Around the same time as Grey was writing, the first conservation organisations were coming into being, starting in Britain, triggered by the rapid disappearance of familiar species as they were captured for their feathers or for food.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; A substantial folklore rich in symbolism has accrued around birds; it was documented early in the 20th century as something that was already fading from memory. For example, the [[house sparrow]] has been associated with "sex and lechery"&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; since ancient Egypt, where libidinousness was written with the sparrow hieroglyph. In the same vein, in the classical era the sparrow was sacred to the goddess of love, [[Aphrodite]] or [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]]; the sparrow features in an erotic poem by Catullus for the same reason. [[Chaucer]] describes the summoner in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' as being as "lecherous as a sparwe".&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ingersoll |first1=Ernest |title=Birds in Legend, Fable, and Folklore |date=1923 |publisher=Longmans Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong |first1=Edward A. |title=The Folklore of Birds|date=1958 |publisher=Collins ([[New Naturalist]] series)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown how important birds are to individual societies, touching on all aspects of life. In Andean societies such as the [[Moche culture|Moche]] (1–800 AD), [[Nazca people|Nazca]] (100–700 AD) and [[Chimu]] (1150–1450 AD), bright parrot and macaw feathers were traded from the Amazon rainforest to the mountains and the Pacific coast, while guano was collected as a fertiliser, and artists and craftsmen were inspired to create textiles, metal jewellery, and ceramics depicting condors, cormorants, ducks, hummingbirds, owls, vultures, and waders. Their religions, too, endowed birds with symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds of the Andes |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bird/hd_bird.htm |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Audubon society]], reviewing the importance of birds in 2013, obtained statements from many people with differing perspectives. Among them, the society's science director, Gary Langham, noted that what is good for birds is also good for humans. The writer [[David Allen Sibley]] observed that birds bring a little wildness into parks and gardens.&lt;ref name=Audubon/&gt; The writer [[Barbara Kingsolver]] noted that birds are part of life on earth. The actress [[Jane Alexander]] wrote "Birds remind us that there are angels."&lt;ref name=Audubon/&gt; The forensic ornithologist Carla Dove noted that birds are biological indicators of habitat health, climate change, and the coming of spring.&lt;ref name=Audubon&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Do Birds Matter?|url=http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2013/why-do-birds-matter|publisher=Audubon|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Extinct Birds of New Zealand'', Te Papa Press, Wellington {{ISBN|978-0-909010-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Persian mythology, the [[simurgh]] was a gigantic bird, the first to come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was to shake the seeds of all the plants out of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warner |first1=Arthur George |last2=Warner |first2=Edmond |title=The Shahnama of Firdausi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eH7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235 |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-39505-5 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese painting|Chinese art]], [[bird-and-flower painting]] forms one of the three major subjects (the others being landscapes and figures), from the time of the [[Five Dynasties]] in the 10th century. [[Huang Quan (painter)|Huang Quan]] created the naturalistic ''xiesheng'' style for bird paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bird Painting |url=http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-birds.php |website=China Online Museum |accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Birds have long been celebrated in the [[Japanese art|arts of Japan]], including in painting, woodblock printing, cloisonné, ceramics and indeed poetry from the 18th and 19th centuries. Print artists like [[Utamaro]] and [[Hokusai]] made use of Western and Chinese influences to give a sophisticated effect, while [[Hiroshige]] reworked the traditional bird-and-flower genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds in Japanese Art and Poetry |url=http://www.worcesterart.org/exhibitions/past/birds_in_japanese.html |publisher=Worcester Art Museum |accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poetry====

Birds have been celebrated in [[poetry]] since ancient times, when for example the Roman poet [[Catullus]] wrote in one of his most famous works about a girl and her pet [[sparrow]] in ''[[Catullus 2|Passer, deliciae meae puellae]]'', "Sparrow, delight of my girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Phillimore, J.S. |title=Passer: Catull.

Birds featured in medieval poetry, for example forming the characters of the 1177 Persian poem ''[[The Conference of the Birds]]'', where the birds of the world assemble under the wisest bird, the [[hoopoe]], to decide who is to be their king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conference of the Birds |author=Attar, Farid al-Din |authorlink=Farid al-Din Attar |editor1=Darbandi, Afkham |editor2=Davis, Dick |publisher=Penguin Classics |date=1984 |isbn=978-0-14-044434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English romantic poetry, [[John Keats]]'s 1819 "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]" and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s 1820 "[[To a Skylark]]" are popular classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooks |first=Cleanth |last2=Warren |first2=Robert Penn |title=The ''Ode to a Nightingale'' |work=Keats's Odes |editor-first=Jack |editor-last=Stillinger |pages=44–47 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Sandy | first=Mark | title=To a Skylark | encyclopedia=The Literary Encyclopedia | date=2002 | url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=7305 | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird poems by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] include "Sea and Skylark" and "[[The Windhover]]" (on the kestrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopkins |first1=Gerard Manley |title=Poems and Prose |date=1985 |publisher=Penguin Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afjmf6TpHagC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227|isbn=9780140420159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Ted Hughes]]'s 1970 collection of poems about a bird character, "[[Crow (poetry)|Crow]]", is considered one of his most important works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/crow.htm |title=Crow – The Ted Hughes Society Journal |publisher=The Ted Hughes Society |date=2012 |accessdate=22 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702124543/http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/crow.htm |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Billy |title=Bright Wings|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-15084-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, birds have appeared in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available printing techniques. The [[wood engraver]] [[Thomas Bewick]]'s 1797–1804 ''[[A History of British Birds]]'' brought affordable illustrations to the public for the first time, and the book formed in effect the first [[field guide]] to birds,&lt;ref name=Uglow&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/oct/14/art.biography | agency=[[The Guardian]] | title=Small wonders | date=14 October 2006 | accessdate=12 January 2013 | author=Uglow, Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcastle"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st December – The Partridge|url=https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/speccoll/tag/thomas-bewick/|publisher=Newcastle University|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John James Audubon]]'s enormous&lt;ref&gt;The first [[Book size|double elephant folio]] edition was 39.5 inches high by 28.5 inches wide. {{cite web |url=http://minniesland.com/prints/audubon_folio_birds_havell.htm |title=Prints: Audubon's Folio Birds Havell Edition (1827-1838) |publisher=minniesland.com |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 ''[[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'' are among the most admired by art critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smart |first1=Alastair |title=The best birds in art |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10816680/The-best-birds-in-art.html |accessdate=22 April 2016 |agency=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/12/books | work=The Economist | title=Book value | date=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithologist [[John Gould]]'s bird illustrations, in books such as ''A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains'' (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume ''The Birds of Australia'' (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Karen S.|title=John Gould: Bird Illustration in the Age of Darwin|url=https://exhibits.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/show/gould/about/kucollections|publisher=University of Kansas Gould Collections|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds are popular characters in children's books, which are often handsomely illustrated. [[Beatrix Potter]]'s 1908 ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-duck]]'' created an enduringly popular bird heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Judy |year=1996 |origyear=1986 |title=Beatrix Potter: Artist, Storyteller and Countrywoman |publisher=Frederick Warne |isbn=0-7232-4175-9 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors followed with many bird characters in books for children of different ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Gill |title=Gill Lewis's top 10 birds in books |url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/31/top-ten-birds-childrens-books-gill-lewis |work=The Guardian |date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In books for adults, birds may have symbolic or psychological significance. For instance, [[Paul Gallico]]'s 1940 ''[[The Snow Goose: A Story of Dunkirk]]'' was a parable about the regenerative power of friendship in wartime; the goose symbolises both the hero, Rhayader, a wounded artist, and the world wounded by war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/19/winter-reads-snow-goose-paul-gallico |author=Allardice, Lisa |title=Winter reads: The Snow Goose by Paul Gallico |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. H. White]]'s 1951 ''The Goshawk'' describes the author's "monstrous and often cruel battles" to train his bird of prey, while [[Helen Macdonald (writer)|Helen Macdonald]]'s 2014 ''[[H is for Hawk]]'', which references White's book, tells how her obsession with the same species as a falconer helped her through the loss of her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Rachel |title=H is for Hawk review – Helen Macdonald's taming of a goshawk called Mabel reads like a thriller |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/h-is-for-hawk-review-helen-macdonald-taming-goshawk-mabel |work=The Guardian |date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====

[[File:Léon Bakst 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Ballerina in ''[[The Firebird]]'' by [[Léon Bakst]], 1910]]

[[Birds in music|In music]], [[birdsong]] has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Beethoven]] did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, first seen in the work of [[Ottorino Respighi]]; or as [[Beatrice Harrison]] did in 1924 with a [[nightingale]], and [[David Rothenberg]] did in 2000 with a [[laughingthrush]], they can duet with birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Head, Matthew |title=Birdsong and the Origins of Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |volume=122 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1093/jrma/122.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark, Suzannah |year=2001 |title=Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century |journal=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-77191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ledger&gt;{{cite news |last=Reich |first=Ronni |title=NJIT professor finds nothing cuckoo in serenading our feathered friends |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/10/njit_professor_finds_nothing_c.html |accessdate=19 June 2011 |newspaper=Star Ledger |date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two groups of scientists, namely Luis Felipe Baptista and Robin A. Keister in 2005, and Adam Tierney and colleagues in 2011, have argued that [[birdsong]] has a similar structure to music. Baptista and Keister argue that the way birds use variations of [[rhythm]], relationships of [[musical pitch]], and combinations of [[musical note|note]]s is somewhat musical, perhaps because some birds exploit variation in song to avoid monotony, or [[mimicry|mimic]] other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baptista |first1=Luis Felipe |last2=Keister |first2=Robin A. |title=Why Birdsong is Sometimes Like Music |journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |date=2005 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=426–443 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2005.0066 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/185549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tierney argues that the similar motor constraints on human and avian song drive these to have similar song structures, including "arch-shaped and descending melodic contours in musical phrases", long notes at the ends of phrases, and typically small differences in pitch between adjacent notes.&lt;ref name=Tierney&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tierney |first1=Adam T. |last2=Russo |first2=Frank A. |last3=Patel |first3=Aniruddh D. |title=The motor origins of human and avian song structure |journal=PNAS |date=2011 |volume=108 |issue=37 |pages=15510–15515 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1103882108 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/37/15510.full.pdf |pmid=21876156 |pmc=3174665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds feature as central characters in [[dance]] traditions around the world.
For example, [[Goldie's bird of paradise]] is celebrated in Papua New Guinea in a "beautiful"&lt;ref name=LeCroy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LeCroy |first1=Mary |last2=Kulupi |first2=Alfred |last3=Peckover |first3=W.

It is performed on important occasions, carrying "special magic",&lt;ref name=LeCroy/&gt; and the performers are obliged to prepare for a week, avoiding certain foods, and undergoing a prolonged submergence in a cold stream to prepare their minds. The dance is preceded by a "magic chant" to the bird of paradise.&lt;ref name=LeCroy/&gt;
In [[Balinese dance]], the [[Cendrawasih (dance)|cendrawasih]] dance illustrates the [[bird-of-paradise]]'s mating rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Tari Cendrawasih Keelokan Gerak dan Busana |trans-title=Cendrawasih Dance: The Beauty of Costume and Movement |language=Indonesian |work=Pikiran Rakyat  |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/269737 |date=12 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TtXit61n?url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/269737 |archivedate=7 November 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, the [[Ewe people]] of Ghana, who were said to have been guided from Dahomey to Ghana by a bird, incorporate the flapping of the bird's wings in dances such as ''Agbadza'', ''Atsiagbekor'', and ''Gakpa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Welsh-Asante |first=Kariamu |title=African Dance: An Artistic, Historical, and Philosophical Inquiry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnsWhJGkXo8C&amp;pg=PA14 |year=1996 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=978-0-86543-197-3 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ballet]], [[Tchaikovsky]]'s classical 1895 ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1910 ''[[The Firebird]]'' have central bird characters.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Roland John. ''Tchaikovsky's Ballets: Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, Nutcracker''. Oxford University Press 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dramatic arts====
[[File:Alabastron (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ancient Greek]] bird: an [[alabastron]], 600 BC]]

In [[theatre]], [[Aristophanes]]'s 414 BC [[Greek comedy|comedy]] ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ὄρνιθες}} ''Ornithes'') is an acclaimed fantasy with effective mimicry of birds. The play's chorus consists of characters playing many identifiable species, including the [[kingfisher]], [[Streptopelia|turtledove]], and [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrowhawk]]; birds feature as messengers and dancers, and several Athenians are compared to specific birds.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Birds and Other Plays''.

Effects are not all negative; for example, [[wind farm]]s produce [[renewable energy]], helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can [[Bird migration perils|kill many birds]] in collisions.&lt;ref name=RSPBwindfarms/&gt; For example, at the [[Altamont Pass Wind Farm|Altamont Pass]] in California, the [[golden eagle]] has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DRIESSEN: Big Wind tax credit exterminates endangered species |author=Paul Driessen |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/22/big-wind-tax-credit-exterminates-endangered-specie/ |newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |date=22 December 2012 |quote=In an 86-square-mile area blanketed by the Altamont wind facility, no eagles have nested for more than 20 years even though the area is prime habitat, Mr. Wiegand says. Overall, there has been an 80 percent population decline for the golden eagle in Southern California, he notes. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is a [[trade-off]] in the siting of any wind farm.&lt;ref name=RSPBwindfarms&gt;{{cite web |title=Wind Farms |url=https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/our-positions-and-campaigns/positions/windfarms/ |publisher=[[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments and [[conservation biology|conservation]] groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that [[In-situ conservation|preserve]] and [[ecological restoration|restore]] bird habitat, or by establishing [[Ex-situ conservation|captive populations]] for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the [[California condor]] and [[Norfolk parakeet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0030605306000950 | last1=Butchart | first1=S. | last2=Stattersfield | first2=A. | last3=Collar | first3=N. | year=2006 | title=How many bird extinctions have we prevented? | url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/08/butchart_et_al_2006.pdf | journal=Oryx | volume=40 | issue=3| pages=266–279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the [[egret]] from hunting for their plumes, used in fashion, has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar societies in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=[[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more specialised organisation, the [[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]] founded in 1946, works to conserve waterfowl and their [[wetland]] habitats, with projects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our projects |url=https://www.wwt.org.uk/conservation/wwt-projects/ |publisher=[[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]] |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10285">'''Integrated Engineering''' is a multi-disciplinary, design-project-based engineering degree program.

Integrated Engineering is a program created to meet the demand for engineers skilled in various disciplines, combining aspects from traditional engineering studies and liberal arts. The demand arises from the current state of industry, where both the products manufactured and the plants which make the products are progressing towards greater diversity and sophistication. Recent studies had shown concern in both [[Canada]] and in the [[United States]] that engineering graduates were not well-prepared for many of today's multi-disciplinary and project-based workplaces. Several committees have been formed to study this and  have published some material. One Canadian study was done by the [[Canadian Academy of Engineering]] and two of its main conclusions were:

* Engineering faculties should ensure that breadth of learning, beyond the technical aspects of the specialist engineering discipline, is a major thrust in engineering education.
* The engineering curriculum should emphasize problem-solving, design, and the development of the learning skills of their students.

Integrated Engineers acquire background in core disciplines such as: [[materials science|materials]], [[solid mechanics]], [[fluid mechanics]], and [[systems]] involving [[chemical]], [[electro-mechanical]], and [[biology|biological]] components.

==Academia and Accreditation==

===Institutions===
Currently, the following academic institutions are known to offer Integrated Engineering programs:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Canada
*[[University of British Columbia]]
*[[University of Western Ontario]]

UK
*[[University of Bath]]
*[[University of Cardiff]]
*[[University of Liverpool]]
*[[University of Nottingham]]
*[[Anglia Ruskin University]]
*[[University Centre Peterborough]]

United States
*[[Lehigh University]]
*[[Southern Utah University]]
*[[Minnesota State University, Mankato]]

Germany
* [http://www.dhbw.de Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW)]

Estonia
*[[Tallinn University of Technology]]

Korea
*[[Chung-Ang University]]

Trinidad and Tobago
*[[University of Trinidad and Tobago]]

===Canada===
Integrated Engineering originated at the [[University of Western Ontario]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and in 2000 the [[Applied Science]] Faculty of the [[University of British Columbia]] also began a degree program for Integrated Engineering.

In Canada, the program has been fully accredited by the [[Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board]] and engineers are able to obtain a [[Professional Engineer]] (P.Eng) Certificate.

===United Kingdom===
In 1988, the Engineering Council UK, identified the need for routes to qualification for Chartered (Professional) Engineers that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
meet the identified needs of industry,
increase access to engineering education by more students,
provide a balanced curriculum combining the subjects that engineers use most often and directed towards the needs of the majority of engineers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the fundamental definition for Integrated Engineering.

The qualities looked for by industry when recruiting graduates were identified as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
flexibility and broad education,
ability to understand non engineering functions,
ability to solve problems,
knowledge of the principles of engineering and ability to apply them in practical situations,
information skills,
experience of project work, especially cross linked projects,
ability to work as a member of a team,
presentation and communication skills.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Engineering Council UK, 1988, An Integrated Engineering Degree Programme.
Engineering Council UK, 1988, Admissions to Universities - Action to increase the supply of engineers.''

Following open competition for additional funding provided by the UK Department for Technology and Industry, and industrial supporters including British Petroleum, six universities were selected from thirty three applicants.  Four "Pilot Programmes" were launched at Cardiff University, Nottingham Trent University, Portsmouth University and Sheffield Hallam University.

In 1989, The Nottingham Trent University (UK) admitted students to first of the Engineering Council's new Integrated Engineering Degree Programme courses.  The course was accredited, at the CEng and European Engineer level, by the Institutions of Mechanical Engineers, Electrical Engineers and Manufacturing Engineers.

Generic engineering programmes are common.  Integrated Engineering is distinct through emphasizing the development of personal competencies, especially the ability of students to work within groups.  It is design led, and integration of all the subjects of study is a defining characteristic, achieved partly through the medium of project based learning.

Following the successful experience at The Nottingham Trent University, Integrated Engineering programmes were established in 1993, at selected universities in Bulgaria and Hungary, with the aid of European Union funding granted under the Tempus Programme.

In [[University of Liverpool]], the Integrated Engineering Program is accredited by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] and the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]], and can lead to [[Chartered Engineer]] status.

In [[Anglia Ruskin University]], the Integrated Engineering Program is accredited by the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]], and can lead to [[Incorporated Engineer]] status.

===United States===
In the U.S. there are several Integrated engineering education programs.

[[Southern Utah University]] requires its students to pass the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]] (FE) before they graduate; and received ABET accreditation in 2004 that extended retroactively through October 2003. The graduates are also able to obtain a [[Professional Engineer]] (P.E.) license.

[[Minnesota State University, Mankato]] has developed a collaborative Integrated engineering program to provide engineering education at MNSCU Community Colleges in the Northern Higher Education District in former [[Iron Range]] communities. This partnership allows students to stay near home, while earning a bachelor of science in integrated engineering while focusing on local engineering needs of manufacturers and businesses. As part of the program students are also required to sit for the FE examination prior to graduation and are eligible to sit for the P.E. exam license as the program is also ABET accredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cset.mnsu.edu/ie/ |title=Integrated Engineering - Iron Range Engineering|author=Minnesota State|publisher= |access-date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany the [([http://www.dhbw.de Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW)])] introduced a flexible M.Eng. program in 2015, to fit to the industrial demand for generally educated engineers for Integrated Industry, known as Industry 4.0 in Germany. The graduated school program [http://141.31.235.70/integratedengineering/ "Integrated Engineering"] is administered at the [http://www.cas.dhbw.de Center for Advances Studies] in Heilbronn and requires at least two years professional experience as an engineer for admission.

===Korea===
In Korea the Department of Integrative Engineering at [[Chung-Ang University]] aims to develop human resources that will contribute to building a knowledge infrastructure by effectively responding to rapid educational and social changes.

The department will focus on developing fundamental and application technologies by realizing future-oriented converging technologies and, through a global network, on strengthening convergence-related competitiveness at the university and national level. To accomplish the goals, based on imaginative education using an innovative system, the department will develop “integrative engineering” people who are equipped with initiative research abilities.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
The Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.S.c) and Master of Engineering (M.Eng) programs in Utilities Engineering was validated in December 2008 at the University of Trinidad and Tobago. These programs are geared towards the Electrical and Mechanical engineering disciplines that exist within the broad area of Integrated Engineering.

Prior to the introduction of the programs most of the engineers in the utilities sector were specialized in one branch of engineering mainly Electrical or Mechanical. The sector required an engineer who was multi-skilled and versed in both disciplines. The Utilities Engineer therefore performs a wide range of maintenance and operational duties in the following industries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Industry,
Electric Utilities (generation, distribution and efficient utilization),
Transportation Industry,
Processing and Manufacturing Industry,
Water and sanitation industry,
Mining and Smelting Industry,
Renewable and Green Energy Industry.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''InterAmerican Network of Academies of Sciences''' (IANAS) is a regional network made up of National [[Academy of Sciences]] from the nations in the Americas.  It was founded in 2004 as an organization utilizing [[science diplomacy]] to "build [[scientific]] and technological capacities and strengthen relationships among the countries of the Americas as a tool for societal development."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2015/interamerican-network-academies-sciences |title=The InterAmerican Network of Academies of Sciences |work=Science &amp; Diplomacy|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the organization was in part inspired by the [[InterAcademy Panel]] (IAP), to function as a regional network in the manner of the [[Network of African Science Academies]] (previously founded with help from the IAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://twas.org/article/international-academy-networks-create-umbrella-organization |title=International academy networks create umbrella organization |website=TWAS |language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Support also came from the [[Organization of American States]] and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] for the creation of IANAS. The IAP continues to be its principal  source of financial support.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Current co-chairs are [[Juan Asenjo]],  President of the [[Chilean Academy of Science]] and Jeremy McNeil, Foreign Secretary of the [[Royal Society of Canada]].

== Mission ==
The purpose of the network is to  connect  and develop  the scientific community and institutions in each  country, and thus to contribute to [[sustainable development]] and help build research capacity . Its main objectives are:

1. "To help improve national scientific capacities, especially as a tool for societal development. This is to be accomplished by strengthening relationships in science and technology among the countries of the Americas.

2. To assist member Academies in building their internal capacity, by creating a forum for the exchange of information and experience.

3. To promote the creation of new Academies in interested countries of the Americas.

4. To contribute to the scientific decision-making processes in the Americas, "with the goal of promoting prosperity and equity in the hemisphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ianas.org/index.php/ianas-home/about |title=About IANAS |last= |first= |date= |website=www.ianas.org |language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
IANAS organizes its efforts through programs focused on six key issues : Water, Energy, Science Education, Women for Science, Capacity Building, and Food Security.  Each program has a leadership team, and carries out its own activities .    Generally each program collects experts from different countries to prepare  documents for policy makers in the Americas, often in collaboration with organizations such as [[UNESCO]] and the IAP  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ianas.org/books/books_2015/water/urban_water_210315.pdf |title=Urban Water Challenges of the Americas |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |first= |date= |publisher=IANAS and UNESCO |year=2015 |isbn=978-607-8379-12-5 |location= |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Network also  conducts multi-national surveys, for instance to assist in a study investigating the presence of women in national academies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gibney |first=Elizabeth |title=Women under-represented in world's science academies |url=http://www.nature.com/news/women-under-represented-in-world-s-science-academies-1.19465 |journal=Nature |language=en |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19465 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consciousness]] is a loosely defined concept that addresses the human [[awareness]] of both internal and external stimuli. This can refer to spiritual recognition, psychological understanding, medically altered states, or more modern-day concepts of life purpose, satisfaction, and [[self-actualization]].

Most proposals map consciousness in a series of levels, some stages of which are more continuous or complex than others. Movement between stages is often bidirectional depending on internal and external conditions, with each mental ascension precipitating a change in reactivity. In the most basic sense, this alteration might lead to a reduced responsiveness as seen in [[anesthesiology]]; more abstract facets of tiered consciousness describe characteristics of profoundness, [[insight]], [[perception]], or [[understanding]].

First appearing in the historical records of the ancient [[Maya civilization#Writing and literacy|Mayan]] and [[Incan#Communication and medicine|Incan]] civilizations, proposals of multiple levels of consciousness have pervaded spiritual, psychological, medical, and moral speculations in both [[Eastern culture#Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|Western]] cultures. Because of occasional and sometimes substantial overlap between [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], there have recently been attempts to combine perspectives to form new models that integrate components of separate viewpoints.

Which if any of these proposals, models or viewpoints can be verified or falsified is open to question.

==History==

[[File:The Pyramid of Kulkucan (3182000923).jpg|thumb|alt=Pyramid of Kulkucan|Pyramid of Kulkucan (found at the center of the Chichen Itza)]]Although many cultures have incorporated theories of the layered consciousness into their belief structure, particularly for spiritual means before the [[Separation of church and state#Ancient history|separation of church and state]] within any given civilization, the Ancient Mayans were among the first to propose an organized sense of each level, its purpose, and its temporal connection to humankind.

==Mayans==

The pyramid of consciousness has defined [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] thought since the dawn of its civilization around 2000 BCE. Shamans and priests defined consciousness as an awareness of being aware, commonly referred to as a branch of [[metacognition]]. Because consciousness incorporates stimuli from the environment as well as internally, the Mayans believed it to be the most basic form of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calleman|first=Carl Johan|title=Solving the Greatest Mystery of Our Time: the Mayan Calendar|year=2000|publisher=Garev Publishing International|isbn=978-0970755803|pages=1–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This existence, which they referred to as a loose translation of ''[[Cosmos]]'', was made up of nine underworlds, depicted concretely through the nine-storied [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent]] in [[Chichen Itza]], [[Tikal Temple I|the Temple of the Jaguar]] in [[Tikal]], and the [[Temple of the Inscriptions]] in [[Palenque]]. Within these nine underworlds are a specified "day" and "night", symbolizing periods of enlightenment, increased consciousness, and a heightened ability to interact with the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calleman|first=Carl Johan|title=Mayan|authorlink=Carl Johan Calleman|work=Calendar: The Pyramid of Consciousness|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Mayan_Calendar/id/1722|publisher=The Global Oneness Commitment|accessdate=3 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710212121/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Mayan_Calendar/id/1722|archivedate=10 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

[[File:PeterSavichHeartChakra.jpg|thumb|alt=The Seven Chakras|The Seven [[Chakras]] ]]Although historical views of the separation of consciousness into various layers do not exactly mirror modern-day perspectives, many parallels can be gathered from the overarching themes found in [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|Western]] cultures.

===Eastern perspectives===

Many specific similarities have been drawn between Ancient Incan and historical Eastern views of tiered consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillabel|first=Dirk|title=Seven Shamanic Levels of Consciousness|year=2001|publisher=House of the Sun|location=Seattle, WA|pages=1–53|url=http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/sevenlevels.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within most Eastern belief structures is the principle of the Cosmos as a joint entity with human awareness. Many branches stress the importance of AUM, also written [[Om]], as the first sound produced after the world was created. Within [[Christianity]] this concept can be likened to the first words of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] regarding the holiness of the Word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Azariah|first=Jayapaul|title=The Symbol OM (Aum)|url=http://xuxoweb.galeon.com/Aum.html|accessdate=3 March 2011|newspaper=Eubios Ethics Institute Newsletter 4|date=July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical beliefs====

The majority of Eastern perspectives assert that while consciousness originates from the sound of AUM, it has incorporated itself into flesh, which therefore gives humankind the goal of attaining oneness with the universe once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=James H.|title=Zen-brain reflections : reviewing recent developments in meditation and states of consciousness|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262012232|pages=1–586|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZ4fyfH_t9EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Incan tradition, this oneness eliminates the separation of external and internal changes into one general indication of movement from stage to stage, commonly known as the Seven Shamanic Levels of Consciousness.

|-

|-

|}

====Modern-day beliefs====

Like the Seven Shamanic Levels of Consciousness, [[yoga]] meditation practices as well as the teachings of [[Vedanta]] and [[Tantra]] emphasize the importance of [[self-realization]], a concept that has become increasingly popular in Western philosophy after [[Abraham Maslow|Abraham Maslow's]] and [[Carl Rogers|Carl Rogers's]] research in [[Humanistic Psychology]].

=====Advaita Vedanta=====

[[File:Aum by a Korean artist.jpg|thumb|alt=Aum (Om) Mantra|Aum (Om) Mantra]]In particular, the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]] has been a topic of extensive study in both Eastern and Western cultures for its tiered depiction of the steps toward attaining self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|title=The Self in Advaita Vedanta|journal=International Philosophical Quarterly|year=1966|volume=6|pages=5–21|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/collection/show?id=ipq_1966_0006_0001_0003_0004&amp;file_type=pdf&amp;q=the%20self%20in%20advaita%20vedanta|accessdate=3 March 2011|doi=10.5840/ipq19666118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the unidirectional nature of Mayan, Inca, and ancient shamanic perspectives, however, this particular belief structure arranges the attainment of oneness with OM through rows and domains, each of which constitutes a fragment of this vibratory sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Victor|first=P. George|author2=V.V.S. Saibaba |title=Studies in Vedanta: Essays in Honour of Professor S.S. Rama Rao Pappu|journal=Teaching Philosophy|year=2007|volume=30|issue=3|pages=332–335|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/collection/show?id=teachphil_2007_0030_0003_0332_0335&amp;file_type=pdf&amp;q=the%20self%20in%20advaita%20vedanta|accessdate=3 March 2011|doi=10.5840/teachphil200730319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Row !! Level !! Realm !! Description
|-
| 1: "A" || Waking || Conscious || External, active conscious
|-
| 2: "U" || Dreaming || Unconscious || Subtle images and impressions
|-
| 3: "M" || Deep Sleep || Subconscious || Focus on latent or inactive thought patterns
|-
| 4: "AUM" || Absolute || Consciousness || Transcending of all three levels
|}

=====OM Mantra=====

Similarly, the seven levels of consciousness defined by modern-day OM mantras strive to reach Absolute Reality through the same four realms described in the Advaita Vedanta, with three transitional tiers in between each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bharati|first=Swami Jnaneshvara|title=Om Mantra and the Seven Levels of Consciousness|year=2007|publisher=Lulu Enterprises, Inc.|location=Raleigh, NC|pages=1–32|asin=B004JH6982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Between the first ("A") and second ("U") levels is the ''Unmani'', similar to the Western concept of [[hypnagogia]], or the movement from full alertness into [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep#Stages of NREM sleep|stage 1 sleep]]
* Between the second ("U") and third ("M") levels is the ''Aladani'', mirroring ideas of [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]
* Between the third ("M") and fourth ("AUM") levels is the ''Samadhi'', or the attainment of deep absorption

=====The Veda=====

The ancient Indian [[Vedas]] texts have lent a comparable view of unified consciousness, with a key difference in the purpose of human ascension from stage to stage. Instead of oneness with the universe, the Vedic vision of consciousness emphasizes the importance of attaining knowledge and pure intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Satya P.|title=Vedic vision of consciousness and reality|year=2005|publisher=Centre for Studies in Civilizations|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788187586180|pages=1–522|url=http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/satya+singh/vedic+vision+of+consciousness+and+reality/6005949/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ananda Sangha=====

[[File:Sivakempfort.jpg|thumb|alt=Statue of Shiva|Statue of Shiva]]The Ananda Sangha movement has evolved following the teachings of the late yogi and guru [[Paramhansa Yogananda]]. Compared to the multi-dimensional theories of consciousness in shamanic and OM mantra perspectives, this particular ideological faction stresses simplicity rather than detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kriyananda|first=Swami|title=Intuition for Starters: How to Know and Trust Your Inner Guidance|year=2002|publisher=Crystal Clarity Publishers|location=Nevada City, CA|isbn=1-56589-155-4|pages=1–127|url=http://www.crystalclarity.com/product.php?code=BIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Subconscious: relatively dim awareness; repository of remembered experiences and consequent mental impressions
* Conscious: rational awareness; guides daily decisions and can be influenced by others; input from the bodily senses
* Superconscious Awareness: intuition and heightened mental clarity; problem and solution are seen as one entity

===Western perspectives===

Fluctuations in consciousness theories are not particular to Eastern cultures. A surprising degree of overlap can be found within the field of health and social sciences with regard to dulled, standard, and heightened intensities of awareness, both naturally and as a result of injury or disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Izard|first=C.|title=Levels of emotion and levels of consciousness|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=96–98|doi=10.1017/S0140525X07001045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychological views====

Like many [[psychology|psychological]] theories within the particular field of [[psychoanalysis]], one of the most popular theories of consciousness was proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]], who described three facets of the [[psychic apparatus]]: the unconscious ([[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]]) or instinctual facet, the preconscious ([[Ego (Freudian)|ego]]) or rational facet, and the conscious ([[Super-ego|superego]]) or moral facet.

Although not unlike the Vedic vision of consciousness as a form of [[intelligence]], [[Jean Piaget|Jean Piaget's]] [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|theory of cognitive development]] is not commonly considered a form of knowledge awareness but instead as the evolution of the brain's capacity for thought throughout the human lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pons|first=F.|author2=P. Harris |title=Piaget's conception of the development of consciousness: An Examination of two hypotheses|journal=Human Development|year=2001|volume=44|issue=4|pages=220–227|doi=10.1159/000057061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical and pathological views====

Similar to previously mentioned psychological views, medical and pathological perspectives often hypothesize tiered consciousness as a result of disease or disorders. [[Altered level of consciousness|The Altered Levels of Consciousness]] (ALC) theory is one such measure, in which a person's arousability and responsiveness to environmental stimuli are classified by their behavioral response.

=====Glasgow Coma Scale=====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:JoseGoulaoHospital.jpg|thumb|alt=Comatose Patient|Comatose Patient (most extreme level on the Glasgow Coma Scale)]] --&gt;Although many such ALC tests take place in hospital settings, the primary evaluation of patient alertness is the Glasgow Coma Scale, which separates levels of consciousness from standard conscious awareness to a [[coma]]tose state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=L.|title=Assessment of Levels of Consciousness: The Glasgow Coma Scale|journal=University of Nebraska Medical Center, College of Nursing|year=1987|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=120&amp;sid=ef978c44-327b-458d-ab15-a965836e8543%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=1&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=c8h&amp;AN=1993157161|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Conscious''': normal, attentive; oriented to self, place, and mind
* '''Confused''': impaired or slowed thinking; disoriented
* '''Delirious''': disoriented, restless, clear deficit in attention; possible incidence of hallucinations and delusions
* '''Somnolent''': excessive drowsiness; little response to external stimuli
* '''Obtunded''': decreased alertness, slowed motor responses; sleepiness
* '''Stuporous''': conscious but sleep-like state associated with little or no activity; only responsiveness is in reaction to pain
* '''Comatose''': no response to stimuli, cannot be aroused; no gag reflex or pupil response to light

=====Relationship to schizophrenia=====

Recent hypotheses have incorporated these ALC theories into the psychopathological study of [[schizophrenia]], suggesting that each altered level of awareness is connected to a degree of suffering or shock experienced by the patient, arguably traversing the Qliphoth in the process. As the situation increases in seriousness, patients will descend to lower levels of consciousness and consequentially lose the capacity to cry, to smile, or to exhibit a wide range of emotions when reacting to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mates|first=Maureen|title=Altered Levels of Consciousness in Schizophrenia|journal=Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine|year=1992|volume=7|issue=4|pages=216–220|doi= |url=http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1992/pdf/1992-v07n04-p216.pdf|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more physiologically based studies, scientists have found that while the [[reticular formation]] controls alertness, wakefulness, and arousal in the brain, many mental responses to internal and external stimuli are dictated through signals relayed to and from the thalamus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tindall|first=Suzie C.|title="Level of Conscioussness." In H.K. Walker, W.D. Hall, and J.W. Hurst (eds.)

===Modern-day perspectives===

Although many of the previously mentioned theories are still widely held today in various groups, beliefs, and areas of study, a majority of commonly accepted perspectives stem from just the past decade. These hypothesized structures of awareness draw from many historical and early eighteenth- or nineteenth-century theories to form an integrated and overarching generalization of consciousness as a means of determining inner and outer recognition of stimuli.

====Holder's three levels of consciousness====

Derived loosely from his philosophy of the [[Kung fu#Meditation|Kung Fu]] system, Philip Holder offers three levels of consciousness that feature distinct differences in the way in which they are reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holder|first=Philip|title=The Three Levels of Consciousness and Humanity|url=http://www.wingchunonline.com/levels-of-consciousness/|work=Wing Chun Online|publisher=Wing Chun|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| Spontaneous || The mind can react to the progression of life and does not account for future or past events; therefore, the mind develops an optimistic outlook
|-

|-
| Imposed || The mind is short sighted and clashes with the opposition; lack of awareness for surroundings amounts to failure in the long term
|}

====Barrett's seven levels of personal consciousness====

[[File:MasonParanoidPolaroid.jpg|thumb|alt=Self-Concept|[[Self-concept]]]]Similarly, Richard Barrett proposes seven stages of consciousness that progress in a logical order. The progression focuses on “[[existential]]” needs directly connected to and dependent on the human condition, all of which are motivating factors for daily interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Richard|title=The Seven Levels of Personal Consciousness|journal=Business &amp; Economics|year=2006|pages=248–252|url=http://www.valuescentre.com/uploads/2010-07-06/The%207%20Levels%20of%20Personal%20Consciousness-1.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

====Gibson's four states of consciousness====

Dr. Bob Günius Gibson, left-handed author of ''Notes on Personal Integration and Health'' and often recognized as a [[psychic|psychic healer]], hypothesized the existence of four tiers of extrasensory awareness. Beyond being more applicable to internal states rather than reactions to the external environment, these stages contrast markedly with the previously mentioned modern theories through their emphasis on humankind's immediate interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Marsha|title=Levels of Consciousness|url=http://www.marshasummers.com/innerman/tape7.htm|work=Studies of the Inner Being|publisher=Daytona Music|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson does not focus on life progression or individual power to move between levels, but rather on momentary instances of personal experience.

==Attempts to combine theories==

===Leary's 8-Circuit Model of Consciousness===

[[File:Deep Thought (3914353258).jpg|thumb|alt=Deep in Thought|Deep in Thought]]Timothy Leary and Robert Anton Wilson proposed [[8-Circuit Model of Consciousness|the Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness]], a psychologically based theory that unifies various interpretations of main altered states of awareness into a single mega-theory, or a hypothesis' about an already existing hypothesis. In this case, Leary and Wilson state that [[Altered level of consciousness|the altered levels of consciousness]] defined in medical fields are products of eight differing brain structures within the human nervous system.

This concept not only connects psychology and the more medically focused studies of [[neurology]] and biology, but also incorporates elements of sociology, anthropology, physics, chemistry, and advanced mathematical formulas. Furthermore, critics argue that the inspiration for his theory stems at least indirectly from the Hindu [[chakra]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert Anton|title=Cosmic Trigger: Final Secret of the Illuminati|year=2008|publisher=New Falcon Publications|location=Las Vegas, NV|isbn=978-1561840038|pages=1–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

===Morin's integration===

Similar to Dr. Rondell Gibson's view of a simplified hierarchy of conscious states, Alain Morin describes a four-tiered integration of nine past awareness models, focusing explicitly on the two common aspects underlying each belief structure: the perception of the self in time and the complexity of those self-representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=Alain|title=Levels of Consciousness and Self-Awareness: A Comparison and Integration of Various Views.|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=2|pages=358–371|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2005.09.006|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:jzJyTUjZytEJ:www.societyofrobots.com/robottheory/self-awareness_review.pdf+%22levels+of+consciousness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiGSelg-Sv4Tg4jTX0WDTM4JnyzZi4pLoDiriu3uFf6rMRXjvleJ8yXu0YIO_K8enn2Jur6Xg76W0wvDGq3OrmiLKfbjywM-uo0rhIPVZR68ztIGvBbEdAAqOiDJv0_RmbtHRQ3&amp;sig=AHIEtbQunMEYJUoOVZWytul9fD7o73h4lA|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

In summary, Morin concludes that from the many concepts discussed above it is near impossible to settle for only one theory without accepting at least a fraction of another. Although each hypothesis has been debated either in scientific or more spiritually focused literature, he states that consciousness is related most directly to the subjective perception of self-recognition and language, both of which are determined by culture and our external environment as a whole.

=== Bob Monroe ===

[[Robert Monroe|Robert Allan Monroe]] became known for his research into [[Altered state of consciousness|altered consciousness]] and "[[out-of-body experience]]". His book 1985 ''"Far Journeys"''  showed numerous levels of consciousness and infinite expansion of consciousness.

''“The plants exist on levels of consciousness from one through seven. They are on a vibrational rate on the levels one through seven. It is the same pattern.''

''Animals exist on the levels of consciousness from eight through fourteen, and when a person attains, when a consciousness attains level fourteen, it can no longer go any higher unless it is willing to change its form of consciousness.''

''Levels of consciousness from fifteen through twenty-one are what you call human life on this earth.''

''When a person progresses to level of consciousness twenty one, he then has the choice of going higher or staying within the realm of human form, but he cannot go higher unless he is willing to give up human form.”'' &lt;ref&gt;''Far Journeys'' (1985)  {{ISBN|0-385-23182-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.be8.com/group/courseofawakening/forum/topics/the-levels-of-consciousness The Infinite expansion of consciousness &amp; its levels.[[Robert Monroe]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905052149/http://www.be8.com/group/courseofawakening/forum/topics/the-levels-of-consciousness |date=2011-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moore and Gillette===

Some analytical psychological methods have presented methodology to engage in deeper levels of inner expansive transcendence, depth that may lead to a reconciliation process. Propositions such as "active imagination," engaging in a conversation with the "Ego" and "Shadow" for instance. "Invocation," calling upon an archetypal imago to dialogue with, perhaps an image of saint or God, "Admiring Mature Paragon Examples," having conversations with wise old men and women; those who have accessed wisdom, for example, and "Acting 'As If,'" getting into character, acting like the character archetype one wishes to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Douglas|last2=Gillette|first2=Robert|title=King Warrior Magician Lover, Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine|year=1990|publisher=HarperOne|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780062506061|url=https://www.amazon.com/King-Warrior-Magician-Lover-Rediscovering/dp/0062506064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1483">A '''lightweight methodology''' is a [[software development methodology|software development method]] that has only a few rules and practices, or only ones that are easy to follow. In contrast, a complex method with many rules is considered a ''[[heavyweight methodology]].''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremeprogramming.org/light1.html Agile Software Development: A gentle introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of lightweight methodologies include:

* [[Adaptive Software Development]] by [[Jim Highsmith]], described in his 1999 book ''Adaptive Software Development''
* [[Crystal Clear (software development)|Crystal Clear]] family of methodologies with [[Alistair Cockburn]],
* [[Extreme Programming]] (XP), promoted by people such as [[Kent Beck]] and [[Martin Fowler]]
* [[Feature Driven Development]] (FDD) developed (1999) by [[Jeff De Luca]] and [[Peter Coad]]
* [[ICONIX]] process, developed by Doug Rosenberg: An UML Use Case driven approach that purports to provide just enough documentation and structure to the process to allow flexibility, yet produce software that meets user and business requirements

Most of these lightweight processes emphasize the need to deal with change in requirements and change in environment or technology by being flexible and adaptive.

The drainage basin includes parts of five [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]]s ([[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]), territories ([[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]) and four [[United States of America|American]] states ([[Montana]], [[South Dakota]], [[North Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]]). The two principal waterways are the [[La Grande Rivière]], in Québec, and the [[Nelson River]] in Manitoba, each with an average waterflow of over {{cvt|3,000|m³/s}}.

The rivers are presented by coastline, clockwise, starting with the George River in northeastern Quebec, just south of [[Cape Chidley]] and the entrance to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Users of [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] have taken the Latin language to places the [[Rome|Romans]] never went; hence a need arose to make '''Latin names of mountains''' that did not exist when Latin was a living language.

'''Marine biology''' is the scientific study of [[marine life]], organisms in the [[sea]].  Given that in [[biology]] many [[scientific classification|phyla]], families and [[genera]] have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land, marine biology classifies species based on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] rather than on [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

A large proportion of all [[life|life on Earth]] lives in the ocean. The exact size of this ''large proportion'' is unknown, since many ocean species are still to be discovered. The ocean is a complex three-dimensional world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine-conservation.org/media/shining_sea/theme_oceanography.htm Oceanographic and Bathymetric Features] ''Marine Conservation Institute''. Uploaded 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; covering approximately 71% of the Earth's surface. The habitats studied in marine biology include everything from the tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be trapped in [[surface tension]] between the ocean and atmosphere, to the depths of the [[oceanic trench]]es, sometimes 10,000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean. Specific habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[Seagrass|seagrass meadows]], the surrounds of [[seamount]]s and [[thermal vent]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] to huge [[cetaceans]] (whales) {{convert|25-32|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length. [[Marine ecosystem|Marine ecology]] is the study of how marine organisms interact with each other and the environment.

Marine life is a vast resource, providing food, medicine, and raw materials, in addition to helping to support [[recreation]] and [[tourism]] all over the world. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms contribute significantly to the [[oxygen cycle]], and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's [[climate]].&lt;ref name="DMS"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the feedback response| last1=Foley| first1=Jonathan A.| last2=Taylor| first2=Karl E.| last3=Ghan| first3=Steven J.| doi=10.1007/BF00142502| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm3h1q666x206h46| journal=Climatic Change| volume=18| issue=1| year=1991| pages=1| bibcode=1991ClCh...18....1F}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shore]]lines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.&lt;ref name="Sousa"&gt;{{cite book| last=Sousa| first=Wayne P.| editor1-last=Pickett| editor1-first=Steward T.

Many species are economically important to humans, including both finfish and shellfish. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the [[carbon cycle]]) and of air (such as [[Global climate model|Earth's respiration]], and movement of energy through [[ecosystem]]s including the ocean). Large areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively unexplored.

{{main| History of marine biology}}
[[File:Scyliorhinus retifer embryo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle]] recorded that the [[embryo]] of [[Mustelus canis|&lt;!--a different species shown--&gt;a dogfish]] was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the [[yolk sac]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroi, Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The study of marine biology dates back to [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), who made [[Aristotle's biology#Empirical research|many observations of life in the sea]] around [[Lesbos]], laying the foundation for many future discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;"History of the Study of Marine Biology - MarineBio.org". MarineBio Conservation Society. Web. Monday, March 31, 2014. &lt;http://marinebio.org/oceans/history-of-marine-biology.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1768, [[Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin]] (1744–1774) published the ''Historia Fucorum'', the first work dedicated to marine [[algae]] and the first book on marine biology to use the then new [[binomial nomenclature]] of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]. It included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Gmelin S G (1768) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=YUAAAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Historia+Fucorum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jf7RVPC9NoSB8gXviID4BQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historia%20Fucorum%22&amp;f=false ''Historia Fucorum''] Ex typographia Academiae scientiarum, St. Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silva PC, Basson PW and Moe RL (1996) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=vuWEemVY8WEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22Historia+Fucorum%22+binomial+nomenclature&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SfE_cKqtLV&amp;sig=SEiuY0v1D--rDWFi77nh0SSFaz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V__RVJyGGIn98QW06oLwCg&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historia%20Fucorum%22%20binomial%20nomenclature&amp;f=false ''Catalogue of the Benthic Marine Algae of the Indian Ocean''] page 2, University of California Press. {{ISBN|9780520915817}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The British naturalist [[Edward Forbes]] (1815–1854) is generally regarded as the founder of the science of marine biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Marine Biology and Oceanography|url=http://www.meer.org/ebook/mbhist.htm|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pace of oceanographic and marine biology studies quickly accelerated during the course of the 19th century.

[[File:Challenger.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|{{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} during its [[Challenger expedition|pioneer expedition]] of 1872–76}}]]

The observations made in the first studies of marine biology fueled the [[age of discovery]] and exploration that followed. During this time, a vast amount of knowledge was gained about the life that exists in the oceans of the world. Many voyages contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge. Among the most significant were the voyages of {{HMS|Beagle}} where [[Charles Darwin]] came up with his theories of [[evolution]] and on the formation of [[coral reefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Ritchie R. Into the ocean world; the biology of the sea. 1st ed. New York: Knopf; [distributed by Random House], 1974: 161&lt;/ref&gt; Another important expedition was undertaken by [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS ''Challenger'']], where findings were made of unexpectedly high [[species diversity]] among [[fauna]] stimulating much theorizing by population ecologists on how such varieties of life could be maintained in what was thought to be such a hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Gage, John D., and Paul A. Tyler. Deep-sea biology: a natural history of organisms at the deep-sea floor. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991: 1&lt;/ref&gt; This era was important for the history of marine biology but naturalists were still limited in their studies because they lacked technology that would allow them to adequately examine species that lived in deep parts of the oceans.

The creation of marine laboratories was important because it allowed marine biologists to conduct research and process their specimens from expeditions. The oldest marine laboratory in the world, [[Station biologique de Roscoff]], was established in France in 1872. In the United States, the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] dates back to 1903, while the prominent [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] was founded in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Maienschein, Jane. 100 years exploring life, 1888-1988: the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. Boston: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 1989: 189-192&lt;/ref&gt; The development of technology such as sound navigation ranging, scuba diving gear, submersibles and remotely operated vehicles allowed marine biologists to discover and explore life in deep oceans that was once thought to not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Genny|title=Beginnings: History of Marine Science|url=http://marinebio.net/marinescience/01intro/behist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Marine life}}

=== Microscopic life ===
[[File:Copepodkils.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Copepod]]}}]]
{{main article|Marine microorganism}}

As inhabitants of the largest environment on Earth, microbial marine systems drive changes in every global system.  Microbes are responsible for virtually all the [[photosynthesis]] that occurs in the ocean, as well as the cycling of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and other [[nutrients]] and trace elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151210181647.htm |title=Functions of global ocean microbiome key to understanding environmental changes |date=December 10, 2015 |website=www.sciencedaily.com |publisher=University of Georgia |access-date=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microscopic life undersea is incredibly diverse and still poorly understood. For example, the role of [[virus]]es in marine ecosystems is barely being explored even in the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suttle
|first=C.A.|title=Viruses in the Sea|journal=Nature|year=2005|volume=437|issue=9|pages=356–361|doi=10.1038/nature04160|pmid=16163346|bibcode=2005Natur.437..356S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of [[phytoplankton]] is better understood due to their critical position as the most numerous [[primary production|primary producers]] on Earth. Phytoplankton are categorized into [[cyanobacteria]] (also called blue-green algae/bacteria), various types of [[algae]] (red, green, brown, and yellow-green), [[diatom]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[Euglenid|euglenoids]], [[coccolithophorid]]s, [[cryptomonad]]s, [[chrysophyte]]s, [[chlorophyte]]s, [[prasinophyte]]s, and [[silicoflagellate]]s.

[[Zooplankton]] tend to be somewhat larger, and not all are microscopic. Many [[Protozoa]] are zooplankton, including dinoflagellates, [[zooflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]]ns, and [[radiolarian]]s. Some of these (such as dinoflagellates) are also phytoplankton; the distinction between plants and animals often breaks down in very small organisms. Other zooplankton include [[cnidarian]]s, [[Ctenophora (phylum)|ctenophore]]s, [[chaetognatha|chaetognaths]], [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s, [[Tunicate|urochordates]], and [[annelid]]s such as [[polychaete]]s. Many larger animals begin their life as zooplankton before they become large enough to take their familiar forms. Two examples are [[fish larva]]e and sea stars (also called [[starfish]]).

=== Plants and algae ===
Microscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for life, sometimes acting as hiding places for larval forms of larger fish and foraging places for invertebrates.

Algal life is widespread and very diverse under the ocean. Microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute a larger proportion of the world's photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined. Most of the [[ecological niche|niche]] occupied by sub plants on land is actually occupied by macroscopic [[algae]] in the ocean, such as ''[[Sargassum]]'' and [[kelp]], which are commonly known as [[seaweed]]s that create [[kelp forest]]s.

Plants that survive in the sea are often found in shallow waters, such as the [[seagrass]]es (examples of which are eelgrass, ''[[Zostera]]'', and turtle grass, ''Thalassia''). These plants have adapted to the high salinity of the ocean environment. The [[foreshore|intertidal zone]] is also a good place to find plant life in the sea, where [[mangroves]] or [[cordgrass]] or [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|beach grass]] might grow.

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Crown of Thorns-jonhanson.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Crown-of-thorns starfish]]}}]]
{{Main|Marine invertebrates}}

As on land, [[invertebrates]] make up a huge portion of all life in the sea. Invertebrate sea life includes [[Cnidaria]] such as [[jellyfish]] and [[sea anemone]]s; [[Ctenophora (phylum)|Ctenophora]]; [[sea worm]]s including the [[phylum (biology)|phyla]] [[Platyhelminthes]], [[Nemertea]], [[Annelida]], [[Sipuncula]], [[Echiura]], [[Chaetognatha]], and [[Phoronida]]; [[Mollusca]] including [[shellfish]], [[squid]], [[octopus]]; [[Arthropoda]] including [[Chelicerata]] and [[Crustacea]]; [[Porifera]]; [[Bryozoa]]; [[Echinodermata]] including starfish; and [[Urochordata]] including [[sea squirt]]s or [[tunicate]]s. Invertebrates have no backbone. There are over a million species.

==== Reptiles ====
[[File:Chelonia mydas and bubbles.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Green turtle]]}}]]
{{Main|Marine reptile}}

[[Reptile]]s which inhabit or frequent the sea include [[sea turtle]]s, [[sea snake]]s, [[terrapin]]s, the [[marine iguana]], and the [[saltwater crocodile]]. Most [[extant taxon|extant]] marine reptiles, except for some sea snakes, are [[oviparity|oviparous]] and need to return to land to lay their eggs. Thus most species, excepting sea turtles, spend most of their lives on or near land rather than in the ocean. Despite their marine adaptations, most sea snakes prefer shallow waters nearby land, around islands, especially waters that are somewhat sheltered, as well as near estuaries.&lt;ref name="Sti74"&gt;Stidworthy J. 1974.

Accessed 7 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[extinction|extinct]] marine reptiles, such as [[ichthyosaur]]s, evolved to be [[viviparity|viviparous]] and had no requirement to return to land.

==== Birds ====

[[ File:Black-browed albatross.jpg|thumb | left| An albatross hovering over the ocean looking for prey.]] 
Birds adapted to living in the [[marine environment]] are often called [[seabird]]s. Examples include [[albatross]], [[penguin]]s, [[gannet]]s, and [[auk]]s. Although they spend most of their lives in the ocean, species such as [[gull]]s can often be found thousands of miles inland.

==== Mammals ====
[[File:Sea otters holding hands, cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sea otter]]s]]
{{Main| Marine mammal}}

There are five main types of marine mammals, namely [[cetacea]]ns ([[toothed whale]]s and [[baleen whale]]s); [[sirenian]]s such as [[manatee]]s;  [[pinniped]]s including seals and the [[walrus]]; [[sea otter]]s; and the 
[[polar bear]]. All are air-breathing, and while some such as the [[sperm whale]] can dive for prolonged periods, all must return to the surface to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019653| pmid=21625431| title=Current and Future Patterns of Global Marine Mammal Biodiversity| journal=PLoS ONE| volume=6| issue=5| pages=e19653| year=2011| last1=Kaschner | first1=K. | last2=Tittensor | first2=D.

==Marine habitats==
{{ocean habitat topics|image=Callyspongia sp. (Tube sponge).jpg|caption=[[Coral reef]]s provide marine habitats for tube sponges, which in turn become marine habitats for fish}}
{{main|Marine habitats}}

Marine habitats can be divided into [[coastal]] and [[open ocean]] habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from the [[shoreline]] to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided into [[pelagic]] and [[demersal]] habitats. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean and affected by [[ocean current]]s, while demersal habitats are near or on the bottom. Marine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like corals, kelp and sea grasses, are [[ecosystem engineer]]s which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms.

===Intertidal and near shore===
[[File:Tide pools in santa cruz.jpg|thumb|left|Tide pools with sea stars and [[sea anemone]]]]

[[Intertidal zone]]s, the areas that are close to the shore, are constantly being exposed and covered by the ocean's [[tides]]. A huge array of life can be found within this zone. Shore habitats span from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of [[bioerosion]].{{clear left}}

===Estuaries===
[[File:Urdaibai, Bizkaia, Euskal Herria.jpg|thumb|left|Estuaries have shifting flows of sea water and fresh water.]]

[[Estuaries]] are also near shore and influenced by the [[tides]]. An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it and with a free connection to the open sea.&lt;ref name="james"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pritchard |first=D. W. |year=1967 |chapter= What is an estuary: physical viewpoint |pages=3–5 |editor-first=G. H. |editor-last=Lauf |title= Estuaries |series=A.A.A.S. Publ. |volume=83 |location=Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estuaries form a transition zone between freshwater river environments and saltwater maritime environments. They are subject both to marine influences—such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water—and to riverine influences—such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The shifting flows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.&lt;ref name="McLusky"&gt;{{cite book |last=McLusky |first=D. S. |last2=Elliott |first2=M. |year=2004 |title=The Estuarine Ecosystem: Ecology, Threats and Management |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-852508-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

=== Reefs ===
[[File:Maldivesfish2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coral reef]]s form complex marine ecosystems with tremendous [[biodiversity]].]]
{{Main| Coral reef}}

[[Reef]]s comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world. The best-known types of reefs are [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s which exist in most tropical waters; however, reefs can also exist in cold water. Reefs are built up by [[coral]]s and other [[calcium]]-depositing animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create [[artificial reef]]s. Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic [[zooxanthellae]], tropical fish and many other organisms.

Much attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the [[El Niño]] weather phenomenon. In 1998, coral reefs experienced the most severe mass bleaching events on record, when vast expanses of reefs across the world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA (1998) Record-breaking coral bleaching occurred in tropics this year. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], Press release (October 23, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRS (1998) Statement on Global Coral Bleaching in 1997-1998. International Coral Reef Society, October 15, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Some reefs are recovering, but scientists say that between 50% and 70% of the world's coral reefs are now endangered and predict that [[global warming]] could exacerbate this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, D., Burke, L., McManus, J., et al.

IUCN, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

===Open ocean===
[[File:Humpback stellwagen edit.jpg|thumb|left|The open ocean is the area of deep sea beyond the [[continental shelves]]]]
{{Main| Pelagic zone}}

The open ocean is relatively unproductive because of a lack of nutrients, yet because it is so vast, in total it produces the most primary productivity. The open ocean is separated into different zones, and the different zones each have different ecologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marinebio.org/oceans/open-ocean/|title=The Open Ocean - MarineBio.org|website=marinebio.org|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zones which vary according to their depth include the [[epipelagic]], [[mesopelagic]], [[bathypelagic]], [[abyssopelagic]], and [[hadopelagic]] zones. Zones which vary by the amount of light they receive include the [[Photic zone|photic]] and [[aphotic zone]]s. Much of the aphotic zone's energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of [[detritus]].{{clear left}}

=== Deep sea and trenches ===
[[File:Deep sea chimaera.jpg|thumb|A deep-sea chimaera. Its snout is covered with tiny pores capable of detecting animals by perturbations in electric fields.]]

The deepest recorded [[oceanic trench]] measured to date is the [[Mariana Trench]], near the [[Philippines]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at {{convert|10,924|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At such depths, [[water pressure]] is extreme and there is no sunlight, but some life still exists. A white [[flatfish]], a shrimp and a jellyfish were seen by the American crew of the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'' when it dove to the bottom in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml Seven Miles Down: The Story of The Bathyscaph Trieste.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202144233/http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml |date=2007-02-02 }}, ''Rolex Deep Sea Special'', January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the deep sea is considered to start at the [[aphotic zone]], the point where sunlight loses its power of transference through the water.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light known as [[bio-luminescence]]. Marine life also flourishes around [[seamount]]s that rise from the depths, where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed. [[Hydrothermal vent]]s along the [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers act as [[oasis|oases]], as do their opposites, [[cold seeps]]. Such places support unique [[biome]]s and many new [[microbe]]s and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations .{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Subfields ==
The [[marine ecosystem]] is large, and thus there are many sub-fields of marine biology. Most involve studying specializations of particular animal groups, such as [[phycology]], [[invertebrate zoology]] and [[ichthyology]]. Other subfields study the physical effects of continual immersion in [[sea water]] and the ocean in general, adaptation to a salty environment, and the effects of changing various oceanic properties on marine life. A subfield of marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and ocean life, and global warming and environmental issues (such as [[carbon dioxide]] displacement). Recent marine [[biotechnology]] has focused largely on marine [[biomolecule]]s, especially [[protein]]s, that may have uses in medicine or engineering. Marine environments are the home to many exotic biological materials that may inspire [[Bionics|biomimetic material]]s.

=== Related fields ===
Marine biology is a branch of [[biology]]. It is closely linked to [[oceanography]] and may be regarded as a sub-field of [[marine science]]. It also encompasses many ideas from [[ecology]]. [[Fisheries science]] and [[marine conservation]] can be considered partial offshoots of marine biology (as well as [[environmental studies]]). Marine Chemistry, Physical oceanography and Atmospheric sciences are closely related to this field.

==Distribution factors==
An active research topic in marine biology is to discover and map the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]s of various species and where they spend their time. Technologies that aid in this discovery include [[pop-up satellite archival tag]]s, [[acoustic tag]]s, and a variety of other [[data loggers]]. Marine biologists study how the [[ocean current]]s, [[tide]]s and many other oceanic factors affect ocean life forms, including their growth, distribution and well-being. This has only recently become technically feasible with advances in [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and newer underwater visual devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Most ocean life breeds in specific places, nests or not in others, spends time as juveniles in still others, and in maturity in yet others. Scientists know little about where many species spend different parts of their life cycles especially in the infant and juvenile years. For example, it is still largely unknown where juvenile [[sea turtle]]s and some year-1 [[shark]]s travel. Recent advances in underwater tracking devices are illuminating what we know about marine organisms that live at great Ocean depths.&lt;ref&gt;http://us7.campaign-archive2.com/?u=82eb97f4b587306a3537ecf16&amp;id=e398851e6b&amp;e=%5BUNIQID%5D&lt;/ref&gt; The information that [[pop-up satellite archival tag]]s give aids in certain time of the year fishing closures and development of a [[marine protected area]]. This data is important to both scientists and fishermen because they are discovering that by restricting commercial fishing in one small area they can have a large impact in maintaining a healthy fish population in a much larger area.

'''OSIRIS''' ('''O'''ptical '''S'''pectrograph and '''I'''nfra'''R'''ed '''I'''mager '''S'''ystem) is an instrument that measures vertical profiles of spectrally dispersed, limb scattered sunlight from the upper troposphere into the lower mesosphere. OSIRIS is one of two instruments on the [[Odin (satellite)|Odin]] satellite, launched February, 2001 (the other instrument being a sub-mm radiometer) into a sun-synchronous, 6 pm/6 am local time orbit at 600&amp;nbsp;km. This restricts OSIRIS sunlit observations to the Northern hemisphere in May, June, July August and the Southern hemisphere in November, December, January and February. Global coverage from 82°S to 82°N occurs on the months adjoining the equinoxes. OSIRIS measurements began November, 2001 and continue to the present.

==Objectives==
*Stratospheric [[ozone]] science: To elucidate the geographical extent of, and mechanisms responsible for, [[ozone depletion]] in the "[[ozone hole]]" region and to study dilution effects and possible heterogeneous chemistry even outside of the polar regions due to [[sulphate aerosols]].
*Coupling of atmospheric regions: To study some of the mechanisms that provide coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere, e.g., downward transport of [[Nitric oxide|NO]] with its effects on ozone photochemistry and the vertical exchange of minor species such as odd oxygen, [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], and [[Water vapour|H2O]].

==Instrument==

The OSIRIS spectrograph measures from 274&amp;nbsp;nm to 810&amp;nbsp;nm with a single line of sight that is scanned through a range of tangent altitudes. Each scan typically ranges from 7&amp;nbsp;km to 65&amp;nbsp;km and takes 40 seconds to acquire. The measurements are used to produce height profiles of [[ozone|O3]], [[Nitrogen Dioxide|NO2]], and stratospheric [[sulfate aerosols|aerosols]].

The [[Odin (satellite)|Odin]] satellite was operated until June 2007 as a joint mission between astronomy and aeronomy disciplines. 50% of the total observation time was dedicated to each discipline where time was split into 1 day segments. Odin has operated as a purely aeronomy mission since June, 2007, and continues to the present, with almost complete coverage.

OSIRIS is a Canadian instrument, operated by the [[Canadian Space Agency]]. The mission PI is Dr. Doug Degenstein, [[University of Saskatchewan]]. Odin is operated by the [[Swedish Space Corporation]], with funds from the [[European Space Agency]] as a Third Party Mission.

'''Pelagonius''' (4th century AD) was an influential [[Latin]] writer on [[veterinary medicine]], especially on horses. He is one of the many authors whose work was compiled and preserved in the ''[[Hippiatrica]]''. Remains of his texts still exist in Latin and Greek. One of his sources was [[Columella]]. He was used by [[Vegetius]].

There is an edition of his texts in [[Teubner]] (1980), ''De veterinaria medicina'', by K.D. Fischer.

'''''Philosophical Transactions''''', titled '''''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society''''' (often abbreviated as '''''Phil. Trans.''''') from 1776, is a [[scientific journal]] published by the [[Royal Society]]. In its earliest days, it was a private venture of the Royal Society's secretary.&lt;ref name="Scarecrow Press"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kronick |first1=David |title=A History of Scientific and Technical Periodicals: the Origins and Development of the Scientific and Technological Press |date=1962 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=Metuchen, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=publishing&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Royal Society |title=Publishing the Philosophical Transactions: the economic, social and cultural history of a learned journal, 1665–2015 |url=https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophicaltransactions/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became an official society publication in 1752.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt; It was established in 1665,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstl.1665.0001|title=Epistle Dedicatory|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=1|pages=0|year=1665 |last1=Oldenburg|first1=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first journal in the world exclusively devoted to science,&lt;ref name=publishing /&gt; and therefore also the world's longest-running scientific journal.&lt;ref name=publishing /&gt; The use of the word ''philosophical'' in the title refers to [[natural philosophy]], which was the equivalent of what would now be generally called ''science''.

== Current publication ==
In 1887 the journal expanded and divided into two separate publications, one serving the [[physical sciences]] (''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences]]'') and the other focusing on the [[life sciences]] (''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]]''). Both journals now publish themed issues and issues resulting from papers presented at the Discussion Meetings of the [[Royal Society]]. Primary [[research article]]s are published in the sister journals ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]'', ''[[Biology Letters]]'', ''[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]]'', and ''[[Interface Focus]]''.

== Origins and history ==

=== Origins ===
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--several paragraphs without citations--&gt;
[[File:Henry Oldenburg.jpg|thumb|left| [[Henry Oldenburg]], founding editor and publisher]]
The first issue, published in London on 6 March 1665,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=David Banks|title=The use of modality in the early academic article. The Journal des Sçavans and the Philosophical Transactions, 1665‐1700|url=https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/docs/759-2014-09-16-EMEL14-BOOK_OF_ABSTRACTS.pdf|work=UCM|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was edited and published by the Society's first secretary, [[Henry Oldenburg]], four-and-a-half years after the [[Royal Society]] was founded.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/ |title=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London – History |publisher=Royal Society Publishing |accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full title of the journal, as given by Oldenburg, was ''Philosophical Transactions, Giving some Account of the present Undertakings, Studies, and Labours of the Ingenious in many considerable parts of the World''. The society's council minutes dated 1 March 1664 (in the [[Julian calendar]]; equivalent to 11 March 1665 in the modern [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian system]]) ordered that "the Philosophical Transactions, to be composed by Mr Oldenburg, be printed the first Munday of every month, if he have sufficient matter for it, and that that tract be licensed by the Council of this Society, being first revised by some Members of the same". Oldenburg published the journal at his own personal expense and seems to have entered into an agreement with the society's council allowing him to keep any resulting profits. He was to be disappointed, however, since the journal performed poorly from a financial point of view during his lifetime, just about covering the rent on his house in Piccadilly.&lt;ref name=Bluhm&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsnr.1960.0018 |title=Henry Oldenburg, F.R.S. (c. 1615–1677) |journal=[[Notes and Records of the Royal Society]] |volume=15 |pages=183 |year=1960 |last1=Bluhm |first1=R. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oldenburg put out 136 issues of the ''Transactions'' before his death in 1677.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;

The familiar functions of the scientific journal – registration (date stamping and provenance), certification ([[scholarly peer review|peer review]]), dissemination and archiving − were introduced at inception by ''Philosophical Transactions''. The beginnings of these ideas can be traced in a series of letters from Oldenburg to [[Robert Boyle]]:&lt;ref&gt;Royal Society Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

* [24 November 1664] "We must be very careful as well of regist'ring the person and time of any new matter, as the matter itselfe, whereby the honor of the invention will be reliably preserved to all posterity" (registration and archiving)
* [3 December 1664] "...all ingenious men will thereby be incouraged to impact their knowledge and discoverys" (dissemination)
* The council minutes of 1 March 1665 made provisions for the tract to be revised by members of the council of the Royal Society, providing the framework for peer review to eventually develop, becoming fully systematic as a process by the 1830s.

The printed journal replaced much of Oldenburg's letter-writing to correspondents, at least on scientific matters, and as such can be seen as a labour-saving device. Oldenburg also described his journal as "one of these philosophical commonplace books", indicating his intention to produce a collective notebook between scientists.&lt;ref&gt;''Notebooks, Virtuosi and Early-Modern Science'' – Richard Yeo {{clarify|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue 1 contained such articles as: an account of the improvement of optic glasses; the first report on the [[Great Red Spot]] of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]; a prediction on the motion of a recent comet (probably an [[Oort cloud object]]); a review of [[Robert Boyle]]'s ''Experimental History of Cold''; Robert Boyle's own report of a deformed calf; "A report of a peculiar lead-ore from Germany, and the use thereof"; "Of an Hungarian Bolus, of the Same Effect with the Bolus Armenus"; "Of the New American Whale-Fishing about the Bermudas", and "A Narrative Concerning the Success of Pendulum-Watches at Sea for the Longitudes". The final article of the issue concerned "The Character, Lately Published beyond the Seas, of an Eminent Person, not Long Since Dead at Tholouse, Where He Was a Councellor of Parliament". The eminent person in question was [[Pierre de Fermat]], although the issue failed to mention his [[Fermat's Last Theorem|last theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=15 March 2015 |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/1-22.toc |title=Table of Contents |work=Philosophical Transactions |publisher=Royal Society Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldenburg referred to himself as the "compiler" and sometimes "Author" of the ''Transactions'', and always claimed that the journal was entirely his sole enterprise – although with the Society's imprimatur and containing reports on experiments carried out and initially communicated by of many of its Fellows, many readers saw the journal as an official organ of the Society.&lt;ref name="Scarecrow Press"/&gt; It has been argued that Oldenburg benefitted from this ambiguity, retaining both real and perceived independence (giving the publication an air of authenticity) and the prospect of monetary gain, while simultaneously enjoying the credibility afforded by the association. The Society also enjoyed the benefits of ambiguity: it was able to communicate advances in natural philosophy, undertaken largely in its own name, without the worry that it was directly responsible for its content. In the aftermath of the [[Interregnum (1649-60)|Interregnum]], the potential for censorship was very real.  Certainly the tone of the early volumes was set by Oldenburg, who often related things he was told by his contacts, translated letters and manuscripts from other languages, and reviewed books, always being sure to indicate the provenance of his material and even to use this to impress the reader.&lt;ref name=publishing&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Royal Society |title=Publishing the Philosophical Transactions: the economic, social and cultural history of a learned journal, 1665–2015 |url=https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophicaltransactions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By reporting ongoing and often unfinished scientific work that may otherwise have not been reported, the journal had a central function of being a scientific news service. At the time of ''Philosophical Transactions''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' foundation, print was heavily regulated, and there was no such thing as a free press. In fact, the first English newspaper, ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (which was an official organ of government and therefore seen as sanitized), did not appear until after ''Philosophical Transactions'' in the same year.

Oldenburg's compulsive letter writing to foreign correspondents led to him being suspected of being a spy for the Dutch and interned in the [[Tower of London]] in 1667. A rival took the opportunity to publish a pirate issue of ''Philosophical Transactions'', with the pretense of it being Issue 27. Oldenburg repudiated the issue by publishing the real 27 upon his release.

Upon Oldenburg's death, following a brief hiatus, the position of Editor was passed down through successive secretaries of the Society as an unofficial responsibility and at their own expense. [[Robert Hooke]] changed the name of the journal to ''Philosophical Collections''  in 1679 – a name that remained until 1682, when it changed back. The position of editor was sometimes held jointly and included [[William Musgrave]] (Nos 167 to 178) and [[Robert Plot]] (Nos 144 to 178).&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;A. J. Turner, 'Plot, Robert (bap. 1640, d. 1696)', [[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eighteenth century ===
[[File:Hans Sloane by Stephen Slaughter, 1736, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|[[Hans Sloane]] by [[Stephen Slaughter]], 1736]]
By the mid-eighteenth century, the most notable editors, besides Oldenburg, were [[Hans Sloane]], [[James Jurin]] and [[Cromwell Mortimer]].&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Record of the Royal Society |year=1940 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In virtually all cases the journal was edited by the serving secretary of the society (and occasionally by both secretaries working in tandem). These editor-secretaries carried the financial burden of publishing the ''Philosophical Transactions''. By the early 1750s, the ''Philosophical Transactions'' came under attack, most prominently by John Hill, an actor, apothecary, and naturalist. Hill published three works in two years, ridiculing the Royal Society and the ''Philosophical Transactions''. The Society was quick to point out that it was not officially responsible for the journal. Yet, in 1752 the Society took over the ''Philosophical Transactions''. The journal would henceforth be published "for the sole use and benefit of this Society"; it would be financially carried by the members' subscriptions; and it would be edited by the Committee of Papers.&lt;ref name=pt350&gt;{{cite web |title=Philosophical Transactions: 350 years of publishing at the Royal Society (1665–2015) |url=https://royalsociety.org/~/media/publishing350/publishing350-exhibition-catalogue.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the takeover of the journal by the Royal Society, management decisions including negotiating with printers and booksellers, were still the task of one of the Secretaries—but editorial control was exercised through the Committee of Papers. The Committee mostly based its judgements on which papers to publish and which to decline on the 300 to 500-word abstracts of papers read during its weekly meetings. But the members could, if they desired, consult the original paper in full.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt; Once the decision to print had been taken, the paper appeared in the volume for that year. It would feature the author's name, the name of the Fellow who had communicated the paper to the Society, and the date on which it was read. The Royal Society covered paper, [[engraving]] and printing costs.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt; The Society found the journal to be a money-losing proposition: it cost, on average, upwards of £300 annually to produce, of which they seldom recouped more than £150. Because two-fifths of the copies were distributed for free to the journal's natural market, sales were generally slow, and although back issues sold out gradually it would usually be ten years or more before there were fewer than 100 left of any given print run.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;

[[File:First-5-women.JPG|thumb|left|In 1787, [[Caroline Herschel]] became the first woman published in the journal and the only one in the 18th century. Poster at Publishing 350 Exhibit, 2015]]

During the Presidency of [[Joseph Banks]] the work of the Committee of Papers continued fairly efficiently, with the President himself in frequent attendance. There was a number of ways in which the President and Secretaries could bypass or subvert the Royal Society's publishing procedures. Papers could be prevented from reaching the Committee by not allowing them to be read in the first place. Also—though papers were rarely subjected to formal review—there is evidence of editorial intervention, with Banks himself or a trusted deputy proposing cuts or emendations to particular contributions. Publishing in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' carried a high degree of prestige and Banks himself attributed an attempt to unseat him, relatively early in his Presidency, to the envy of authors whose papers had been rejected from the journal.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chambers |first1=Neil |title=The Scientific Correspondence of Joseph Banks |date=2006 |publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
''Transactions'' continued steadily through the turn of the century and into the 1820s. In the late 1820s and early 1830s, a movement to reform the Royal Society rose. The reformers felt that the scientific character of the Society had been undermined by the admission of too many [[amateur|gentleman dilettantes]] under Banks. In proposing a more limited membership, to protect the Society's reputation, they also argued for systematic, expert evaluation of papers for ''Transactions'' by named referees.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Marie |title=All Scientists Now: The Royal Society in the Nineteenth Century |date=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sectional Committees, each with responsibility for a particular group of disciplines, were initially set up in the 1830s to adjudicate the award of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV's]] [[Royal Medal]]s. But individual members of these committees were soon put to work reporting on and evaluating papers submitted to the Royal Society. These evaluations began to be used as the basis of recommendations to the Committee of Papers, who would then rubber-stamp decisions made by the Sectional Committees. Despite its flaws – it was inconsistent in its application and not free of abuses – this system remained at the heart of the Society's procedures for publishing until 1847, when the Sectional Committees were dissolved. However, the practice of sending most papers out for review remained.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

During the 1850s, the cost of the ''Transactions'' to the Society was increasing again (and would keep doing so for the rest of the century); illustrations were always the largest outgoing. Illustrations had been a natural and essential aspect of the [[scientific periodical]] since the later seventeenth century. Engravings (cut into metal plates) were used for detailed illustrations, particularly where realism was required; while wood-cuts (and, from the early nineteenth century, wood-engravings) were used for diagrams, as they could be easily combined with letterpress.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;

By the mid-1850s, the ''Philosophical Transactions'' was seen as a drain on the Society's finances and the treasurer, [[Edward Sabine]], urged the Committee of Papers to restrict the length and number of papers published in the journal. In 1852, for example, the amount expended on the ''Transactions'' was £1094, but only £276 of this was offset by sales income. Sabine felt this was more than the Society could comfortably sustain. The print run of the journal was 1000 copies. Around 500 of these went to the fellowship, in return for their membership dues, and since authors now received up to 150 off-prints for free, to circulate through their personal networks, the demand for the ''Transactions'' through the book trade must have been limited. The concerns with cost eventually led to a change in printer in 1877 from [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] to [[Harrison &amp; Sons]] – the latter was a larger commercial printer, able to offer the Society a more financially viable contract, although it was less experienced in printing scientific works.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;
[[File:Ggstokes.jpg|thumb|left|Sir [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]]]]

While expenditure was a worry for the Treasurer, as Secretary (from 1854), [[George Gabriel Stokes]] was preoccupied with the actual content of the ''Transactions'' and his extensive correspondence with authors over his thirty-one-years as Secretary took up most of his time beyond his duties as [[Lucasian Professor]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Stokes was paramount in establishing a more formalized refereeing process at the Royal Society.  It was not until Stokes's [[Royal Society#President|Presidency]] ended, in 1890, that his influence over the journal diminished. The introduction of fixed terms for Society officers precluded subsequent editors from taking on Stokes's mantle, and meant that the Society operated its editorial practices more collectively than it had done since the mechanisms for it were established in 1752.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

By the mid-nineteenth century, the procedure of getting a paper published in the ''Transactions'' still relied on the reading of papers by a Fellow. Many papers were sent immediately for printing in abstract form in ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]''. But those which were being considered for printing in full in ''Transactions'' were usually sent to two referees for comment before the final decision was made by the Committee of Papers. During Stokes's time, authors were given the opportunity to discuss their paper at length with him before, during and after its official submission to the Committee of Papers.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;

In 1887, the ''Transactions'' split into series "A" and "B", dealing with the physical and biological sciences respectively. In 1897, the model of collective responsibility for the editing of the ''Transactions'' was emphasized by the re-establishment of the Sectional Committees. The six sectional committees covered [[mathematics]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[physiology]], geology, and (together) [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], and were composed of Fellows of the Society with relevant expertise. The Sectional Committees took on the task of managing the refereeing process after papers had been read before the Society. Referees were usually Fellows, except in a small number of cases where the topic was beyond the knowledge of the fellowship (or at least, of those willing to referee). The Sectional Committees communicated referee reports to authors; and sent reports to the Committee of Papers for final sanction. The Sectional Committees were intended to reduce the burden on the Secretaries and Council. Consequently, the Secretary in the 1890s, [[Arthur William Rucker|Arthur Rucker]], no longer coordinated the refereeing of papers, nor did he generally correspond extensively with authors about their papers as Stokes had done. However, he continued to be the first port of call for authors submitting papers.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;

=== Twentieth century ===
Authors were increasingly expected to submit manuscripts in a standardized format and style. From 1896, they were encouraged to submit typed papers on [[Foolscap folio|foolscap-folio-sized]] paper to lighten the work of getting papers ready for printing, and to reduce the chance of error in the process. A publishable paper now had to present its information in an appropriate manner, as well as being of remarkable scientific interest. For a brief period between 1907 and 1914, authors were under even more pressure to conform to the society's expectations, due to a decision to discuss cost estimates of candidate papers alongside referees' reports. The committees could require authors to reduce the number of illustrations or tables or, indeed, the overall length of the paper, as a condition of acceptance. It was hoped that this policy would reduce the still-rising costs of production, which had reached £1747 in 1906; but the effect appears to have been negligible, and the cost estimates ceased to be routine practice after 1914.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;

It was only after the [[Second World War]] that the Society's concerns about the cost of its journals were finally allayed. There had been a one-off surplus in 1932, but it was only from 1948 that the ''Transactions'' began regularly to end the year in surplus. That year, despite a three-fold increase in production costs (it was a bumper year for papers), there was a surplus of almost £400. Part of the post-war financial success of the ''Transactions'' was due to the rising subscriptions received, and a growing number of subscriptions from British and international institutions, including universities, industry, and government; this was at the same time as private subscriptions, outside of fellows, were non-existent. By the early 1970s, institutional subscription was the main channel of income from publication sales for the society. In 1970–1971, 43,760 copies of ''Transactions'' were sold, of which casual purchasers accounted for only 2070 copies.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;

All of the Society's publications now had a substantial international circulation; in 1973, for example, just 11% of institutional subscriptions were from the United Kingdom; 50% were from the United States. Contributions, however, were still mostly from British authors: 69% of Royal Society authors were from the United Kingdom in 1974. A Publications Policy Committee suggested that more overseas scientists could be encouraged to submit papers if the requirement to have papers communicated by Fellows was dropped. This did not happen until 1990. There was also a suggestion to create a "C" journal for molecular sciences to attract more authors in that area, but the idea never materialized. The conclusion in 1973 was a general appeal to encourage more British scientists (whether Fellows or not) to publish papers with the Society and to pass on the message to their overseas colleagues; by the early 2000s, the proportion of non-UK authors had risen to around a half; and by 2017 it had passed 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.royalsociety.org/publishing/2017-the-year-in-review/|title=Publishing 2017 – The Year in Review|website=The Royal Society |access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the twentieth century came to a close, the editing of the ''Transactions'' and the Society's other journals became more professional with the employment of a growing in-house staff of editors, designers and marketers. In 1968 there were about eleven staff in the Publishing Section; by 1990, the number had risen to twenty-two. The editorial processes were also transformed. In 1968 the Sectional Committees had been abolished (again). Instead, the secretaries, [[Harrie Massey]] (physicist) and [[Bernard Katz]] (physiologist), were each assigned a group of Fellows to act as Associate Editors for each series ("A" and "B") of the ''Transactions''. The role of the Committee of Papers was abolished in 1989 and since 1990 two Fellows (rather than the Secretaries) have acted as the Editors with assistance from [[associate editor]]s. The editors serve on the Publishing Board, established in 1997 to monitor publishing and report to the Council. In the 1990s, as these changes to the publishing and editorial teams were implemented, the Publishing Section acquired its first computer for administration; the ''Transactions'' were first published online in 1997.&lt;ref name=pt350 /&gt;

== Famous and notable contributors ==
Over the centuries, many important scientific discoveries have been published in the ''Philosophical Transactions''. Famous contributing authors include:

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| [[Isaac Newton]] || His first paper ''New Theory about Light and Colours'',&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newton | first1 = I. | title = A Letter of Mr. Isaac Newton, Professor of the Mathematicks in the University of Cambridge; Containing His New Theory about Light and Colors: Sent by the Author to the Publisher from Cambridge, Febr. 6. 1671/72; in Order to be Communicated to the R. Society | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1671.0072 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 6 | issue = 69–80 | pages = 3075–3087 | year = 1671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1672) can be seen as the beginning of his public scientific career.
|-
| [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] || Leeuwenhoek's 1677 paper, the famous ‘letter on the protozoa’, gives the first detailed description of protists and bacteria living in a range of environments, sent by the author in a Dutch letter of the 9 Octob. 1676 concerning little animals by him observed in rain-well-sea and snow water; as also in water wherein pepper had lain infused. &lt;ref name=Leeuwenhoek&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1677.0003| title = Observation, communicated to the publisher by Mr. Antony van Leewenhoeck, in a Dutch letter of the 9 Octob. 1676 here English'd: concerning little animals by him observed in rain-well-sea and snow water; as also in water wherein pepper had lain infused. In a Letter from Mr. Anton van Leeuwenhoek |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London| volume = 12| pages = 821-831| year = 1677| last1 = Leeuwenhoek | first1 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Benjamin Franklin]] || The American statesman was the sole or co-author of 19 papers in ''Philosophical Transactions'', including an experiment on the calming effects of oil on water (of great significance to current scientific fields including surface chemistry and physics, and self-assembly) carried out on Clapham Common pond. But it was his ''"Philadelphia Experiment"'', ''A Letter of Benjamin Franklin, Esq; to Mr. Peter Collinson, F. R. S. concerning an Electrical Kite'' – recognized as one of the most famous scientific experiments of all time – and published in ''Phil. Trans'' in 1753, that secured his reputation. He later founded the [[American Philosophical Society]] in [[Philadelphia]], closely modelled on the Royal Society.
|-
| [[William Roy]] || Between 1747 and 1755, William Roy organised and carried out an innovative Military Survey of Scotland. He then gained military rank, and throughout his career promoted extending this to a survey triangulation of the whole of Britain. In the 1780s Major General William Roy measured the distance between the Greenwich and Paris observatories, promoting a method of triangulation and instruments designed and built by [[Jesse Ramsden]].&lt;ref name="NLS Roy"&gt;{{cite web | title=Roy Military Survey of Scotland, 1747-1755 | website=National Library of Scotland | url=http://maps.nls.uk/roy/background.html | access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work led to much more accurate records of longitudes for both the British and French – remarkable during a century of near-constant warfare between the two nations. The work was written up in three papers in ''Philosophical Transactions'', culminating in a 1790 publication, ''An Account of the Trigonometrical Operation, Whereby the Distance between the Meridians of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris Has Been Determined'' (with [[Isaac Dalby]]). While, like most English maps at the time, the prime meridian is centred on St Paul's cathedral (a system the vestiges of which can be found in the naming of the British road network), Roy's figure showing the triangulation of major distances between England and France takes Greenwich as the prime meridian. While this had been suggested before, notably by [[Edmund Halley]] in 1710, this was one of the first major works to take Greenwich as prime meridian, anticipating its status as the universal prime meridian. Roy's work in ''Philosophical Transactions'' led to the [[Ordnance Survey of Great Britain]].
|-
| [[Caroline Herschel]] || The first paper by a woman in the journal, ''An account of a new comet'' appeared in 1787.&lt;ref name=Herschel&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1787.0001| title = An Account of a New Comet. In a Letter from Miss Caroline Herschel to Charles Blagden, M. D. Sec. R. S. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London| volume = 77| pages = 1| year = 1787| last1 = Herschel | first1 = C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline Herschel was paid a salary of £50 per annum by the King to work with her brother [[William Herschel]] as an astronomer – unusual at a time when most who worked in astronomy or science did so without pay, regardless of gender
|-
| [[Mary Somerville]] || ''On the Magnetizing Power of the More Refrangible Solar Rays''&lt;ref name=Somerville&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rstl.1826.0014|title=On the Magnetizing Power of the More Refrangible Solar Rays|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=116|pages=132|year=1826|last1=Somerville|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of two papers submitted to ''Philosophical Transactions'' by the Scottish polymath, translator of [[Laplace]] and friend of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. In it, she communicates her finding that the ultraviolet components of the electromagnetic spectrum could magnetize a steel needle. While subsequent experiments were not able to reproduce this finding, leading Somerville to retract her claim (exactly in accordance with what would be expected of a scientist today), her reputation was secured. In some ways, her hypothesis remarkably prescient: the [[photoelectric effect]] is more likely to occur when metals are irradiated by light at the violet end of the spectrum.
|-
| [[Charles Darwin]] || Darwin's only paper in ''Philosophical Transactions'', the snappily titled ''Observations on the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, and of Other Parts of Lochaber in Scotland, with an Attempt to Prove That They Are of Marine Origin''&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1839.0005| title = Observations on the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, and of Other Parts of Lochaber in Scotland, with an Attempt to Prove That They Are of Marine Origin |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London| volume = 129| pages = 39| year = 1839| last1 = Darwin | first1 = C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1837) describes parallel lines cut horizontally across the hillsides of [[Glen Roy]], and proposes that they had marine origins as had similar features he had seen at [[Coquimbo]] in Chile while on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' expedition]]. In 1840 the lines were explained by French geologist [[Louis Agassiz]] as due to a lake formed in an ice age, and after many years of argument, Darwin conceded in 1862 that his own paper was "one long gigantic blunder".
|-
| [[Michael Faraday]] || Publishing over 40 papers in the journal, Faraday rose from a fairly humble background to become a world-famous and highly respected scientist. His final paper in the journal, which was given as the [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1857, ''Experimental Relations of Gold (and Other Metals) to Light'',&lt;ref name=Faraday&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1857.0011| title = The Bakerian Lecture: Experimental Relations of Gold (and Other Metals) to Light |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London| volume = 147| pages = 145| year = 1857| last1 = Faraday | first1 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the idea of metal particles that were smaller than the wavelength of light – colloidal sols or what would now be called nanoparticles.
|-
| [[James Clerk Maxwell]] || In ''On the Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field''&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1865.0008| title = A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London| volume = 155| pages = 459| year = 1865| last1 = Maxwell | first1 = J. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1865) Maxwell described how electricity and magnetism could travel as a wave and inferred from the velocity given by the wave equation, and by known experimental determinations of the speed of light, that light was an electromagnetic wave.
|-
| [[Kathleen Lonsdale]] || Lonsdale's work carried out at the [[Royal Institution]] led to 17 papers in Royal Society journals, two of which were in ''Philosophical Transactions'' Like many notable figures in the 'new sciences' of structural and cell biology, and also the new physics (which included luminaries such as [[Paul Dirac]]), she published the bulk of her work in the more regular [[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]. Her 1947 paper, ''Divergent-Beam X-Ray Photography of Crystals'',&lt;ref name=Lonsdale&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsta.1947.0002|title=Divergent-Beam X-Ray Photography of Crystals|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=240|issue=817|pages=219|year=1947|last1=Lonsdale|first1=K.|bibcode=1947RSPTA.240..219L}}&lt;/ref&gt; built on earlier work to show how this nuanced technique could reveal information about the purity and degree of 'perfection' of a crystal.
|-
| [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] || Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin's record of publishing in Royal Society journals spanned 50 years, beginning in 1938. Out of 20 papers, only two were published in ''Philosophical Transactions'', the first in 1940, when she was still called Dorothy Crowfoot and was working with [[JD Bernal]]. The second, in 1988, was her final publication in a Royal Society journal. Hodgkin used advanced techniques to crystallize proteins, allowing their structures to be elucidated by X-ray crystallography, including Vitamin B-12&lt;ref name=Hodgkin1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1957.0174|title=The Structure of Vitamin BFormula I. An Outline of the Crystallographic Investigation of Vitamin BFormula|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=242|issue=1229|pages=228|year=1957|last1=Hodgkin|first1=D.

C.| bibcode = 1974RSPSA.338..251H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Alan Turing]] || Turing's 1952 paper, ''On the Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis'',&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turing | first1 = A. M. | authorlink = Alan Turing| title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 237 | issue = 641 | pages = 37–64 | year = 1952 | bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a chemical and physical basis for many of the patterns and forms found in nature, a year before the structure of DNA was reported by Watson and Crick. They published their initial findings in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and subsequently published an expanded version in ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]''. In the paper, Turing coins the term ''[[morphogen]]'', which is now used in the sciences of developmental biology and epigenetics, to denote a chemical species that modulates the growth of a species.
|-
| [[Stephen Hawking]] || A 1983 paper ''The Cosmological Constant''&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0092|title=The Cosmological Constant [and Discussion]|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=310|issue=1512|pages=303|year=1983|last1=Hawking|first1=S. W.|bibcode=1983RSPTA.310..303H}}&lt;/ref&gt; was actually Hawking's seventh in a Royal Society journal, but his first in ''Philosophical Transactions'' (all the others appeared in ''Proceedings''). The paper was first presented at a themed meeting at the Royal Society, providing a model for the journal's content that continues to this day (unlike Proceedings, which publishes new research on any scientific subject, divided along the physical and life sciences, ''Philosophical Transactions'' is now always themed and roughly half of the time taken from open 'discussion' meetings at the Society's headquarters in London, which are free to attend). The meeting in this instance also featured papers given by future Astronomer Royal and President of the Royal Society, [[Martin Rees]], then-recent Nobel Laureate [[Steven Weinberg]], future winners of Royal Society premier medals [[Chris Llewellyn Smith]] and [[John Ellis (physicist)|John Ellis]], and [[Michael Faraday Prize]] winner and popular science author [[John D Barrow]].

== Public domain and access ==
In July 2011 programmer Greg Maxwell released through ''[[The Pirate Bay]]'' the nearly 19 thousand articles that had been published before 1923 and were therefore in the [[public domain in the United States]], to support [[Aaron Swartz]] in his [[United States v. Swartz|case]]. The articles had been digitized for the Royal Society by [[JSTOR]] for a cost of less than US$100,000 and public access to them was restricted through a paywall.&lt;ref name="VanNoordenOct2001"&gt;Van Noorden, Richard [http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/10/royal_society_frees_up_journal_1.html ''Royal Society frees up journal archive''], 26 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MurphyJuly2011"&gt;Murphy, y Samantha [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/424780/guerilla-activist-releases-18000-scientific-papers/ ''Guerilla Activist' Releases 18,000 Scientific Papers''], 22 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, users uploaded over 18,500 articles to the [[Lists of Internet Archive's collections|collections]] of the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/philosophicaltransactions&lt;/ref&gt; The collection received 50 thousands views per month by November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/philosophicaltransactions&amp;tab=about|title=About page, "philosophicaltransactions"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October of the same year, the Royal Society released for free the full text all its articles prior to 1941, but denied that this decision had been influenced by Maxwell's actions.&lt;ref name="VanNoordenOct2001" /&gt;

In 2017, the Royal Society launched a completely re-digitised version of the complete journal archive back to 1665 in high resolution and with enhanced metadata.

==Description==
Females reach {{convert|38|mm|abbr=on}} in total length. They are slender with fairly small head and large protruding, gold-coloured eyes. Fingers and toes are long and slender, with the toes being about one-third webbed. Eyes have two symmetrical rounded structures on the centre of the upper and lower border of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The skin is smooth. Colouration is bright yellowish-brown on the upper surfaces of the head, body and legs. There are irregular dark spots across the back, and wavy dark reticulated lines on the sides of the body and backs of the thighs. There is a characteristic yellowish stripe that runs centrally down the top of the head and half of the back. The belly is purplish-yellow with dark grey reticulated spots. The lower surface of the thighs is purplish-rose and bears faint grey reticulated spots.&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt;

==Habitat and conservation==
''Pleurodema somuncurense'' is a fully aquatic frog that inhabits geothermal springs and streams. It is threatened by predation by introduced [[rainbow trout]] and by [[habitat loss]] from canalization of spring water. Also livestock farming has negative impacts through overgrazing and chemical pollution.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt;

{{NSA surveillance|1}}
'''Project Genoa''' was a software project commissioned by the [[United States]]' [[DARPA]] which was designed to analyze large amounts of data and metadata to help human analysts counter [[terrorism]].

==Program Synopsis==
Genoa's primary function was [[intelligence analysis]] in order to assist human analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| author = Dan Verton | title = Genoa II: Man and Machine Thinking as One| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=N1zRvHre4noC&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| magazine = [[Computerworld]]| publisher = IDG Enterprise| date = 1 September 2003| access-date= 3 June 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was designed to support both top-down and bottom-up approaches; a policy maker could hypothesize a possible attack and use Genoa to look for supporting evidence of such a plot, or it would compile pieces of intelligence into a diagram and suggest possible outcomes. Human analysts would then be able to modify the diagram to test various cases.&lt;ref name= harris/&gt;

Companies such as Integral Visuals, [[Saffron Technology]], and Syntek Technologies were involved in Genoa's development. It cost a total of $42 million to complete the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| last = Berinato| first  = Scott| date = August 2004| title = The Short Life, Public Execution and (Secret) Resurrection of Total Information Awareness | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AmAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=| magazine = CSO| publisher = CXO Media Inc.| ISSN = 1540-904X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Genoa was conceived in late 1995 by retired Rear Admiral [[John Poindexter]], a chief player in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. At the time, Poindexter was working at Syntek, a company often contracted to do work for the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name= harris&gt;{{cite book| last = Harris| first = Shane| title = The Watchers: The Rise of America's Surveillance State| publisher = Penguin| edition = reprint| date = 18 February 2010| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kGEMwv0VHL4C&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781101195741}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a computer system that would help humans [[Data analysis|crunch large amounts of data]] in order to more effectively predict potential national security threats. Poindexter brought his ideas to former colleagues working with the [[United States National Security Council]].

That year, a team of researchers was assembled for the project and began studying various historical events to which Genoa could be applied. The [[Tokyo subway sarin attack]] in March was the primary focus.

In order to pitch their ideas, the researchers set up a mock crisis command center in [[DARPA]]'s main building, full of monitors staffed by actors. An audience would watch as a fictitious scenario would unfold before them, guided along by an animated video segment. Poindexter called the presentation "A Day in the Life of an Analyst."&lt;ref name= harris/&gt; Another mock center was set up near the DARPA building with the help of a [[Hollywood]] set designer to serve the same purpose.

'''Semiclassical [[physics]]''', or simply '''semiclassical''' refers to a theory in which one part of a system is described [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanically]] whereas the other is treated [[classical mechanics|classically]]. For example, external [[field (physics)|field]]s will be constant, or when changing will be classically described. In general, it incorporates a development in [[exponent|power]]s of [[Planck's constant]], resulting in the classical physics of power 0, and the first nontrivial approximation to the power of (−1). In this case, there is a clear link between the quantum-mechanical system and the associated semi-classical and classical approximations, as it is similar in appearance to the transition from [[physical optics]] to [[geometric optics]].

==Instances==

Four examples of a semiclassical approximation include:

* [[WKB approximation]]: electrons in classical external [[electromagnetic field]]s.
* [[semiclassical gravity]]: [[quantum field theory]] within a classical [[curved space|curved]] [[gravity|gravitational]] background (see [[general relativity]]).
* [[quantum chaos]]; quantization of classical [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] systems.
* [[quantum field theory]], only [[Feynman diagram]]s with at most a single closed loop (see for example [[one-loop Feynman diagram]]) are considered, which corresponds to the powers of Planck's constant.

The '''sociology of scientific knowledge''' ('''SSK''') is the study of [[science]] as a social activity, especially dealing with "the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity."&lt;ref name=socofsci-bendavid&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the [[sociology of knowledge]] studies the impact of human [[knowledge]] and the prevailing ideas on societies and relations between knowledge and the social context within which it arises.

[[Sociologist]]s of scientific knowledge study the development of a [[scientific field]] and attempt to identify points of contingency or interpretative flexibility where ambiguities are present. Such variations may be linked to a variety of [[political]], [[historical]], [[cultural]] or [[economic]] factors. Crucially, the field does not set out to promote [[relativism]] or to attack the scientific project; the aim of the researcher is to explain why one interpretation rather than another succeeds due to external social and historical circumstances.

The field emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and at first was an almost exclusively British practice. Other early centers for the development of the field were in France, Germany, and the United States (notably at [[Cornell University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=Lk9T2HDmM1t6PHggWkXy9Ny7Cv75T9TskJwwvw8PyFgdmccphCr7!601689703!-129296667?docId=5000344671 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701102333/http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major theorists include [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[David Bloor]], [[Sal Restivo]], [[Randall Collins]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]], [[Martin Kusch]], [[Bruno Latour]],  [[Mike Mulkay]], [[Derek J. de Solla Price]], [[Lucy Suchman]] and [[Anselm Strauss]].

==Programmes and schools==
The sociology of scientific knowledge  in its Anglophone versions emerged in the 1970s in self-conscious opposition to the sociology of science associated with the American  [[Robert K. Merton]], generally considered one of the seminal authors in the sociology of science.  Merton's was a kind of "sociology of scientists," which left the cognitive content of science out of sociological account; SSK by contrast aimed at providing sociological explanations of scientific ideas themselves, taking its lead from aspects of the work of Thomas S. Kuhn, but especially from established traditions in cultural anthropology (Durkheim, Mauss) as well as the later Wittgenstein.  [[David Bloor]], one of SSK's early champions, has contrasted the so-called 'weak programme' (or 'program' &amp;mdash; either spelling is used) which merely gives social explanations for erroneous beliefs, with what he called the '[[strong program]]me', which considers sociological factors as influencing all beliefs.

The ''weak'' programme is more of a description of an approach than an organised movement. The term is applied to historians, sociologists and philosophers of science who merely cite [[sociological]] factors as being responsible for those beliefs that went wrong. [[Imre Lakatos]] and (in some moods) [[Thomas Kuhn]] might be said to adhere to it.  The ''strong'' programme is particularly associated with the work of two groups: the 'Edinburgh School' ([[David Bloor]], Barry Barnes, and their colleagues at the Science Studies Unit at the [[University of Edinburgh]]) in the 1970s and '80s, and the 'Bath School' ([[Harry Collins]] and others at the [[University of Bath]]) in the same period. "Edinburgh sociologists" and "Bath sociologists" promoted, respectively, the Strong Programme and Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR). Also associated with SSK in the 1980s was discourse analysis as applied to science (associated with [[Michael Mulkay]] at the University of York), as well as a concern with issues of reflexivity arising from paradoxes relating to SSK's relativist stance towards science and the status of its own knowledge-claims (Steve Woolgar, Malcolm Ashmore).

The sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) has major international networks through its principal associations, 4S and EASST, with recently established groups in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Latin America.  It has made major contributions in recent years to a critical analysis of the biosciences and informatics.

==The sociology of mathematical knowledge==
Studies of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] are also rightly part of the sociology of knowledge, since they focus on the community of those who practice [[mathematics]] and their common assumptions.  Since [[Eugene Wigner]] raised the issue in 1960 and [[Hilary Putnam]] made it more rigorous in 1975, the question of why fields such as [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] should agree so well has been debated. Proposed solutions point out that the fundamental constituents of mathematical thought, space, form-structure, and number-proportion are also the fundamental constituents of physics. It is also worthwhile to note that physics is nothing but a modeling of reality, and seeing causal relationships governing repeatable observed phenomena, and much of mathematics, especially in relation to the growth of the [[calculus]], has been developed precisely for the goal of developing these models in a rigorous fashion. Another approach is to suggest that there is no deep problem, that the division of human scientific thinking through using words such as 'mathematics' and 'physics' is only useful in their practical everyday function to categorize and distinguish.

Fundamental contributions to the sociology of mathematical knowledge have been made by [[Sal Restivo]] and [[David Bloor]]. Restivo draws upon the work of scholars such as [[Oswald Spengler]] (''The Decline of the West'', 1918), [[Raymond Louis Wilder]] and [[Leslie White|Leslie Alvin White]], as well as contemporary sociologists of knowledge and science studies scholars. [[David Bloor]] draws upon [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and other contemporary thinkers. They both claim that mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and has irreducible contingent and historical factors woven into it. More recently [[Paul Ernest]] has proposed a social constructivist account of mathematical knowledge, drawing on the works of both of these sociologists.

==Criticism==
SSK has received criticism from theorists of the [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) school of [[science and technology studies]]. These theorists criticise SSK for sociological [[reductionism]] and a [[anthropocentrism|human centered]] universe. SSK, they say, relies too heavily on human actors and social rules and conventions settling scientific controversies. The debate is discussed in an article ''Epistemological Chicken''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M. and S. Yearley (1992). "Epistemological Chicken". In A. Pickering (Ed.) ''Science as Practice and Culture''. Chicago, Chicago University Press: 301-326.

'''Statistical physics''' is a branch of [[physics]] that uses methods of [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], and particularly the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] tools for dealing with large populations and approximations, in solving physical problems. It can describe a wide variety of fields with an inherently [[stochastic]] nature. Its applications include many problems in the fields of physics, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[neurology]], and even some social sciences, such as [[sociology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raducha|first=Tomasz|last2=Gubiec|first2=Tomasz|date=2017-04|title=Coevolving complex networks in the model of social interactions|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|volume=471|pages=427–435|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2016.12.079|issn=0378-4371|arxiv=1606.03130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[linguistics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raducha|first=Tomasz|last2=Gubiec|first2=Tomasz|date=2018-04-27|title=Predicting language diversity with complex networks|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=e0196593|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0196593|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5922521|pmid=29702699}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Introduction to Statistical Physics |last = Huang |first = Kerson |publisher= CRC Press| isbn = 978-1-4200-7902-9 |page=15 |edition = 2nd|date = 2009-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, [[statistical mechanics]] develops the [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] results of [[thermodynamics]] from a probabilistic examination of the underlying microscopic systems. Historically, one of the first topics in physics where statistical methods were applied was the field of [[mechanics]], which is concerned with the motion of particles or objects when subjected to a force.

==Statistical mechanics==
{{Statistical mechanics}}
{{main|Statistical mechanics}}
[[Statistical mechanics]] provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk properties of materials that can be observed in everyday life, therefore explaining [[thermodynamics]] as a natural result of statistics, [[classical mechanics]], and [[quantum mechanics]] at the microscopic level.  Because of this history, the statistical physics is often considered synonymous with statistical mechanics or [[statistical thermodynamics]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;This article presents a broader sense of the definition of statistical physics.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important equations in statistical mechanics (analogous to &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt; in [[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian mechanics]], or the [[Schroedinger equation|Schrödinger equation]] in quantum mechanics) is the definition of the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, which is essentially a weighted sum of all possible states &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; available to a system.

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_q \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{E(q)}{k_BT}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[temperature]] and  &lt;math&gt;E(q)&lt;/math&gt; is [[energy]] of state  &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, the probability of a given state, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, occurring is given by

: &lt;math&gt;P(q) = \frac{ {\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{E(q)}{k_BT}}}}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we see that very-high-energy states have little probability of occurring, a result that is consistent with intuition.

A statistical approach can work well in classical systems when the number of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] (and so the number of variables) is so large that exact solution is not possible, or not really useful. Statistical mechanics can also describe work in [[non-linear dynamics]], [[chaos theory]], [[thermal physics]], [[fluid dynamics]] (particularly at high [[Knudsen number]]s), or [[plasma physics]].

Although some problems in statistical physics can be solved analytically using approximations and expansions, most current research utilizes the large processing power of modern computers to simulate or approximate solutions. A common approach to statistical problems is to use a [[Monte Carlo simulation]] to yield insight into the dynamics of a [[complex system]].

===Quantum statistical mechanics===
[[Quantum statistical mechanics]] is [[statistical mechanics]] applied to [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical systems]]. In quantum mechanics a [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] (probability distribution over possible [[quantum state]]s) is described by a [[density matrix|density operator]] ''S'', which is a non-negative, [[self-adjoint]], [[trace-class]] operator of trace 1 on the [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' describing the quantum system.  This can be shown under various [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics]].  One such formalism is provided by [[quantum logic]].

==Scientists and universities==
A significant contribution (at different times) in development of statistical physics was given by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[J. Willard Gibbs]], [[Marian Smoluchowski]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[L. Landau]], [[Vladimir Fock]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], Benjamin Widom, [[Lars Onsager]], Benjamin and Jeremy Chubb (also inventors of the titanium sublimation pump), and others. Statistical physics is studied in the nuclear center at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Also, Pentagon has organized a large department for the study of [[turbulence]] at the [[Princeton University|University of Princeton]]. Work in this area is also being conducted by [[Saclay]] (Paris), [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institute]], [[AMOLF|Netherlands Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics]] and other research centers.

==Achievements==
Statistical physics allowed us to explain and quantitatively describe [[superconductivity]], [[superfluidity]], [[turbulence]], collective phenomena in [[solid]]s and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and the structural features of [[liquid]]. It underlies the modern [[astrophysics]]. It is statistical physics that helped us to create such intensively developing study of [[liquid crystals]] and to construct a theory of [[phase transition]] and [[critical phenomena]]. Many experimental studies of matter are entirely based on the statistical description of a system. These include the scattering of cold [[neutron]]s, [[X-ray]], [[Visible radiation|visible light]], and more.
Statistical physics plays a major role in Physics of Solid State Physics, Materials Science, Nuclear Physics, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Biology and Medicine (e.g. study of the spread of infectious diseases), Information Theory and Technique but also in those areas of technology owing to their development in the evolution of Modern Physics. It still has important applications in theoretical sciences such as Sociology and Linguistics and is useful for researchers in higher education, corporate governance and industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2350">In [[biology]], a '''subgenus''' (plural: '''subgenera''') is a [[taxonomic rank]] directly below [[genus]].

In the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], a subgeneric name can be used independently or included in a [[binomen|species name]], in parentheses, placed between the [[name of a biological genus|generic]] name and the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]]: e.g. the [[Cowry|tiger cowry]] of the Indo-Pacific, ''Cypraea'' (''Cypraea'') ''tigris'' Linnaeus, which belongs to the subgenus ''Cypraea'' of the genus ''Cypraea''. However, it is not mandatory, or even customary, when giving the name of a species, to include the subgeneric name.

In the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], the subgenus is one of the possible subdivisions of a genus. There is no limit to the number of divisions that are permitted within a genus by adding the prefix "sub-" or in other ways as long as no confusion can result.&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

In zoological nomenclature, when a genus is split into subgenus, the originally described population is retained as the "nominotypical subgenus" or "nominate subgenus", which repeats the same name as the genus. For example, ''Panthera Panthera pardus'', a [[leopard]].

'''''The Emperor's New Drugs – Exploding the Antidepressant Myth''''' is a 2009 book by [[Irving Kirsch]], arguing that the [[chemical imbalance theory]] of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] is wrong and that [[antidepressants]] have little or no direct effect on depression but, because of their common serious side-effects, they are a powerful [[placebo]].&lt;ref name="Kirsch2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==
While analyzing antidepressant trials as part of his research into the [[placebo]] effect, Kirsch realised that drug companies do not publish all of their disappointing antidepressant trial results, but most decisions about the efficacy of an antidepressant are based only on published results. Using the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], he and his colleagues acquired from the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] the unpublished trial results for six antidepressants. When the results from both published and unpublished studies were averaged, the researchers concluded that the drugs produced a small but [[Clinical significance|clinically meaningless]] improvement in mood compared with an inert placebo (sugar pill).&lt;ref name=Medscape/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirsch2002&gt;{{cite journal|title= The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|author1=Kirsch, Irving |author2=Moore, Thomas J. |author3=Scoboria, Alan |author4=Nicholls, Sarah S |journal=Prevention &amp; Treatment|volume=5|issue=1|date= Jul 2002|doi= 10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some researchers have questioned the statistical basis of this study suggesting that it underestimates the effect size of antidepressants&lt;ref name="HORDER2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horder J, Matthews P, Waldmann R | title = Placebo, Prozac and PLoS: significant lessons for psychopharmacology | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England) | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 1277–88 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20571143 | doi = 10.1177/0269881110372544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOUNTOULAKIS2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fountoulakis KN, Möller HJ | title = Efficacy of antidepressants: a re-analysis and re-interpretation of the Kirsch data | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–8 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20800012 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145710000957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other studies have reached a range of supporting and conflicting conclusions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibbons RD, Hur K, Brown CH, Davis JM, Mann JJ | title = Benefits from antidepressants: synthesis of 6-week patient-level outcomes from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials of fluoxetine and venlafaxine | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 572–9 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22393205 | pmc = 3371295 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2044 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD, etal |title=Antidepressant drug effects and depression severity: a patient-level meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |date=January 2010  |pmid=20051569 |pmc=3712503 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1943 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine whether their averaging of results was hiding a meaningful benefit to more-severely depressed patients by combining their results with those of moderately and mildly depressed patients, he and his colleagues undertook another study, this time of the four new-generation antidepressants for which all (published and unpublished) trial data were available, and concluded that the difference between drug and placebo effect was greater for more-severely depressed patients, and that this difference was clinically meaningful (but still relatively small) only at the upper end of the very severely depressed category. They attributed this difference to very seriously depressed patients being less responsive to the inert placebo.&lt;ref name=Kirsch2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT |title=Initial severity and antidepressant benefits: a meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e45 |date=February 2008  |pmid=18303940 |pmc=2253608 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirsch also addresses the conclusions of the [[STAR*D|a 2004 study]], that if one antidepressant doesn't work on a patient, another should be tried in its place, and then another, until hopefully one will be found to be effective. The 2004 study found that although only 37% of patients were helped by the first antidepressant tried, 67% had found some relief by the time they had tried the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rush AJ |title=Sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D): rationale and design |journal=Control Clin Trials |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=119–42 |date=February 2004  |pmid=15061154 |doi= 10.1016/s0197-2456(03)00112-0|url=|name-list-format=vanc |author2= Fava M |author3= Wisniewski SR |displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirsch cites a 1957 study&lt;ref name="Kirsch59"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|url=|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which volunteers were given a drug that induces nausea and one to treat nausea. If the anti-nausea drug failed to prevent nausea, they were given another. If that failed, another was tried; and so on. All volunteers experienced complete relief from nausea by the sixth treatment, yet every treatment was a placebo. He concludes that the results of the 2004 antidepressant study are also likely due to the placebo effect.&lt;ref name=Menand&gt;{{cite journal| author=Menand, Louis| url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2010/03/01/100301crat_atlarge_menand?currentPage=all| date=1 March 2010| journal=The New Yorker| title=Head Case: Can Psychiatry Be a Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Psychopharmacology revolution#Theory of mood disorders|chemical-imbalance theory of depression]] is based on the efficacy of antidepressants, Kirsch concludes, "It now seems beyond question that the traditional account of depression as a chemical imbalance in the brain is simply wrong."&lt;ref name=Menand/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirsch80"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|url=|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
The European Psychiatric Association published a position paper in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Möller HJ, Bitter I, Bobes J, Fountoulakis K, Höschl C, Kasper S |title=Position statement of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA) on the value of antidepressants in the treatment of unipolar depression |journal=Eur. Psychiatry |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=114–28 |year=2012 |pmid=22119161 |doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.08.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924933811001398}}&lt;/ref&gt; that described Kirsch's argument as "misleading".  The organization argues that 
* The mathematical treatment of the data was flawed and underestimates the efficacy of antidepressants; 
* The analysis incorrectly focuses on mean differences between groups and ignores important subgroup effects; 
* The size effect cutoff of 0.50 is arbitrary and not demonstrated to be clinically meaningful; 
* That efficacy measured by the 15-20% difference between placebo and active antidepressant treatment in rate of remission corresponds to moderate to strong efficacy in evidence-based medicine analyses, and 
* Kirsch's analysis disregards the results of double-blind, placebo controlled maintenance studies that show highly statistical effects on the rate of relapse for those treated with antidepressants relative to those receiving placebo

[[Marcia Angell]]'s review of The Emperor's New Drugs welcomes Kirsch's work as a long overdue application of the scientific method to a field lacking rigorous scientific analysis, stating "Kirsch is a faithful proponent of the scientific method, and his voice therefore brings a welcome objectivity to a subject often swayed by anecdotes, emotions, or, as we will see, self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/06/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/ |title=The Epidemic of Mental Illness: Why? |last=Angell |first=Marcia |website=[[New York Review of Books]] |publication-date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Daniel Carlat]] called the book "an important book, with the reservation that Kirsch’s selective use of data gives him the appearance of an anti-antidepressant partisan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Book Review: The Emperor’s New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth. Irving Kirsch Basic Books; 2010. | pmc=3001545 | page=E873 | volume=182 | issue=18 | journal=CMAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He states that Irving's conclusions are "provocative but unconvincing", noting that many drugs such as benzodiazepines have been tested for antidepressant activity and found inactive.  Carlat argues that if antidepressants were acting purely via a placebo effect, any benzodiazepines and other drugs would show activity as well.

In a 2012 episode of [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'' featuring Kirsch and his book, host [[Lesley Stahl]] said, "The medical community is at war – battling over the scientific research and writings of a psychologist named Irving Kirsch ... Kirsch and his studies have triggered a furious counterattack, mainly from psychiatrists."&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/treating-depression-is-there-a-placebo-effect/|title=Treating Depression: Is there a Placebo Effect? |date=19 February 2012 |website= CBS, 60 Minutes |publisher= |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the program's airing, [[Jeffrey Lieberman]], the American Psychiatric Association's president elect at the time, said, "Dr. Kirsch is mistaken and confused, and he's ideologically biased in his thinking. He is conducting an analysis and interpreting the data to support his ideologically biased perspective.  What he is concluding is inaccurate, and what he is communicating is misleading to people and potentially harmful to those who really suffer from depression and would be expected to benefit from antidepressant medication. To say that antidepressants are no better than placebo is just plain wrong." &lt;ref name=Medscape&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/760569 |author= Fran Lowry|title=APA Blasts 60 Minutes Program on Antidepressants |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 470–399 [[Socrates]]&lt;ref name="SheehyChapman2002" /&gt; – Socrates has been called the father of western philosophy, if only via his influence on Plato and Aristotle. Socrates made a major contribution to [[pedagogy]] via his dialectical method and to [[epistemology]] via his definition of true knowledge as true belief buttressed by some rational justification.

* 387&amp;nbsp;BCE – [[Plato]] suggested that the brain is the seat of mental processes. Plato's view of the "soul" (self) is that the body exists to serve the soul: "God created the soul before the body and gave it precedence both in time and value, and made it the dominating and controlling partner." from [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]&lt;ref name="Kemp1990"/&gt;

* c. 300–30 [[Zeno of Citium]] taught the philosophy of [[Stoicism]], involving [[logic]] and [[ethics]]. In logic, he distinguished between imperfect knowledge offered by the senses and superior knowledge offered by reason. In ethics, he taught that virtue lay in reason and vice in rejection of reason. Stoicism inspired [[Aaron Beck]] to introduce [[cognitive behavior therapy]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Beck AT, Rush AJ, Shaw BF, Emery G |year = 1979|title = Cognitive Therapy of Depression|page = 8|publisher = Guilford Press|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-89862-000-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 123–43&amp;nbsp;BCE – [[Themison of Laodicea]] was a pupil of [[Asclepiades of Bithynia]] and founded a school of medical thought known as "methodism." He was criticized by Soranus for his cruel handling of mental patients. Among his prescriptions were darkness, restraint by chains, and deprivation of food and drink. [[Juvenal]] satirized him and suggested that he killed more patients than he cured.&lt;ref name="HowellsOsborn1984" /&gt;

* 345–399 - [[Evagrius Ponticus]] described a rigorous way of introspection within the early Christian monastic tradition.

==Seventh century==

*625–690 – [[Paul of Aegina]] suggested that hysteria should be treated by ligature of the limbs, and mania by tying the patient to a mattress placed inside a wicker basket and suspended from the ceiling.

A '''tropical year''' (also known as a '''solar year''') is the [[time]] that the [[Sun]] takes to return to the same [[position of the Sun|position]] in the cycle of [[season]]s, as seen from [[Earth]]; for example, the time from [[vernal equinox]] to vernal equinox, or from [[summer solstice]] to summer solstice. Because of the [[axial precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]], the [[season]]al cycle does not remain exactly synchronized with the position of the Earth in [[Earth's orbit|its orbit]] around the Sun. As a consequence, the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun as measured with respect to the [[fixed stars]] (the [[sidereal year]]).

Since antiquity, astronomers have progressively refined the definition of the tropical year. The entry for "year, tropical" in the ''Astronomical Almanac Online Glossary'' ([[#{{harvid|USNO|2015}}|2015]]) states:

{{quote|the period of time for the ecliptic longitude of the Sun to increase 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. Since the Sun's ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox, the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of seasons, and its length is approximated in the long term by the civil (Gregorian) calendar. The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds.}}

An equivalent, more descriptive, definition is "The natural basis for computing passing tropical years is the mean longitude of the Sun reckoned from the precessionally moving equinox (the dynamical equinox or equinox of date).   Whenever the longitude reaches a multiple of 360 degrees the mean Sun crosses the vernal equinox and a new tropical year begins" {{harv|Borkowski|1991|p=122}}.

The mean tropical year in 2000 was 365.24219 [[ephemeris day]]s; each ephemeris day lasting 86,400 SI seconds.&lt;ref name=SIsecond/&gt; This is 365.24217 [[mean solar day]]s {{harv|Richards|2013|p=587}}.

==History==

===Origin===
The word "tropical" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tropikos'' meaning "turn" {{harv|tropic|1992}}. Thus, the tropics of [[tropic of Cancer|Cancer]] and [[tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]] mark the extreme north and south [[latitude]]s where the Sun can appear directly overhead, and where it appears to "turn" in its annual seasonal motion. Because of this connection between the tropics and the seasonal cycle of the apparent position of the Sun, the word "tropical" also lent its name to the "tropical year". The early Chinese, Hindus, Greeks, and others made approximate measures of the tropical year.

===Early value, precession discovery===
In the 2nd century BC [[Hipparchus]] measured the time required for the Sun to travel from an [[equinox]] to the same equinox again. He reckoned the length of the year to be 1/300 of a day less than 365.25 days (365 days, 5 hours, 55 minutes, 12 seconds, or 365.24667 days). Hipparchus used this method because he was better able to detect the time of the equinoxes, compared to that of the solstices {{harv|Meeus|Savoie|1992|p=40}}.

Hipparchus also discovered that the equinoctial points moved along the [[ecliptic]] (plane of the Earth's orbit, or what Hipparchus would have thought of as the plane of the Sun's orbit about the Earth) in a direction opposite that of the movement of the Sun, a phenomenon that came to be named "precession of the equinoxes". He reckoned the value as 1° per century, a value that was not improved upon until about 1000 years later, by [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomers]]. Since this discovery a distinction has been made between the tropical year and the sidereal year {{harv|Meeus|Savoie|1992|p=40}}.

===Middle Ages and the Renaissance===
During the Middle Ages and Renaissance a number of progressively better tables were published that allowed computation of the positions of the Sun, [[Moon]] and [[planets]] relative to the fixed stars. An important application of these tables was the [[Calendar reform|reform of the calendar]].

The [[Alfonsine Tables]], published in 1252, were based on the theories of [[Ptolemy]] and were revised and updated after the original publication; the most recent update in 1978 was by the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]]. The length of the tropical year was given as 365 solar days 5 hours 49 minutes 16 seconds (≈&amp;nbsp;365.24255 days). This length was used in devising the [[Gregorian calendar]] of 1582 {{harv|Meeus|Savoie|1992|p=41}}.

In the 16th century [[Copernicus]] put forward a [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric cosmology]]. Erasmus Reinhold used Copernicus' theory to compute the [[Prutenic Tables]] in 1551, and gave a tropical year length of 365 solar days, 5 hours, 55 minutes, 58 seconds (365.24720 days), based on the length of a [[sidereal year]] and the presumed rate of precession. This was actually less accurate than the earlier value of the Alfonsine Tables.

Major advances in the 17th century were made by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. In 1609 and 1619 Kepler published his three laws of planetary motion {{harv|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=26}}. In 1627, Kepler used the observations of [[Tycho Brahe]] and Waltherus to produce the most accurate tables up to that time, the [[Rudolphine Tables]]. He evaluated the mean tropical year as 365 solar days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds (365.24219 days; {{harvnb|Meeus|Savoie|1992|p=41}}).

Newton's three laws of dynamics and theory of gravity were published in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687. Newton's theoretical and mathematical advances influenced tables by [[Edmund Halley]] published in 1693 and 1749 {{harv|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pp=26–28}} and provided the underpinnings of all solar system models until [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[General relativity]] in the 20th century.

===18th and 19th century===

From the time of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, the year was based on two equinoxes (or two solstices) a number of years apart, to average out both observational errors and the effects of [[nutation]] (periodic motions of the axis of rotation of the earth, the main cycle being 18.6 years) and the movement of the Sun caused by the gravitational pull of the planets. These effects did not begin to be understood until Newton's time. To model short-term variations of the time between equinoxes (and prevent them from confounding efforts to measure long-term variations) requires either precise observations or an elaborate theory of the apparent motion of the Sun. The necessary theories and mathematical tools came together in the 18th century due to the work of [[Pierre-Simon de Laplace]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], and other specialists in [[celestial mechanics]]. They were able to express the mean longitude of the Sun as

:''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; days

where ''T'' is the time in Julian centuries. The inverse of the derivative of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''dT/dL''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; gives the length of the tropical year as a linear function of T. When this is computed, an expression giving the length of the tropical year as a function of T results.

Two equations are given in the table. Both equations estimate that the tropical year gets roughly a half second shorter each century.

Newcomb's tables were successful enough that they were used by the joint American-British ''[[Astronomical Almanac]]'' for the Sun, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]] through 1983 {{harv|Seidelmann|1992|p=317}}.

===20th and 21st centuries===
The length of the mean tropical year is derived from a model of the solar system, so any advance that improves the solar system model potentially improves the accuracy of the mean tropical year. Many new observing instruments became available, including
*artificial satellites
*tracking of deep space probes such as [[Pioneer 4]] beginning in 1959 ([[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] [[#{{harvid|JPL|2005}}|2005]])
*[[Radar astronomy|radars]] able to measure the distance to other planets beginning in 1961 {{harv|Butrica|1996}}
*[[lunar laser ranging]] since the 1969 [[Apollo 11]] left the first of a series of [[retroreflector]]s which allow greater accuracy than reflectorless measurements
*artificial satellites such as [[LAGEOS]] (1976) and the [[Global Positioning System]] (initial operation in 1993)
*[[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] which finds precise directions to [[quasar]]s in distant [[galaxies]], and allows determination of the Earth's orientation with respect to these objects whose distance is so great they can be considered to show minimal space motion {{harv|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=265}}.

The complexity of the model used for the solar system must be limited to the available computation facilities. In the 1920s punched card equipment came into use by L. J. Comrie in Britain. For the ''American Ephemeris'' an electromagnetic computer, the [[IBM Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator]] was used since 1948. When modern computers became available, it was possible to compute ephemerides using [[numerical integration]] rather than general theories; numerical integration came into use in 1984 for the joint US-UK almanacs {{harv|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=32}}.

[[Einstein]]'s [[General Theory of Relativity]] provided a more accurate theory, but the accuracy of theories and observations did not require the refinement provided by this theory (except for the advance of the perihelion of Mercury) until 1984. Time scales incorporated general relativity beginning in the 1970s {{harv|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=37}}.

A key development in understanding the tropical year over long periods of time is the discovery that the rate of rotation of the earth, or equivalently, the length of the [[Solar day|mean solar day]], is not constant. William Ferrel in 1864 and [[Charles-Eugène Delaunay]] in 1865 indicated the rotation of the Earth was being retarded by tides. In 1921 William H Shortt invented the [[Shortt-Synchronome clock]], the most accurate commercially produced pendulum clock; it was the first clock capable of measuring variations in the Earth's rotation. The next major time-keeping advance was the [[quartz clock]], first built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton in 1927; in the late 1930s quartz clocks began to replace pendulum clocks as time standards {{harv|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;9}}.

A series of experiments beginning in the late 1930s led to the development of the first [[atomic clock]] by [[Louis Essen]] and J. V. L. Parry in 1955. Their clock was based on a transition in the cesium atom {{harv|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pp=157–9}}. Due to the accuracy the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1960 redefined the second in terms of the cesium transition.&lt;ref name=SIsecond&gt;"The second is the duration of {{gaps|9|192|631|770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom." [[CGPM]] (1960, Resolution 9, as quoted in [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] [[#{{harvid|BIPM|2006}}|2006]], 133)&lt;/ref&gt; The atomic second, often called the [[SI]] second, was intended to agree with the ephemeris second based on Newcomb's work, which in turn makes it agree with the mean solar second of the mid-19th century {{harv|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pp=81–2, 191–7}}.

==Time scales==
As mentioned in [[#History|History]], advances in time-keeping have resulted in various time scales. One useful time scale is [[Universal Time]], especially the UT1 variant, which is the mean solar time at 0 degrees [[longitude]] (the [[Greenwich meridian]]). One second of UT is 1/86,400 of a mean solar day. This time scale is known to be somewhat variable. Since all civil calendars count actual solar days, they must ultimately be based on UT (but the actual timing of official midnight is based on [[UTC]]).

The other time scale has two parts. Ephemeris time (ET) is the independent variable in the equations of motion of the solar system, in particular, the equations in use from 1960 to 1984 {{harv|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=378}}. That is, the length of the second used in the solar system calculations could be adjusted until the length that gives the best agreement with observations is found. With the introduction of atomic clocks in the 1950s, it was found that ET could be better realized as atomic time. This also means that ET is a uniform time scale, as is atomic time. ET was given a new name, [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT), and for most purposes ET = TT = [[International Atomic Time]] + 32.184 SI seconds. {{As of|2017|01|post=,}} TT is ahead of UT1 by 69.184 seconds ([[International Earth Rotation Service]] [[#{{harvid|IERS|2017}}|2017]]; {{harvnb|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pp=86–7}}).

As explained below, long-term estimates of the length of the tropical year were used in connection with the reform of the [[Julian calendar]], which resulted in the Gregorian calendar. Participants in that reform were unaware of the non-uniform rotation of the Earth, but now this can be taken into account to some degree. The amount that TT is ahead of UT1 is known as [[ΔT|Δ''T'']], or Delta ''T''. The table below gives [[#{{harvid|Morrison|Stephenson|2004}}|Morrison and Stephenson's (S &amp; M) 2004]] estimates and [[standard error]]s (''σ'') for dates significant in the process of developing the Gregorian calendar.

The low-precision extrapolations are computed with an expression provided by {{harvtxt|Morrison|Stephenson|2004}}

:Δ''T'' in seconds = &amp;minus;20 + 32''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

where ''t'' is measured in Julian centuries from 1820. The extrapolation is provided only to show Δ''T'' is not negligible when evaluating the calendar for long periods; {{harvtxt|Borkowski|1991|p=126}} cautions that "many researchers have attempted to fit a parabola to the measured Δ''T'' values in order to determine the magnitude of the deceleration of the Earth's rotation. The results, when taken together, are rather discouraging."

==Length of tropical year==
An oversimplified definition of the tropical year would be the time required for the Sun, beginning at a chosen ecliptic longitude, to make one complete cycle of the seasons and return to the same ecliptic longitude. Before considering an example, the equinox must be examined. There are two important planes in solar system calculations, the plane of the ecliptic (the Earth's orbit around the Sun), and the plane of the [[celestial equator]] (the Earth's equator projected into space). These two planes intersect in a line. This ''direction'' is given the symbol {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}} (the symbol looks like the horns of a [[Bighorn sheep|ram]] because it used to be toward the constellation [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]). The opposite ''direction'' is given the symbol {{Emoji presentation|♎|text}} (because it used to be toward [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]). Because of the [[Axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]] and nutation these directions change, compared to the direction of distant stars and galaxies, whose directions have no measurable motion due to their great distance (see [[International Celestial Reference Frame]]).

The ecliptic longitude of the Sun is the angle between {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}} and the Sun, measured eastward along the ecliptic. This creates a complicated measurement, because as the Sun is moving, the direction the angle is measured from is also moving. It is convenient to have a fixed (with respect to distant stars) direction to measure from; the direction of {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}} at noon January 1, 2000 fills this role and is given the symbol {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

Using the oversimplified definition, there was an equinox on March 20, 2009, 11:44:43.6 TT. The 2010 March equinox was March 20, 17:33:18.1 TT, which gives a duration of 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 34.5 seconds (Astronomical Applications Dept., [[#{{harvid|USNO|2009}}|2009]]). While the Sun moves, {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}} moves in the opposite direction . When the Sun and {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}} met at the 2010 March equinox, the Sun had moved east 359°59'09" while {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}} had moved west 51" for a total of 360° (all with respect to {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; {{harvnb|Seidelmann|1992|p=104}}, expression for p&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;).

If a different starting longitude for the Sun is chosen, the duration for the Sun to return to the same longitude will be different. This is because although {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}} changes at a nearly steady rate&lt;ref&gt;The expression for p&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; in {{harvnb|Seidelmann|1992|p=104}} shows the progression per 365 days of TT increases steadily from 50.25865 arcseconds (January 1, 2009 – January 1, 2010) to 50.25889 arcseconds (December 1, 2009 – December 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; there is considerable variation in the angular speed of the Sun. Thus, the 50 or so arcseconds that the Sun does not have to move to complete the tropical year "saves" varying amounts of time depending on the position in the orbit.

===Mean time interval between equinoxes===

As already mentioned, there is some choice in the length of the tropical year depending on the point of reference that one selects. But during the period when return of the Sun to a chosen longitude was the method in use by astronomers, one of the equinoxes was usually chosen because it was easier to detect when it occurred. When tropical year measurements from several successive years are compared, variations are found which are due to [[nutation]], and to the planetary [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] acting on the Sun. {{harvtxt|Meeus|Savoie|1992|p=41}} provided the following examples of intervals between northward equinoxes:
{| class=wikitable

|-
|1989–1990 || 365 ||5 ||51 ||06
|}
Until the beginning of the 19th century, the length of the tropical year was found by comparing equinox dates that were separated by many years; this approach yielded the ''mean'' tropical year {{harv|Meeus|Savoie|1992|p=42}}.

Values of mean time intervals between equinoxes and solstices were provided by {{harvtxt|Meeus|Savoie|1992|p=42}} for the years [[Astronomical year numbering#Year zero usage|0]] and 2000.

===Mean tropical year current value===
The mean tropical year on January 1, 2000 was {{gaps|365.242|189|7}} or 365 [[ephemeris day]]s, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45.19 seconds. This changes slowly; an expression suitable for calculating the length of a tropical year in ephemeris days, between 8000 BC and 12000 AD is

: &lt;math&gt;365.242 189 669 8-6.153 59\times 10^{-6}T-7.29\times 10^{-10}T^2 + 2.64\times 10^{-10}T^3&lt;/math&gt;

where T is in Julian centuries of 36,525 days of 86,400 SI seconds measured from noon January 1, 2000 TT (in negative numbers for dates in the past; {{harvnb|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=18}}, calculated from planetary model of {{harvnb|Laskar|1986}}).

Modern astronomers define the tropical year as time for the Sun's mean longitude to increase by 360°. The process for finding an expression for the length of the tropical year is to first find an expression for the Sun's mean longitude (with respect to {{Emoji presentation|♈|text}}), such as Newcomb's expression given above, or Laskar's expression ([[#{{harvid|Laskar|1986}}|1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;64). When viewed over a one-year period, the mean longitude is very nearly a linear function of Terrestrial Time. To find the length of the tropical year, the mean longitude is differentiated, to give the angular speed of the Sun as a function of Terrestrial Time, and this angular speed is used to compute how long it would take for the Sun to move 360° ({{harvnb|Meeus|Savoie|1992|p=42}}; [[#{{harvid|USNO|2010}}|Astronomical Almanac for the year 2011]], L8).

The above formulae give the length of the tropical year in ephemeris days (equal to 86,400 SI seconds), not [[solar day]]s. It is the number of solar days in a tropical year that is important for keeping the calendar in synch with the seasons (see below).

== Calendar year ==
The [[Gregorian calendar]], as used for civil and scientific purposes, is an international standard. It is a solar calendar that is designed to maintain synchrony with the mean tropical year {{harv|Dobrzycki|1983|p=123}}. It has a cycle of 400 years (146,097 days). Each cycle repeats the months, dates, and weekdays. The average year length is 146,097/400 = {{frac|365|97|400}} = 365.2425 days per year, a close approximation to the mean tropical year {{harv|Seidelmann|1992|pp=576–81}}.

The Gregorian calendar is a reformed version of the Julian calendar. By the time of the reform in 1582, the date of the vernal equinox had shifted about 10 days, from about March 21 at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, to about March 11. According to {{harvtxt|North|1983}}, the real motivation for reform was not primarily a matter of getting agricultural cycles back to where they had once been in the seasonal cycle; the primary concern of Christians was the correct observance of Easter. The rules used to [[Computus|compute the date of Easter]] used a conventional date for the vernal equinox (March 21), and it was considered important to keep March 21 close to the actual equinox {{harv|North|1983|pp=75–76}}.

If society in the future still attaches importance to the synchronization between the civil calendar and the seasons, another reform of the calendar will eventually be necessary. According to Blackburn and Holford-Strevens (who used Newcomb's value for the tropical year) if the tropical year remained at its 1900 value of {{gaps|365.242|198|781|25}} days the Gregorian calendar would be 3 days, 17 min, 33 s behind the Sun after 10,000 years. Aggravating this error, the length of the tropical year (measured in Terrestrial Time) is decreasing at a rate of approximately 0.53 s per century. Also, the mean solar day is getting longer at a rate of about 1.5 ms per century. These effects will cause the calendar to be nearly a day behind in 3200. The number of solar days in a "tropical millennium" is decreasing by about 0.06 per millennium (neglecting the oscillatory changes in the real length of the tropical year).&lt;ref&gt;365242×1.5/8640000.&lt;/ref&gt; This means there should be fewer and fewer leap days as time goes on. A possible reform would be to omit the leap day in 3200, keep 3600 and 4000 as leap years, and thereafter make all centennial years common except 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, etc. But the quantity [[ΔT]] is not sufficiently predictable to form more precise proposals {{harv|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=692}}.

'''X-ray fluorescence''' ('''XRF''') is the emission of characteristic "secondary" (or fluorescent) [[X-rays]] from a material that has been excited by bombarding with high-energy X-rays or [[gamma rays]]. The phenomenon is widely used for [[elemental analysis]] and [[analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]], particularly in the investigation of [[metal]]s, [[glass]], [[ceramic]]s and building materials, and for research in [[geochemistry]], [[forensic science]], [[archaeology]] and art objects&lt;ref&gt;De Viguerie L, Sole VA, Walter P, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19688344 Multilayers quantitative X-ray fluorescence analysis applied to easel paintings], Anal Bioanal Chem. 2009 Dec; 395(7): 2015-20. {{doi|10.1007/s00216-009-2997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[paintings]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/x-ray-fluorescence/ X-Ray Fluorescence at ColourLex]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[murals]].

==Underlying physics==
[[File:X-ray fluorescence simple figure.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Physics of X-ray fluorescence in a schematic representation.]]

When materials are exposed to short-[[wavelength]] X-rays or to gamma rays, ionization of their component [[atom]]s may take place. Ionization consists of the ejection of one or more electrons from the atom, and may occur if the atom is exposed to radiation with an energy greater than its [[ionization energy]]. X-rays and gamma rays can be energetic enough to expel tightly held electrons from the inner [[atomic orbital|orbital]]s of the atom. The removal of an electron in this way makes the electronic structure of the atom unstable, and electrons in higher orbitals "fall" into the lower orbital to fill the [[electron hole|hole]] left behind. In falling, energy is released in the form of a photon, the energy of which is equal to the energy difference of the two orbitals involved. Thus, the material emits radiation, which has energy characteristic of the atoms present. The term ''[[fluorescence]]'' is applied to phenomena in which the absorption of radiation of a specific energy results in the re-emission of radiation of a different energy (generally lower).

===Characteristic radiation===
Each element has electronic orbitals of [[characteristic X-ray|characteristic]] energy. Following removal of an inner electron by an energetic photon provided by a primary radiation source, an electron from an outer shell drops into its place. There are a limited number of ways in which this can happen, as shown in Figure 1. The main transitions are given names: an L→K transition is traditionally called [[K-alpha|K&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;]], an M→K transition is called K&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;, an M→L transition is called L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, and so on. Each of these transitions yields a fluorescent photon with a characteristic energy equal to the difference in energy of the initial and final orbital. The wavelength of this fluorescent radiation can be calculated from [[Planck postulate|Planck's Law]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h c}{E} &lt;/math&gt;

The fluorescent radiation can be analysed either by sorting the energies of the photons ([[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy-dispersive]] analysis) or by separating the wavelengths of the radiation ([[wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|wavelength-dispersive]] analysis). Once sorted, the intensity of each characteristic radiation is directly related to the amount of each element in the material. This is the basis of a powerful technique in [[analytical chemistry]]. Figure 2 shows the typical form of the sharp fluorescent spectral lines obtained in the wavelength-dispersive method (see [[Moseley's law]]).

===Primary radiation===
In order to excite the atoms, a source of radiation is required, with sufficient energy to expel tightly held inner electrons. Conventional [[X-ray generators]] are most commonly used, because their output can readily be "tuned" for the application, and because higher power can be deployed relative to other techniques. However, gamma ray sources can be used without the need for an elaborate power supply, allowing an easier use in small portable instruments. When the energy source is a [[synchrotron]] or the X-rays are focused by an optic like a [[polycapillary]], the X-ray beam can be very small and very intense. As a result, atomic information on the sub-micrometre scale can be obtained. X-ray generators in the range 20–60 kV are used, which allow excitation of a broad range of atoms. The continuous spectrum consists of "[[bremsstrahlung]]" radiation: radiation produced when high-energy electrons passing through the tube are progressively decelerated by the material of the tube anode (the "target"). A typical tube output spectrum is shown in Figure 3.

===Dispersion===
In energy dispersive analysis, the fluorescent X-rays emitted by the material sample are directed into a solid-state detector which produces a "continuous" distribution of pulses, the voltages of which are proportional to the incoming photon energies. This signal is processed by a multichannel analyser (MCA) which produces an accumulating digital spectrum that can be processed to obtain analytical data.

In wavelength dispersive analysis, the fluorescent X-rays emitted by the material sample are directed into a diffraction grating monochromator. The diffraction grating used is usually a single crystal. By varying the angle of incidence and take-off on the crystal, a single X-ray wavelength can be selected. The wavelength obtained is given by [[Bragg's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt; n \cdot \lambda = 2 d \cdot \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the spacing of atomic layers parallel to the crystal surface.

===Detection===
In energy dispersive analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, as already mentioned above. [[Proportional counter]]s or various types of solid-state detectors ([[PIN diode]], Si(Li), Ge(Li), [[Silicon Drift Detector]] SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray [[photon]] ionises a large number of detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. [[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDXRF]] detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover the low end of the performance spectrum, followed by [[PIN diode]] detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and [[Silicon Drift Detector]]s (SDD) occupy the high end of the performance scale.

In wavelength dispersive analysis, the single-wavelength radiation produced by the monochromator is passed into a [[photomultiplier]], a detector similar to a [[Geiger counter]], which counts individual photons as they pass through. The counter is a chamber containing a gas that is ionised by X-ray photons. A central electrode is charged at (typically) +1700 V with respect to the conducting chamber walls, and each photon triggers a pulse-like cascade of current across this field. The signal is amplified and transformed into an accumulating digital count. These counts are then processed to obtain analytical data.

===X-ray intensity===

The fluorescence process is inefficient, and the secondary radiation is much weaker than the primary beam. Furthermore, the secondary radiation from lighter elements is of relatively low energy (long wavelength) and has low penetrating power, and is severely attenuated if the beam passes through air for any distance. Because of this, for high-performance analysis, the path from tube to sample to detector is maintained under vacuum (around 10 Pa residual pressure). This means in practice that most of the working parts of the instrument have to be located in a large vacuum chamber. The problems of maintaining moving parts in vacuum, and of rapidly introducing and withdrawing the sample without losing vacuum, pose major challenges for the design of the instrument. For less demanding applications, or when the sample is damaged by a vacuum (e.g. a volatile sample), a helium-swept X-ray chamber can be substituted, with some loss of low-Z (Z = [[atomic number]]) intensities.

==Chemical analysis==

The use of a primary X-ray beam to excite fluorescent radiation from the sample was first proposed by [[Richard Glocker|Glocker]] and [[Hans-Wilhelm Schreiber|Schreiber]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Glocker, R., and Schreiber, H., ''Annalen der Physik.'', 85, (1928), p. 1089&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the method is used as a non-destructive analytical technique, and as a process control tool in many extractive and processing industries. In principle, the lightest element that can be analysed is [[beryllium]] (Z = 4), but due to instrumental limitations and low X-ray yields for the light elements, it is often difficult to quantify elements lighter than [[sodium]] (Z = 11), unless background corrections and very comprehensive inter-element corrections are made.

[[File:dmedxrfschematic.jpg|thumb|Figure 4: Schematic arrangement of EDX spectrometer]]

===Energy dispersive spectrometry===
In [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy dispersive]] spectrometers (EDX or EDS), the detector allows the determination of the energy of the photon when it is detected. Detectors historically have been based on silicon semiconductors, in the form of lithium-drifted silicon crystals, or high-purity silicon wafers.

[[File:DmedxrfSiLiDetector.jpg|thumb|Figure 5: Schematic form of a Si(Li) detector]]

====Si(Li) detectors====
These consist essentially of a 3–5&amp;nbsp;mm thick silicon junction type p-i-n diode (same as PIN diode) with a bias of −1000 V across it. The lithium-drifted centre part forms the non-conducting i-layer, where Li compensates the residual acceptors which would otherwise make the layer p-type. When an X-ray photon passes through, it causes a swarm of electron-hole pairs to form, and this causes a voltage pulse. To obtain sufficiently low conductivity, the detector must be maintained at low temperature, and liquid-nitrogen cooling must be used for the best resolution. With some loss of resolution, the much more convenient Peltier cooling can be employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=667SJf95AFAC&amp;pg=PA559|page=559|title=Transmission electron microscopy: a textbook for materials science|volume=2|author=David Bernard Williams|author2=C. Barry Carter|publisher=Springer|date=1996|isbn=0-306-45324-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wafer detectors====
More recently, high-purity silicon wafers with low conductivity have become routinely available. Cooled by the [[Thermoelectric effect#Peltier effect|Peltier effect]], this provides a cheap and convenient detector, although the [[liquid nitrogen]] cooled Si(Li) detector still has the best resolution (i.e. ability to distinguish different photon energies).

====Amplifiers====
The pulses generated by the detector are processed by [[pulse-shaping]] amplifiers. It takes time for the amplifier to shape the pulse for optimum resolution, and there is therefore a trade-off between resolution and count-rate: long processing time for good resolution results in "pulse pile-up" in which the pulses from successive photons overlap. Multi-photon events are, however, typically more drawn out in time (photons did not arrive exactly at the same time) than single photon events and pulse-length discrimination can thus be used to filter most of these out. Even so, a small number of pile-up peaks will remain and pile-up correction should be built into the software in applications that require trace analysis. To make the most efficient use of the detector, the tube current should be reduced to keep multi-photon events (before discrimination) at a reasonable level, e.g. 5–20%.

====Processing====
Considerable computer power is dedicated to correcting for pulse-pile up and for extraction of data from poorly resolved spectra. These elaborate correction processes tend to be based on empirical relationships that may change with time, so that continuous vigilance is required in order to obtain chemical data of adequate precision.

====Usage====
[[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]] spectrometers are different from [[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|WDX]] spectrometers in that they are smaller, simpler in design and have fewer engineered parts, however the accuracy and resolution of EDX spectrometers are lower than for WDX.  EDX spectrometers can also use miniature X-ray tubes or gamma sources, which makes them cheaper and allows miniaturization and portability. This type of instrument is commonly used for portable quality control screening applications, such as testing toys for lead (Pb) content, sorting scrap metals, and measuring the lead content of residential paint. On the other hand, the low resolution and problems with low count rate and long dead-time makes them inferior for high-precision analysis. They are, however, very effective for high-speed, multi-elemental analysis. Field Portable XRF analysers currently on the market weigh less than 2&amp;nbsp;kg, and have limits of detection on the order of 2 parts per million of lead (Pb) in pure sand.

===Wavelength dispersive spectrometry===
In [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|wavelength dispersive]] spectrometers ([[WDX]] or [[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|WDS]]), the photons are separated by [[diffraction]] on a single crystal before being detected. Although wavelength dispersive spectrometers are occasionally used to scan a wide range of wavelengths, producing a spectrum plot as in EDS, they are usually set up to make measurements only at the wavelength of the emission lines of the elements of interest. This is achieved in two different ways:

*'''"Simultaneous" spectrometers''' have a number of "channels" dedicated to analysis of a single element, each consisting of a fixed-geometry crystal monochromator, a detector, and processing electronics. This allows a number of elements to be measured simultaneously, and in the case of high-powered instruments, complete high-precision analyses can be obtained in under 30 s. Another advantage of this arrangement is that the fixed-geometry monochromators have no continuously moving parts, and so are very reliable. Reliability is important in production environments where instruments are expected to work without interruption for months at a time. Disadvantages of simultaneous spectrometers include relatively high cost for complex analyses, since each channel used is expensive. The number of elements that can be measured is limited to 15–20, because of space limitations on the number of monochromators that can be crowded around the fluorescing sample. The need to accommodate multiple monochromators means that a rather open arrangement around the sample is required, leading to relatively long tube-sample-crystal distances, which leads to lower detected intensities and more scattering. The instrument is inflexible, because if a new element is to be measured, a new measurement channel has to be bought and installed.
*'''"Sequential" spectrometers''' have a single variable-geometry monochromator (but usually with an arrangement for selecting from a choice of crystals), a single detector assembly (but usually with more than one detector arranged in tandem), and a single electronic pack. The instrument is programmed to move through a sequence of wavelengths, in each case selecting the appropriate X-ray tube power, the appropriate crystal, and the appropriate detector arrangement. The length of the measurement program is essentially unlimited, so this arrangement is very flexible. Because there is only one monochromator, the tube-sample-crystal distances can be kept very short, resulting in minimal loss of detected intensity. The obvious disadvantage is relatively long analysis time, particularly when many elements are being analysed, not only because the elements are measured in sequence, but also because a certain amount of time is taken in readjusting the monochromator geometry between measurements. Furthermore, the frenzied activity of the monochromator during an analysis program is a challenge for mechanical reliability. However, modern sequential instruments can achieve reliability almost as good as that of simultaneous instruments, even in continuous-usage applications.

====Sample preparation====
In order to keep the geometry of the tube-sample-detector assembly constant, the sample is normally prepared as a flat disc, typically of diameter 20–50&amp;nbsp;mm. This is located at a standardized, small distance from the tube window. Because the X-ray intensity follows an inverse-square law, the tolerances for this placement and for the flatness of the surface must be very tight in order to maintain a repeatable X-ray flux. Ways of obtaining sample discs vary: metals may be machined to shape, minerals may be finely ground and pressed into a tablet, and glasses may be cast to the required shape. A further reason for obtaining a flat and representative sample surface is that the secondary X-rays from lighter elements often only emit from the top few micrometres of the sample. In order to further reduce the effect of surface irregularities, the sample is usually spun at 5–20 rpm. It is necessary to ensure that the sample is sufficiently thick to absorb the entire primary beam. For higher-Z materials, a few millimetres thickness is adequate, but for a light-element matrix such as coal, a thickness of 30–40&amp;nbsp;mm is needed.

[[File:dmbraggreflection.jpg|thumb|Figure 7: Bragg diffraction condition]]

====Monochromators====
The common feature of monochromators is the maintenance of a symmetrical geometry between the sample, the crystal and the detector. In this geometry the Bragg diffraction condition is obtained.

The X-ray emission lines are very narrow (see figure 2), so the angles must be defined with considerable precision. This is achieved in two ways:

*'''Flat crystal with Soller collimators'''
The Soller collimator is a stack of parallel metal plates, spaced a few tenths of a millimetre apart. To improve angle resolution, one must lengthen the collimator, and/or reduce the plate spacing. This arrangement has the advantage of simplicity and relatively low cost, but the collimators reduce intensity and increase scattering, and reduce the area of sample and crystal that can be "seen". The simplicity of the geometry is especially useful for variable-geometry monochromators.

[[File:dmwdxrfFlatXtalMonochrom.jpg|thumb|Figure 8: Flat crystal with Soller collimators]]
[[File:dmwdxrfCurvedXtalMonochrom.jpg|thumb|Figure 9: Curved crystal with slits]]

*'''Curved crystal with slits'''
The Rowland circle geometry ensures that the slits are both in focus, but in order for the Bragg condition to be met at all points, the crystal must first be bent to a radius of 2R (where R is the radius of the Rowland circle), then ground to a radius of R. This arrangement allows higher intensities (typically 8-fold) with higher resolution (typically 4-fold) and lower background. However, the mechanics of keeping Rowland circle geometry in a variable-angle monochromator is extremely difficult. In the case of fixed-angle monochromators (for use in simultaneous spectrometers), crystals bent to a logarithmic spiral shape give the best focusing performance. The manufacture of curved crystals to acceptable tolerances increases their price considerably.

====Analysis Lines====
The spectral lines used for chemical analysis are selected on the basis of intensity, accessibility by the instrument, and lack of line overlaps. Typical lines used, and their wavelengths, are as follows:

Other lines are often used, depending on the type of sample and equipment available.

====Crystals====

The desirable characteristics of a diffraction crystal are:
*High diffraction intensity
*High dispersion
*Narrow diffracted peak width
*High peak-to-background
*Absence of interfering elements
*Low thermal coefficient of expansion
*Stability in air and on exposure to X-rays
*Ready availability
*Low cost

Crystals with simple structure tend to give the best diffraction performance. Crystals containing heavy atoms can diffract well, but also fluoresce themselves, causing interference. Crystals that are water-soluble, volatile or organic tend to give poor stability.

Commonly used crystal materials include LiF (lithium fluoride), ADP (ammonium dihydrogen phosphate), Ge (germanium), graphite, InSb (indium antimonide), PE (''tetrakis''-(hydroxymethyl)-methane: penta-erythritol), KAP (potassium hydrogen phthalate), RbAP (rubidium hydrogen phthalate) and TlAP (thallium(I) hydrogen phthalate). In addition, there is an increasing use of "layered synthetic microstructures", which are "sandwich" structured materials comprising successive thick layers of low atomic number matrix, and monatomic layers of a heavy element. These can in principle be custom-manufactured to diffract any desired long wavelength, and are used extensively for elements in the range Li to Mg.

====Detectors====
Detectors used for wavelength dispersive spectrometry need to have high pulse processing speeds in order to cope with the very high photon count rates that can be obtained. In addition, they need sufficient energy resolution to allow filtering-out of background noise and spurious photons from the primary beam or from crystal fluorescence. There are four common types of detector:
*gas flow proportional counters
*sealed gas detectors
*scintillation counters
*semiconductor detectors

[[File:dmwdxrfFlowDetector.jpg|thumb|Figure 10: Arrangement of gas flow proportional counter]]
'''Gas flow proportional counters''' are used mainly for detection of longer wavelengths. Gas flows through it continuously. Where there are multiple detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane ("P10"), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5&amp;nbsp;nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionised by incoming X-ray photons, and the electric field multiplies this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or nichrome of 20–60 μm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to the ratio of the detector chamber diameter to the wire diameter, a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector. The window needs to be conductive, thin enough to transmit the X-rays effectively, but thick and strong enough to minimize diffusion of the detector gas into the high vacuum of the monochromator chamber. Materials often used are beryllium metal, [[Metallized polyethylene terephthalate|aluminised PET film]] and aluminised polypropylene. Ultra-thin windows (down to 1 μm) for use with low-penetration long wavelengths are very expensive. The pulses are sorted electronically by "pulse height selection" in order to isolate those pulses deriving from the secondary X-ray photons being counted.

'''Sealed gas detectors''' are similar to the gas flow proportional counter, except that the gas does not flow through it. The gas is usually krypton or xenon at a few atmospheres pressure. They are applied usually to wavelengths in the 0.15–0.6&amp;nbsp;nm range. They are applicable in principle to longer wavelengths, but are limited by the problem of manufacturing a thin window capable of withstanding the high pressure difference.

'''Scintillation counters''' consist of a scintillating crystal (typically of sodium iodide doped with thallium) attached to a photomultiplier. The crystal produces a group of scintillations for each photon absorbed, the number being proportional to the photon energy. This translates into a pulse from the photomultiplier of voltage proportional to the photon energy. The crystal must be protected with a relatively thick aluminium/beryllium foil window, which limits the use of the detector to wavelengths below 0.25&amp;nbsp;nm. Scintillation counters are often connected in series with a gas flow proportional counter: the latter is provided with an outlet window opposite the inlet, to which the scintillation counter is attached. This arrangement is particularly used in sequential spectrometers.

'''Semiconductor detectors''' can be used in theory, and their applications are increasing as their technology improves, but historically their use for WDX has been restricted by their slow response (see [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]]).

[[File:LDHerzogBeadMaking.jpg|thumb|A glass "bead" specimen for XRF analysis being cast at around 1100 °C in a Herzog automated fusion machine in a cement plant quality control laboratory. 1 (top): fusing, 2: preheating the mould, 3: pouring the melt, 4: cooling the "bead"]]

====Extracting analytical results====
At first sight, the translation of X-ray photon count-rates into elemental concentrations would appear to be straightforward: WDX separates the X-ray lines efficiently, and the rate of ''generation'' of secondary photons is proportional to the element concentration. However, the number of photons ''leaving the sample'' is also affected by the physical properties of the sample: so-called "[[matrix effects]]". These fall broadly into three categories:
*X-ray absorption
*X-ray enhancement
*sample macroscopic effects
All elements ''absorb'' X-rays to some extent. Each element has a characteristic absorption spectrum which consists of a "saw-tooth" succession of fringes, each step-change of which has wavelength close to an emission line of the element. Absorption attenuates the secondary X-rays leaving the sample. For example, the mass absorption coefficient of silicon at the wavelength of the aluminium Kα line is 50 m²/kg, whereas that of iron is 377 m²/kg. This means that a given concentration of aluminium in a matrix of iron gives only one seventh of the count rate{{clarify|reason=The use of the term "count rate" is confusing because absorption refers to radiation that is silently removed, not counted. The counting is done later. I would suggest "removal rate". Unless I have misunderstood and the silicon resp. iron is located in the detector?|date=July 2016}}  compared with the same concentration of aluminium in a silicon matrix. Fortunately, mass absorption coefficients are well known and can be calculated. However, to calculate the absorption for a multi-element sample, the composition must be known. For analysis of an unknown sample, an iterative procedure is therefore used. It will be noted that, to derive the mass absorption accurately, data for the concentration of elements not measured by XRF may be needed, and various strategies are employed to estimate these. As an example, in cement analysis, the concentration of oxygen (which is not measured) is calculated by assuming that all other elements are present as standard oxides.

'''Enhancement''' occurs where the secondary X-rays emitted by a heavier element are sufficiently energetic to stimulate additional secondary emission from a lighter element. This phenomenon can also be modelled, and corrections can be made provided that the full matrix composition can be deduced.

'''Sample macroscopic effects''' consist of effects of inhomogeneities of the sample, and unrepresentative conditions at its surface. Samples are ideally homogeneous and isotropic, but they often deviate from this ideal. Mixtures of multiple crystalline components in mineral powders can result in absorption effects that deviate from those calculable from theory. When a powder is pressed into a tablet, the finer minerals concentrate at the surface. Spherical grains tend to migrate to the surface more than do angular grains. In machined metals, the softer components of an alloy tend to smear across the surface. Considerable care and ingenuity are required to minimize these effects. Because they are artifacts of the method of sample preparation, these effects can not be compensated by theoretical corrections, and must be "calibrated in". This means that the calibration materials and the unknowns must be compositionally and mechanically similar, and a given calibration is applicable only to a limited range of materials. Glasses most closely approach the ideal of homogeneity and isotropy, and for accurate work, minerals are usually prepared by dissolving them in a borate glass, and casting them into a flat disc or "bead". Prepared in this form, a virtually universal calibration is applicable.

Further corrections that are often employed include background correction and line overlap correction. The background signal in an XRF spectrum derives primarily from scattering of primary beam photons by the sample surface. Scattering varies with the sample mass absorption, being greatest when mean atomic number is low. When measuring trace amounts of an element, or when measuring on a variable light matrix, background correction becomes necessary. This is really only feasible on a sequential spectrometer. Line overlap is a common problem, bearing in mind that the spectrum of a complex mineral can contain several hundred measurable lines. Sometimes it can be overcome by measuring a less-intense, but overlap-free line, but in certain instances a correction is inevitable. For instance, the Kα is the only usable line for measuring sodium, and it overlaps the zinc Lβ (L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) line. Thus zinc, if present, must be analysed in order to properly correct the sodium value.

==Other spectroscopic methods using the same principle==
It is also possible to create a characteristic secondary X-ray emission using other incident radiation to excite the sample:
*[[electron]] beam: [[electron microprobe]];
*[[ion]] beam: [[PIXE|particle induced X-ray emission]] (PIXE).
When radiated by an X-ray beam, the sample also emits other radiations that can be used for analysis:
*[[electron]]s ejected by the [[photoelectric effect]]: [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS), also called [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy|electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis]] (ESCA)
The de-excitation also ejects [[Auger electron]]s, but [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES) normally uses an electron beam as the probe.

[[Confocal|Confocal microscopy]] X-ray fluorescence imaging is a newer technique that allows control over depth, in addition to horizontal and vertical aiming, for example, when analysing buried layers in a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=326128&amp;jid=MAM&amp;volumeId=11&amp;issueId=S02&amp;aid=326127|journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis|date=2005|volume=11|page=682|doi=10.1017/S1431927605503167|title=Confocal X-ray Fluorescence Imaging and XRF Tomography for Three-Dimensional Trace Element Microanalysis|author=L.
