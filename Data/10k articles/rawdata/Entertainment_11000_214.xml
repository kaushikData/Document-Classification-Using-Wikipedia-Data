'''''100 Bloody Acres''''' is a 2012 Australian [[horror comedy]] film directed and written by brothers Colin and Cameron Cairnes.  [[Damon Herriman]] and [[Angus Sampson]] star as opportunistic, rural fertiliser manufacturers who resort to using human remains for their business.  It premiered at the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] on 4 August 2012, and it was released in the United States on 28 June 2013.

== Plot ==

Reg and Lindsay Morgan own and operate a small [[Meat and bone meal|blood and bone]] fertiliser business in country [[South Australia]]. While making local deliveries and the occasional roadkill pick up, Reg encounters the crash site of a van, the driver dead inside. Reg recovers the body from the crash and puts it in the back of his own truck. Making his way back to the brothers' plant, Reg is delayed again, this time by three tourists stuck on the side of the road: Sophie, a young woman; James, Sophie's boyfriend; and Wes, James' friend, with whom Sophie is having an affair. Reg takes an instant attraction to Sophie, and, against his better judgement, allows the three to ride with him.

Wes and James ride in the back of the truck with the hidden corpse, and Sophie rides up front with Reg. Sophie gets to know Reg, while James tells Wes that he plans to marry Sophie. The pair soon discover the corpse and fear for their lives. Sophie starts to find things in common with Reg, but Reg's anxiety gets the better of him. This unnerves Sophie, and, as soon as the truck arrives at the plant, Reg detains her. Lindsay arrives and demands to know what is going on. Reg suggests that they can grind the people into fertiliser, and Lindsay berates him for his lack of planning for such a bold crime. Ultimately, Lindsay agrees to Reg's idea, and it is revealed that the pair have ground humans in the past: in order to create a new formula for their fertiliser, the pair ground a group of charity volunteers who crashed and died in a nearby road accident.

Wes and James are soon detained with Sophie, and the trio watch as Reg and Lindsay grind the driver. At the last minute, Reg becomes convinced that the man is still alive and tries to save him, to no avail. When Wes cuts himself loose and escapes, Lindsay pursues him. Sophie takes advantage of the situation and attempts to seduce Reg, much to James' chagrin. Reg catches on to the ruse and exposes Sophie's infidelity with Wes, further angering James. Lindsay soon returns with Wes, accumulating the body of a local police officer along the way. Reg now begins to have serious second thoughts about the pair's actions. When Nancy, their elderly neighbour, surprises the brothers with a visit, Lindsay stuffs Reg in a car boot with Wes, cutting off Wes' hand in the process. Reg and Wes work together to escape, and Reg enters the house alone to confront his brother.

Reg overhears Lindsay tell Nancy that Reg has moved away, perhaps permanently. As Reg gathers his courage, Lindsay and Nancy begin to have sex. Severely disturbed, Reg decides instead to stealthily steal Lindsay's keys. As he is about to take them, Wes stumbles into the house, looking for his missing hand. In a fit of rage, Lindsay kills Wes and Nancy, and Reg flees with the keys. James and Sophie panic when they hear the gunshots, but Sophie decides to return to the farm when she hears Reg call out to her; James angrily breaks up with Sophie as she leaves. After a brief struggle, Lindsay overpowers and ties up Reg. As Lindsay prepares Reg for grinding, Sophie returns and distracts Lindsay. Reg is able to pull him in to the grinder, killing him; afterward, Sophie and Reg share a momentary attraction. In a post credits scene, James hysterically runs onto the road and is killed by a reckless driver.

'''59 Productions''' is an Olivier and Tony Award-winning design studio and production company with offices in London and New York. 

== Origins ==

59 Productions was founded in Edinburgh by Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer. Early projects included the video design for [[Stellar Quines Theatre Company]]'s ''Sweet Fanny Adams in Eden'' (2003),&lt;ref name=SFA&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweet Fanny Adams in Eden|url=http://www.stellarquines.com/productions/sweet-fanny-adams-in-eden/|work=Stellar Quines Theatre Company|accessdate=14 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the video design for the recently formed [[National Theatre of Scotland]]'s ''Roam'' (2006) and ''[[Black Watch (play)|Black Watch]]'' (2006), which featured in the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].&lt;ref name=NYT20071024&gt;{{cite news|last=Brantley|first=Ben|title=To Tell These War Stories, Words Aren't Enough|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/theater/reviews/24watch.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=24 October 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the success of the show, which won multiple awards at Edinburgh Festivals, a [[Critics' Circle Theatre Award]], a [[South Bank Sky Arts Award]], four [[Critics' Awards for Theatre in Scotland]], four [[Laurence Olivier Award]]s, and a [[New York Drama Critics' Circle Award]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for the National Theatre of Scotland|url=http://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/content/default.asp?page=s7_13|publisher=National Theatre of Scotland|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 59 Productions relocated to London, where they began a series of collaborations at the [[Royal National Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sears|first=Amelia|title=Interviews with the Creative Team|url=http://d1wf8hd6ovssje.cloudfront.net/documents/Some_trace_of_her_workpack.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=National Theatre Education|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing critics to say that the company had "created an entirely new art form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|title=Waves sets a high-water mark for multimedia theatre|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2006/dec/04/wavessetsahighwatermarkfo|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

59's Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer were part of the original creative team for ''[[War Horse (play)|War Horse]]'' in 2007, which went on to win six [[Laurence Olivier Award]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shenton |first=Mark |title=''Hairspray'' Wins Four 2008 Laurence Olivier Awards Including Best Musical |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/115735-Hairspray-Wins-Four-2008-Laurence-Olivier-Awards-Including-Best-Musical |accessdate=23 May 2014 |newspaper=Playbill |date=9 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324015047/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/115735-Hairspray-Wins-Four-2008-Laurence-Olivier-Awards-Including-Best-Musical |archivedate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in London and five [[Tony Award]]s for the subsequent production on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British play ''War Horse'' triumphs at Tony Awards|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/8571791/British-play-War-Horse-triumphs-at-Tony-Awards.html|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

59 Productions undertook its first [[opera]] in 2007 at the [[English National Opera]], providing the projection design for [[Philip Glass]]'s ''[[Satyagraha (opera)|Satyagraha]]'', directed by [[Phelim McDermott]] and designed by Julian Crouch of [[Improbable theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brieler|first=Philipp|title=The Art of Satyagraha|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/features/detail.aspx?customid=3469|publisher=The Metropolitan Opera|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first of several collaborations with Improbable theatre, including the design for the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s 125th Anniversary Gala in 2009, which raised more than $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Tommasini|title=A Gala of Singing and Nostalgia (Addio, Speeches)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/arts/music/17gala.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry584%23%2Fmetropolitan+opera+125th+anniversary+gala|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, 100 years to the day since [[William Boeing|William E. Boeing]] turned his attention to the thrilling and world-changing field of aviation, 59 Productions mounted an immersive show on a vast scale – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAc5KhXM_w The Boeing Centennial Projection Spectacular] – a celebration of the [[Boeing]] company's centenary, for more than 80,000 spectators, across 30 performances, at [[Boeing Field]] in [[Seattle]], Washington. The show featured an animated sequence projection-mapped onto the body of a [[Boeing 747]], telling the history of the iconic aircraft, as well as a specially commissioned soundtrack by composer, [[Jeff Beal|Jeff Beale]].

In 2017, the company developed and produced their first self-initiated production, an adaptation of [[Paul Auster]]'s [[City of Glass (Paul Auster book)|City of Glass]], written by [[Duncan Macmillan (playwright)|Duncan Macmillan]]. City of Glass was a co-production with the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Hammersmith]], [[HOME (Manchester)|HOME Manchester]] and Karl Sydow. The production was described by The Daily Telegraph as a "Neo-noir thriller that rewrites the rulebook for theatre design."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/neo-noir-rewrites-rulebook-city-glass-lyric-hammersmith-review/|title=Neo-noir thriller that rewrites the rulebook for theatre design - City of Glass, Lyric Hammersmith review|last=Allfree|first=Claire|date=2017-04-27|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, 59 Productions provided both set and projection design for [[The Last Ship (musical)|The Last Ship]], the [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] musical which tells the story of the shipbuilding industry in the North East of England. The production opened at [[Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne|Northern Stage]] before embarking on a UK tour. Other recent projects include the design of Marnie, an opera by [[Nico Muhly]] which transferred to the [[Metropolitan Opera]] after an initial run at the [[English National Opera]] in London. The company also designed large scale events in 2018 for both the BBC [[First Night of the Proms]] at [[Royal Albert Hall|The Royal Albert Hall]], and the [[Edinburgh International Festival]].

Alongside their work for the stage, 59 Productions also made two award-winning VR films in 2018, Grenfell: Our Home,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/grenfell-our-home-vr-documentary-parable-a3877406.html|title=A new VR documentary takes you inside Grenfell before the fire|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collaboration with [http://parableworks.com/ Parable] and [[Channel 4]] which won the Audience Award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sheffdocfest.com/articles/630-2018-doc-fest-award-winners|title=Sheffield Doc/Fest: Sheffield International Documentary Festival|website=sheffdocfest.com|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Sheffield Doc/Fest|Sheffield Doc Fest]] ; and Nothing To Be Written,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/vr-prom|title=BBC - The first ever Virtual Reality Prom - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned by the [[BBC]], winner of Best UK Experience at [[Raindance Film Festival|Raindance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.raindance.org/award-winners-raindance-gallery-of-immersive-stories-2018/|title=Award Winners - Raindance Immersive Stories 2018 - Raindance|date=2018-10-07|work=Raindance|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2018, their film collaboration with composer [[Eric Whitacre]] and [[NASA]], ''Deep Field'', premiered at [[Kennedy Space Center]]. 

Now employing 35 people worldwide, with offices in London and New York, 59 Productions works in set design, video projection design, exhibition and events design, film, theatre, and interactive production. The company expanded in 2016 to include an architecture department with a particular focus on design for performance environments, and an interest in developing forms of architectural expression which are fundamentally narratively led.

'''''A Steady Rain''''' is a play by Keith Huff. With a plot similar to a real-life event involving [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], it focuses on two [[Chicago]] policemen who inadvertently return a [[Vietnam]]ese boy to a [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]] who claims to be the child's uncle. When he later becomes the man's latest victim, the lifelong friendship of the two men is threatened when it becomes clear someone must bear responsibility for their egregious failure to assess the situation accurately. The play alternates between two separate monologues and present-moment dialogue scenes.

Following readings in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]], ''A Steady Rain'' was staged by [[Chicago Dramatists]] in 2007. It opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in September 2009.

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Chicago police officers Joey and Denny are longtime partners and best friends.  Joey is single and lonely, and Denny is married with children; but both men have flaws and serious problems.  Introverted Joey struggles with a drinking problem and secretly loves Denny's wife, Connie; angry tough-guy Denny can barely disguise his racism and cheats on Connie with a prostitute on his beat.

The two men offer contrasting descriptions to Internal Affairs interrogators of their harrowing experiences.  They relate how Walter Lorenz, a pimp that Denny has harassed over the years, shoots a bullet through Denny's front window, causing flying glass to sever an artery in Denny's son's neck.  Denny pursues Lorenz relentlessly, drawing Joey into a series of dangerous and incriminating activities.  During a domestic disturbance call, the two return a frightened Vietnamese boy to a man who says he is the boy's uncle.  The uncle turns out to be a cannibalistic serial killer, who eats the boy.

==Productions==
''A Steady Rain'' initially was produced by [[Chicago Dramatists]] in 2007 and then at the Royal George Theatre in [[Chicago]] in February 2008. It won the [[Joseph Jefferson Awards]] for Best New Work, Best Actor for Randy Steinmeyer, and Best Production.&lt;ref name=gans&gt;Gans, Andrew.

Following a number of staged and table readings and an [[off-Broadway]] [[workshop production]],&lt;ref name=CD&gt;[http://www.chicagodramatists.org/catalogue/detail.html?playid=1270#historydesc ''A Steady Rain'' at ChicagoDramatists.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001230354/http://www.chicagodramatists.org/catalogue/detail.html?playid=1270#historydesc |date=October 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the play began previews at the [[Schoenfeld Theatre]] on September 10, 2009 and opened officially on September 29. The 12-week engagement closed on December 6. Directed by [[John Crowley (director)|John Crowley]], it starred [[Hugh Jackman]] and [[Daniel Craig]], making his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut. Set and costume design was by [[Scott Pask]], with lighting design by [[Hugh Vanstone]].&lt;ref name=gans /&gt;  The producers announced that the show had broken the record for the highest weekly gross of a non-musical production on Broadway, with a weekly gross of $1,167,954 for the week ending September 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Itzkoff, Dave. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/a-steady-rain-sets-a-broadway-sales-record/?hp "''A Steady Rain'' Sets a Broadway Sales Record",] ''The New York Times'', September 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
In reviewing the original Chicago Dramatists production, Chris Jones of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called the play "a gritty, rich, thick, poetic and entirely gripping noir tale."&lt;ref name=CD /&gt;  Hedy Weiss of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote, "Huff provides [the actors] with enough fiery, superbly rendered, often deeply poetic speeches, enough mood shifts, enough emotional cataclysms and action-packed storytelling to keep this hallucinatory roller-coaster ride in motion. I would be happy to see this production again with an audience of real men in blue, just to take the temperature in the room."&lt;ref name=CD /&gt;

Steve Oxman of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed, "Keith Huff's crackerjack two-hander ... turns out to be less like the perpetual drizzle of its title and more like a snowball that builds to an avalanche. While Huff starts with a couple of familiar characters — [[good cop/bad cop]] Chicago patrolmen with alcohol and racism issues — he deepens them into complex figures, compellingly human even when at their most despicable. The adroit character development combines with a billowing narrative to deliver some rattling emotional crescendos....  While he could maybe pull back on a contrivance or two, the playwright smartly sticks to his conceit of piling one worse complication on top of another, effectively investing ''A Steady Rain'' with genuine dramatic power and a sense of true tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935158.html?categoryid=33&amp;cs=1 ''Variety'' review, October 22, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the Broadway production, [[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who was generally satisfied with the performances of Jackman and, especially, Craig, wrote, "If Mr. Huff has not managed to reweave this premise [childhood friends find themselves on opposite sides of the law and in love with the same woman] with any surprising threads, he has packed it with enough lurid incident to fill a season of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/theater/reviews/30steady.html?ref=theater "A Sentimental Journey Over Brutal Terrain",] ''The New York Times'', September 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Time magazine's [[Richard Zoglin]], naming it one of the Top 10 Plays of 2009 and ranking it at #2, commented that "Casting a couple of big movie stars in a Broadway play can cut both ways. Audiences may stand in line for tickets, but critics can put on their scowling "show-me" faces — as many did for Keith Huff's one-act play, which cast Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman as a pair of Chicago cops in crisis. Both stars were excellent, but they were wonderfully served by Huff's taut, tough-minded script, which takes potentially clichéd material — the moral challenges faced by cops on the urban mean streets — and makes it fresh and compelling."&lt;ref&gt;Zoglin, Richard. [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1945379_1943992_1944005,00.html?ref=“The Top 10 Everything of 2009”,] "Time", December 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
"Jackman allows you to feel both the warmth and the tyranny of Denny's love. A taller presence than Craig, he takes up more stage space physically and theatrically, which is just how it should be, given the way his character swaggers like the king of his own limited universe."
— LOS ANGELES TIMES&lt;ref&gt;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/09/theater-review-a-steady-rain-on-broadway-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

"Jackman does an excellent job playing a man who heedlessly jumps the median between superego and id, in the best tradition of the self-mythologizing American sociopath. The erstwhile X-man has never spelled danger, with or without muttonchops."

"Under John Crowley's direction, the two stars present the increasingly far-fetched tale with an amiable diffidence that lets them show you their acting ability, as each gets into his character's moments of personal pain, while carefully keeping the sordid events at a distance […] Jackman, with his wonderful easy fluidity, shows once again that he's a natural-born stage star."

'''''Agar.io'''''{{efn|Sometimes called or pronounced "agario" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ɡ|ɑːr|iː|oʊ|,_|ˈ|ɑː|-}}).}} is a [[Massively multiplayer online game|massively multiplayer online]] [[action game]] created by Matheus Valadares. Players control one or more [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in a map representing a [[Petri dish]]. The goal is to gain as much mass as possible by eating [[agar]] and cells smaller than the player's cell while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player's cells. Each player starts with one cell, but players can split a cell into two once it reaches a sufficient mass, allowing them to control multiple cells. The name comes from the substance [[agar]], used to culture bacteria.

The game was released to positive critical reception; critics particularly praised its simplicity, competition, and mechanics, while criticism targeted its repetitive gameplay. Largely due to [[word of mouth]] on social networks, it was a quick success, becoming one of the most popular web and mobile games in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/why-you-should-care-about-agario/|title=Why You Should Care About Agar.io|website=App Annie|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Steam (software)|Steam]] version was announced on 3 May 2015 (though never released as of 2018), and the mobile version of ''Agar.io'' for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] was released on 24 July 2015 by [[Miniclip]]. ''Agar.io'' has inspired similar web games called "[[.io]] games", including games with a similar objective but different characters, and games that incorporate elements of other genres like [[shooter game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Takahashi|first1=Dean|title=The surprising momentum behind games like Agar.io|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/02/11/the-surprising-momentum-behind-io-games-like-agar-io/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=5 May 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

The objective of ''Agar.io'' is to grow a cell on a [[Petri dish]] by swallowing both randomly generated pellets (agar), which slightly increases a cell's mass, and smaller cells, without being swallowed by larger cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eat and be eaten: How to survive and thrive in Agar.io|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/agario-game-guide/|publisher=[[Digital Trends]]|date=14 September 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The browser version currently holds five game modes: FFA (Free-For-All), Battle Royale, Teams, Experimental and Party. The mobile version of the game includes FFA (Free-For-All) and Rush Mode. The goal of the game is to obtain the largest cell; players must restart when all their cells are eaten. Players can change their cell's appearance with predefined words, phrases, symbols or skins.&lt;ref name="turkeypolitics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grayson|first1=Nathan|title=A Game That's Become A Political Battleground|url=http://kotaku.com/a-game-thats-become-a-political-battleground-1707084641|website=Kotaku (America)|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more mass a cell has, the slower it will move.&lt;ref name="pcgamer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Livingston|first1=Christopher|title=Agario: the dot-gobbling browser game that's a hit on Twitch|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/agario-the-dot-gobbling-browser-game-thats-a-hit-on-twitch/|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells gradually lose a small amount of mass over time.&lt;ref name="lemonde1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment battre vos collègues au jeu en ligne Agar.io|trans-title=How to beat your colleagues in the online game Agar.io|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2015/08/03/comment-battre-vos-collegues-au-jeu-en-ligne-agar-io_4709759_4408996.html|website=Le Monde|language=French}} "Enfin chaque joueur perd de la masse." ("Finally each player loses mass.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Viruses are green, spiky circles that split large cells. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but can also be generated when receiving enough mass, to the point of splitting into two, hence creating a new virus.&lt;ref name="lemonde2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment battre vos collègues au jeu en ligne Agar.io|trans-title=How to beat your colleagues in the online game Agar.io|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2015/08/03/comment-battre-vos-collegues-au-jeu-en-ligne-agar-io_4709759_4408996.html|website=Le Monde|language=French}} "Il doit composer avec les autres compétiteurs, mais aussi avec les virus, des boules de taille moyenne qui feront éclater les joueurs les plus gros en plusieurs morceaux, les laissant vulnérables ... Il est possible de faire se dupliquer les virus en leur tirant dessus plusieurs fois avec la touche W." ("They [the player] must deal with other competitors, but also with viruses, balls of medium size that split the biggest players into several pieces, leaving them vulnerable ... It is possible to duplicate viruses by shooting them several times with the W key.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Players can split their cell into two, and one of the two evenly divided cells will be flung in the direction of the cursor. This can be used as a ranged attack to shoot a cell in order to swallow other smaller cells or to escape an attack and move quickly around the map.&lt;ref name="theweek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Agar.io: a guide to the hit game&amp;nbsp;– and the best tips to win|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/64437/agario-what-is-the-hit-game-and-what-are-the-best-tips-to-win|website=The Week|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Split cells eventually merge back into one cell. Aside from feeding viruses, players can release a small fraction of their mass to feed other cells, an action commonly recognized as an intention to team with another player.&lt;ref name="lemonde3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment battre vos collègues au jeu en ligne Agar.io|trans-title=How to beat your colleagues in the online game Agar.io|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2015/08/03/comment-battre-vos-collegues-au-jeu-en-ligne-agar-io_4709759_4408996.html|website=Le Monde|language=French}} "Le plus gros est, par exemple, nourri par ses amis qui viennent volontairement se faire manger." ("The biggest are, for example, fed by their friends who come voluntarily to be eaten.")&lt;/ref&gt; However, a small portion of the ejected mass is lost.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agar.io/changelog.txt|title=changelog.txt|date=11 February 2017|access-date=26 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211223837/http://agar.io/changelog.txt|archivedate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can also spawn from ejected mass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Development==
''Agar.io'' was announced on [[4chan]] on 28 April 2015 by Matheus Valadares, a 19-year-old Brazilian developer.&lt;ref name="4chan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archived.moe/v/thread/292440446/|title=No.292440446|last1=Anonymous|first=|date=|website=4chan (archived by archived.moe)|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[JavaScript]] and [[C++]], the game was developed in a few days.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Efsane oyunun geliştiricisi ile kısa bir söyleşi yaptık|url=http://kafakutu.com/2015/05/13/efsane-gelistiricisi-ile-kisa-bir-soylesi-yaptik/|archivedate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game originally did not have a name, and users had to connect to Valadares' [[IP address]] in order to play. The name ''Agar.io'' was suggested by an anonymous user on 4chan, as other [[domain names]] such as cell.io were already taken.&lt;ref name="4chan" /&gt; Valadares continued updating and adding new features to the game, such as an [[Experience point|experience system]] and an "experimental" gamemode for testing experimental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.miniclip.com/2015/10/03/the-new-agar-io-mobile-update-whats-new/|title=The new Agar.io mobile update – what’s new?|work=Miniclip|date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, ''Agar.io'' entered [[Steam Greenlight]] with Valadares announcing a future [[free-to-play]] version of the game for download. He planned to include features in the Steam version not available in the browser version, including additional gamemodes, custom styling, and an account system. It was approved for listing on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] due to community interest.&lt;ref name="steamgreenlight"&gt;{{cite web|title = Steam Greenlight: Agar.io|url = http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=436491794&amp;searchtext=agar.io|publisher = [[Steam (software)|Steam]]|accessdate = 16 June 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150618085953/http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=436491794&amp;searchtext=agar.io|archivedate = 18 June 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game was eventually removed from the Greenlight program (the Greenlight program its self shut down in 2016), and was never released.

On 24 July 2015, [[Miniclip]] published a mobile version of ''Agar.io'' for iOS and Android. Sergio Varanda, head of mobile at Miniclip, explained that the main goal of the mobile version was to "recreate the gaming experience" on mobile, citing the challenges with recreating the game on touchscreen controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Scott|title=Agar.io: can the Play Store’s top game continue to grow?|url=https://www.androidpit.com/agario-interview-will-the-play-store-s-top-game-eat-the-world|website=AndroidPit|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Agar.io'' was released to a positive critical reception. Particular praise was given to the simplicity, competition, and mechanics of the game. ''[[Engadget]]'' described the game as "a good abstraction of the fierce survival-of-the-fittest competition that you sometimes see on the microscopic level."&lt;ref name="engadget"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fingas|first1=Jon|title=Agar.io brings massively multiplayer games to the Petri dish|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/01/agar-io/|website=Engadget|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Toucharcade'' praised its simplicity, strategic element, and "personality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Chris|title='Agar.io' Review&amp;nbsp;– The Amoeba Boys (and Girls)|url=http://toucharcade.com/2015/07/28/agario-review/|website=Toucharcade|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism was mainly targeted towards its repetitiveness and the controls of the mobile version. Tom Christiansen of ''Gamezebo'' was mixed on the game, saying that there was "nothing to hold my attention" and that it was "highly repetitive, overall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christiansen|first1=Tom|title=Agar.io Review: Bursting Your Bubble|url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2015/07/14/agar-io-review-bursting-bubble/|website=Gamezebo|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'', reviewing the mobile version, described its controls as "floaty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Glen|title=Agar.io review|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Agario/review.asp?c=66459|website=[[Pocket Gamer]]|publisher=Steel Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it was frequently propagated through social media and broadcast on [[Twitch.tv]]&lt;ref name="pcgamer" /&gt; and [[YouTube]],&lt;ref name="unocero"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Matuk|first1 = Pablo|title = Agar.io, el nuevo y sencillo juego de moda|trans-title=Agar.io, the new and simple game in fashion|url = https://www.unocero.com/2015/07/31/agar-io-el-nuevo-y-sencillo-juego-de-moda/|website = Unocero|accessdate = 7 August 2015|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Agar.io'' was a quick success. The agar.io website (for the browser version) was ranked by [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] as one of the 1,000 most visited websites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=agar.io Site Overview |url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/agar.io |website=Alexa Internet |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6b7qezt0q?url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/agar.io |archivedate=28 August 2015 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mobile versions were downloaded more than ten million times during their first week.&lt;ref name="conquer"&gt;{{cite web|title = How Agari.io conquered the App Store, without spending a penny|url = http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/Agario/news.asp?c=66717|website = Pocket Gamer|accessdate = 6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2015, ''Agar.io'' was [[Google Search|Google]]'s most searched video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/agario-fallout-4-mortal-kombat-x-googles-most-searched-games-2015-1494086|title=Agar.io, Fallout 4, Mortal Kombat X in Google's most searched games in 2015|work=International Business Times|date=22 December 2015|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Google's second-most searched game in the United States in 2016.&lt;ref name="MostGoogled2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4599919/these-were-the-most-googled-video-games-of-2016/|title=These Were the Most-Googled Video Games of 2016|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Alex|date=13 December 2016|website=Time|access-date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 press release by ''Miniclip'' stated that ''Agar.io'' was listed as the fifth top game on YouTube’s list of top games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corporate.miniclip.com/press_release/agar-io-is-5-on-youtube-list-of-top-games/|title=Agar.io is #5 on YouTube’s list of top games|website=coporate.miniclip.com|date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaigns of the [[Turkish general election, June 2015|June 2015 Turkish elections]], ''Agar.io'' was used in [[Turkey]] as a medium of political advocacy; many players were naming their cells after Turkish political parties and references, with alliances formed between players with similar political views, battling against other players with opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web game becomes latest battlefield in Turkish politics|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/web-game-becomes-latest-battlefield-in-turkish-politics.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=83041&amp;NewsCatID=338|date=27 May 2015|website=Hurriyet Daily News|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some political parties have used ''Agar.io'' in campaign posters as a symbol of support.&lt;ref name="turkeypolitics" /&gt;

''Agar.io'' was featured (including some details of its gameplay as well as a shot of an actual game) in "Chapter 48" of [[Netflix]] TV-series ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.de/miniclip-agario-house-of-cards-season-4-frank-underwood-48-2016-3?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=Miniclip's Agar.io features in 'House of Cards' season 4|date=4 March 2016|work=Business Insider Deutschland|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its gameplay was compared to the presidential campaigning.

''Slither.io'' is a [[Massively multiplayer online game|massively multiplayer]] [[browser game]] developed by Steve Howse.

'''''Alligator II: The Mutation''''' is a 1991 American [[direct-to-video]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Jon Hess (director)|Jon Hess]]. It is a sequel to the 1980 film ''[[Alligator (film)|Alligator]]''.

==Plot==
Deep in the sewers beneath the city of Regent Park, another baby alligator feeds on the experimental animals discarded by Future Chemicals Corporation. Nourished by toxic growth hormones and other mutating chemicals, the gator grows immense in size, develops a voracious appetite and goes out on a killing spree. Nobody believes the sightings until a large number of people are killed, and the police eventually embark on a search-and-destroy mission to put a stop to the alligator's murderous rampage. They track it down to a lake and a police helicopter attempts to blow the alligator up, but to no avail. Afterwards, two officers enter a marsh area where the alligator had escaped to. One of the officers uses a [[rocket launcher]] and ends the alligator's reign of terror.

==Reception==
The film has received negative reception, with some critics considering it a retread of the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wingrove |first=David |title=Science Fiction Film Source Book |location=Harlow |publisher=Longman |year=1985 |isbn=0-582-89310-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the original film, [[Kim Newman]] of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' noted that "''Alligator II: The Mutation'' is less a sequel than a lackluster remake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Newman |first=Kim |date=1 January 2000 |title=Alligator Review |url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/alligator/review/ |publisher=Empire |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almar Haflidason of [[BBC Online]] wrote that the film lacked "the wit and indeed the scares of the original".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/02/10/alligator_2_se_2003_dvd_review.shtml |title=BBC - Films - review - Alligator II - The Mutation SE DVD (1991) |location=BBC Online |date=24 September 2014 |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3617">'''Antonio Denzio''' (23 September 1689 – after 1763) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[impresario]], [[tenor]], and [[librettist]]. Born in [[Venice]] to a family of musicians and operatic personnel, he pursued a career mainly as a singer until 1724, when he traveled to [[Bohemia]] as a member of the opera company of Antonio Maria Peruzzi, probably his uncle. Peruzzi had the idea of bringing an Italian opera company to central Europe to perform first in [[Prague]], then [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]]. The company was first brought to Bohemia under the patronage of Count [[Franz Anton von Sporck]], who had it play at his palace at [[Kuks]] in northwest Bohemia in the summer of 1724. The performances were so successful that he permitted the company to perform free of charge in his palace in [[Prague]]. After disagreements with Peruzzi, Denzio was able to supplant him as impresario before the end of the year 1724 and continued productions in the Sporck palace until 1735. Peruzzi left with some of the Peruzzi-Denzio players to found the [[Breslau Opera]]. Denzio's opera theater at Sporck's palace was the first standing opera theater in the city. His productions were popular with the Bohemian nobility until about 1729, after which Denzio's finances deteriorated. Count Sporck provided no financial assistance to the company except the free use of his theater, and he allowed it to fail. The company went bankrupt and Denzio was forced to spend time in [[debtors' prison]]. During its heyday, Denzio was able to attract at least one of the principal singing stars in Italy to Prague each season. The most prominent of all was [[Margherita Gualandi]], who was forced to come to Prague after being [[Blackballing|blackballed]] in Italy for bad behavior. Denzio sought the assistance of [[Antonio Vivaldi]] in engaging singers for his company, and the composer sent music. In the early 1730s, Vivaldi came himself to Prague. Some of the music for one of his operas composed for Prague, ''[[Argippo]]'', has only recently been re-discovered.

Isolated as he was from his operatic base of Venice, Denzio was forced to become a theatrical [[wikt:jack of all trades|jack-of-all-trades]]. He sang himself in the company's productions and also served as its poet. He wrote several full-length librettos, the most significant of which was ''[[La pravità castigata]]'' (1730), the earliest opera based on the [[Don Juan]] tale to use the original setting and characters.

After returning briefly to Venice in 1735, Denzio tried again to mount opera companies in northern Europe, including in [[Brussels]] and [[Augsburg]]. Unfortunately, all of these ventures failed. The last record of him comes from a newspaper announcement published in [[Moscow]] in 1763.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">The theatre YUĞ was established in 1989 under the auspices of the Azerbaijan State Academic National Drama Theatre by Vagif Ibrahimoglu and Hasanaga Turabov. In 1992, the theatre got the status of ‘a state theatre’. &lt;ref&gt;[http://azteatr.musigi-dunya.az/file?id=88&amp;dt=1739 azteatr.musigi] Foundation of the theatre
&lt;/ref&gt;
According to its creators, the [[name]] of the theatre carries a meaning: YUĞ means ‘an old [[rite]]’. Everything, however, is more complicated as it seems, because this burial ritual during which were played the scenes from the life of the deceased, symbolizes a return to the memory. The actors try reminding the spectators of what they knew, maybe even in their past lives, but just forgot.&lt;ref&gt;Theatres, Cinemas, Concert Halls of Baku: Azerbaijan State Theatre "Yuğ"— National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017.  &lt;/ref&gt;

The main principle of this avant-garde theatre is the relevance of chosen topics, non-standard interpretation of familiar stories and experimenting with new forms. During its history, the Azerbaijan State Theatre YUĞ has staged more than 90 plays. The theatre’s troupe participated in many [[international]] [[festival]]s. Today the theatre YUĞ occupies a place in the theatre art of the country. It regularly stages plays by [[William Shakespeare]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Kōbō Abe]], as well as [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] classical and [[contemporary]] authors.&lt;ref&gt;Theatres, Cinemas, Concert Halls of Baku: Azerbaijan State Theatre "Yuğ"— National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Going beyond its space, the theatre YUĞ often collaborates with theatres of different countries, while enriching its skills and influencing the culture of others. The repertoire of the theatre includes the following performances: “Unforgettable Efendi” based on the play by the national writer Ilyas Efendiyev, “Hello from Kafka” based on the novel “The Verdict” by F.Kafka, “The first act” based on the Chekhov’s play “The Cherry Orchard”, “The Shadow” based on the works Y.Nil “Love Under the Elm-tress”, “Come all who….” and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yugteatr.org/|title=YUGTEATR - Fine About Fashion and Decorations|website=yugteatr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the theatre hosted the premiere of the play “Unknown Akhundzade” staged on the basis of comedies of the Azerbaijani playwright and enlightener [[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]] and his philosophical [[treatise]] “The three letters of the Indian Prince Kemakud-Dowle to the Persian Prince Jalal-ud-Dowle”.
Each season, the theatre offers new plays, tells us about new theatre personalities, some of whom determine the image of contemporary Azerbaijani theatre.

Like the earlier ''[[comédie en vaudeville]]'' and the later ''[[Singspiel]]'', its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were '[[opera]]s' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported ''[[opera seria]]''.   Music critic [[Peter Gammond]] describes the ballad opera as "an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song."&lt;ref name="gammond"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Peter| last1= Gammond| year= 1991| title= The Oxford Companion to Popular Music| publisher= Oxford University Press| location= Oxford| pages=35–36 | isbn= 0-19-311323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest ballad operas==
Ballad opera has been called an "eighteenth-century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene."&lt;ref name=Lubbock&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.

It is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728.&lt;ref&gt;J. Milling, P. Thomson, J. W. Donohue, eds, ''The Cambridge History of British Theatre: 1660 to 1895'' / edited by Joseph Donohue (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[Johann Christoph Pepusch]], both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in [[Paris]], and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form.  They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas D'Urfey]] (1653–1723) who had a reputation for [[parody music|fitting new words to existing songs]]; [[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy|a popular anthology of these settings]] was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "D'Urfey, Thomas".&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in ''The Beggar's Opera''.

After the success of ''The Beggar's Opera'', many similar pieces were staged.  The actor [[Thomas Walker (actor)|Thomas Walker]], who played [[Macheath]] in the original production, wrote several ballad operas,&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt; and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, ''Polly''.  [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], [[Charles Coffey]], [[Thomas Arne]], [[Charles Dibdin]], Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref name=Lubbock/&gt; By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WarwickWest1992&gt;J. Warwick and E. West, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics—in ''The Beggar's Opera'' the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir [[Robert Walpole]]. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning—as was the case with Gay's successor to ''The Beggar's Opera'', ''Polly''.

The tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern "[[jukebox musical]]"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including [[folk music|folk melodies]], popular airs by classical composers (such as [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]) and even children's [[nursery rhymes]]. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London [[broadside (music)|broadside ballad]]s are set. It is from this connection that the term "ballad opera" is drawn. This ragbag of [[Parody music|"pre-loved" music]] is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms.  Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as "[[Lillibullero]]", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;  In 1762, Thomas Arne's ''[[Love in a Village]]'' presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's ''Lionel and Clarissa'' in 1768.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;

''[[The Disappointment]]'' (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera.

==Singspiel connection==
In 1736 the [[Prussia]]n ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, ''The Devil to Pay'', by [[Charles Coffey]]. This was successfully performed in [[Hamburg]], [[Leipzig]] and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and [[Johann Adam Hiller]] in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]) "the fathers of the German Singspiel". (The storyline of ''The Devil to Pay'' was also adapted for [[Gluck]] for his 1759 French opera ''[[Le diable à quatre (opera)|Le diable à quatre]]'').

==Pastoral ballad opera ==
A later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more "pastoral" form. In subject matter, especially, these "ballad operas" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) ''The Beggar's Opera'', the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]]'s ''Love in a Village'', and [[William Shield]]'s ''Rosina'' (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas.

Later in the century broader comedies such as [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''The Duenna'' and the innumerable works of [[Charles Dibdin]] moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera.

==19th century==
English 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of "serious" practitioners such as [[John Barnett]]. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert's]] contribution to the [[Savoy opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walbrook|first=H. M.|year=1922|title=Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment|url=http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/index.html|location=|accessdate=24 June 2009|publisher=F. V. White &amp; Co.

==20th century==
''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1928) is a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original—all the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera.

In a completely different vein, ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'', an [[opera]] in two acts by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a "ballad opera". It is plainly much closer to [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' than to ''The Beggar's Opera''.

In the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called "ballad operas". [[Alan Lomax]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Burl Ives]], and others recorded ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy]] and others recorded ''The Transports'' in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric ''Beggar's Opera'' type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term.

Ironically, it is in the [[Musical theatre|musicals]] of [[Kander and Ebb]]—especially ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''—that the kind of satire embodied in ''The Beggar's Opera'' and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century.

The '''Canadian Clowning''' technique is a mask-based style of performance created by [[Richard Pochinko]].&lt;ref&gt;"Canadian clown theatre goes to a whole new level". ''[[Victoria Times-Colonist]]'', March 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the "Pochinko Method" or "Clown Through Mask", seven [[Mask|masks]] are used, each representing one of the six physical directions (North, South, East, West, Above-above and Below-below). The final, seventh, mask is the [[clown]] nose. Variations include a three-mask technique (based on the three polarities) and a six-in-one mask technique.

Pochinko taught clowning as a sort of "reverse therapy", in which instead of ridding oneself of anxieties, the clown performer leans into their own insecurities and foibles in order to package them as comedy. "Get applauded for your idiosyncrasies" was one of his key mottos as a trainer.&lt;ref name=laughingmatter/&gt; According to [[Mump and Smoot|Michael "Mump" Kennard]], one of the most prominent practitioners and trainers of Canadian clowning since Pochinko's death in 1989, "Clowns should be fun no matter what the topic is, but the comedy has to come from the tragedy. You just can't go out and be funny all the time. It has no meaning. It still has to be real, because if it's not real, the audience has nothing to relate to."&lt;ref name=terrors&gt;"Real terrors influence the clowns of horror". ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', January 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most clowning techniques (Eastern, European, etc.) focus on basic structure and formalism as the basis from which to start story creation. The Pochinko Clown begins by focusing on one's personal naturally-occurring emotions and impulses, and then structuring that creative licence into a story and performance.&lt;ref name=laughingmatter&gt;"Clowning is no laughing matter". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', November 6, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant distinctions between Pochinko's "Canadian clown" technique and other clowning traditions is that Pochinko drew on [[First Nations]] performance traditions.&lt;ref name=laughingmatter/&gt;

Noted students of the Pochinko technique have included [[Karen Hines]], Cheryl Cashman, [[Mump and Smoot]], Nion, [[Tantoo Cardinal]], Sue Morrison and [[Sara Tilley]].

The '''Cinema of Portugal''' started with the birth of the medium in the late 19th century. Cinema was introduced in Portugal in 1896 with the screening of foreign films and the first Portuguese film was ''[[Saída do Pessoal Operário da Fábrica Confiança]]'', made in the same year. The first [[movie theater]] opened in 1904 and the first scripted Portuguese film was ''[[O Rapto de Uma Actriz]]'' (1907). The first all-talking [[sound film]], ''[[A Severa (film)|A Severa]]'', was made in 1931. Starting in 1933, with ''[[A Canção de Lisboa]]'', the Golden Age would last the next two decades, with films such as ''[[O Pátio das Cantigas]]'' (1942) and ''[[A Menina da Rádio]]'' (1944). ''[[Aniki-Bóbó]]'' (1942), [[Manoel de Oliveira]]'s first feature film, marked a milestone, with a realist style predating [[Italian neorealism]] by a few years. In the 1950s the industry stagnated. The early 1960s saw the birth of the ''Cinema Novo'' (literally "New Cinema") movement, showing realism in film, in the vein of Italian neorealism and the [[French New Wave]], with films like ''[[Dom Roberto]]'' (1962) and ''[[Os Verdes Anos]]'' (1963). The movement became particularly relevant after the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974. In 1989, [[João César Monteiro]]'s ''[[Recordações da Casa Amarela]]'' won the [[Silver Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and in 2009, [[João Salaviza]]'s ''[[Arena (2009 film)|Arena]]'' won the [[Short Film Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Several other Portuguese films have been in competition for major film awards like the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Golden Bear]]. ''[[João Sete Sete]]'' (2006) was the first Portuguese animated feature film. Portuguese cinema is significantly supported by the State, with the government's [[Instituto do Cinema e do Audiovisual]] giving films financial support.

==Silent films==
Portuguese film history began on 18 June 1896, at the Real Colyseu da Rua da Palma nº 288, in [[Lisbon]], when [http://www.victorian-cinema.net/rousby.htm Edwin Rousby] presented [http://www.victorian-cinema.net/paul.htm Robert William Paul]'s Animatograph, using a [http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10296471 Teatrograph] projector. This places the debut of film in Portugal around six months after the [[Lumière brothers]]' inaugural presentation in Paris.

=== The early days ===

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] audience was familiar with photographic projection, first from [[cyclorama]]s, [[dioramas]] and [[stereoscopic]] views and, later, from the [[magic lantern]], with the projection of transparent photographs through a glass plate then coloured. On 28 December 1894, the German photographer Carlos Eisenlohr opened his "Imperial Exhibition" at the galleries of the Avenida Palace Hotel. He presented a novelty to this already knowledgeable Lisbon audience: the live photograph – shown not through an [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] [[Kinetograph]], as announced at the time, but by the Elektrotachyscop or Schnellseher, also called the Electro-Tachiscópio Eisenlohr, an invention by [[Ottomar Anschutz]]. The device projected images of actions, of a dog passing by or the galloping of a horse, contained in small disks that produced moving images of extremely short periods.

In the beginning of 1895, the tobacco shop Tabacaria Neves presented Edison's [[Kinetoscope]] (in fact, a copy of said invention, built in London by [[Robert William Paul]], ordered by the Greek George Georgiades, who presented the machine in Lisbon). Unlike preceding inventions, the Kinestoscope allowed individual viewing and a film made up of 1,380 photographs enabling a 20-second projection of 20 seconds.

The machine that was used for movies at the Real Colyseu was not the Lumiére brothers' [[Cinematograph]], but a competitor, the [[Theatrograph]], by Robert W. Paul. The machine projected behind the screen, allowing life-size images to appear for about a minute. The first presentation of it was well-received and in the following months, many of the same machines swirled in the cinemas of Lisbon, vying for the favour of movie audiences.

At the Real Colyseu of the Rua da Palma of António Santos Júnior, on 18 June 1896, Edwin Rousby showed films by Robert William Paul's production house, for whom Rousby worked. About a minute in length each, these "animated views" were shot by operators who worked for the British producer: "Parisian balls", "The [[Pont Neuf]] in Paris", "The Train", "The Serpentine Dance", "A Barber and Shoeshine Store in [[Washington DC|Washington]]".

Rousby then met Manuel Maria da Costa Veiga, a photographer with electrical and mechanical skills, who assisted him in preparing his sessions. Costa Veiga himself began acting as an exhibitor, acquiring a projectoscope from Edison that same year and showing films in Lisbon venues.

Robert W. Paul also sent his operator Henry Short to southern Europe, to record the animated views of landscapes for use by the English producing house. Short passed through Portugal, registering several views that, although destined to be shown in London, would be integrated into Rousby's program at his Portuguese sessions in 1897.

His success is overwhelming, and he prolonged his stays in Portugal and increased the sessions.  However, when Rousby proceeded with his tour to the Teatro-Circo Príncipe Real, in [[Oporto]], the animated photograph also gained a professional who would go on to found Portuguese cinema: [[Aurélio da Paz dos Reis]]. [[Image:Aprfabrica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Saída do Pessoal da Fábrica Confiança'', the first Portuguese film, by Aurélio Paz dos Reis]]
From July to August, Rousby presented his films at the Teatro do Príncipe Real (now the Teatro Sá da Bandeira), without achieving, however, the level of success in Lisbon.

=== The pioneers and the producing houses ===

Three years after beginning his exhibition business, Costa Veiga purchased a movie camera and made first film, ''Aspectos da Praia de Cascais'' ("Views of the Cascais beach"), with images of [[Carlos I of Portugal|King D. Carlos]] bathing in [[Cascais]]. He began recording official visits and other relevant national political events. He founded the first Portuguese production house, Portugal Film, headquartered close to his home in [[Algés Parish|Algés]].

In 1909, Portugália Film, made up of João Freire Correia and Manuel Cardoso, was established in Lisbon, financed by D. Nuno de Almada, and the "Empresa Cinematográfica Ideal," Júlio Costa. Freire Correia, a photographer, bought a projector for the opening of the Salão Ideal ao Loreto in 1904, the first Portuguese cinema. He founded his production company five years later, for which he'd make several films, including ''Batalha de Flores'' ("Battle of Flowers") that garnered vast success. He was also the cinematographer of ''O Rapto de Uma Actriz ''("The kidnapping of an Actress")'','' the first scripted Portuguese film, directed by Lino Ferreira in 1907.

Freire Correia directed two documentaries of significant success in 1909: ''A Cavalaria Portuguesa'' ("The Portuguese Cavalry") and the ''O Terramoto de Benavente'' ("The Earthquake of Benavente"). The first already showed some technique of image capturing, displaying the prowess of Portuguese cavalry in such a way to create a sense of danger, however fictitious, to the audience. The earthquake was filmed in April, and shown two days later – a remarkable speed – and 22 copies were exported abroad. He would also be responsible for the production of two versions of ''Os Crimes de Diogo Alves'' ("The Crimes of Diogo Alves"), whose direction he entrusted first to Lino Ferreira in 1909 but that remained incomplete, and a second with João Tavares directing one in 1911.

Early notable attempts at sound films include the incomplete ''Grisette'' (1908) directed by Freire Correia used adaptations of the [[Léon Gaumont|Gaumont]] method by which he attempted to synchronise image and sound. Portugália also produced the first film adaptation of a literary work: ''Carlota Ângela'' was based in the work of the same name by [[Camilo Castelo Branco]] and was directed by João Tavares, in 1912.

Júlio Costa, partnering with João Almeida, acquired the Salão Ideal from Freire Correia and Nuno Almada in 1908 and started the Empresa Cinematográfica Ideal production and distribution house. Remodelled and appropriately refitted, the Salão Ideal presented a predecessor of the [[talkies]], the "Animatógrafo Falado" (Spoken [[Animatograph]]), where a group of people read the script and produced sound in synch with the film's projection. The group was made up of volunteer firefighters of [[Ajuda]], of which not only Júlio Costa but also [[António Silva (actor)|António Silva]], the actor of the Portuguese Golden Age comedies, were members.

While waiting for the construction of his studio at Rua Marquês Ponte de Lima, Júlio Costa began filming "views". He begins filming features with ''Chantecler Atraiçoado'' ("Chantecler Betrayed") and then with ''Rainha depois de Morta'' ("Queen After Dead"), by Carlos Santos, the first Portuguese film with a historic motif. Júlio Costa's company pioneered grouping, production, distribution and exhibition, together for the first time. The company would halt activity after a suspicious fire.

In 1918, Lusitânia Film was founded, a production company with an ambitious outlook, led by Celestino Soares and Luís Reis Santos. They remodelled the old Portugália Film studio, in [[São Bento (Porto de Mós)|São Bento]], and began filming documentaries. The same year, two short films are made outdoors by Costa Veigam, directed by the young [[Leitão de Barros]]: ''Malmequer'' ("Daisy") and ''Mal de Espanha'' ("Evil From Spain"). The shooting of ''[[O Homem dos Olhos Tortos]]'' ("The Man with the Twisted Eyes") began, the story based on a Reinaldo Ferreira police serial and directed by Leitão de Barros. However, due to financial pressures, the film was never completed. A well-organized conspiracy would close down the company that intended to film ''[[A Severa (film)|A Severa]]'' as its next production.

After the closing of the "cycle of Lisbon", the first Oporto production house was founded, which ensured for some years the continuous production of cinema in the country.

=== Foreign cinematographers ===

After founding a production company bearing his name in 1910, the Oporto exhibitor Nunes de Mattos, added Invicta Film to its corporate name two years later. The company filmed current events and documentaries, among them ''O Naufrágio do [[Silurian]]'' ("The Sinking of the Silurian"), of which 108 copies were shipped to Europe. In November 1917, de Mattos founded the second "Invicta Film, Lda", increasing the number of partners and equity. Henrique Alegria took over [[art direction]] and they acquired the Quinta da Prelada, in Oporto, where the studios and laboratories of the producer were built.

In 1918 they left for Paris, and brought back a technical team from the [[Pathé]] studios led by Georges Pallu, a director who would author virtually all the feature films of the Oporto producing house. Also in the team were André Lecointe, architect-decorator; Albert Durot, camera operator and Georges and Valentine Coutable – the couple who would be, respectively, the chief lab and chief editor. Durot would later be replaced by Maurice Laumann, also from Pathé.

For six years, Invicta Film produced several films and documentaries, enriching the Portuguese film landscape. In 1924, however, the company experienced severe financial distress, leading to the laying off all its personnel and continuing only lab work. They shut down in 1928.

Rino Lupo, another milestone of cinematography, showed up on the scene through Pallu, who approved his direction of ''Mulheres da Beira'' ("Women from Beira"), after a tale by [[Abel Botelho]], with photography by Artur Costa de Macedo. Though the financial disagreements and the unfulfilment of deadlines forced his removal from the company, Lupo still directed ''Os Lobos'' ("The Wolves"), another pearl of the Portuguese silent cinema. He directed others, but without the quality of his earlier works.

Three other companies are set up in the '20s to fill in the studios gap: Caldevilla Film, Fortuna Film and Pátria Film. These also follow the Portuguese pattern, hiring foreign technicians for their experience in Portuguese productions. Although the directors brought from French production houses were presented as recognised stars in their countries, in fact, they often built their careers without having the claimed background.

Raul de Caldevilla founded in 1920 his Caldevilla Film, placing production in Lisbon, at Quinta das Conchas, in [[Lumiar]]. Frenchman Maurice Mariaud was the director chosen for the works ''Os Faroleiros'' ("The Lighthouse Men") and ''As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor'' ("The Wards of the Dean"), for the studio's only two productions. The company would shut down due to an acute financial disagreement among its partners.

Virgínia de Castro e Almeida, a children's book writer, founded in Lisbon the studio Fortuna Film, and hires a French lawyer, [[Roger Lion]], to direct productions based upon her books. Lion brought along his wife, actress Gil-Clary, Maxudian, and the cameramen Daniel Quintin and Marcel Bizot, and they shoot ''A Sereia de Pedra'' ("The Stone Mermaid") and ''Olhos da Alma'' ("Eyes of the Soul"), the latter shot in [[Nazaré (film)|Nazaré]], in what was its first screen register.

Henrique Alegria left Invicta Film in 1922, to found Pátria Film with Raul Lopes Freire. They bought Quinta das Conchas, where Maurice Mariaud directs ''O Fado''. This company too would cease to operate after shooting ''Aventuras de Agapito – Fotografia Comprometedora'' ("Adventures of Agapito – Compromising Photograph"), the fourth film directed by Roger Lion in Portugal.

=== The new generation ===

At the end of the twenties, the "young Turks" begin the era of the cinema estates, with the return of [[Leitão de Barros]] and the emergence of young [[António Lopes Ribeiro]] (who would soon launch [[Manoel de Oliveira]]), [[Jorge Brum do Canto]], Chianca de Garcia and [[Arthur Duarte]]. Their agenda was to move away from the previous productions, taking inspiration in the aesthetic designs of the French, German and Russian cinemas. Casts also follow this move, bringing to the screen the stars of the Revista, in contrast to the theatre world. Stars such as Eduardo Brazão, Brunilde Júdice, António Pinheiro or Pato Moniz fade, and a new school emerges with the presence of [[Vasco Santana]], [[António Silva (actor)|António Silva]], [[Maria Matos]], [[Ribeirinho]] or Maria Olguim.

At the same time, the state's relationship with cinema was also to change from the end of the '20s. The installed powers understood these young people dominated the cinema press and influenced the masses with their perspectives and wisely viewed the industry as a privileged means of propaganda for their new regime.

[[António Lopes Ribeiro]] launched his career benefiting from the 100 meters law. He films ''Uma Batida em Malpique'' ("A huntin Malpique") and ''Bailando ao Sol'' ("Dancing in the Sun") (1928), the latter with photography by Aníbal Contreiras. He later departed with [[Leitão de Barros]] in a visit to the main European studios, where he'll meet [[Dziga Vertov]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eiseinstein]].

De Barros, who screened at Lopes Ribeiro's home the 9,5&amp;nbsp;mm film he had made with his brother-in-law in Nazaré, was spurred by the trip and returned to filming with ''Nazaré, Praia de Pescadores'' ("Nazaré, Beach of Fishermen"). Again in Nazaré, de Barros films ''Maria do Mar'' ("Mary of the Sea"), the second [[ethnofiction]] in cinema history, and a milestone for up until then bleak Portuguese cinematography aesthetics. He also directed ''Lisboa, Crónica Anedótica'' ("Lisbon, an Anecdotal Chronicle") (1929), where in a series of multiple city scenes, he displays [[Chaby Pinheiro]], repeat stars Adelina Abranches and Alves da Cunha, Nascimento Fernandes, and the unforgettable [[Vasco Santana]] and [[Beatriz Costa]].

Inspired by Marcel l'Herbier, [[Jorge Brum do Canto]] opened with ''A Dança dos Paroxismos'' ("The Dance of the Paroxisms") in 1928, playing the main role with his own script. It opened only to a private audience in 1930, however, to only be seen again in 1984.

[[Manoel de Oliveira]] shot ''[[Douro, Faina Fluvial]]'' ("Douro, River Works"), with Lopes Ribeiro persuading him to take it to the V International Critics Congress{{Where|date=November 2013}}, where it received the praise of [[Pirandello]]. But again it will be [[Leitão de Barros]] who leaves an imprint in movie history, with ''[[A Severa (film)|A Severa]]'', based upon the work by [[Júlio Dantas]], with the direction of the first Portuguese [[talkies|talkie]]. A new era of Portuguese cinema was about to begin.

== Sound films ==

===1930s–1940s===
{{see also|List of Portuguese films of the 1930s|List of Portuguese films of the 1940s}}
With the beginning of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] right-wing dictatorship in 1933, a new genre of film started, based on the comedy and musical genres, famously the "A Comédia À Portuguesa", with the focus on contemporary life and light matters, and the intention of taking the minds of the people from the difficult times faced.

1942 saw the release of ''[[Aniki-Bóbó]]'', the first full-length fictional film from Manoel de Oliveira, who would only return to fiction film-making twenty-one years later. It marked a milestone in Portuguese film not only because it differed from the tone most in vogue at the time, as it dealt with social issues, but also because it predated the first Italian neo-realism movies by a few years.

The '''Golden Age''', as it is known, began that same year with the release of ''[[A Canção de Lisboa]]'', and dominated the country for the next two decades. Other famous titles from this popular era are ''[[Aldeia da Roupa Branca]]'' (1938), ''[[O Pátio das Cantigas]]'' and ''[[O Pai Tirano]]'' (1941), ''[[O Costa do Castelo]]'' (1943), ''[[A Menina da Rádio]]'' (1944) and ''[[O Leão da Estrela]]'' (1947).

During this period historic films also emerged as an important genre in the Portuguese industry, as a medium for the state party to develop its nationalist propaganda and conservative values, namely ''[[As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor]]'' (1935), ''[[Bocage]]'' (1936), ''[[Amor de Perdição (1943 film)|Amor de Perdição]]'' (1943), ''[[Inês de Castro]]'' (1945), ''[[Camões (film)|Camões]]'' (1946) and ''[[Frei Luís de Sousa]]'' (1950). A subgenre of these nationalist films were those related to the culture of [[Fado]] and the rise to popularity of [[Amália Rodrigues]], the great name of ''Portuguese song''. Some of those films were ''[[Capas Negras]]'' and ''[[Fado, História de Uma Cantadeira]]'', both from 1947.

''[[Camões (film)|Camões]]'', directed by [[José Leitão de Barros]], was an official selection at the [[1946 Cannes Film Festival|first]] [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1946.

===1950s===
{{see also|List of Portuguese films of the 1950s}}
The Fifties were mainly years of stagnation with the continuity of the same movies made in the earlier decades, government censorship and glorification of the colonial empire – see ''[[Chaimite (film)|Chaimite]]'' (1953); although the first signs of the winds to come were being given by films like ''[[Saltimbancos (1951 film)|Saltimbancos]]'' (1951) and ''[[Nazaré (film)|Nazaré]]'' (1952), both directed by Manuel Guimarães and inspired by the Italian neo-realism.

In 1958 opens the Portuguese Cinematheque with a retrospective of American movies that inspired the French filmmakers of the Nouvelle Vague, an event lauded by then new critics Alberto Seixas Santos e António Pedro Vasconcelos.

In 1959 ''[[Portuguese Rhapsody]]'', directed by [[João Mendes]], was in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1959 Cannes Film Festival]].

===1960s–1970s===
{{see also|List of Portuguese films of the 1960s|List of Portuguese films of the 1970s}}
The new decade brought a new generation of films, led by ''Dom Roberto'' (1962), ''[[Os Verdes Anos]]'' and ''Pássaros de Asas Cortadas'' (1963). The new phase was named '''[[Cinema Novo]]''' or '''Novo Cinema''' (New Cinema), and it refers to Portuguese cinema made between 1963 and the revolution in 1974 by directors such as [[Fernando Lopes (filmmaker)|Fernando Lopes]], [[Paulo Rocha (film director)|Paulo Rocha]] or [[António da Cunha Telles]], amongst others. Like other new waves of the period, the influence of Italian Neo-Realism and the burgeoning ideas of the Nouvelle Vague could be felt keenly.

The term ''Novo Cinema'' is now used to avoid confusion with the [[Cinema Novo|Brazilian movement]] of the same name. This movement gains particular relevance after the [[Carnation Revolution]], pursuing certain experiences of the French New Wave, both in the field of [[visual anthropology]] and of [[political cinema]]. The generation of the seventies, taking advantage of the new liberties, explores [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[legend]], politics and [[ethnography]], until the late eighties, in conjunction with some directors of the liberated colonies, such as [[Flora Gomes]]. Portugal has a notable tradition in the field of [[docufiction]] and [[ethnofiction]] since [[Leitão de Barros]], who was a contemporary of [[Robert Flaherty]].

Films during this period also include ''Belarmino'' (1964), ''Domingo à Tarde'' (1965), ''Sete balas para Selma'' (1967) and ''O Cerco'' (1969). In 1973 ''[[The Vows]]'', directed by [[António de Macedo]], was in competition for the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prix]] at the [[1973 Cannes Film Festival]].

===1980s===

A '''comic book archive''' or '''comic book reader file''' (also called '''sequential image file''') is a type of [[archive file]] for the purpose of sequential viewing of images, commonly for [[comic book]]s. The idea was made popular by the [[CDisplay]] sequential image viewer;&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.cnet.com/CDisplay-Image-Display/3000-18488_4-10162238.html CDisplay Image Display] Download.com&lt;/ref&gt; since then, many viewers for different platforms have been created.

== Design ==
Comic book archive files mainly consist of a series of [[image file]]s, typically [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] ([[lossless compression]]) or [[JPEG]] ([[lossy compression]]) files, stored as a single [[archive file]]. Occasionally [[GIF]], [[Windows and OS/2 bitmap|BMP]], and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] files are seen. Folders may be used to group images.

The [[filename extension]] indicates the archive type used:
* .cb7 → [[7z]]
* .cba → [[ACE (compression file format)|ACE]]
* .cbr → [[RAR (file format)|RAR]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBR file extension|url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/cbr|accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* .cbt → [[tar (file format)|TAR]]
* .cbz → [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBZ file extension|url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/cbz|accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comic book archive files are not a distinct file format; only the file name extension differs from a standard file of the given archive type.

Comic book archive viewers typically offer various dedicated functions to read the content, like one page forward/backwards, go to first/last page, zoom or print. Some applications support additional tag information in the form of embedded XML files in the archive or use of the ZIP comment to store additional information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://code.google.com/p/comicbookinfo/ | title = Metadata for Digital Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt; These files can include additional information like artists, story information, table of contents or even a separate text layer for comic book translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://launchpad.net/acbf | title = Advanced Comic Book Format project page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard "Dick" Lee Peng Boon''' (born 24 August 1956) is a Singaporean singer-songwriter, playwright and film director.

==Early life==
He was born to a [[Peranakan]] father, Lee Kip Lee, (who wrote for ''[[The Straits Times]]''), and Elizabeth Tan. He was the eldest child in the family of five, with three brothers and a deceased younger sister. He received his early education at St. Michael's School (now [[St. Joseph's Institution Junior|SJI Junior]]) and his secondary education at [[St. Joseph's Institution]].
==Career==

===Early years===
Dick Lee started his career in 1971 when, at the age of fifteen, participated in various talent contests with the group, Harmony, and Dick and the Gang (teaming with his siblings). His first album, ''Life Story'', featuring his compositions, was released in 1974.

Throughout the 70s and 80s, Lee championed the acceptance of Asian elements in pop music. His pioneering album, ''Life in the Lion City'' (1984), won acclaim. But the album that shot him to regional prominence was his 1989 release, ''The Mad Chinaman''. Lee has also won several awards in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. In 1983, he co-produced [[Zircon Lounge]]'s debut album ''Regal Vigour''.

===The 90s===
In 1990, Lee moved to [[Japan]] where he continued to develop the new Asian identity through his solo work, as well as collaborations with top Asian artistes such as [[Tracy Huang]], [[Sandy Lam]] and Japanese group [[Zoo (Japanese band)|Zoo]]. He has to date, written numerous songs for top singing talents in Asia.

''Transit Lounge'', released by [[Sony]], won both critical and general music lovers' praises during the same time when he was also the regional vice-president of Artiste and Repertoire for Sony Music Asia, based in Hong Kong from 1998 to 2000. ''Everything'', released in November 2000 also by [[Sony Music]], features a collection of his works written since the 1970s. In December 2001, Lee and his friend Leonard T contributed a song to a charity CD – ''Love Is The Answer For Kids With Aids, KK Outreach for Kids Fund''. The song "It All Begins With Love" is aired frequently on Singapore's radio stations.

===Plays and musicals===
Lee has also written many staged musicals including ''[[Beauty World (musical)|Beauty World]]'' (1988), ''Fried Rice Paradise'' (1991), ''Kampong Amber'' (1994), ''[[Sing to the Dawn]]'' (1996), ''[[Hotpants]]'' (1997), [[Jacky Cheung]]'s acclaimed ''[[Snow.Wolf.Lake]]'' (1997), ''Nagraland'' (1992), ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (musical)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2006) and ''P. Ramlee'' (2007). Since 1998, Lee has been the Associate Artiste Director of the [[Singapore Repertory Theatre]].

In 2000, Lee composed the songs to the musical of ''[[Phua Chu Kang]]'', a highly popular sitcom, for the Singapore President's Star Charity Drive. Produced and broadcast by [[Television Corporation of Singapore]] (TCS), the musical raised over a record-setting $2 million.

In 2002, he wrote and co-directed his first dance musical ''re:MIX'' for Singapore Repertory Theatre Young Company (SRT Young Company), as well as a specially commissioned work, ''[[Forbidden City: Portrait of An Empress]]'', one of the highlights of Singapore's prestigious new cultural centre, The [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay]] opening festival in October that year and a popular re-run in September 2003, and again in 2006. It was directed by [[Steven Dexter]] and will go on a world tour in 2008, with the first stop being [[London's West End]].

[[Stefanie Sun]] performed the song and also included it in her own top-selling album. This was his second National Day theme song, having written "[[Home (Kit Chan song)|Home]]", performed by [[Kit Chan]], in 1998.

In 2003, he penned the English lyrics of "Treasure The World", the image song of J-ASEAN campaign by [[The Japan Foundation]]. Artistes from Japan and 10 [[ASEAN]] countries recorded this song for the campaign in English and their respective native languages. In July 2003, Lee was awarded the Fukuoka Arts and Culture Prize, an award by the [[Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize]] committee to recognise an individual's substantial contributions to the arts scene in Asia.

Lee wrote an autobiography, ''The Adventures of the Mad Chinaman'', in 2004.

==Press==
''Down on Abby'' garnered attention from international [[mainstream press]] as well as [[adult industry]]-related media since the announcement of its production with mentions from [[Jimmy Fallon]] on the ''[[Jimmy Fallon Show]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hines|first=Sophie|title=Downton Abbey porn parody is released|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/celebs/entertainment/downton-abbey-porn-parody|work=Cosmopolitan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Locker|first=Melissa|title=Hold on yo your bloomers|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2014/01/22/hold-on-to-your-bloomers-downton-abbey-gets-a-porn-makeover/|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sun-Herald]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Idato|first=Michael|title=Downton Abbey to get parody film treatment|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/downton-abbey-to-get-adult-film-treatment-20140123-31ajd.html|work=Sunday Herald Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the London ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Downton Abbey gets porn version|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/01/22/downton-abbey-gets-porn-version-ingeniously-titled-down-on-abby-4272555/|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Stars of the main ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' show have also expressed dismissive opinions on the porn parody. [[Michelle Dockery]] spoke of her "porn doppleganger" Lexi Lowe, pointing to Lowe on the cover and saying "That's me, is it? The one with the extremely large breasts?" during an interview with [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dockery|first=Michelle|title=Michelle Dockery talks Down on Abby on Conan|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV_wiiGHxJ4|work=Conan O'Brien|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugh Bonneville]] was also asked about his opinion of ''Down on Abby'' by [[Brad Blanks]] on the [[red carpet]] of ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' [[première]] in New York City. When told the title, Bonnevile stated "that's hilarious" before jokingly asking [[Bob Balaban]] if he had directed it. Balaban replied that he had been the assistant director. Bonnevile stated that he "can't wait to watch it" and that he would get the ''Downton Abbey'' crew around to watch it for a Saturday night event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonneville|first=Hugh|title=Hugh Bonneville talks Downton Abbey Porn Parody|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYGUgphGILM|work=Brad Blanks Interview|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The parody has had a mixed reception. Mainstream press appear to give generally negative reviews of the parody. A ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine writer commented that although the parody of the ''Downton Abbey'' was humorous, it was "rife with historical inaccuracies" and "not recommended for those who get distracted by historically inaccurate details like squared-off French tips and [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]].".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoefell|first=Kat|title=Downton Abbey porn parody rife with historical inaccuracies|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/01/downton-abbey-porn-rife-with-inaccuracies.html|work=New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer for ''Cosmopolitan'' magazine wrote: "What I witnessed were things that were both horrifying and factually incorrect: This nonsense would never have happened at Downton Abbey or any respectable 1920's British [[country estate]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rees|first=Alex|title=Everything you need to know about that insane Downton Abbey porn parody|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/downton-abbey-porn-fails?src=spr_TWITTER&amp;spr_id=1440_51565300|work=Cosmopolitan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, adult industry reviewers give a generally more positive review. A reviewer for the porn review website Die Screaming wrote: "After watching ''Down on Abby'', I can say with absolute certainty that the movie more than lived up to all the hype surrounding it." and "''Down on Abby'' delivers a solid [[hardcore porn]] film wrapped in the luxurious look and feel of British [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] wealth, which is exactly what you’d want from a ''Downton Abbey'' porn parody." He added "I also need to take a moment to stand up and applaud Lexi Lowe. Her scene with Tony DeSergio and Clarke Kent was arguably the highlight of the movie, with Ms. Lowe delivering a performance that will make your jaw drop." and ended the review with 5/5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheek|first=Dan|title=Lexi Lowe shines in Down on Abby porn parody|url=http://www.die-screaming.com/down-on-abby-review-710921/|work=Die Screaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another review from adult DVD review site XCritic noted: "I was surprised at how good I thought the movie was. A porn parody of ''Downton Abby'' was inevitable, but it found a way to get beautiful and sexy stars to parody the [[costume drama]] and mix in hot, depraved sex. I loved the puns with the names (Smallcock, Lord Stiffie, Lady Stiffie, etc.) and thought it was very funny overall. This parody is highly recommended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Down on Abby XCritic Review|url=http://www.xcritic.com/review/40771/jess-west-down-on-abby-tales-from-bottomley-manor/|work=XCritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecphonesis''' ({{lang-el|ἐκφώνησις}}) is an emotional, exclamatory phrase ([[wikt:exclamation|exclamation]]) used in poetry, drama, or song. It is a [[rhetorical device]] that originated in ancient literature.

A Latin example is [[O tempora o mores!|"O tempora! O mores!"]] ("Oh, the times! Oh, the morals!"). A modern example is "Young man!" from the song [[Y.M.C.A. (song)|YMCA]] by the [[Village People]].

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] used ecphonesis in “[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]:” &lt;blockquote&gt;"Almighty God!--no, no! They heard!--they suspected!--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my horror!--this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! "'Villains!' I shrieked, 'dissemble no more! I admit the deed!--tear up the planks! here, here!--It is the beating of his hideous heart!'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other examples of ecphonesis include when Homer Simpson said "No! No-no-no-no-no-no! Well, yes." during ''The Simpsons'' episode "Homer The Heretic,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homer The Heretic|url=http://simpsons-scripts.wikidot.com/homer-the-heretic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when the Scarecrow said "Oh joy! Rapture! I got a brain!" in ''The Wizard of Oz.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wizard of Oz (1939) Quotes|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/quotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump]] has used the expressions "Sad!" and "Wrong!" without elaboration throughout his 2016 presidential campaign.

== In Eastern Orthodox Liturgy ==
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] many prayers are recited silently by the priest who "speaks to God face-to-face" according to St. [[Symeon of Thessaloniki]].  However, the closing words of such prayers are usually chanted aloud, especially at the closing of an [[ectenia|ectenia (litany)]], and those closing words are called an '''ecphonesis'''.

''Examples:''

* In the [[anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]] (eucharistic prayer), the prayer following the [[sanctus]] is said silently by the priest but its ending, the [[Words of Institution]], are intoned in a loud voice.
* During most [[ectenia]]s the priest silently recites a prayer up to its last line and then, when the ectenia has concluded, he chants aloud that last line.

'''Eloquentia Perfecta,''' a tradition of the [[Society of Jesus]], is a value of Jesuit rhetoric that revolves around cultivating a person as a whole, as one learns to speak and write for the common good.

Steven Mallioux, a Professor of Rhetoric at [[Loyola Marymount University|LMU]], concluded that "an optimal orator would combine written and oral language concepts such as morality or ethics and intelligence." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallioux|first=Steven|date=2013|title=A Good Person Speaking Well: Eloquentia Perfecta in U.S. Jesuit Colleges: A Brief Genealogy|url=|journal=Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education: Vol. 43, Article 6.|volume=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has expanded from education in Jesuit colleges and preaching this tradition and guiding [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] to courses in American Colleges such as [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola Marymount University]], [[University of San Francisco]], and [[Fordham University]].

[[Loyola Marymount University|LMU]]'s core curriculum provides a few aspects that construct Eloquentia Perfecta, the first being that "It incorporates the traditional mode of rhetoric through writing, reading, speaking, and listening." The second aspect is, "The remediation of this form of rhetoric in terms of adapting to the information age and its digital elements." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmu.edu/AssetFactory.aspx?did=65635|title=JESUIT RHETORICAL ARTS: ELOQUENTIA PERFECTA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==

=== Ancient History ===
In ancient Athens, they had a goal of "perfect eloquence" in their education system, which was long before the Jesuits existed.  They believed that speech had great power and could achieve many things with "perfect eloquence" way of speaking.  [[Isocrates]] taught the "art of word" in his school that he opened and continued with words are needed to express one's thoughts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Malley|first=John W.|date=May 16, 2011|title=Eloquentia: a short history|url=|journal=America|publisher=America Press, Inc.|volume=204|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1500's ===
Jesuit education is believed by many Jesuits that the late sixteenth century's [[Ratio Studiorum]] was the founding document of Jesuit education. Under [[Ratio Studiorum]], "perfect eloquence" was renamed Eloquentia Perfecta.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ratio was developed from an idea from [[Ignatius of Loyola]] vision of education which had a baseline of classical humanities with a Renaissance focus. In addition, there was some math and history. As students go up to higher education, there is an integration of the study of science, logic, philosophy, and theology. With each progressive year of education, the Jesuit values of Eloquentia Perfecta is integrated into the curriculum. The goals were not explicit but Eloquentia Perfecta are the ides of "developing an eloquent and mature. For example, when students gave speeches, they had to adapt to different audiences and be able to speak in a variety of styles to persuade the audience.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Changing Practice of Liberal Education and Rhetoric in Jesuit Education, 1600-2000|last=Leigh|first=David|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8232-6453-7|location=New York, NY|pages=125–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1700's ===
As education of the eighteenth century arose, Jesuit education in France was revised with the addition of sciences, plays, speeches, and the discussion of philosophical ideas. Along with the revision, however, Jesuit education maintained the practices of lectures, critical thinking, public speaking, as well as challenging students with quizzes and exams.  The differences between traditional thinking and modern thinking provided a divide during changing times in the Enlightenment. The goal of education remained as the education aimed to strengthen the students communication skills with leadership skills, emotions, and eloquence. Students who attended Universities in the eighteenth century had the option of only getting a master's degree, however towards the end of the century, universities had incorporate BAs (Bachelor of Arts) and BSs (Bachelor of Science) degrees that students could get. If the student wanted to continue their education then they could get their master's as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 1900's ===
American Jesuit liberal-arts-colleges in the mid-twentieth-century had a new major discipline incorporated into their educational system. In college, students would have to take two thirds of their college requirement credits on liberal education and the other third on their major. Before the twentieth century, students had to learn about classical core education, however, it has changed to a professional field which includes nursing, business, and education. Furthermore, there are still studies in rhetoric and logic that students are required to take involving speech and debate. In the education system, some teachers still use earlier Jesuit colleges methods where they provide lectures and exams while others use more recent methods like discussion and question-answer from students. Graduates from college during this time period say that the most crucial benefit they got out of their educational experience was that they "learned to think", which means integrating concepts from the old and new ideas in society in involving a person's mind and character.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Education  ==

=== Jesuit Rhetoric ===
In 1599, the [[Society of Jesus]] was presented with ''[[Ratio Studiorum]],'' which included Jesuit educational framework and rules for the professors of rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Within this framework was the values of Eloquentia Perfecta which was, and continues to be, taught in Jesuit schools worldwide. These schools aim to promote Eloquentia Perfecta by educating their students into ideal [[orator]]s by incorporating critical thinking, civic responsibility, and ethics into a Jesuit rhetoric curriculum.

Gert Beista, the author of ''The Beautiful Risk of Education'', explains that there are three objectives to Jesuit rhetoric that focuses on, "reconnecting with the question of purpose in education." The first is that Jesuit rhetoric provides students with the knowledge, skills, and judgment that enables them to ‘‘do something’’ within their current society such as training for real-world issues with eloquence. The second of the three objectives is ''socialization'' where Beista states that, "Through education, we become members of and part of particular social, cultural and political orders." The last objective is what Beista likes to call, ''subjectification.'' This term is characterized to be the opposite of socialization, in which its emphasis is on individualization and independence in one's thinking and actions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mailloux|first=Steven|date=|title=Jesuit Eloquentia Perfecta and Theotropic Logology|url=|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|volume=34|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eloquentia Perfecta in Jesuit Colleges ===
Although Jesuit rhetoric promotes the study of Eloquentia Perfecta, by midcentury in the United States, Jesuit rhetorical studies differed little in comparison to rhetorical studies in non-Jesuit Schools. This is due to the similarity of the fundamental study of Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian. After the American Civil War, however, non-Jesuit colleges began to differ in the curriculum. This divergence was due to the molding of non-Jesuit schools by the elective system, while Jesuit colleges conserved classical courses involving Greek and Latin literature.

With the advancements of Jesuit rhetoric, Jesuit colleges introduced three important rhetorics written by Jesuits. These three rhetorics included ''Ars Dicendi'' by German Jesuit [[Joseph Kleutgen]], ''A Practical Introduction to English Rhetoric'', and ''The Art of Oratorical Composition'' both written by a Belgian-born Jesuit, [[Charles Coppen]]s. Coppens taught at multiple American Jesuit colleges including the Jesuit seminary [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|St. Stanislaus]] in Missouri. He defines the three terms rhetoric, oratory, and eloquence. Coppens states that rhetoric is, “the art of inventing, arranging, and expressing thought in a manner adapted to influence or control the minds and wills of others.” He defines oratory as, “the branch of rhetoric which expresses through orally.” Lastly, he defines eloquence as, “the expression or utterance of strong emotion in a manner adapted to excite correspondent emotions in others.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Ways of Proceeding: Eloquentia Perfecta in American Jesuit Colleges|last=Mailloux|first=Steven|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780823264520|location=United States of America|pages=162–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ignation Pedagogy ===
The [[Ignatius of Loyola]] created a document of the ''Spiritual Exercises,'' a sequence of meditations that have been utilized in universities. These spiritual practices have been around since the sixteenth century and have been more accessible to people around the world as it was published over 4,500 times. Jesuit Spiritual Exercises have been the groundwork of Ignation pedagogy, also known as the [[Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm|Ignation pedagogical paradigm]]. Ignition pedagogy, which started in 1980's, is the discipline that cultivates a person's understanding, behavior, and contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unfinished Business of Eloquentia Perfecta in Twenty-First-Century Jesuit Higher Education|last=Gannett|first=Cinthia|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8232-6453-7|location=New York, New York|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eloquentia Perfecta in Modern Times  ==

=== Adaptation to Rhetorical Changes in Eloquentia Perfecta ===
Many scholars might have the assumption that the original traditions of Eloquentia Perfecta have been erased in the later century, both through religious and academic teachings. However, though the term has been altered to fit modern society communication, the traditional teachings of the topic are very much alive.  Through both digital technology and verbal communication, Eloquentia Perfecta continues to carry on the original goal of rhetorical eloquence to spread justice to all. Many of the Jesuit scholars have had to really adapt to new medians of expression and constantly have to recreate lesson plans for students to adapt to current societal standards. As stated by Morgan T. Reitmeyer and Susan A. Sci in their article, How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta, "News is no longer something to simply consume; rather it is something to which we are compelled to respond within a wide array of media." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parmach|first=Robert J.|date=September 1, 2013|title=Talking Back: Eloquentia Perfecta: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Article 24|volume=46|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As social justice has become a social phenomenon for current day societies, mainly because news is so easily accessible through digital devices, people are feeling more compelled to speak with Eloquentia Perfecta to portray their message.

=== Eloquentia Perfecta in the Digital Age ===
As many Jesuit-affiliated universities have created a required course for all incoming first year students to take on Eloquentia Perfecta, the goal of Eloquentia Perfecta teachings remain, which is to spread the oral and written justice to people all over. Our society's culture today is a place for people to share their voices publicly using all different types of technology. Many of the digital platforms (i.e. Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram) allow people to integrate their personal insight and moral judgments to their followers. There are many famous people whom use their public voice on these platforms in society to relay eloquent, and justice messages to the public. Many of these messages relate to real-life issues within different cultures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reitmeyer|first=Morgan T|last2=Sci|first2=Susan A.|date=March 1, 2013|title=How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta|url=|journal=Article 19|volume=43|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People ===
One prime example of Eloquentia Perfecta, being  [[Jeannie Gaffigan]], a writer, actress, and Catholic comedian, was awarded the Inaugural Eloquentia Perfecta Award from Fordham’s Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education (GRE) and the Paulist Press in October 2016.  The award was given to Gaffigan because of her constant dedication to capturing the core significance of humanity.  As a public figure, and social activist, she shines light on the idea that humanity is full of flaws that must be addressed.  She bases her career on bringing people from all over the world together through skepticism, errors and uncertainty.  As she receives much of her inspiration through Catholic religion, one of her most inspirational quotes to live by is by St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of Society of Jesus, which reads, “Love ought to manifest itself in deeds rather than in words,” and spreads this faith through her many social platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.fordham.edu/faith-and-service/catholic-comedian-jeannie-gaffigan-accepts-eloquentia-perfecta-award/|title=Catholic Comedian Jeannie Gaffigan Accepts Eloquentia Perfecta Award|work=Fordham Newsroom|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eloquentia Perfecta and Other Rhetorical Phrases of Past and Modern Tradition ===
'''''"Eloquentia Perfecta."'''''

Eloquentia Perfecta is the most fundamental goal of all of these four practices listed below.  The perfect eloquence is achieved through literature of many different cultures, where one must first understand other cultural and rhetorical languages to master this practice.  These practices were all created in the early ages of Jesuit teachings, yet all still are related to modern day times. Eloquentia Perfecta is ultimately the only quality in which one must have to fulfill any sort of leadership role. Many believe that it is more important to have perfect eloquence in language and communication than it is to have any sore of technology-based skills in higher up positions in society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Malley|first=John S.J|date=March 1, 2013|title="Not for Ourselves Alone:" Rhetorical Education in the Jesuit Mode With Five Bullet Points for Today|url=|journal=Article 4|volume=43|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''“The fly in the bottle.”'''''

This metaphor first came alive by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1914.  It originally was used to help students get out of their comfort ones and expand their critical thinking skills by becoming exposed to different languages and cultures.  It have been adopted into modern day education where educators can push students to think about the questions of life that don't necessarily apply to their particular areas of skill.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“Heritage and Perspective.”'''''

"Heritage and Perspective" became a popular value in school, as it teaches past-recognition.  It is based on the idea that modern day citizens are formed by the past and must grasp the concept that the past is still relevant to today's world. Without the knowledge of the past it is hard to understand some of the current situations in which an individual in society might get caught up in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“We are not born for ourselves alone.”'''''

[[Pedro Arrupe|Father Pedro Arrupe]] made the assertion that all students must become people of the world who help people to truly reach the fundamental goal of academic Jesuit teachings.  He meant this in a rhetorical and philosophical way and not only referred to pure Jesuit practice. Women and men should be serving others to truly reach the Jesuit-practice goals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“The spirit of finesse.”'''''

This phrase became well known by [[Henri-Irénée Marrou|Henri Marrou]], as he dubbed it as the opposite of “geometric spirit.” This phrase is made to push its followers into a humane mentality.  It is meant to “weave webs with words that reflect the webs we weave with our lives, which are not neat geometric patterns but broken in places and filled with knots and tangles.” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A {{Nihongo|'''film comic'''|フィルムコミック|firumu komikku}} or {{Nihongo|'''anime comics'''|アニメコミックス|anime komikkusu}} are Japanese manga volumes which use illustrated images from an [[anime]] series, film, or video release, rather than original custom art. They generally contain the full dialog from the anime from which they are adapted. While usually published in [[tankōbon|book]] form, they are also sometimes released electronically as [[e-book]]s, occasionally called ''e-manga''. Companies such as [[Tokyopop]] and [[Viz Media|Viz]] release film comics under the trademarks '''''Cine-manga''''' and '''''Ani-manga''''', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2004-04-06/tokyopop-and-disney-expand-on-cinemanga-success Tokyopop and Disney expand on Cinemanga Success]".

The technique is similar to [[photo comics]], many of which use stills from live-action movies or television series to adapt these stories to the comics medium.

Film comics have been well received in English-speaking countries, with some titles selling more than 500,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/8740.html 'Avatar Cine-Manga' Tops 500k]". ICv2. May 25, 2006. Accessed 20 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flatter''' is a [[colorist|coloring]] specialist within the [[comic book|comic book industry]] that prepares the inked or sketched comic book page for the colorist with digital art software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. The specialist does so by selecting the objects on the page and filling them in with a solid color called a "flat", so that the "flats" can be used by the colorist by way of the "magic wand" tool. In this way, the colorist may select each object during the rendering process-to the exclusion of the other objects on the page-so that the object's base color may be changed, or to render the colors.

Because each colorist has preferences as to how the flats are to be done flatters usually work as freelancers commissioned directly by the colorist. Pricing for flats vary but as of early 2010 one common going rate for a flatted page was $15 if the page were inked and of regular difficulty ($30 for a double page) with $20 for a sketched page of regular difficulty ($40 for a double sketched page).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Notable flatters include Jeremiah Embs and Neil Fraser that obtained published credit for flats while working for the colorist Brian Buccellato on the comic book series ''Witchblade'' (issues #72, 73, 74) for [[Top Cow Productions|Top Cow]] in 2003-2004. Other notable flatters include Alex Petretich, Talon Kelley, and Fredric Paculba, who have worked for the colorist [[Dave Stewart (artist)|Dave Stewart]] on such series as [[Hellboy]], [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense|BPRD]] and received published credits for the comic [[Shaolin Cowboy]].

== Production ==

''Four'' took over five years to make and the film started several times before it was actually made.&lt;ref name="indieWire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/meet-the-2012-laff-filmmakers-3-four-director-joshua-sanchez.html |title='Meet the 2012 LAFF Filmmakers #3: "Four" Director Joshua Sanchez" |accessdate=2013-05-08 |work=indieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanchez met Christopher Shinn in 2003 while he was working for an online magazine and was assigned to interview Shinn.&lt;ref name="Mary Literary Quarterly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maryliterary.com/?p=340 |title='Meet the 2012 LAFF Filmmakers #3: "Four" Director Joshua Sanchez" |accessdate=2013-05-08 |work=Mary Literary Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanchez had read all of Shinn's plays as research for the interview, which is how he first came to read Shinn's play, ''Four''.&lt;ref name="Mary Literary Quarterly" /&gt; Sanchez wanted to option ''Four'' right away, but another filmmaker had already optioned it.  A year later, the other filmmaker did not renew the option on the play, so Sanchez stepped in.

To raise money for the film, Sanchez and his producer, Christine Giorgio, were among some of the first artists to use the crowdfunding website, [[Kickstarter]] in December 2009.&lt;ref name="Mary Literary Quarterly" /&gt; They successfully raised nearly $20,000 for their initial campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fourthemovie/four.html|date=Jan 25, 2010|title=FOUR by Joshua Sanchez and Christine Giorgio=|accessdate=2013-05-08 |work=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film director, and playwright, [[Neil LaBute]], executive produced the film along with renowned photographer, Allen Frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/hot-summer-night-joshua-sanchez-four|date=Oct 20, 2012|title=Hot summer night: Joshua Sanchez on Four=|accessdate=2013-07-21 |work=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

The film is a requiem for loneliness, conformity and desire quietly hidden in the everyday norms of suburban American life and touches on several cultural boundaries, including sexuality, class and race.  Three of the film's four main characters are people of color.

About ''Four'' Sanchez said:
{{quote|I've had so many people in the business tell me that people here and abroad do not want to watch serious films about people of color.  It’s really fucked up.  I think it’s changing...because people, real moviegoers, are sort of starved to see their lives reflected back to them in the cinema.&lt;ref name="Mary Literary Quarterly" /&gt;}}

== Release ==

The film was released on September 13, 2013.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130716-908756.html |title='Controversial Award-Winning Film - FOUR - Embraced by AMC Theatres |accessdate=2013-07-21 |work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fox cartoons''' refer to animated television series presented by the [[United States|American]] TV network [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].  During the more than thirty-year existence of the Network, there have been many successful [[prime time]] animated series and Fox cartoons. The first and most famous of these, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', was the first such series since the end of ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in the 1960s.

==History==

===1980s===
When the upstart young Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX) network was formed in 1986 by [[Rupert Murdoch]], early shows tended to attract low viewership, with the exception of some early ratings successes such as ''[[Married... with Children]]'' and ''[[21 Jump Street]]''. The animation industry had experienced a decline in the 1980s.

In 1987, ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' premiered with mild success. During this time, [[The Simpsons shorts|a series of short cartoons]] originally intended to be [[Commercial bumper|bumpers]] gained a following with young and old audiences, and Fox ordered thirteen episodes of a new animated television series based on these, titled ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

When ''The Simpsons'' premiered in December 1989, the series was instantly popular. Merchandise featuring the show’s [[breakout character]] [[Bart Simpson]] has accumulated over US$1 billion in sales. ''The Simpsons'' was the first successful primetime animated series since ''[[The Flintstones]]'', paving the way for other animated series on major broadcast networks. Since its debut, a total of {{:The Simpsons}} episodes of ''The Simpsons'' have aired, and the series is airing its [[The Simpsons (season 27)|27th season]] in 2015.

===1990s===
In September 1992, ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' made its debut, and from December 1992 to March 1993, it aired in primetime while also airing on [[Fox Kids]] for several more years.

Also in September 1992, ''[[Eek! The Cat]]'' premiered on Fox Kids. In 1994, it was renamed to ''Eek! Stavaganza''. ''Eek!'' ended in 1997. The only episode of the series to air in primetime was a Christmas special in 1993.&lt;ref name=tvtango&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Listings for - December 5, 1993 - TV Tango|url=http://www.tvtango.com/listings/1993/12/05|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' specials were also aired in primetime during that show's run on Fox Kids.&lt;ref name=tvtango/&gt;

In 1994, ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' had a brief primetime run as the first two episodes of season 3 aired in primetime on Friday nights in July and August 1994 for two consecutive weeks.&lt;ref name=xmen&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Listings for - July 29, 1994 - TV Tango|url=http://www.tvtango.com/listings/1994/07/29|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last episode of season 3 (along with an episode of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'') would premiere in primetime in June 1995.&lt;ref name=listings&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Listings for - June 11, 1995 - TV Tango|url=http://www.tvtango.com/listings/1995/06/11|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 1994, ''[[The Tick (1994 TV series)|The Tick]]'', an animated superhero/satirical Children's show based on the comic [[The Tick|of the same name]] aired on Fox Kids. A repeat of the show's Christmas episode aired in primetime in 1996.

A boom in new adult-oriented animated programming began thereafter, with [[MTV]]’s ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' beginning in 1992, and ''Simpsons'' producers [[Al Jean]]'s and [[Mike Reiss]]’ own series, ''[[The Critic]]'', in 1994. ''The Critic'' ran for one season (13 episodes) on its original network, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (in 1994);  from there, it moved to FOX, where it ran for another season of 10 episodes (1995). ''The Critic'' can be described as a minor success, with [[DVD]] sales and late-night showings on cable networks (such as [[Comedy Central]]) making it a [[cult hit]]. It received critical acclaim, being the only television series to ever be reviewed on ''[[Siskel and Ebert]]'', in which it received "Two Thumbs Up".

Two episodes of ''[[Life with Louie]]'' aired in primetime&lt;ref name=lifewithlouie&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Listings for - December 18, 1994 - TV Tango|url=http://www.tvtango.com/listings/1994/12/18|publisher=TV Tango|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=louie&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Listings for - June 18, 1995 - TV Tango|url=http://www.tvtango.com/listings/1995/06/18|publisher=TV Tango|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; before it debuted on [[Fox Kids]]. It was created by [[Louie Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporateartists.com/comedy_louie_anderson.html Comedian Louie Anderson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226045704/http://www.corporateartists.com/comedy_louie_anderson.html |date=2009-12-26 }} CorporateArtists.com. Retrieved on 2-21-09.&lt;/ref&gt; It ended in 1998.

[[Mike Judge]] left ''Beavis and Butt-head'' in the mid-1990s to begin a new project with ''Simpsons'' writer [[Greg Daniels]]. ''[[King of the Hill]]'' premiered in January 1997, and was a huge success for the network. In August 1997, ''[[South Park]]'' debuted on the cable network [[Comedy Central]], and with its subversive humor and numerous obscenities, it became controversial in a way similar to ''The Simpsons'' seven years earlier.

===2000s===
Created by comedian [[Eddie Murphy]], the series ''[[The PJs]]'' debuted in January 1999.  The show was a minor success similar to ''The Critic'', but the show’s high budget caused it to be moved to [[The WB]] in 2001, where it lasted one season.

[[Seth MacFarlane]]'s animated series ''[[Family Guy]]'' premiered after [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] in 1999. The show was cancelled in 2000, but fan petitions convinced Fox to renew it for a third season. After its third season ended in 2002, the network cancelled the series again and reruns soon began airing on [[Cartoon Network]]’s [[Adult Swim]].

Ratings for the series increased soon after, and DVD sales skyrocketed. ''Family Guy'' was revived and began airing again on Fox on May 1, 2005. ''Family Guy'' has remained a large success for the network. MacFarlane's follow-up series, ''[[American Dad!]]'', began airing on February 6, 2005, and despite low ratings, the series was renewed for multiple seasons on the network before being transferred to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in 2014.

''[[Futurama]]'', the follow-up series from ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]], began in March 1999, and was later cancelled (with its last episode aired on August 10, 2003) thanks to scheduling changes (the same fate met previously by ''Family Guy'' during its original run). In a similar move to ''Family Guy'', high DVD sales and ratings led to four separate DVD movies released from 2007 to 2009, all later broadcast on Comedy Central. ''Futurama'' was brought back in 2009 to Comedy Central, with new episodes airing from 2010 to 2013.

Fox canceled ''[[King of the Hill]]'' in late 2009. Meanwhile, ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', another endeavor from Seth MacFarlane, premiered on the network in fall 2009. It stars ''Family Guy'' character [[Cleveland Brown]].

''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' creator [[Mitch Hurwitz]] and former ''Simpsons'' executive producer [[Josh Weinstein]] developed an American version of ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (2009 TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]]'', which premiered in April 2009.

===2010s===
On January 9, 2011, ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' premiered.

Later, ''[[Allen Gregory]]'', ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]'', ''[[Axe Cop]]'', ''[[High School USA!]]'', ''[[Lucas Bros. Moving Co.]]'', ''[[Golan the Insatiable]]'', ''[[Bordertown (2016 TV series)|Bordertown]]'' and ''[[Son of Zorn]]'' were all cancelled after one season during the 2010s.

On October 8, 2013, Fox removed the unaired series ''[[Murder Police]]'' without airing a single episode.

==Controversy==
FOX cartoon series have been the subject of controversy; most notably, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', for their approach to comedy and for the coarse language and jokes that some have said are too raunchy for network TV. These shows have been some of the most risqué material aired on FOX. Fox has also been accused by some groups of corrupting children with cartoons ostensibly for teens and adults. In [[Venezuela]], ''The Simpsons'' and ''Family Guy'' have been taken off the air due to their content. In [[Russia]], ''Family Guy'' and ''The Simpsons'' were subject to lawsuits regarding their content, although in Russia other animated series like ''South Park'' were more controversial.

'''''Freedom Fighters''''' is a 2003 [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was developed by [[IO Interactive]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]].&lt;ref name=GS_review&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerstmann|first=Jeff|title = Anyone looking for thrilling action with refined control and a great premise need look no further than Freedom Fighters.|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/freedom-fighters-review/1900-6075492/|work=GameSpot.com|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=April 1, 2014|date=September 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is set in an [[alternate history]] where the [[Soviet Union]] has invaded and occupied [[New York City]]. The player takes the role of Christopher Stone, a plumber turned [[resistance movement]] leader, fighting against the invaders.&lt;ref name=IGN_review&gt;{{cite web|last=Boulding|first=Aaron|title=Freedom Fighters Review: IO Interactive is back with another damn fun game|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/30/freedom-fighters-review|work=IGN.com|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 1, 2014|date = September 30, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Freedom Fighters'' is a [[third-person shooter]], in which the player navigates through the streets of New York with a controllable squad of team mates while fighting the occupying Soviet forces. The player gains [[charisma]] points by performing various deeds, such as capturing a base or destroying enemy supplies. The more charisma gained, the more squad mates the character can recruit, up to a maximum of twelve. The player can direct recruits by giving them simple orders such as "follow," "attack," and "defend."&lt;ref name=GS_review /&gt;

===Multiplayer===
The console versions' [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] revolves around securing flags and bunkers. The flag is usually in the center of the map. Bunkers are positioned around the map, and spawn either Soviet soldiers or American freedom fighters. A game can host up to four players via [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] who may choose between the Soviet and American sides. Each side has a different set of weapons which the players can switch during battle. The players' charisma meters are set to eight, so each player can have a maximum of eight soldiers under their command; however, if it is a four-player battle, each player can control a maximum of four soldiers. The PC version does not support [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]].&lt;ref name=EG_reviewPS2&gt;{{cite web|last=Bramwell|first=Tom|title=Freedom Fighters Review - Liberate the yanks in Io's freedom up.|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_freedomfighters_ps2|publisher=EuroGamer.net|accessdate=April 1, 2014|date=September 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The Soviet Union became a world superpower by dropping the first [[atomic bomb]] on [[Berlin]], ending [[World War II]], and propping up [[communist state]]s throughout the globe which begin to surround the US in the present day. New York plumbing brothers Chris and Troy Stone travel to meet with their next client, an activist named Isabella Angelina, only to find her apartment abandoned. The Soviet Union launches a surprise [[Mainland invasion of the United States|invasion]] of [[New York City]] and suddenly Soviet soldiers, led by General Tatarin, seize Troy. Amidst the attack, Chris escapes to the streets, encountering a man named Mr. Jones and resistance member Phil Bagzton. After rescuing Isabella from a police station and Troy from a post office, the group retreats to the sewers and sets up a base of operations as New York is lost, with the media now [[State media|being controlled]] by the Soviet Union.

Months later, Chris, Phil, and Isabella sabotage key Soviet facilities and reclaim areas within the city, building up a resistance group of New York citizens and disillusioned Soviet soldiers. Chris becomes known as the "Freedom Phantom" within the Soviet-controlled media network, SAFN. Troy is captured by Soviet troops and tortured for information. Forced into issuing a public statement aimed at the resistance to cease their actions, he breaks from the prepared text and urges Chris to continue fighting. In response, General Tatarin has Troy taken to Fort Jay and executes him personally. Mr. Jones suggests assassinating Tatarin in retaliation. Chris succeeds, but returns to find Isabella missing and the resistance base occupied by the Soviet Army. The operation was orchestrated by Mr. Jones who reveals himself to be [[KGB]] agent Colonel Bulba. Chris escapes with Phil and others to a new underground area while SAFN reports on the death of Tatarin, Colonel Bulba's promotion to General, and the end of the resistance in New York.

During the winter, Chris leads the resistance deeper into occupied New York, culminating with a major raid on SAFN Studios. Chris uses the station to send a broadcast encouraging the city and beyond to rise up and bring an end to the Soviet occupation. A final assault on [[Governors Island]], consisting of massed resistance forces, is planned. After capturing [[Fort Jay]] and rescuing Isabella, New York is liberated for the time being as Chris and the group solemnly celebrate their victory. Chris knows the Soviets will not give up the occupied United States easily, but resolves to fight on as long as is necessary.

==Development==
In 2002, [[EA Games]] officially announced ''Freedom: The Battle for Liberty Island'', which would later be renamed ''Freedom Fighters'', at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]]. The concept for the game originally involved a [[turn-based]] strategic mode as a major element of gameplay.&lt;ref name = E3_Press&gt;{{cite web|last=Park|first=Andrew|title=E3 2002: Freedom:The Battle for Liberty Island announced|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2002-freedomthe-battle-for-liberty-island-announced/1100-2866557/|publisher=Game Spot|accessdate=April 1, 2014|date=May 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed by [[IO Interactive]], using the [[Game engine|3D engine]] Glacier. This engine makes use of the [[OpenGL]] and [[Direct X]] [[List of 3D graphics libraries|graphic APIs]].

''Freedom Fighters'' was released by [[EA Games]] in the U.S. on October 1, 2003, a full week after the UK release. An EA spokesperson stated that retailers in the U.S. had requested the delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feldman|first=Curt|title=Freedom Fighters moves to October|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/freedom-fighters-moves-to-october/1100-6075753/|publisher=Game Spot|accessdate=April 2, 2014|date=September 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is one of the few developed by [[IO Interactive]] that was not published by [[Eidos Interactive]].&lt;ref name = Glacier&gt;{{cite web|title=3D Engine: Glacier|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/3d-engine-glacier|publisher=Moby Games|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
The ''Freedom Fighters'' original soundtrack was composed by [[Jesper Kyd]] and released on September 29, 2003 by [[Sumthing Else Music Works]] and Nano Studios. It was [[GameSpot]]'s "Best Game Soundtrack of the Year 2003" and ''[[Game Reactor]]'''s "Best Game Music of the Year".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Tracks 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 14 and 16 are performed by the Hungarian Radio Choir. The music has grand, Soviet-style choral arrangements, and the [[synth]] parts have been described as "[[Vangelis]] on steroids".

Kyd researched [[Music of Russia|Russian music]] and [[musical scales]] prior to composing the soundtrack, citing Soviet history and [[the Cold War]] as major influences. Kyd composed the score in [[Manhattan]] shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].

''Freedom Fighters'' received generally positive reviews, with an average scoring of 81.5/100 overall by [[Metacritic]] and 82.69% overall by [[GameRankings]]. It was praised for having an excellent AI for squad tactics, which served to enhance the sense of immersion in the "extremely detailed" environments and maintain the illusion of working with a team. The game's sound quality was also of note, both for the realistic combat noises and the game's Russian-influenced music, which "adds a perfect level of drama to the proceedings."&lt;ref name=GS_review /&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN_review /&gt;

Critics noted that while the game "does a marvelous job" of creating a realistic environment, the story was lacking in substance and fairly predictable, and while the squad AI is good, the enemy AI was lacking. Another source of criticism was the game's length. The game can be cleared relatively quickly, but offers little replay value. According to Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot, "The only real problem with Freedom Fighters is that there simply isn't enough of it. "&lt;ref name = GS_review /&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN_review /&gt;

==Sequel==
On April 6, 2004 Eidos UK revealed plans for the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/freedomfighters2/news.html?sid=6092995|publisher=Gamespot|title=New ''Commandos'', ''Freedom Fighters'', and ''Deus Ex'' titles planned|date=April 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eidos announced it would distribute the sequel in the latter part of 2005. However, [[IO Interactive]] announced development of a new game, ''[[Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men]]'', casting the future of a ''Freedom Fighters'' sequel in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/freedomfighters2/news.html?sid=6154183|publisher=Gamespot|title=''Hitman'' maker contracts new shooter|date=July 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, when asked about a potential sequel, ''[[Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days]]'' director Karsten Lund refused to comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cullen|first=Johnny|title=IO gives "no comment" to Freedom Fighters 2|url=http://www.vg247.com/2010/01/15/io-gives-no-comment-to-freedom-fighters-2/|work=vg247.com|publisher=VG 24/7|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, IO Interactive's official [[Twitter]] account tweeted that ''Freedom Fighters 2'' is "definitely something a lot of us are interested in doing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IO-Interactive Tweet|url=https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/89262955866243072|work=Twitter.com|publisher=@IOInteractive|accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[IO Interactive]] split from Square Enix and took with them the rights to Freedom Fighters since it was published before the Eidos buyout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2017-11-13-io-interactive-targets-more-hitman-and-more-control|title=More Hitman, more control: IO Interactive on its newfound independence|website=www.gamesindustry.biz|language=en|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past summits have also attracted large companies such as [[Sony]] and [[Nintendo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/11/4212216/full-indie-summit-to-feature-mass-effect-and-mark-of-the-ninja-devs|title=Full Indie Summit to feature Mass Effect and Mark of the Ninja devs on April 10|last=Gera|first=Emily|date=2013-04-11|website=Polygon|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hoity Toity''''' ({{lang-de|'''Adel Verpflichtet''', meaning "[[Noblesse oblige]]"}}) is a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[board game]] created by [[Klaus Teuber]] in 1990, and published in the United States by [[Überplay]] in 2008.  The game was also published in the United States under the original German title and under the name, '''''By Hook or Crook,''''' and in the United Kingdom under the name '''''Fair Means or Foul'''''.

== Gameplay ==
The players in the game represent the members of the pretentious Antique Club. Their goal in life is to have a better collection of old stuff than every other member in the club. There are two options every turn: 1) to the Auction House to bid on an antique, or 2) to a manor house to participate in a competitive exhibit. The outcome of the players' actions depends on the choices and card play of the other players in the same location. The game therefore includes a considerable bluffing component.

The winner is the player to move the farthest on the board, or whoever finishes the fastest.

==Awards==
* 1990 [[Spiel des Jahres]]
* 1990 [[Deutscher Spiele Preis]]

'''''Jennifer's Body''''' is a 2009 American [[supernatural horror]] [[dark comedy]] film written by [[Diablo Cody]] and directed by [[Karyn Kusama]].

Since childhood, she had been friends with a selfish and popular cheerleader, Jennifer Check, despite having little in common. One night, Jennifer takes Needy to a local [[dive bar]] to attend a concert by [[indie rock]] band Low Shoulder. A suspicious fire engulfs the bar, killing several people. In shock, Jennifer agrees to leave with the band, despite Needy's protests. Later that evening, Jennifer, covered in blood, appears in Needy's kitchen and attempts to eat food from the refrigerator. She immediately vomits a trail of black, spiny fluid and leaves in a hurry.

The next morning at school, Jennifer appears fine and dismisses Needy's concerns. While the town is devastated by the deaths caused by the fire, Jennifer seduces the school's football captain in the woods and [[Disembowelment|disembowels]] him. Meanwhile, the members of Low Shoulder gain popularity due to their rumored heroism during the fire and offer to make a charity appearance at the school's spring formal.

A month later, Jennifer has become pale. She accepts a date with school [[Goth subculture|goth]]/[[emo]] Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and her boyfriend Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she again encounters Jennifer, who explains that Low Shoulder had taken her into the woods after the bar fire and offered her as a [[Virginity|virgin]] [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] to [[Satan]] in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not actually a virgin, so she became permanently [[Demonic possession|possessed]]. Leaving the woods, Jennifer had encountered an exchange student leaving the scene of the fire and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, healing instantly.

The following day, Needy goes to the school library's [[occult]] section and determines that Jennifer is a [[succubus]] who must feed on flesh and can only be killed while she is hungry and weak. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him in order to protect him. Chip attempts to attend the dance anyway but is intercepted by Jennifer, who takes him to an abandoned pool house and begins feeding on him. Needy arrives there and fights Jennifer. Chip impales Jennifer through the stomach with a pool skimmer, but Jennifer removes it and escapes, while Chip dies.

Needy goes to Jennifer's home and breaks into her bedroom. She fights Jennifer and stabs her in the heart with a [[utility knife]], killing her and destroying the demon. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy on top of her daughter's body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an [[Insane asylum|asylum]]. In her asylum room, she manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such as super strength and the ability to [[levitation (paranormal)|levitate]] due to a non-fatal bite from Jennifer during the fight between them. She escapes the mental facility, hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying, and murders them.

==Cast==
* [[Megan Fox]] as Jennifer Check:
: Fox was in negotiations to star as Jennifer Check since the film was announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Mr. Disgusting | title= Megan Fox to Star in Supernatural-Comedy 'Jennifer's Body' | url= http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10237 | publisher= [[Bloody Disgusting]] | date= October 23, 2007 | accessdate= February 11, 2008 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081120203404/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10237 | archivedate= November 20, 2008 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," she said. "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun to be able to say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming."&lt;ref name="www.moviesonline.ca" /&gt; Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', Fox said "there's [no] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible".&lt;ref name="www.moviesonline.ca" /&gt; She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," said Fox. "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works."&lt;ref name="www.moviesonline.ca" /&gt; To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on [[Diablo Cody]]'s script and [[Karyn Kusama]]'s direction to pull it off, stating, "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that."&lt;ref name="shocktillyoudrop.com"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Rotten |title= Megan Fox Talks Jennifer's Body FX |publisher=shocktillyoudrop.com |date=July 29, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2009 |url=http://shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Being a lead (like Megan), you have that weird pressure of feeling like you have to look attractive," she stated. "In this movie, I didn't worry about any of that [shit].

===Development===
''Jennifer's Body'' is the follow-up to writer and producer Diablo Cody's and Jason Reitman's collaboration efforts on ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]].'' In October 2007, [[Fox Atomic]] pre-emptively purchased the rights to Cody's script with Megan Fox to star. Peter Rice, who at the time oversaw [[Fox Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight]] and Fox Atomic, brought in the project as Fox Searchlight had previously distributed Cody's film ''Juno''.&lt;ref name="Cody Body"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kit |first=Borys |last2=Simmons |first2=Leslie |title=Atomic has Cody 'Body,' Fox part |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 23, 2007 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i55bff7bc1a68ecefd1ee67eb5979e4fb |accessdate=February 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110213754/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i55bff7bc1a68ecefd1ee67eb5979e4fb |archivedate=January 10, 2010 }} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason Novick and Reitman's producing partner Dan Dubiecki signed as producers in November 2007 with plans to produce the film under Hard C, which is housed at Fox Searchlight.

Cody stated that when writing the script, she was "simultaneously trying to pay tribute to some of the conventions that we've already seen in horror, yet, at the same time, kind of turn them on their ear".&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt; One of her influences from the 1980s horror genre was the film ''[[The Lost Boys]]''. She wanted to "honor that, and at the same time, [she] had never really seen this particular subgenre done with girls and [she] tried to do a little of both".&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt; Despite this, she said she had noticed that "the last survivor standing in the typical horror film is a woman" and that because of this she feels "horror has always had kind of a feminist angle to it in a weird way and, at the same time, it's kind of delightfully exploitative". ''Jennifer's Body'' could play on both of these aspects.&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt;

Cody said she wanted the film to speak to female empowerment and explore the complex relationships between best friends.&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt; "(Director) Karyn Kusama and I are both outspoken [[Feminism|feminists]]", she said. "We wanted to subvert the classic horror model of women being terrorized. I want to write roles that service women. I want to tell stories from a female perspective. I want to create good parts for actresses where they're not just accessories to men."&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt; Addressing "the male-dominated" horror genre, Cody said "a key reason for writing the film was to bring to the screen a new way of expressing the intensity of female bonds" and that the adolescent female friendships she experienced were unparalleled in their intensity. She wanted to show the "almost horrific" aspect of such devotion and its relation to [[parasitism]].&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt;

The producers decided to have the film open with the statement "Hell is a teenage girl" to reflect the "horrors" of [[puberty]] and that "the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women".&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt; Cody stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. I always thought that was such a sad image. She's so vulnerable. I don't know any woman who hasn't had a moment sitting in front of the mirror and thinking, 'Help me, I want to be somebody else.' What makes it extra affecting is that [Megan Fox] is stunning.&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cody crafted the story to follow a night that ends in a tragic fire, after which Jennifer is kidnapped and set up as a sacrifice which goes awry. Jennifer, now possessed by a demon and subsequently altered into a [[succubus]], sets out on a bloody rampage in which she devours boys, and it is up to Needy to stop her. In sort of a reversal [[Menstrual cycle|aspect of how puberty changes a girl's life]], Jennifer must consume the blood of others once a month or she becomes weak and plain-looking.&lt;ref name="www.msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Alonso|last=Duralde|title='Jennifer's Body' fails at horror and comedy. For all its pedigree, teen fright flick winds up a mess.|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=September 17, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2009|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32903289/ns/entertainment-movies/}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's a [[Beatitudes#Content|meek shall inherit the Earth]] sort of thing. I think it's always really satisfying and cathartic to see a character that was previously bullied become super human", said Cody.&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt; Cody said the script is not a reflection of any part of her own life, but that she is more like character Needy. "I would say I was more of a Needy than a Jennifer. I was never an [[Alpha (biology)|Alpha female]], and I've never gotten off with bullying other people", she said. "If I had to choose, I was definitely the one being shoved, not the one shoving."&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt;

The nickname "Needy" was given to Seyfried's character to underline the essentially condescending dynamic in Jennifer and Needy's high school relationship,&lt;ref name="sfweekly.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Pinkerton|title=Jennifer's Body|publisher=[[Sci Fi Weekly]]|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2009|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/movies/jennifers-body-1279788/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Needy often admires Jennifer and feels she needs her. Cody said "Jennifer is a product of a culture that pressures girls to be skinny, beautiful and just like movie stars" and that she "hopes the film inspires girls to take life into their own hands and do with it, what they want".&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt; "If I had gone to this movie as a teenage girl, I would've come out of it feeling totally inspired", she stated. "I would've wanted to write, I would've wanted to create and I would've felt like I watched something that was speaking to me."&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt;

Assigned to direct the film, Kusama said, "I think also a lot of horror is about femaleness – whether it's ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' or ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''."&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt; She said she feels "like there's a lot of fear of the female or kind of celebration of it in some weird way and something about this movie managed to take the fear and the sense that it's the female that ultimately survives and sort of marry that in a really interesting way".&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt;

Addressing her decision to have Jennifer and Needy be romantically intimate at one point during the film, which takes place in the form of a long and passionate kissing scene, Cody said she did not write the scene to score publicity.&lt;ref name=www.afterellen.com/&gt; Speaking of the scene's media hype, she said that "if the two protagonists of the film were a guy and a girl and in a particularly tense moment, they shared a kiss, no one would say it was gratuitous" but "the fact that they're women means it's some kind of stunt". The scene was "intended to be something profound and meaningful" to her and Kusama.&lt;ref name=www.afterellen.com/&gt; She further stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously we knew people were going to totally sensationalize it. They're beautiful girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [your] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and talk to them on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.&lt;ref name=www.afterellen.com/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though the film is part comedy, Cody initially intended for it to be a "very dark, very brooding" traditional slasher film. Close to "a third of the way into the process" she felt that she was incapable of doing so because "the humor just kept sneaking in". She stated, "I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of the things in the movie that are horrifying are funny to me." Feeling that "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience. So, I actually think comedy and horror are kind of similar in that way."&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt;

=== Design and effects ===
[[Image:Jennifer's Body, demon within.jpg|thumb|right|One of the makeup designs in the film for Jennifer's mouth while the character is in demonic form. Fox explained that the jaw unhinges sort of like a [[snake]]'s so that Jennifer can "fully envelop" her victims.&lt;ref name="maximotv"&gt;{{cite news|title=Megan Fox on the 'Make-Up Process' for Jennifer's Body at Hot Topic Event|publisher=maximotv|date=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a snake, the character has long, sharp teeth in order to tear the flesh from her victims' bodies as she eats them.]]

Handling the film's [[special effect]]s were KNB EFX GROUP and the [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC). For Jennifer's demonic form, the creators used different techniques. "I actually wasn't in [the makeup chair] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of me from the shoulders up. They created me and then put the teeth in", stated Fox. "To save my face, they had a photo double that would come in and do most of the crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her. So it would go from me, then in post-production it would somehow go to her and the fake head. They would mix them all together."&lt;ref name=shocktillyoudrop.com/&gt;

For the "vomit scene" where Jennifer has just arrived at Needy's house after being murdered and inhabited by a demon, Fox said the liquid she was given to spit out "was actually ... chocolate syrup initially".&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt; "We did a few takes where I would just do this scream and sort of puke [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]]'s chocolate syrup. Scratch the Hershey's because I don't want to endorse that or anything", she stated. "And then, special effects did a rig that clamps onto my ear and you revisit it in the pool scene ..." Fox said it "clips on. It goes around the back of my ear and then I bite down on it on the side of my face, like this, and it projectiles. It's a tube ..."&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt;

Directing the scene, Kusama said it had a classic feel. Fox agreed, "Yeah, and it projects whatever that material was. I'm not sure. It was pretty intense. I think it was worse for [Seyfried] because she's the one that got puked on. I was the one doing the puking."&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt;

For more practical special effects on the set as opposed to [[Computer graphics|CG]], Kusama said it "was a choice that we all sort of made organically". She said they appreciate "those kind of effects in older movies and [questions] sometimes how much more effective it is to use a ton of CG" and that they "always started with a practical effect and then moved forward from there to lay a groundwork of something that's actually physically, materially there". They found this to be more enjoyable.&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt;

{{quote_box|width=35%|align=left|quote=Before we started shooting, it involved the full appliance attached to [Fox's] face and then her real jaw would be [[Chroma key|greened]] essentially inside of her mouth and then the appliance would drop below her real jaw and then visual effects essentially owned everything in her mouth and everything outside would've been a special effects appliance. And then there would've been a lot of clean up as well because of the way it attached to her face.|source=—Erik Nordby on the construction of Jennifer's demonic mouth and jaw&lt;ref name=www.awn.com/&gt;}}

Erik Nordby of KNB (known for his work on ''[[The Haunting in Connecticut]]'', which also features co-star [[Kyle Gallner]]) stated, "We immediately went into pitch mode in January and spent a solid two weeks trying to not only bid the script but also collect as much reference material and stuff for the first client get together."&lt;ref name="www.awn.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Desowitz|title=Jennifer's Body: Jaw Dropping VFX|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=September 22, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/feature/ijennifers-bodyi-jaw-dropping-vfx}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the director and producers wanted an "old-school, hands-off, lo-fi approach to the visual effects" so that the horror elements would not overpower the storyline.&lt;ref name=www.awn.com/&gt; Based on the script, MPC similarly came to the same conclusion and "provided a clear direction" for Nordby and his team. "At that point when we met with them, they had already met with KNB, who had already done up a stylized still of what, at the time, they were calling 'Evil Jennifer,'" he said. "There was a lot of info yet to come, but based on the script, Jennifer goes from very beautiful Megan Fox to a very ghoulish, succubus creature whose jaw distends half-way down her face." Nordby said the look was eventually toned down at the wishes of MPC. From there, KNB "produced some tests, grabbing a bunch of stills from [Fox] and [did their] work to indicate how that balance could exist between special effects and visual effects and still maintain a level of subtlety" and that "[MPC] responded really well".&lt;ref name=www.awn.com/&gt;

The teams wanted to "maintain some sort of the Megan Fox allure" but said that it was "incredibly difficult because as soon as [they] warped her face in any direction, the shine kind of came off it". To combat this, they ended up focusing on anything below her nose, where they had the freedom to make things "as horrific as [they] needed to" and then above her nose, "[they] could manipulate it somewhat with warps and color correction in her eye sockets. So even at her worst, she had some of that sexiness throughout".&lt;ref name=www.awn.com/&gt;

Nordby said most of the attention was devoted to Jennifer's face and that "very quickly in combination" with special effects and makeup, MPC thought up a five-station system for what Jennifer goes through. Nordby stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain like the rest of us. And stage four was some custom [[dentures]] that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] and a variety of other musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.&lt;ref name=www.awn.com/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During testing, Nordby and the special effects teams realized that getting Fox in and out of the appliance used to create Jennifer's murderous jaw would be too time-consuming. To remedy this, they hired a photo double. "[E]very day (for about 10 days) she would sit in a chair with this full appliance on her and we would shoot this jaw, and then all [Fox] would have to do is the dentures", stated Nordby. He said that "when it came time to shoot any of these jaw moments, [Fox] would act out in rehearsal how she was going to attack her victim and [they would] fine tune that blocking so it was relatively locked".&lt;ref name="www.awn.com" /&gt; The camera accompanied them in the same way, as "it would roll and she would put her dentures in, and they would really distort her face" in a way that would produce a satisfying and nice side effect. Additionally, the team would have Fox wear [[contact lens]]es and go through exactly the same motions as normal Jennifer. "But then I would shoot all the key poses that existed in whatever moves the digital double was doing, so that we had as much of that appliance in that lighting condition that we could get", said Nordby. "KNB also created a hairless but high detailed head of the stage five Jennifer that had an articulating jaw."&lt;ref name="www.awn.com" /&gt;
[[Image:Fire and Jennifer's demon eyes.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Seyfried (left) as Needy during the fire which leads to Jennifer's kidnapping, and Fox (right) as demonic Jennifer a month after the incident; the special effects teams recessed the character's eyes and added a pinning effect to her irises, along with a variety of other musculature deforms to create the illusion.&lt;ref name="www.awn.com" /&gt;]]

Nordby spent a significant amount of time shooting "the articulating jaw" scene because they had "ultimate control over how the light was hitting the head". He said, "This so-called jaw shot became a pivotal point, because for four months of the post, the filmmakers thought the film was getting too scary so MPC pulled back on the jaw and then they thought it wasn't scary enough."&lt;ref name="www.awn.com" /&gt; Because of this, "they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. "From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did", said Norby, "there was a lot of work figuring out how to make this a scary film as well as a funny film."&lt;ref name="www.awn.com" /&gt; Since the team was on a small budget, they "relied more on skilled artists to think through shots rather than a brute force approach".&lt;ref name="www.awn.com" /&gt;

MPC additionally worked on the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed at the beginning of the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims", stated Nordby. "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over."&lt;ref name="www.awn.com" /&gt; They could not lock it to a [[Panning (camera)|pan]] or to a [[View camera#Tilt|tilt]] and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." Dealing with "very shallow" water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.&lt;ref name="www.awn.com" /&gt;

During the film's fire scene, Cody appears as a character in the barroom. "To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics and all that stuff which is why I don't know why I asked to be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that [[Burt Reynolds]] had done it once", stated Cody. "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough."&lt;ref name="www.moviesonline.ca" /&gt;

=== Filming ===
In late 2007, Fox Atomic had plans to film ''Jennifer's Body'' before a possible writer's strike. When the [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007–present)|Writers Guild of America strike]] began, shooting was then moved to March 7, 2008, in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]], specifically at Robert Burnaby Park near Cariboo Hill Secondary School. Some of the scenes, particularly those situated in a school setting, were filmed in local [[Vancouver]]-area schools such as [[Vancouver Technical Secondary School]], [[Langley Secondary School]] and [[University Hill Secondary School]].

Fox said that while filming her highly anticipated kissing scene with Seyfried that Seyfried was "extremely uncomfortable" but that she herself was not. "I feel much safer with girls, so I felt more comfortable kissing [Seyfried] than kissing any of the other people that I had to kiss", she said.&lt;ref name="moviesblog.mtv.com"&gt;{{cite web | first = Adam | last = Rosenberg | title = Megan Fox Talks About Her 'Jennifer's Body' Kiss With Amanda Seyfried |publisher= MTV|date= August 31, 2009 |accessdate= September 26, 2009 |url= http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/08/31/megan-fox-talks-about-her-jennifers-body-kiss-with-amanda-seyfried/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused "giggling fits" between takes.&lt;ref name=moviesblog.mtv.com/&gt; Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes.&lt;ref name=wWw.afterellen.com/&gt; She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. "It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. "It is just weird. It is a woman. With a woman's smell—soft and floraly—and maybe the [[pheromone]]s are different. Something about it felt uncomfortable for me."&lt;ref name="www.digitalspy.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Catriona|last=Wightman|title=Seyfried: 'Kissing Megan Fox was weird'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=October 4, 2009|accessdate=October 14, 2009|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a180342/seyfried-kissing-megan-fox-was-weird.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
Music was incorporated as an essential part of the film; there are "very specific bands" placed in band posters in some parts, such as in the selection of the band poster on the walls of the bar.&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt; Kusama said "[t]he music was a huge component of the movie" and this is first evident with "the songs that we see and hear performed, but then, just the vibe of the movie actually". She said, "As the movie progresses, it becomes a pretty clearly music-oriented movie. It's sort of a youth movie. Some of those bands were totally made up and some of them are not."&lt;ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] enjoyed the film, dubbing it a "''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'' for boys" and saying "as a movie about a flesh-eating cheerleader, it's better than it has to be". Ebert said that within Cody there is "the soul of an artist, and her screenplay brings to this material a certain edge, a kind of gleeful relish, that's uncompromising. This isn't your assembly-line teen horror thriller". Additionally, he complimented Fox as "[coming] through" in her portrayal and "play[ing] the role straight".

Mary Pols of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called the film entertaining and reasoned "[t]here is a lot of intelligent camp here, and some sharply observed characterizations" and Cody and Kusama's "depiction of the ways in which women like Needy are willing to compromise themselves to indulge an ultimately less secure friend is spot-on".&lt;ref name="www.time.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary|last=Pols|title=Jennifer's Body: Megan Fox Is a Man Eater|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=September 28, 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1924473,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dana Stevens of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' praised the film for being "luscious and powerful, sexy and scary, maddening at times, but impossible to stop watching" and a "wicked black comedy with unexpected emotional resonance, one of the most purely pleasurable movies of the year so far".&lt;ref name=www.slate.com/&gt; ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle's]]'' Karen Durbin said the film not only puts "a fresh spin on female-centric pop genres but also own[s] them outright" and is "rich with first-rate performances".&lt;ref name="www.elle.com"&gt;{{cite web |first= Karen |last= Durbin |title= Whip It, Jennifer's Body |work= [[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] |date= September 18, 2009 |accessdate= September 24, 2009 |url= http://www.elle.com/Entertainment/Movies-TV/Movie-Releases-Whip-It-Jennifer-s-Body }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Miami Herald]]''{{'s}} Rene Rodriguez likened the film's "[effective exploitation] of the genre as a metaphor for [[adolescence|adolescent]] angst, female sexuality and the strange, sometimes corrosive bonds between girls who claim to be best friends" to [[Brian De Palma]]'s 1976 film ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]''.&lt;ref name="www.miamiherald.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Rene|last=Rodriguez |title=Jennifer's Body (R) **½: Flirting with greatness, bedeviled by timidity|publisher=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=September 19, 2009|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/story/1237654.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; She applauded the film for being fearless when delving into the subject of [[Adolescent sexuality|teen sex]] and for reversing the tradition/idea that only "bad girls have sex when they're 16 [and the] good ones—those who, like Needy, do their homework and are responsible—never slide past first base".&lt;ref name=www.miamiherald.com/&gt; Nick Pinkerton of ''[[Sci Fi Weekly]]'' called Fox and Seyfried's [[lesbian]] kissing scene "the best close-up girl-girl liplock" since ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'',&lt;ref name=sfweekly.com/&gt; and [[A. O.

Giving a partially negative review of the film was Joshua Rothkopf of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out New York]]'', who said the "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into ''Twilight''-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" and that "Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through.

====Later assessments====
In 2018, Constance Grady reported in ''Vox'' that a new critical consensus was forming that appreciated the film as a "forgotten feminist classic".&lt;ref name="Vox 31 October 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grady |first1=Constance |title=How Jennifer’s Body went from a flop in 2009 to a feminist cult classic today |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/10/31/18037996/jennifers-body-flop-cult-classic-feminist-horror |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=Vox |date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that after the #[[MeToo]] movement highlighted routine sexual harassment and misconduct in the media industry, the film's story of "a group of powerful men sacrificing a girl's body on the altar of their own professional advancement" became uncomfortably familiar, and that the scene of the band laughingly torturing Jennifer recalled [[Christine Blasey Ford]]'s testimony of [[Brett Kavanaugh]]'s alleged sexual assault on her. This, according to Grady, allowed viewers to see the film, rather than as a sex fantasy, as a revenge fantasy as Jennifer uses her abused body against her attackers.&lt;ref name="Vox 31 October 2018" /&gt; ''Vox'' also attributed the film's initially poor reception to the reviewers' assumption that "a teen horror flick" was intended for a straight, male audience, and that if a film failed to meet that audience's expectations, it failed as a film – exemplified by ''[[ReelViews]]''{{'}}s assessment that "if you're in search for a way to ogle Megan Fox's body, there are a lot better ways to do it than subjecting yourself to this".

Though the film was expected to pull in a significant number of the late teenage/[[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]] audience, particularly males aged 17 and older, while Cody hoped for a large female turnout,&lt;ref name=in.reuters.com/&gt; it earned a "disappointing" $2.8&amp;nbsp;million on its opening Friday and $6.8&amp;nbsp;million its opening weekend at the North American [[box office]]; the film placed #5, while [[3-D film|3D]] animated film ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]] ''placed #1 with $30.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=theboxofficejunkie.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0d52172227325f28c4c19ec7af9c3317 | title = 'Cloudy' wins weekend boxoffice | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lexib.net"&gt;{{cite web |author= LexiB |title= Jennifer's Body D.O.A in Weekend Box Office |publisher= LexiB |date= September 21, 2009 |accessdate= September 25, 2009 |url= http://lexib.net/2009/09/jennifer%e2%80%99s-body-doa-in-weekend-box-office/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced for $16&amp;nbsp;million, ''Jennifer's Body'' did manage to attract the sizable female audience Cody wanted; 51% were female, with 70% of patrons under age 25.&lt;ref name=hollywoodreporter.com/&gt; The film had been expected to benefit somewhat from its heavily marketed lesbian kissing scene between Fox and Seyfried, which, in addition to Fox being in the film, was thought to entice and successfully attract male viewers.&lt;ref name=wWw.afterellen.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=movies.ign.com/&gt; Critic Jim Vejvoda at IGN stated that such a scene is not as shocking as it was in past decades and cannot be expected to significantly pull in an audience.&lt;ref name="movies.ign.com"&gt;{{cite web | author = Jim Vejvoda | date = September 17, 2009 | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/101/1019379p1.html| title = Jennifer's Body Review.

Box-office analysts and critics debated the film's underperformance. Analyst Jeff Bock, of Exhibitor Relations, reasoned the film underperformed at the box office due to two reasons; the first, he said, is the genre. Bock stated that Americans get horror and comedy, but with the idea "of those two things together in one place, people suddenly get very dumb".&lt;ref name="www.eonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Leslie|last=Gornstein|title=Did Jennifer's Body Bomb Because of Megan Fox?|publisher=[[E!]]|date=September 21, 2009|accessdate=September 21, 2009|url= http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/ask_the_answer_bitch/b145273_did_jennifers_body_bomb_because_of.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The horror-comedy genre is the toughest sell in Hollywood", he said. He noted films ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'', ''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'', ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', ''[[Eight Legged Freaks]]'' and [[The Evil Dead (franchise)|''The Evil Dead'' series]], and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, "none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can."&lt;ref name=www.eonline.com/&gt; In addition, he labeled the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' franchise as more "straight-up horror" than comedy and stated ''[[Zombieland]]''{{'}}s box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.&lt;ref name=www.eonline.com/&gt;

Despite other R-rated horror films having centered around teenagers, some such as ''Scream'' having been successful, Bock said the second reason ''Jennifer's Body'' under-performed at the box office is the R-rating, which he described as a "killer" for the film. He said the film is set in high school and "sounds like the perfect package for teens" but that "the R rating banned many teens from the theaters" and the studio was left with "an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?"&lt;ref name=www.eonline.com/&gt; Nicole Sperling of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'' was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the [[Matt Damon]] film ''[[The Informant!]]'' and [[Jennifer Aniston]] film ''[[Love Happens]]'', she concluded that this may support "the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter" and that it takes more than a name to open a film.&lt;ref name="hollywoodinsider.ew.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nicole|last=Sperling|title=Box Office: 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' soars; 'Jennifer's Body' sinks|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 21, 2009|accessdate=September 22, 2009|url= http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/09/box-office-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-soars-jennifers-body-sinks/ |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120902183020/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/09/box-office-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-soars-jennifers-body-sinks/ |dead-url= yes |archive-date= September 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; S.T. VanAirsdale of ''[[Movieline]]'' echoed Sperling's sentiment about the weekend, as "some of the stinkiest high-profile openings in recent memory".&lt;ref name="www.movieline.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=S.T.|last=VanAirsdale|title=So What Went Wrong with Jennifer's Body?|publisher=[[Movieline]]|date=September 21, 2009|accessdate=September 28, 2009|url= http://www.movieline.com/200909/so-what-went-wrong-with-jennifers-body.php |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130129030300/http://www.movieline.com/200909/so-what-went-wrong-with-jennifers-body.php |dead-url= yes |archive-date= January 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded five reasons for ''Jennifer's Body''{{'}}s underperformance at the box office. The first, he said, is the distributor. "[[20th Century Fox]]'s genre wing, [[Fox Atomic]], had ''Jennifer's Body'' in the can by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring", he said. "Instead of offloading the film to [[Fox Searchlight]], which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild ''Juno'' to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory" and "post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried". VanAirsdale classified this as a "[b]ig mistake" and that "[y]ou'd have to go back to ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'' to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you'd probably have to go back to ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully."&lt;ref name=www.movieline.com/&gt; He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.&lt;ref name=www.movieline.com/&gt;
[[File:Diably Cody Jennifers Body TIFF09.jpg|thumb|left|Cody (center) at ''Jennifer's Body'' screening at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]].]]

VanAirsdale cited the release date and [[Film screening|screening]] as the third and fourth reasons; he said there was confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that [[Toronto]] is "a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month" and that "this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn't travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and L.A. bows."&lt;ref name=www.movieline.com/&gt; The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned [[Ty Burr]]'s review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is "ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization" and that "[t]he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be two sides of the same coin. Who's the monster, and who made the monster? Sorry if you wanted ''Heathers'' with demons, fellas. Equipment's cheap these days; perhaps make your own?"&lt;ref name=www.movieline.com/&gt;

Hollywood.com box-office analyst and President Paul Dergarabedian said "the poor numbers don't mean Fox can't open a movie."&lt;ref name="www.usmagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aniston, Megan Fox Bomb at the Box Office|publisher=[[Us Weekly]]|date=September 21, 2009|accessdate=September 21, 2009|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/jen-aniston-and-megan-fox-2009219}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It may be a matter of just choosing the right projects for her", he told the ''[[Associated Press]].'' "She's trying to find a world beyond ''Transformers'', and she will. She's young and has a lot of promise."&lt;ref name="www.usmagazine.com" /&gt;

== Graphic novel == &lt;!-- [[Jennifer's Body (comics)]] and [[Jennifer's Body (graphic novel)]] redirect here --&gt;
As a [[tie-in]] to the film, [[Boom! Studios]] produced a '''''Jennifer's Body'' graphic novel'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. The [[graphic novel]] expands on the film's universe and Jennifer's murders of the boys. It was written by Black Metal's [[Rick Spears]], with the first nine pages illustrated by [[Jim Mahfood]] (''[[Clerks. (comics)|Clerks]]''). Two covers, in Fox's likeness, were designed; one for the direct market by Eric Jones (available only in comic specialty stores), and the other by [[Frank Cho]] for the mass market focusing more on "hellish Jennifer stories" with art by Mahfood, [[Hack/Slash]]'s Tim Seely, [[DMZ (comics)|DMZ's]] Nikki Cook, and Popgun's Ming Doyle. The novel was released in August 2009.&lt;ref name="Shocktillyoudrop.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=Rotten|title=EXCL: First Look at the Jennifer's Body Graphic Novel|publisher=shocktillyoudrop.com|date=July 15, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/comicsnews.php?id=11082}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web | first=Brent| last=Jones|title='Jennifer's Body' creeps into theaters ... and comics| work=[[USA Today]]| date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009| url=https://www.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2009/09/jennifers-body-creeps-into-theaters--and-comics/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.atomiccomics.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiation Interrogation featuring Jennifer's Body creators Rick Spears, Tim Seeley and Jim Mahfood! |publisher=Atomiccomics.com |date=August 26, 2009 |accessdate=September 27, 2009 |url=http://www.atomiccomics.com/Pages/AtomicBlog/tabid/91/EntryID/561/Default.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828020455/http://www.atomiccomics.com/Pages/AtomicBlog/tabid/91/EntryID/561/Default.aspx |archivedate=August 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel features less of Jennifer than the film, but does capture her "going in for the kill" several times. It focuses heavily on following her soon-to-be victims and provides information on their personalities not elaborated on in the film so that readers can better conclude whether the boys deserved to be murdered. The novel consists of four chapters, with a prologue and an epilogue, with art provided for each by different artists. Each one follows a different boy and what is happening in his life just before Jennifer kills him.&lt;ref name="www.atomiccomics.com"/&gt;

On creating the story, Spears stated, "The best part for me as a writer was to show some events from the movie from a different point of view, sort of like ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' for you [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] fans. And with comics we can get into the character's heads in a way that works well in comics and novels more so than in film."&lt;ref name="www.atomiccomics.com"/&gt; He stated, "... I was using the medium to change what we really know about these characters and twist around what we see in the movies. All the academics aside, it's also very funny and gore splattered."&lt;ref name=www.atomiccomics.com/&gt;

Spears stated that while writing the stories, the film was still being made and he had not seen any of it at the time. He mainly learned about the characters through the script. "I got to read the screenplay. It was kinda crazy writing characters that were being changed on set and in the editing process. I had to bob and weave to keep up but that was all part of the fun", he said.&lt;ref name="www.atomiccomics.com"/&gt;

A '''live band dance''' is an event where the means of serving the dancefloor involves the use of a [[musical ensemble|live band]].

==History==
Before the rise of [[discothèque]]s and [[DJ]]-based dancefloors with recorded music (prior to the 1950s); live bands were the ubiquitous means of [[dancing music|serving the dancefloor]].  Along with that, [[slow dance|slow-dancing]] was the primary method of dancing at the time.  However; the rise of [[Rock and Roll]] music initially made it hard for people to dance when it was popularized in the early 1950s, however people quickly adapted to it and started dancing at higher speeds almost coinciding the rise of DJ-based dancefloors.  Live bands have quickly been displaced by DJ-based dancefloors as the DJ stands took up less space than bandstands and that it played recorded music.

==Modern comeback==
Live band dances are still used on occasion at [[ballroom]]s.  Along with that, [[moshpit]]s have live [[punk rock]] bands, so people are able to hear the hardcore sound  associated with [[moshing]].  Some [[School formal|formal dances]] such as [[prom]]s use live bands as a means of serving the dancefloor.  Also, some people choose live bands because they believe there are virtually no space constraints for the band's instruments.  Dance parties with [[high-end]] [[formality]] have also preferred live bands as means of serving the dancefloor.

==In Pop Culture==
*In ''[[Back to the Future]]''; which took place in the 1950s; [[Jazz]] music was being played as it was the ubiquitous genre for live band based dancefloors prior to the time period the movie took place at.  However, when Marty comes up to stand in the position of the guy with the hurt hand, he eventually plays the song ''[[Johnny B. Goode]]''; but then sees the hardship of compensation of the song and ends up saying ''I can't guess you guys are ready for that, but your kids are gonna love it''; which references the aforementioned rapid transition to [[Rock and Roll]] as a dance genre.
*In ''[[Idle Hands]]''; a live band is used for a dancefloor with fans of [[punk music]].

'''Mae Barnes''' (born '''Edith Mae Stith''', possibly January 23, 1907 &amp;ndash; December 13, 1996) was an African-American [[jazz]] singer, dancer and comic entertainer.  She was responsible for introducing the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] dance to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the 1924 [[revue]] ''Runnin' Wild''.  After her career as a dancer ended, she became a successful [[nightclub]] singer and recording artist.

==Biography==
She was born in [[New York City]].  There is some uncertainty over her year of birth.  Most sources give 1907, but blues researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc give 1892, based on [[1900 US census|1900]] and [[1910 US census]] records,&lt;ref name="bare"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues - A Regional Experience| publisher= Praeger Publishers| location= Santa Barbara| pages=259 | isbn= 978-0313344237}}&lt;/ref&gt;  though the 1892 date would suggest that she died at the age of 104.&lt;ref name=opal/&gt;

Around 1919, she left school, purportedly to move to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], but instead started working as a [[chorus girl]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;  Developing expertise as a singer and [[tap dancer]], she worked in [[vaudeville]] and toured the [[Southern United States|south]] in such shows as ''Bon Bon Buddy Jr.'' and ''Dinah''.  In 1924, she made her Broadway debut in ''Runnin' Wild'', in which she introduced the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] dance, and became known as "the bronze [[Ann Pennington (actress)|Ann Pennington]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=94Vkm-y_3CEC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Edith+Mae+Stith%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FaSdb3MN0b&amp;sig=HNCMiAy0ZNK9Yhg77BLXgFYUdFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwint__ZhPjPAhUhCcAKHatMCGEQ6AEIPTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Edith%20Mae%20Stith%22&amp;f=false  Bernard L. Peterson, ''Profiles of African American Stage Performers and Theatre People, 1816-1960'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

On her second tour, in ''Shuffle Along'' (1927), the entertainer [[Bill "Bojangles" Robinson]] called her "the greatest living female tap dancer".  She also performed with [[Charlie Ruggles]] in the Broadway show ''Rainbow'', and danced an "insanely comic" version of the [[Black Bottom (dance)|Black Bottom]].  She continued to perform as a dancer and entertainer in Broadway shows, including the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' and ''Hot Rhythm'', and toured on the [[B. F. Keith Circuit|Keith vaudeville circuit]] through most of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=opal&gt;[http://opalnations.com/files/Mae_Barnes_Dr.Jazz_212_2011_Holland_.pdf  Opal Louis Nations, "The Mae Barnes Story", ''Doctor Jazz Magazine''].

McFarland, 2009, p.226]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, she broke her [[pelvis]] in an automobile accident.  This effectively ended her career as a dancer, and she diverted her energies into singing.  She sang in [[nightclub]]s in [[Hollywood]], [[Honolulu]], and [[New York City]], including a seven-year residency at the Boite in [[Greenwich Village]], and at clubs in [[Park Avenue]].  In the late 1940s she featured at parties including those hosted by [[socialite]] [[Elsa Maxwell]], and gave fundraising [[benefit show]]s for hospitals.  She toured Europe in 1950, and stayed in London to take the lead in [[Jack Hylton]]'s revue, ''Knight of Madness''.&lt;ref name=opal/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

After returning to New York in 1951, she became the main attraction at the Bon Soir club on [[Eighth Street (Manhattan)|Eighth Street]], accompanied by a vocal group, the Three Flames ([[Tiger Haynes]], Roy Testamark and Averill Pollard).  They attracted the attention of [[Ahmet Ertegun|Ahmet]] and [[Nesuhi Ertegun]] of [[Atlantic Records]], who issued Barnes' first [[Extended play|EP]] in 1953 and an [[LP record|LP]], ''Fun with Mae Barnes'', the following year.  She was accompanied by [[Garland Wilson]] and the Three Flames, and the songs included "(I Ain't Gonna Be No) Topsy", a celebration of [[black pride]], and "[[On the Sunny Side of the Street]]", which became her [[signature song]].&lt;ref name=opal/&gt;   She became well known for her "sassy" song interpretations, and for "her irreverent interpolations into familiar lyrics".&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/18/arts/mae-barnes-89-jazz-singer-famous-for-the-charleston.html  Stephen Holdenjan, "Mae Barnes, 89, Jazz Singer Famous for the Charleston", ''New York Times'', January 18, 1997].

In the mid-1950s she appeared regularly on TV [[variety show]]s, and headlined at the [[Apollo Theatre]].  She recorded another album, ''Mae Barnes'', on which she was backed by a jazz group led by trumpeter [[Buck Clayton]], in 1958 for [[Vanguard Records]].  Although it was not successful, she continued as a popular live act, and in 1960 the Erteguns recorded her performance at the [[Playboy Club]] for a further album, although it remained unreleased.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;   She continued to perform in clubs through the 1970s and 1980s, and featured in a [[documentary]], ''Wild Women Don't Have the Blues'', in 1987.&lt;ref name=opal/&gt;&lt;ref name=jbfv&gt;[http://bonjourqui.blogspot.co.uk/2007/02/some-describe-mae-barnes-as-song.html  "Mae Barnes 1958", ''Jazz, Blues, Female Vocalists and More...''].

== Plot ==
In 2013, an [[interdimensional doorway|interdimensional portal]] called the "Breach" opens at the bottom of the [[Pacific Ocean]], from which giant monsters, the [[Kaiju]], emerge. To combat the Kaiju threat, humanity builds massive robotic machines called Jaegers. Each Jaeger is piloted by two or more people, who are mentally linked in a process called "Drifting", to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.

In 2020, the Becket brothers, Raleigh and Yancy, pilots of ''Gipsy Danger'', are launched to defend [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] from Knifehead, a Category III Kaiju. Defying direct orders from command, they engage the monster rather than protect the coastline. Knifehead kills Yancy, and Raleigh barely manages to pilot the Jaeger on his own, killing the Kaiju before crashing it at a shoreline. Traumatized by Yancy's death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program. Five years later, the increasing power and number of Kaiju attacks cause the world governments to cease funding the continuous construction of Jaegers in favor of building coastal walls, and Marshal Stacker Pentecost moves all four remaining Jaegers to the last Jaeger Shatterdome in [[Hong Kong]] and plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying the Breach with a [[nuclear weapon]]. As ''Striker Eureka'', piloted by Herc Hansen and his son Chuck, kills Mutavore, a Category IV Kaiju, in [[Sydney]], demonstrating the ineffectiveness of the walls, Pentecost persuades Raleigh to rejoin the program and they arrive at Hong Kong and meet Mako Mori, director of the Jaeger restoration program. After finding her compatible, Raleigh and Mako try their first drift, but Mako ends up nearly destroying the Shatterdome while lost in the memory of a Category II Kaiju attacking [[Tokyo]] and killing her family, and is relieved of piloting duty. It is revealed that after this incident, Mako was saved and raised by Pentecost.

Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb to plan the assault on the Breach. Newton is able to drift with a piece of a Kaiju brain, discovering the Kaiju are scouts sent by invading beings from another dimension, and establishing a two-way mental link that enables the Kaiju [[Swarm intelligence|hive mind]] to gain access to his knowledge just as he did theirs. Pentecost tasks Newton with finding a [[black market]] dealer and seller of body parts of dead Kaiju, Hannibal Chau, to find a fresh Kaiju brain. Suddenly, two Category IV Kaijus, Leatherback and Otachi, emerge and rampage through Hong Kong to kill Newton. After Otachi destroys ''Crimson Typhoon'' and Leatherback destroys ''Cherno Alpha'', ''Striker Eureka'' loses all power by Leatherback's [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP blast]]. ''Gipsy Danger'' is finally sent and slays both Kaiju. Newton and Chau find out that Otachi is pregnant, and the infant Kaiju dies shortly after swallowing Chau whole. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant's brain, discovering the Breach will only open in the presence of a Kaiju's DNA.

As Herc was injured during the previous fight, Pentecost, who is dying from radiation sickness from piloting a Jaeger with a nuclear core before the implementation of radiation shielding, gives a rallying speech and pilots ''Striker Eureka'' with Chuck. Along with ''Gipsy Danger'', they approach the Breach and are warned by Newton and Hermann of what they discovered from drifting with the infant's brain. Three Kaiju, two Category IV called Scunner and Raiju and a first Category V named Slattern, emerge from the Breach to defend it. After Raiju is killed, Pentecost and Chuck sacrifice themselves by detonating the bomb, which kills Scunner and mortally wounds Slattern. Raleigh and Mako kill Slattern and drag it to the Breach, where Mako is ejected and Raleigh successfully overloads the Jaeger's reactor, destroying and closing the Breach. As Raleigh and Mako's escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean, Herc orders the war clock to be stopped, indicating mankind's victory and Raleigh and Mako embrace.

In a mid-credits scene, Chau is shown cutting his way out of the Kaiju infant, looking for his lost shoe.

I would like to have a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality."&lt;ref name="GDT-Collider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/guillermo-del-toro-pacific-rim-interview/|title=Guillermo del Toro Talks Getting Back in the Director’s Chair, the Evolution of the Script, Creating the World on a Giant Scale, and More on the Set of ''PACIFIC RIM''|work=collider.com|last=Weintraub|first=Steve 'Frosty'|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the character, Hunnam stated: "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me out of retirement to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one.

* [[Idris Elba]] as Marshal Stacker Pentecost:
: Raleigh's commanding officer in Pan Pacific Defense Corps and former Jaeger pilot dying of radiation poisoning due to lax radiation shielding on the first Jaeger models. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: "This is a movie where I have had to deal with more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?"&lt;ref name="GDT-Collider" /&gt; In another interview, the director said: "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [everything]. I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel the weight of the world on his shoulders. When I watched ''[[Luther (TV series)|Luther]]'', that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that."&lt;ref name="IGN-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2013/06/20/ign-heads-to-the-set-of-pacific-rim|title=IGN Heads to the Set of ''Pacific Rim''|last=Nicholson|first=Max|date=June 20, 2013|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians [[David Cameron]] and [[Barack Obama]], as well as [[Russell Crowe]] in ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' and [[Mel Gibson]] in ''[[Braveheart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/videos/entertainment/pacific-rim-interview-with-idris-elba-29397638.html|title=''Pacific Rim'' interview with Idris Elba|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro initially offered the role to [[Tom Cruise]], who declined because of scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/del-toro-hunnam-can-date-daughters-29427356.html|title=Del Toro: Hunnam can date daughters|work=belfasttelegraph.com|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rinko Kikuchi]] as Mako Mori:
: Raleigh's co-pilot who lost her family in a Kaiju attack and was adopted by Pentecost. Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood.&lt;ref name="trauma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/motion-captured/rinko-kikuchi-on-how-trauma-forms-character-in-pacific-rim|title=Rinko Kikuchi on how trauma forms character in ''Pacific Rim''|work=hitfix.com|last=McWeeny|first=Drew|date=July 6, 2013|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro stated: "I was very careful how I built the movie. One of the other things I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's not going to be a sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character."&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt; Noting that the other actors were exhausted and "destroyed physically" by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained… I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' I try to do that in my life now."&lt;ref name="Kline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekexchange.com/guillermo-del-toro-talks-pacific-rim-robots-monsters-cast-and-more-52179.html |title=GUILLERMO DEL TORO TALKS PACIFIC RIM ROBOTS, MONSTERS, CAST, AND MORE! |work=geekexchange.com |last=Kline |first=Doug |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708092944/http://www.geekexchange.com/guillermo-del-toro-talks-pacific-rim-robots-monsters-cast-and-more-52179.html |archivedate=July 8, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mana Ashida]] plays Mako as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyohive.com/article/2012/12/ashida-mana-to-make-her-hollywood-debut-in-pacific-rim/|title=Ashida Mana to make her Hollywood debut in 'Pacific Rim'|date=December 13, 2012|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charlie Day]] as Dr. Newt Geiszler:
: A scientist studying the Kaiju. Day stated: "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide a little bit of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/charlie-day-pacific-rim-interview/|title=Charlie Day Talks How He Got Involved with the Project, Bringing Levity to the Story, the Giant Sets, and More on the Set of ''PACIFIC RIM''|work=collider.com|last=Weintraub|first=Steve 'Frosty'|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a [[celebrity chef]], with tattoos and a "big personality".&lt;ref name="Julian" /&gt; According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'': "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." Trek Buccino portrays Newt as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IGN Heads to the Set of Pacific Rim|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/20/ign-heads-to-the-set-of-pacific-rim|accessdate=July 26, 2014|website=ign.com|date=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Burn Gorman]] as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb:
: A scientist studying the Kaiju alongside Geiszler. According to del Toro, Gottlieb is a "tweed-wearing, English, [[phlegmatic]] introvert that never leaves the lab". The modest Gottlieb resents Geiszler's arrogance and radical behavior; the duo echo the film's theme of incompatible people functioning together when the time comes.&lt;ref name="Julian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAZfjnBtaOU|title=Guillermo del Toro On ''Pacific Rim''|last=Julian|first=Mark|work=youtube.com|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=June 29, 2013|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drew Adkins portrays Gottlieb as a child.
* [[Ron Perlman]] as Hannibal Chau:
: A [[black market]]eer who makes a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, "I actually think this character was designed to be played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [del Toro] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/ron-perlman-pacific-rim-interview/|title=Ron Perlman Talks Developing His Own Character, Practical Effects vs. CG, His Relationship with Guillermo del Toro, &amp; More on the Set of ''PACIFIC RIM''|work=collider.com|last=Weintraub|first=Steve 'Frosty'|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pacific Rim'' marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, you can make your own story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience."&lt;ref name="IGN-1" /&gt; The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardianlv.com/2013/07/pacific-rim-ron-perlmans-new-direction-in-life/|title=''Pacific Rim'': Ron Perlman's New Direction in Life|work=guardianlv.com|last=Shamsul|first=Jayeeta|date=July 14, 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Chau states he took the name from his [[Hannibal|favorite historical figure]] and his second-favorite [[Szechuan cuisine|Szechuan restaurant]] in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="Kline" /&gt; Del Toro drew inspiration from [[Burt Lancaster]]'s performance in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' when writing the character.&lt;ref name="Boston" /&gt;
* [[Max Martini]] as Hercules "Herc" Hansen:
: Chuck's father and co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated the fact that he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they developed a bond while filming, "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog."&lt;ref name="LATimes 2013-07-15" /&gt; The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh "might start to feel like ''[[Sons of Anarchy]] 2.0''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toromagazine.com/features/talking-to/20130729/guillermo-del-toro|title=Talking to...

== Themes ==
In the film, a Jaeger's neural load is too much for a single pilot to handle alone, meaning they must first be psychically linked to another pilot—a concept called "drifting". When pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate knowledge of each other's memories and feelings, and have no choice but to accept them; del Toro found this concept's dramatic potential compelling. The director expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The pilots' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that we're all together in the same robot [in life]… Either we get along or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Del Toro acknowledged this message's simplicity, but said he would have liked to have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child.&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2013/07/06/pacific-rim-latest-heartfelt-project-from-guillermo-del-toro/aTU5X0wLpNaUe1GpbHqDUO/story.html|title=''Pacific Rim'' is the heartfelt project from del Toro|last=Russo|first=Tom|work=bostonglobe.com|date=July 6, 2013|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's ten primary characters all have "little arcs" conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: "I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together." The director noted that ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'' and ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.&lt;ref name="Beaks1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/63167|title=Mr. Beaks Talks PACIFIC RIM, World Building And Gargantuas With Guillermo del Toro And Travis Beacham! Part One Of Two!|work=aintitcool.com|author=Mr. Beaks|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film centers on the relationship between Becket and Mori, but is not a love story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot their Jaeger, they undergo a process of "opening up", gaining access to each other's thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one of respect and "perfect trust". Hunnam commented that the film is "a love story without a love story. It's about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself".&lt;ref name="trauma" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/chralie-hunnam-pacific-rim-interview/|title=Charlie Hunnam Talks Love and Psychic Bonds in ''Pacific Rim''|work=screenrant.com|last=Outlaw|first=Kofi|date=August 2012|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Becket and Mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script's central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically "become one", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/pacificrim/a/guillermo-del-toro-charlie-hunnam-ron-perlman.htm|title=Director Guillermo del Toro Discusses ''Pacific Rim''|work=movies.about.com|last=Murray|first=Rebecca|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro emphasized the characters' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the way he would a sex scene.&lt;ref name="timeout-QA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/tony-q-a-pacific-rims-guillermo-del-toro|title=TONY Q&amp;A: ''Pacific Rim''{{'}}s Guillermo del Toro|last=Fear|first=David|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Toro, a self-described [[pacifist]], avoided what he termed "car commercial aesthetics" or "army recruitment video aesthetics", and gave the characters [[Western (genre)|Western]] ranks including "marshal" and "ranger" rather than military ranks such as "captain", "major" or "general". The director stated: "I avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. We have enough firepower in the world."&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2013/07/05/pacific_rims_guillermo_del_toro_is_a_monsterloving_pacifist.html|title=''Pacific Rim''{{'}}s Guillermo del Toro is a monster-loving pacifist|work=thestar.com|last=Howell|first=Peter|date=July 5, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction featured in contemporary blockbuster films, and made a point of showing the streets and buildings being evacuated before Kaiju attacks, ensuring that the destruction depicted is "completely remorseless". The director stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't want people being crushed. I want the joy that I used to get seeing [[Godzilla]] toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank… What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile the status quo is and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no correlation to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, "I'm going to destroy Seattle." In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/174835-shock-interview-guillermo-del-toro-on-the-development-destruction-and-family-friendly-pacific-rim|title=Shock Interview: Guillermo del Toro on the Development, Destruction and Family-Friendly ''Pacific Rim''|website=shocktillyoudrop.com|last=Turek|first=Ryan|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', [[Wai Chee Dimock]] connected the film's central theme of ''togetherness'' to its recurring image of missing shoes, stating the "utopian dream" driving the characters is

&lt;blockquote&gt;that puny humans like us could be "together"—not only in the specific neural melding that must take place between the two Jaeger co-pilots but also, more generally speaking, in a [[fractal]] web of resemblance, filling the world with copies of ourselves at varying orders of magnitude and with varying degrees of re-expression, beginning with the shoes on our feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/pacific-rim-guillermo-del-toros-fractal-shoes|title=''Pacific Rim'': Guillermo del Toro's Fractal Shoes|work=[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]|last=Dimock|first=Wai Chee|authorlink=Wai Chee Dimock|date=July 27, 2013|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Production ==

=== Development ===
In February 2006, it was reported that [[Guillermo del Toro]] would direct [[Travis Beacham]]'s fantasy screenplay, ''Killing on Carnival Row'', but the project never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empiremovies.com/2006/02/09/guillermo-del-toro-directing-carnival-row/|title=Guillermo Del Toro Directing ''Carnival Row''|last=Cullin|first=Liam|work=empiremovies.com|date=February 9, 2006|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beacham conceived ''Pacific Rim'' the following year. While walking on the beach near [[Santa Monica Pier]], the screenwriter imagined a giant robot and a giant monster fighting to the death. "They just sort of materialized out of the fog, these vast, godlike things." He later conceived the idea that each robot had two pilots, asking "what happens when one of those people dies?" Deciding this would be "a story about loss, moving on after loss, and dealing with [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]]", Beacham commenced writing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacificrimbook.com/content/uploads/PacificRimSpread1.pdf|title=Monsters in the Mist|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512184641/http://pacificrimbook.com/content/uploads/PacificRimSpread1.pdf|archivedate=May 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 2010, it was reported that [[Legendary Pictures]] had purchased Beacham's detailed 25-page [[film treatment]], now titled ''Pacific Rim''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/05/legendary-pictures-re-teams-with-clash-of-the-titans-scribe-on-pacific-rim/ |title=Legendary Pictures Re-Teams With ''Clash Of The Titans'' Scribe On ''Pacific Rim'' |last=Fleming |first=Mike |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512210325/http://www.deadline.com/2010/05/legendary-pictures-re-teams-with-clash-of-the-titans-scribe-on-pacific-rim/ |archivedate=May 12, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2010, it was reported that del Toro would next direct an adaptation of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' for [[Universal Studios]], with [[James Cameron]] producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/07/guillermo-del-toro-and-james-cameron-ready-to-climb-at-the-mountains-of-madness-together-at-universal/|title=Guillermo Del Toro And James Cameron Ready To Climb ‘Mountains Of Madness’|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 28, 2010|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When del Toro met with Legendary Pictures to discuss the possibility of collaborating with them on a film, he was intrigued by Beacham's treatment—still a "very small pitch" at this point.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-scheidt/pacific-rim-costumes_b_1663227.html|title=Exclusive Sneak Peak of the Costumes From Guillermo del Toro's ''Pacific Rim'' and Interview|last=Scheidt|first=Dave|website=The Huffington Post|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro struck a deal with Legendary: while directing ''At the Mountains of Madness'', he would produce and co-write ''Pacific Rim''; because of the films' conflicting production schedules, he would direct ''Pacific Rim'' only if ''At the Mountains of Madness'' were cancelled.&lt;ref name="AICN-Quint" /&gt; [[Tom Cruise]] was attached to star in the Lovecraft adaptation.&lt;ref name="GDT-Collider" /&gt;

On March 7, 2011, it was reported that Universal would not proceed with ''At the Mountains of Madness'' because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/delays-on-at-the-mountains-of-madness-creates-competition-for-guillermo-del-toros-next-picture-as-legendary-preps-pacific-rim/|title=Competition For Guillermo Del Toro’s Next Picture: Legendary Preps ‘Pacific Rim’|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=March 7, 2011|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/qa-guillermo-del-toro-on-why-he-will-direct-pacific-rim-after-at-the-mountains-of-madness-fell-apart/|title=Q&amp;A: Guillermo Del Toro On Why He Will Next Direct ''Pacific Rim'' After ''At The Mountains Of Madness'' Fell Apart|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director later reflected, "When it happened, this has never happened to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't want to sound like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie."&lt;ref name="HeroComplex" /&gt; The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct ''Pacific Rim'' the following Monday.&lt;ref name="GDT-Collider" /&gt;

Del Toro spent a year working with Beacham on the screenplay, and is credited as co-writer. He introduced ideas he had always wished to see in the genre, such as a Kaiju birth and a Kaiju attack seen from a child's perspective.&lt;ref name="timeout-QA" /&gt; The script also received an uncredited rewrite from [[Neil Cross]], who previously created the Idris Elba-starring drama series ''[[Luther (TV series)|Luther]]'' and wrote the del Toro-produced [[horror film]] ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/luther-neil-cross-day-of-triffids-ghost-house-sam-raimi-guillermo-del-toro-296001|title=''Luther'' Creator Neil Cross Set to Grow Ghost House's ''Day of the Triffids'' Adaptation|last=Kit|first=Boris|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=February 29, 2012|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]] were enlisted to perform uncredited rewrites when their [[spec script]] ''Monstropolis'' caught the filmmaker's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/pacific-rim-writers-god-war-game-adaptation-347251|title=''Pacific Rim'' Writers Tapped for ''God of War'' Adaptation (Exclusive)|last=Kit|first=Boris|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=October 7, 2012|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drew Pearce]] also carried out uncredited work on the script.&lt;ref name="scriptuncredited"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/pacific-rim-update-guillermo-del-toro-sandy-154681/|title='Pacific Rim' Production Update From Guillermo del Toro|website=Screenrant|accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principal photography ===
[[Principal photography|Filming]] began on November 14, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2011/11/16/guillermo-del-toro-gives-update-on-pacific-rim-production-ha.html|title=Guillermo del Toro gives Update on ''PACIFIC RIM'' – Production has Begun|date=November 20, 2011|accessdate=February 20, 2012|website=geektyrant}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in [[Toronto]] into April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/tfto/pdf/currentlist.pdf |title=Productions currently filming in Toronto |website=toronto.ca|publisher=Toronto Film and Television Office |location=[[Toronto]] |date=January 26, 2012 |accessdate=February 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjlOmVTp?url=http://www.toronto.ca/tfto/pdf/currentlist.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro gave an update after the second week on filming finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turek |first=Ryan |url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=22067 |title=Guillermo Del Toro Offers ''Pacific Rim'' Update |website=Shock Till You Drop |date=November 29, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was referred to as ''Silent Seas'' and ''Still Seas'' during production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bettinger|first=Brendan|title=New Video and Photos from the ''PACIFIC RIM'' Set Show How Guillermo del Toro Turned Toronto Into Tokyo|url=http://collider.com/tag/still-seas/|website=Collider.com|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Toro had never shot a film in less than 115 days, but had only 103 to shoot ''Pacific Rim''. In order to achieve this, del Toro scheduled a splinter unit that he could direct early in the day, before main unit, and on his off-days. The director worked 17 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, for much of the schedule. Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing "looser" movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: "Everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later. I do not delegate anything. Some people like it, some people don't, but it has to be done that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/inside-pacific-rim-with-guillermo-del-toro-1200489073/ |title=Inside ''Pacific Rim'' with Guillermo del Toro |last=Cohen |first=David S. |work=variety.com |date=May 29, 2013 |accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot using [[Red Epic]] cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guillermo del Toro Talks ''PACIFIC RIM'', Why They Used the RED EPIC &amp; Didn’t Do 3D; Reveals Blu-ray Will Have 30 Minutes of Deleted Scenes|url=http://collider.com/pacific-rim-deleted-scenes-blu-ray/185377/|website=Collider}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first Guillermo del Toro decided not to shoot or convert the film to [[3D film|3D]], as the effect would not work due to the sheer size of the film's robots and monsters, explaining

&lt;blockquote&gt;I didn't want to make the movie 3D because when you have things that big… the thing that happens naturally, you're looking at two buildings lets say at 300 feet [away], if you move there is no [[parallax]]. They're so big that, in 3D, you barely notice anything no matter how fast you move… To force the 3D effects for robots and monsters that are supposed to be big you are making their [perspective] miniaturized, making them human scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaefer|first=Sandy|title=Guillermo del Toro: ''Pacific Rim'' Is Not Japanese Monster Movie Homage; No 3D|url=http://screenrant.com/guillermo-del-toro-pacific-rim-japan-anime/|website=Screenrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was later announced that the film would be converted to 3D, with the conversion taking 40 weeks longer than most. Del Toro said: "What can I tell you? I changed my mind. I'm not running for office. I can do a [[Mitt Romney|Romney]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|title=Guillermo del Toro Talks The Strain and ''Pacific Rim''{{'}}s 3D Conversion|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/170043-guillermo-del-toro-talks-the-strain-and-pacific-rims-3d-conversion|website=Shock Till You Drop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Toro cut approximately an hour of material from the film. The unused footage explored the characters and their arcs in greater detail, but the director felt it was necessary to strike a balance, stating: "We cannot pretend this is [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] with monsters and giant robots. I cannot pretend I'm doing a profound reflection on mankind." Each character's arc was edited down to its minimal requirements.&lt;ref name="Beaks1" /&gt; The director wanted to keep the film around two hours, particularly for younger viewers. [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]] and [[Alfonso Cuarón]] helped with the editing; Iñárritu removed ten minutes of footage, while Cuarón removed "a few minutes" and rearranged several scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/pacific-rim-guillermo-del-toro-interview.html|title=''Pacific Rim''{{'}}s Guillermo del Toro on 3-D, Long Movies, and Mexican Matinees|last=Cruz|first=Gilbert|work=vulture.com|date=July 10, 2013|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iñárritu and Cuarón receive a "special thanks" in the film's end credits, as do [[James Cameron]] and [[David Cronenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Longshore|first1=James|title=Film review: Pacific Rim – Sit in the back|url=http://www.romania-insider.com/film-review-pacific-rim-sit-in-the-back/103834/|accessdate=July 26, 2014|website=Romania-Insider.com|date=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
[[File:El coloso.jpg|thumb|Del Toro drew inspiration from [[Francisco Goya]]'s ''[[The Colossus (painting)|The Colossus]]'', and hoped to evoke the same "sense of awe" with the film's battles.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post" /&gt;]]
Del Toro envisioned ''Pacific Rim'' as an earnest, colorful adventure story, with an "incredibly airy and light feel", in contrast to the "super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie". The director focused on "big, beautiful, sophisticated visuals" and action that would satisfy an adult audience, but has stated his "real hope" is to introduce the Kaiju and mecha genres to a generation of children.&lt;ref name="HeroComplex"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/guillermo-del-toro-edges-toward-greater-success-with-pacific-rim/ | title = Guillermo del Toro edges toward greater success with ''Pacific Rim'' | last = McIntyre | first = Gina | work = Hero Complex – movies, comics, pop culture | publisher = Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the film draws heavily on these genres, it avoids direct references to previous works. Del Toro intended to create something original but "madly in love" with its influences, instilled with "epic beauty" and "operatic grandeur".&lt;ref name="Blastr" /&gt; The end credits dedicate the film to [[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Ishirō Honda]], who helped to establish the giant monster genre with films such as ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' and ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Scott|title=Pacific Rim After The Credits Spoiler|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/07/13/pacific-rim-after-the-credits-spoiler/|website=comicbook.com|date=July 13, 2013|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was to honor the Kaiju and mecha genres while creating an original stand-alone film, something "conscious of the heritage, but not a [[pastiche]] or an homage or a greatest hits of everything". The director made a point of starting from scratch, without emulating or referencing any previous examples of those genres. He cautioned his designers not to turn to films like ''[[Gamera (film)|Gamera]]'', ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', or ''[[The War of the Gargantuas]]'' for inspiration, stating: "I didn't want to be [[Postmodernist film|postmodern]], or referential, or just belong to a genre. I really wanted to create something new, something madly in love with those things. I tried to bring epic beauty to it, and drama and operatic grandeur."&lt;ref name="Blastr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2012/07/heres_why_del_toro_says_p.php|title=Why Del Toro warned ''Pacific Rim'' designers never to watch ''Godzilla''|work=blastr.com|last=Castro|first=Adam-Troy|date=July 17, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/guillermo-del-toro-wants-pacific-rim-kaiju-to-start-from-scratch/|title=Guillermo del Toro wants ''Pacific Rim'' Kaiju to 'start from scratch'|work=herocomplex.latimes.com|last=Clark|first=Noelene|date=August 2, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than popular culture, he drew inspiration from works of art such as ''[[The Colossus (painting)|The Colossus]]'' and [[George Bellows]]'s boxing paintings.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington Post 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/02/guillermo-del-toro-pacific-rim_n_3536028.html|title=Guillermo Del Toro's ''Pacific Rim'' Brings Back The Monster Movie|work=huffingtonpost.com|last=Coyle|first=Jake|date=July 2, 2013|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's designers include [[Wayne Barlowe]], [[Oscar Chichoni]], monster sculptors David Meng and Simon Lee, and ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army|Hellboy II]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' designer Francisco Ruiz Velasco.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post" /&gt; Del Toro has acknowledged that some designs created for his cancelled ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' adaptation may have been used in ''Pacific Rim''.&lt;ref name="timeout-QA" /&gt;

Approximately one hundred Kaiju and one hundred Jaegers were designed, but only a fraction of these appear in the film; every week the filmmakers would "do an ''[[American Idol]]''" and vote for the best.&lt;ref name="Sacks" /&gt; In designing Kaiju, the film's artists frequently drew inspiration from nature rather than other works. The director commented: "Kaijus are essentially outlandish in a way, but on the other hand they come sort of in families: you've got the reptilian Kaiju, the insect Kaiju, the sort of crustacean Kaiju… So to take an outlandish design and then render it with an attention to real animal anatomy and detail is interesting."&lt;ref name="aintitcool50956"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/50956|title=Guillermo Del Toro And Mr. Beaks Discuss DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK, PACIFIC RIM And The Far-From-Used-Up Future Of AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS!|author=Mr. Beaks|work=aintitcool.com|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=August 24, 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro avoided making the Kaiju too similar to any Earth creatures, instead opting to make them otherworldly and alien.&lt;ref name="io9-Barlowe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/why-pacific-rim-doesnt-look-like-any-movie-youve-ever-708314921|title=Why ''Pacific Rim'' Doesn't Look Like Any Movie You've Ever Seen Before|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|work=io9.com|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro called the film's Kaiju "weapons", stating that they are "the cleaning crew, the cats sent into the warehouse to clean out the mice." Certain design elements are shared by all the Kaiju; this is intended to suggest that they are connected and were designed for a similar purpose.&lt;ref name="AICN-Quint" /&gt; Each Kaiju was given a vaguely humanoid silhouette to echo the man-in-suit aesthetic of early Japanese Kaiju films.&lt;ref name="Unbelievable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/umm-kaiju-with-a-blade-sticking-out-of-its-head-reall-635133974|title=Unbelievable ''Pacific Rim'' video reveals all of the Kaiju's secrets|work=io9.com|last=Woerner|first=Meredith|date=July 1, 2013|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While del Toro's other films feature ancient or damaged monsters, the Kaiju lack scars or any evidence of prior culture, indicating that they are engineered creations rather than the result of an evolutionary system.&lt;ref name="io9-Barlowe" /&gt;

Knifehead, the first Kaiju to appear in the film, is a tribute to the plodding kaiju of 1960s Japanese films, and is intended to look almost like a man in a rubber suit; its head was inspired by that of a [[goblin shark]].&lt;ref name="Beaks1" /&gt; Leatherback, the bouncer-like Kaiju which spews electro-magnetic charges, is a favorite of del Toro, who conceived it as a "brawler with this sort of beer belly"; the lumbering movements of gorillas were used as a reference.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; The Kaiju Otachi homages the dragons of Chinese mythology. The director called it a "Swiss army knife of a Kaiju"; with almost 20 minutes of screen time, it was given numerous features so the audience would not tire of it. The creature moves like a Komodo dragon in water, sports multiple jaws and an acid-filled neck sack, and unfurls wings when necessary.&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/meet-monstrous-kaijus-pacific-rim-article-1.1388688|title=The Kaijus and Jaegers of Guillermo del Toro's 'Pacific Rim' are modern updates on classic movie monsters like Godzilla|last=Sacks|first=Ethan|work=nydailynews.com|date=July 7, 2013|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also more intelligent than the other Kaiju, employing eagle-inspired strategies against the Jaegers.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; Onibaba, the Kaiju that orphans Mako Mori, resembles a fusion of a Japanese temple and a crustacean.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; Slattern, the largest Kaiju, is distinguished by its extremely long neck and "half-horn, half-crown" head, which del Toro considered both demonic and majestic.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;

''Gipsy Danger'', the American Jaeger, was based on the shape of New York City's [[Art Deco]] buildings, such as the [[Chrysler Building]] and the [[Empire State Building]], but infused with [[John Wayne]]'s gunslinger gait and hip movements. ''Cherno Alpha'', the Russian Jaeger, was based on the shape and paint patterns of a T-series Russian tank, combined with a giant containment silo to give the appearance of a walking nuclear power plant with a [[cooling tower]] on its head.&lt;ref name="Sacks" /&gt; ''Crimson Typhoon'', the three-armed Chinese Jaeger, is piloted by triplets and resembles a "medieval little warrior"; its texture evokes Chinese lacquered wood with golden edges.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/07/09/pacific-rim-industrial-light-magic-del-toro-special-effects/2480799/|title=''Pacific Rim'': A monster challenge for special effects|work=usatoday.com|last=della Cava|first=Marco R.|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Striker Eureka'', the Australian Jaeger, is likened by del Toro to a [[Land Rover]]; the most elegant and masculine Jaeger, it has a jutting chest, a camouflage paint scheme recalling the Australian outback, and the bravado of its pilots.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;

The film's costumes were designed by [[Shane Mahan]] and Kate Hawley, who spent several months on the costumes of the Jaeger pilots. The Russian pilot suits are old-fashioned and echo cosmonaut space suits.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"/&gt;

=== Visual effects ===
[[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] was chosen to create the visual effects for ''Pacific Rim''. Del Toro hired [[Academy Award|Oscar]] winners [[John Knoll]] and [[Hal T. Hickel]], both known for their work on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[prequel trilogy]] and the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' films. [[Legacy Effects]] co-owner [[Shane Mahan]], known for creating the armored suits for ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', was tasked with building the suits, helmets and conn-pods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qBfMPFmmm4|title=PACIFIC RIM Behind The Scenes: The Pilot Suits - Legacy Effects|date=July 17, 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar winner [[Clay Pinney]], known for his work on ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', was also brought on board.

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|thumb|Del Toro used classic art such as [[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' as a reference for the film's ocean battles.]]
Del Toro conceived the film as an ''operatic'' work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That was one of the first words I said to the entire team at ILM. I said, "This movie needs to be theatrical, operatic, romantic." We used a lot of words not usually associated with high-tech blockbusters … We went for a very, very, very, very saturated color palette for the battle for Hong Kong. I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The classic Japanese [[woodblock print]] ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' by [[Hokusai]] was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, "I would say 'Give me a Hokusai wave'… we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically."&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: "It's pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not something you would associate with a big sci-fi action movie." Del Toro considers the film's digital water its most exciting visual effect: "The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. We agreed on making the water become almost another character. We would time the water very precisely. I'd say 'Get out of the wave [on this frame].'"&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/pacific-rim-visual-effects-get-operatic-twist-1200488753/|title=''Pacific Rim'' Visual Effects Get Operatic Twist|last=Cohen|first=David S.|work=variety.com|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also features extensive [[miniature effect]] shots provided by 32TEN Studios, under the supervision of ILM VFX Producer Susan Greenhow and ILM VFX Supervisors John Knoll and Lindy DeQuattro. Shot using RED Epic cameras on 3D rigs, the scenes produced by 32TEN involved the creation of a quarter-scale office building interior which was destroyed by the fist of a Jaeger robot which was on a separate pneumatically controlled rig, as well as a sequence which depicted several rows of seats in a soccer stadium being blown apart as a Jaeger lands in the stadium, which was created by using quarter-scale seats blown apart by air cannons. Additionally 32TEN provided several [[Practical effects|practical]] elements for ILM’s compositing team including dust clouds, breaking glass and water effects.&lt;ref name="32TEN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/people/32ten-studios-provides-practical-effects-pacific-rim|title=32TEN Studios Provides Practical Effects for Pacific Rim|work=anw.com|date=July 15, 2013|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website's critical consensus reads, "It may sport more style than substance, but ''Pacific Rim'' is a solid modern creature feature bolstered by fantastical imagery and an irresistible sense of fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Rim (2013)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pacific_rim_2013/|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s [[Robbie Collin]] awarded the film five stars out of five, likening the experience of watching it to rediscovering a favorite childhood cartoon. He praised del Toro for investing his own affection for the genre and sense of artistry into the project in such a way that the viewer found themselves immersed in the film rather than watching from afar, noting the director had catered to younger and older audiences alike and expressed surprise that the film could rise above the sum of its parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10162332/Pacific-Rim-review.html|title=''Pacific Rim'', review|last=Collin|first=Robbie|work=telegraph.com|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave a positive review, describing the film as the sum of the potential every monster film had ever tried to fulfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/pacific-rim/review/581518|title=''Pacific Rim'': Film Review|work=hollywoodreporter.com|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|authorlink=Todd McCarthy|date=July 7, 2013|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lou Lumenick]] of ''[[The New York Post]]'' gave the film four stars out of four, and said it had "no shortage of brains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry", praising the "clean and coherent" action sequences and the "terrific chemistry" between Hunnam and Kikuchi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/pacific_rim_baddies_are_big_but_NullCtb04GocGTlszZw83O|title=''Pacific Rim'' baddies are big, but the heroes are better|last=Lumenick|first=Lou|authorlink=Lou Lumenick|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drew McWeeny]] of [[HitFix]] highlighted other aspects of the film, paying particular attention to the production and art design.

He said the Kaijus' civilian victims make a "palpably personal impression", deeming one scene with Mako Mori "as mythically moving as anything in the mecha anime, like ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', that the director emulates with expert aplomb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/us/film/pacific-rim-movie-review|title=''Pacific Rim'': movie review (PG-13)|last=Uhlich|first=Keith|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s Stephanie Zacharek called it "summer entertainment with a pulse", praising its "dumbly brilliant" action and freedom from elitism, but noted the story is predictable and suggested del Toro's time would be better spent on more visionary films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-07-03/film/del-toro-s-pacific-rim-offers-monster-robot-glory/|title=''Pacific Rim'': Building a Better Blockbuster|work=villagevoice.com|last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angela Watercutter of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' called it the "most awesome movie of the summer", a "fist-pumping, awe-inspiring ride", and opined that its focus on spectacle rather than characterization "simply does not matter" in the summer blockbuster context.&lt;ref name="Wired-Watercutter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/07/pacific-rim-surprising-review/all/|title=Pacific Rim Is Literally the Most Awesome Movie of the Summer|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|work=wired.com|date=July 10, 2013|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Roeper]] gave the film a B, commenting that either the Jaegers or Kaiju "can take down any of the [[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelz.com/trailer-clips/70267/pacific-rim-review/ |title=''Pacific Rim'' Review |author=[[Richard Roeper|Roeper, Richard]] |website=[[Reelz (TV channel)|Reelz]] |date=July 12, 2013 |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716032806/http://www.reelz.com/trailer-clips/70267/pacific-rim-review/ |archivedate=July 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it "three-quarters of a really good movie that doesn't know when to quit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelz.com/trailer-clips/70236/pacific-rim-review/ |title=''Pacific Rim'' Review |author=[[Leonard Maltin|Maltin, Leonard]] |website=[[Reelz (TV channel)|Reelz]] |date=July 12, 2013 |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716070650/http://www.reelz.com/trailer-clips/70236/pacific-rim-review/ |archivedate=July 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make ''Pacific Rim'' any better.

The inclusion of only one female character of note resulted in ''Pacific Rim'' not passing the [[Bechdel test]]. This became a topic of discussion in the media and on the Internet. Opinions were divided between those pointing to the film as an example of Hollywood's practice of ostracizing women, and those noting that the film did not [[Sexual objectification|sexually objectify]] Mako Mori and gave her a narrative arc not revolving around a man.&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot 18 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Romano|first=Aja|title=The Mako Mori Test: 'Pacific Rim' inspires a Bechdel Test alternative|url=http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/mako-mori-test-bechdel-pacific-rim/|accessdate=September 15, 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro 18 July 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGuinness|first=Ross|title=The Bechdel test and why Hollywood is a man’s, man’s, man’s world|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/07/18/movie-lovers-hit-back-at-hollywood-misogyny-with-the-bechdel-test-3886103/|accessdate=September 15, 2013|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''SBK 2011: Superbike World Championship''''' is a motorcycle racing game, and the fifth installment of the SBK series developed by [[Milestone S.r.l.]] and published by [[Black Bean Games]]. The game features all the riders of the [[2011 Superbike World Championship]] and the teams and riders of the [[2010 Supersport World Championship season]] and [[Superstock 1000]] championship of 2010 just like ''[[SBK X: Superbike World Championship]]''. The game had a high reception of 8/10 on IGN, and as the 2010 title, it has an arcade and simulation mode with all the realistic motorbike settings, whilst the arcade has no realism and even slows the bike down off track.

It is a TV community site with user discussions, reviews, and news. SideReel acts as a medium, connecting users to content centered on the shows that interest them and organizing the information around those shows.

==History==
SideReel launched in April 2007 and was featured in [[CNET]]'s Webware "beta watch" that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9713579-2.html |title=Beta watch: SideReel opens new video wiki |publisher=[[CNET]] |author=Needleman, Rafe |date=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, SideReel was acquired by [[Rovi Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/video/rovi-sidereel/ |title=Rovi Buys Sidereel, Expands to the Web |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Allrovi.com site was launched.&lt;ref name=vator/&gt; The company also announced it had surpassed 1 million unique visitors in one day.&lt;ref name=vator/&gt;

In July 2013, Rovi spun off SideReel, along with AllGame, AllMovie, AllMusic, and Celebified, as [[All Media Network]]; the company's owners includes the original founders of SideReel and Ackrell Capital investor Mike Ackrell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/31/563685/10042754/en/Rovi-Corporation-Reports-Second-Quarter-2013-Financial-Performance.html |title=Rovi Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2013 Financial Performance Announces Agreements to Sell Rovi Entertainment Store and Consumer Website Businesses |publisher=globalnewswire.com |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2017-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808234118/https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/31/563685/10042754/en/Rovi-Corporation-Reports-Second-Quarter-2013-Financial-Performance.html |archivedate=2017-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131203005593/en |title=Digital Entertainment Veterans Launch 'All Media Network' to Perfect Digital Media Discovery |publisher=BusinessWire |date=December 3, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 2014, a free SideReel app was launched, allowing fans to find, track and watch their favorite TV series on iOS devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/lostremote/sidereel-app-lets-fans-watch-and-track-their-favorite-shows-on-ios-devices/42802 |title=SideReel app lets fans watch and track their favorite shows on iOS devices|website=adweek.com |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's Android and iOS apps were later withdrawn as they were too unprofitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sidereel.com/an-important-update-about-the-sidereel-ios-and-android-apps/ |title=An Important Update About the SideReel iOS and Android Apps |website=SideReel.com |accessdate=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
SideReel compiles a comprehensive list of television shows and movies and aggregates content for them. The site provides links to view full episodes online, as well as a forum to discuss and review TV shows and movies.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/21/business/la-fi-ct-piracy-20100921/2 |title=Hollywood sounds alarm as streaming video websites enable a new wave of piracy |date=September 21, 2010 |author=Chmielewski, Dawn C. |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This site allows users to actively collaborate on updating site content, and uses [[Facebook Connect]] to foster user participation and a sense of community. Users of Connect can see what shows friends like, and share their favorites.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Criticism==
In 2010, an LA Times article was published using interviews with unnamed anti-piracy experts who accused SideReel of being a way for viewers to watch shows that are not available online by linking to pirated streaming sites. The company denied the charges, stating that it was merely a specialized search engine that points to legitimate sites and removes infringing links when notified of them.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

'''''Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith''''' is a 2005 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] film written and directed by [[George Lucas]]. It is the sixth entry of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series and stars [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Hayden Christensen]], [[Ian McDiarmid]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], and [[Frank Oz]]. A sequel to ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999) and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), it is the third and final installment in the ''Star Wars'' [[prequel trilogy]].

The film begins three years after the onset of the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. The [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]] are spread across the [[Star Wars galaxy|galaxy]], leading a massive war against the Separatists. The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] to eliminate the notorious [[General Grievous]], leader of the Separatist Army. Meanwhile, Jedi Knight [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] grows close to [[Palpatine]], the Supreme Chancellor of the [[Galactic Republic]] and, unknown to the public, a [[Sith|Sith Lord]] known as Darth Sidious. Their deepening friendship threatens the [[Jedi Order]], the Republic, and Anakin himself.

Lucas began writing the script before production of ''Attack of the Clones'' ended. Production of ''Revenge of the Sith'' started in September 2003, and filming took place in Australia with additional locations in Thailand, Switzerland, China, Italy and the United Kingdom. ''Revenge of the Sith'' premiered on May 15, 2005, at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], then released worldwide on May 19, 2005. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, especially in contrast to the mixed reviews of the previous two [[Prequel trilogy|prequels]]: praise was directed towards its action sequences, mature themes, musical score, visual effects, and the performances of McGregor, McDiarmid, Oz, and [[Jimmy Smits]]; criticism was aimed at the film's screenplay, inconsistent tone, and Christensen's performance.

''Revenge of the Sith'' broke several [[box office]] records during its opening week and went on to earn over $848 million worldwide,&lt;ref name="Mojo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starwars3.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it, at the time, the third-highest-grossing film in the ''Star Wars'' [[media franchise|franchise]], unadjusted for [[inflation]]. It was the highest-grossing film in the U.S. in 2005 and [[2005 in film#Highest-grossing films|the second-highest grossing film worldwide]], behind ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.&lt;ref name="Mojo" /&gt; The film also holds the record for the highest opening day gross on a Thursday, making $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/days/?page=thu&amp;p=.htm|title=Opening Thursday Records at the Box Office|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
Three years after the Battle of [[Geonosis]], the galaxy is in a state of civil war. During a space battle over [[Coruscant]], [[Jedi|Jedi master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] lead a mission to rescue the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor [[Palpatine]] from the cyborg Separatist commander, [[General Grievous]]. After infiltrating Grievous's [[flagship]], the Jedi battle [[Count Dooku]], whom Anakin eventually executes at Palpatine's urging. Grievous escapes the battle-torn [[cruiser]], in which the Jedi crash-land on Coruscant. There, Anakin reunites with his wife, [[Padmé Amidala]], who reveals that she is [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. While initially excited, Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of Padmé [[Maternal death|dying in childbirth]], and his worry steadily grows.

Palpatine appoints Anakin to the [[Jedi Council]] as his representative and informant, but the Council declines to grant Anakin the rank of Jedi Master and orders him to spy on Palpatine, causing Anakin's faith in the Jedi to diminish significantly. Palpatine tempts Anakin with secret knowledge of the dark side of [[the Force]], including the "power to save his loved ones from dying". Meanwhile, Obi-Wan travels to [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]], where he finds and kills Grievous, and Yoda travels to [[Kashyyyk]] to defend the planet from invasion. Palpatine eventually reveals to Anakin that he is the [[Sith|Sith Lord]], Darth Sidious, saying that only he has the knowledge to save Padmé from dying. Torn between staying loyal to the Jedi and saving Padmé, Anakin reports Palpatine's treachery to [[Mace Windu]], who confronts and subdues Palpatine, severely disfiguring him in the process. Fearing that he will lose Padmé, Anakin intervenes on Palpatine's behalf and severs Windu's hand, allowing Palpatine to throw him out of a window to his death using force lightning. Anakin pledges himself to Palpatine, who dubs him [[Darth Vader]]. Palpatine issues [[Great Jedi Purge#Order 66|Order 66]] for the [[clone trooper]]s to kill the remaining Jedi, and dispatches Vader along with a band of clones to kill everyone in the Jedi Temple. Vader then massacres the remaining Separatist leaders hiding on the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]], while Palpatine addresses the [[Galactic Senate]], transforming the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and declaring himself Emperor. Having survived the chaos, Obi-Wan and [[Yoda]] return to Coruscant and learn of Anakin's betrayal.

Unable to convince Padmé about Anakin's turn to the dark side, Obi-Wan secretly stows aboard Padmé's ship when she travels to Mustafar, where she implores Anakin to abandon the dark side and run away with her. Upon witnessing Obi-Wan present, Vader chokes Padmé into unconsciousness in a fit of rage, thinking that she brought Obi-Wan to kill him. Obi-Wan engages Vader in a deadly lightsaber duel over a river of lava and ultimately defeats Vader, severing both of his legs and his remaining organic arm, and leaves him at the bank of a lava river where he is horribly burned. On Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a [[Tie (draw)|stalemate]]. Yoda then flees with [[Bail Organa]] while Palpatine, sensing that his apprentice is in danger, travels to Mustafar.

On the asteroid [[Polis Massa]], Obi-Wan regroups with Yoda, and Padmé gives birth to a twin son and daughter, whom she names [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia]] before dying shortly after. On Mustafar, Palpatine finds a horribly burnt Vader still alive. After returning to Coruscant, Vader's mutilated body is treated and covered in a black armored suit. When Vader asks about his wife, Palpatine explains to Vader that he himself killed Padmé in his rage, devastating him and leaving him in pain. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Yoda conceal the twins from the Sith, as they are the galaxy's only hope for freedom. Yoda [[exile]]s himself to the planet [[Dagobah]], while Vader and the Emperor oversee the construction of [[Death Star|a huge space station]]. Bail Organa adopts Leia and takes her to [[Alderaan]], while Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-family, [[Owen Lars|Owen]] and [[Beru Lars]] on [[Tatooine]], where Obi-Wan intends to watch over Luke until the time is right to challenge the Empire.

==Production==

===Writing===
Lucas stated that he conceived the ''Star Wars'' saga's story in the form of a plot outline in 1973. However, he later clarified that, at the time of the saga's conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points.&lt;ref name="DVDcom"&gt;''Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith'' DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Rob Coleman, John Knoll and Roger Guyett, [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; He began working on the screenplay for ''Episode III'' even before the previous film, ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', was released, proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Rinzler|2005|pp=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kaminski, in ''The Secret History of Star Wars'', surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin's fall to the dark side and radically re-organized the plot. For instance, instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin, ending the film's first act with his killing of Count Dooku, an action that signals his descent to the dark side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation no brackets|Kaminski|2007|pp=380–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of fans speculated online about the film's subtitle; rumored titles included ''Rise of the Empire'', ''The Creeping Fear'' (which was also named as the film's title on the official website on April Fool's 2004), and ''Birth of the Empire''.&lt;ref name="IGN1"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=IGN | title=Episode III Title Rumors |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/516/516511p1.html| accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, ''Revenge of the Sith'' also became a title guessed by fans that George Lucas would indirectly confirm.&lt;ref name="CConfidential"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Cinema Confidential|title= Lucas: Fans have already guessed the "Episode III" title|url=http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0406153|date=June 15, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926122931/http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0406153|archivedate=September 26, 2011|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is a reference to ''Revenge of the Jedi'', the original title of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''; Lucas changed the title scant weeks before the premiere of ''Return of the Jedi'', declaring that Jedi do not seek revenge.&lt;ref name="EmpireOfDreams"&gt;''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy'' Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary, [2004].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Lucas refocused the film on Anakin, he had to sacrifice certain extraneous plot points relating to ''Attack of the Clones''. Lucas had previously promised fans that he would explain the mystery behind the erasure of the planet [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]] from the Jedi Archives.&lt;ref name=DVDcom/&gt; However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to devote more time to Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author [[James Luceno]] to explain the mystery of Kamino's erasure and the origins of the Clone army in his [[Star Wars expanded universe|expanded universe]] novel ''[[Labyrinth of Evil]]''.

Lucas had originally planned to include even more ties to the original trilogy, and wrote early drafts of the script in which a 10-year-old [[Han Solo]] appeared on Kashyyyk, but the role was not cast or shot. He also wrote a scene in which Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he created him from [[midichlorians]], and is thus his "father", a clear parallel to Vader's revelation to Luke in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', but Lucas ejected this scene as well. Another planned scene by Lucas that was written during the early development of the film was a conversation between Master [[Yoda]] and the ghostly [[Qui Gon-Jinn]], with [[Liam Neeson]] reprising his role as Jinn (he also hinted his possible appearance in the film).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keck |first=William |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-01-09-palm-springs_x.htm |title=USATODAY.com - Movie-star night in Palm Springs |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2005-01-10 |accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scene was never filmed and Neeson was never recorded, although the scene was present in the film's novelization. Also, Neeson finally reprised the role in an episode of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blauvelt |first=Christian |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2011/01/20/liam-neeson-star-wars-clone-wars-exclusive |title=Liam Neeson to voice Qui-Gon Jinn in 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars' - EXCLUSIVE VIDEO |publisher=EW.com |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more changes in Anakin's character, sharpening Anakin's motivations for turning to the dark side. Lucas accomplished this "rewrite" through editing the principal footage and filming new scenes during [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]] in London in 2004.&lt;ref name="Within"&gt;''Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith'' DVD documentary ''Within a Minute'', [2005].&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous versions, Anakin had myriad reasons for turning to the dark side, one of which was his sincere belief that the Jedi were plotting to take over the Republic. Although this is still intact in the finished film, by revising and refilming many scenes, Lucas emphasized Anakin's desire to save Padmé from death. Thus, in the version that made it to theatres, Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to save Padmé.

===Art design===
After the screenplay's earliest draft was submitted, the art department began designing the various ways that each element could appear on screen.

For the [[Kashyyyk]] environment, the art department turned to ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' for inspiration.&lt;ref name="holiday"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=StarWars.com |title=Kashyyyk Revisited |url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/beacon116.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214071838/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/beacon116.html |accessdate=May 17, 2008 |archivedate=December 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a period of months, Lucas would approve hundreds of designs that would eventually appear in the film. He would later rewrite entire scenes and action sequences to correspond to certain designs he had chosen.&lt;ref name="Within" /&gt; The designs were then shipped to the pre-visualization department to create moving [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] versions known as animatics. [[Ben Burtt]] would edit these scenes with Lucas in order to previsualize what the film would look like before the scenes were filmed.&lt;ref name="Within" /&gt; The pre-visualization footage featured a basic raw CGI environment with equally unprocessed character models performing a scene, typically for action sequences. [[Steven Spielberg]] was brought in as a "guest director" to make suggestions to the art designers for the Mustafar duel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Within a Minute: The Making of 'Episode III'|publisher=20th Century Fox|medium=DVD|year=2005|minutes=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and oversee the pre-visualization of an unused version of the Utapau chase scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Star Wars: The Complete Saga Episodes I-VI Bonus Disc I: Utapau Deleted Scenes|publisher=20th Century Fox| medium=Blu-ray|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the pre-visualization and art department designs were sent to the production department to begin "bringing the film out of the concept phase"&lt;ref name="Within" /&gt; by building sets, props and costumes. To determine the required sets, Lucas analyzed each scene with the staff to see which moments the actors would come in most contact with the set, warranting it to be constructed.

===Filming===
Although the first scene filmed was the final scene to appear in the film (shot during the filming of ''Attack of the Clones'' in 2000),&lt;ref name="Suntan"&gt;''We Didn't Go to the Desert to Get a Suntan'' Episode II DVD Special Feature, [2002].&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The scene with Obi-Wan delivering Luke to the Lars homestead was reshot on a soundstage during the production of Episode III.{{harv|Kaminski|2008|p=397}}}} principal photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at [[Shepperton Studios]] and [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in [[London]] from August 2004 to January 31, 2005.&lt;ref name="Within"/&gt; The initial filming took place on soundstages at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in [[Sydney]], although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting [[Kashyyyk]], which were filmed in [[Phuket Province|Phuket, Thailand]] (they were later damaged by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]]). The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting at the same time that [[Mount Etna]] erupted in [[Italy]]. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.&lt;ref name="Within" /&gt;

While shooting key dramatic scenes, Lucas would often use an "A&amp;nbsp;camera" and "B&amp;nbsp;camera", or the "V&amp;nbsp;technique", a process that involves shooting with two or more cameras at the same time in order to gain several angles of the same performance.&lt;ref name="Within" /&gt; Using the HD technology developed for the film, the filmmakers were able to send footage to the editors the same day it was shot, a process that would require a full 24 hours had it been shot on film.&lt;ref name="Within" /&gt; Footage featuring the planet Mustafar was given to editor [[Roger Barton (film editor)|Roger Barton]], who was on location in [[Sydney, Australia]] cutting the climactic duel. All other footage was forwarded to lead editor Ben Burtt at Skywalker Ranch in [[California]].

[[Hayden Christensen]] says Lucas asked him "to bulk up and physically show the maturity that had taken place between the two films."&lt;ref name="MovieWeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movieweb.com/hayden-christensen-talks-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith/|last=B.|first=Brian|title=Hayden Christensen Talks Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith|date=October 10, 2005|website=Movieweb|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor says he worked out with a trainer in Sydney for three months and ate "six meals a day and on every protein, weight gain supplement that man has created" to go from 160lbs. to 185lbs.&lt;ref name="SciFi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rea|first1=Darren|title=Hayden Christensen Interview|url=http://www.sci-fi-online.com/Interview/05-11-01_HaydenChristensen.htm|website=Sc-Fi Online|accessdate=25 December 2016|date=1 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen and [[Ewan McGregor]] began rehearsing their climactic [[lightsaber]] duel long before Lucas would shoot it. They trained extensively with stunt coordinator [[Nick Gillard]] to memorize and perform their duel together. As in the previous prequel film, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes without the use of stunt doubles.&lt;ref name="Stunts"&gt;''Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith'' DVD documentary ''It's All for Real: The Stunts of Episode III'', [2005].&lt;/ref&gt; The speed at which Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.&lt;ref name="DVDcom"/&gt;

''Revenge of the Sith'' eventually became the first ''Star Wars'' film in which Anakin Skywalker and the suited Darth Vader were played by the same actor in the same film. As Christensen recounted, it was originally intended to simply have a "tall guy" in the Darth Vader costume, but after "begging and pleading" Christensen persuaded Lucas to have the Vader costume used in the film created specifically to fit him. The new costume featured shoe lifts and a muscle suit.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Freeman]] |title=Hayden Christensen on the Force and the Future |url=http://www.thefreeman.com/entertainment/story-20050521-30725.html |accessdate=May 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526144507/http://www.thefreeman.com/entertainment/story-20050521-30725.html |archivedate=May 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also required Christensen (who is {{convert|6|ft|1|in|disp=or}} tall) to look through the helmet's mouthpiece.&lt;ref name="Celebration"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=StarWars.com | title=Live from Italy: Hayden Christensen |url=http://www.starwars.com/community/event/celebration/f20050419/indexp15.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423225541/http://www.starwars.com/community/event/celebration/f20050419/indexp15.html| accessdate=May 17, 2008|archivedate=April 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Gary Oldman]] was originally approached to provide the voice of General Grievous;&lt;ref name="Oldman"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=MovieWeb |title=Gary Oldman in talks for Star Wars: Episode III |url=https://movieweb.com/gary-oldman-in-talks-for-star-wars-episode-iii/ |accessdate=April 12, 2018 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, complications arose during contract negotiations after Oldman learned the film was to be made outside of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], of which he is a member. He backed out of the role rather than violate the union's rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/544/544480p1.html|title=Oldman Out of Sith|date=September 4, 2004|publisher=IGN|accessdate=August 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]], who voiced Grievous, disputed this story at Celebration III, held in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]]. According to him, Oldman is a friend of producer [[Rick McCallum]], and thus recorded an audition as a favor to him, but was not chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Matthew | last = Wood| authorlink = Matthew Wood (sound editor)| title = Voicing Grievous| publisher = Celebration III | date = April 19, 2005 | location = Indianapolis, Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood, who was also the supervising sound editor, was in charge of the auditions and submitted his audition anonymously in the midst of 30 others, under the initials "A.S." for [[Alan Smithee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Visual effects===
The post-production department began work during filming and continued until weeks before the film was released in 2005. Special effects were created using almost all formats, including model work, CGI and practical effects. The same department later composited all such work into the filmed scenes—both processes taking nearly two years to complete. ''Revenge of the Sith'' has 2,151 shots that use special effects, a world record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/vfxworld/revenge-sith-part-1-circle-now-complete|title=Revenge of the Sith: Part 1&amp;nbsp;— The Circle is Now Complete|publisher=[[Animation World Network|VFXWorld]]|date=May 19, 2005|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[DVD]] featurette ''Within a Minute'' illustrates, the film required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone.&lt;ref name="Within" /&gt;&lt;!--- if a ref is a found, reinclude: The film was produced with a budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]113 million, making it the least expensive of the three [[prequel]] films. ---&gt; Members of Hyperspace, the Official Star Wars Fan Club, received a special look into the production. Benefits included not only special articles, but they also received access to a [[webcam]] that transmitted a new image every 20 seconds during the time it was operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, were spotted on the webcam.&lt;ref name="Hyperspace"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=StarWars.com | title=Hyperspace Online Star Wars Fan Club|url=http://www.starwars.com/hyperspace/about/news/news20040428.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040429122306/http://www.starwars.com/hyperspace/about/news/news20040428.html| accessdate=May 17, 2008|archivedate=April 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deleted scenes===
During the process of shaping the film for its theatrical release, Lucas and his editors dropped many scenes, and even an entire subplot, from the completed film.

Lucas excised all the scenes of a group of Senators, including Padmé, Bail Organa, and [[Mon Mothma]] ([[Genevieve O'Reilly]]), organising an alliance to prevent the Chancellor from receiving any more emergency powers. Though this is essentially the [[Rebel Alliance]]'s birth, the scenes were discarded to achieve more focus on Anakin's story.&lt;ref name="DVDcom"/&gt;  The scene where Yoda arrives on [[Dagobah]] to begin his self-imposed [[exile]] was also cut, but is featured in a deleted scene in the DVD release, although McCallum stated he hopes Lucas may add it to the release if Lucas releases a six-episode DVD box set.&lt;ref name="DVDcom"/&gt;

Many scenes concerning Jedi deaths during the execution of Order 66 were cut. The deaths of [[Barriss Offee]] and [[Luminara Unduli]] were either cut from the film or not filmed in the first place.

[[Bai Ling]] filmed minor scenes for the film playing a senator, but her role was cut during editing. She claimed this was because she posed for the June 2005 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'', whose appearance on newsstands coincided with the film's May release. Lucas denied this, stating that the cut had been made more than a year earlier, and that he had cut his own daughter's scenes as well.&lt;ref name="BaiLing"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Contact Music|title=Ling claims Star Wars bosses cut her after Playboy pose|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/ling%20claims%20star%20wars%20bosses%20cut%20her%20out%20after%20playboy%20pose|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Main|Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (soundtrack)}}

A [[music video]] titled ''A Hero Falls'' was created for the film's theme, "[[Battle of the Heroes]]", featuring footage from the film and was also available on the DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205123253/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/release/trailer/10.html |date=April 30, 2005 |title=A Hero Falls Music Video |url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/release/trailer/10.html |publisher=StarWars.com |archivedate=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack also came with a collectors' DVD, ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (soundtrack)#Star Wars: A Musical Journey|Star Wars: A Musical Journey]]'', at no additional cost. The DVD, hosted by McDiarmid, features 16 music videos set to remastered selections of music from all six film scores, set chronologically through the saga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050316210453/http://starwars.com/episode-iii/release/publishing/news20050315.html|

==Releases==
''Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith'' charity premieres took place in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston, Denver, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Miami on Thursday, May 12, 2005;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenshealthfund.org/event/star-wars-nyc-premiere |title="Star Wars" NYC Premiere |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908014858/http://www.childrenshealthfund.org/event/star-wars-nyc-premiere |archivedate=September 8, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on May 13, 2005, there were two additional charity premiere screenings in George Lucas's hometown of Modesto.The official premiere was at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] (out of competition) on May 16.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4278019/year/2005.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith |accessdate=December 13, 2009|publisher=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its theatrical release in most other countries took place on May 19 to coincide with the 1999 release of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (the 1977 release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'' and the 1983 release of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' were also released on the same day and month, six years apart). The global outplacement firm [[Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas]] claimed one week before the premiere that it may have cost the U.S. economy approximately [[USD|US$]]627 million in lost productivity because of employees who took a day off or reported in sick.&lt;ref name="Economy"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[CNET]] | title=Can't work today, got a nasty case of Episode III-fever|url=http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-5702394-7.html| accessdate=April 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], a traditional venue for the ''Star Wars'' films, did not show it.

===Leaked workprint===
A copy of the film leaked onto [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped [[workprint]], suggesting it may have come from within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening.&lt;ref name="P2P"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=BBC | title=Revenge of the Sith Leaked Online|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4563631.stm| date=May 19, 2005| accessdate=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a copy of the film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges.&lt;ref name="P2P2"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[MPAA]] |title=U.S. ATTORNEY CHARGES STAR WARS MOVIE THIEVES &amp; Academy Award Screener |url=http://www.mpaa.org/press_releases/2005_09_27b.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2008 |date=September 27, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930190653/http://www.mpaa.org/press_releases/2005_09_27b.pdf |archivedate=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.&lt;ref name="P2P3"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Justice]] |title=Seven Plead Guilty in 'Star Wars' Leak |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/cac/Pressroom/pr2006/008.html |accessdate=February 8, 2015 |date=January 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115171605/http://www.justice.gov/usao/cac/Pressroom/pr2006/008.html |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the above-mentioned print was leaked, it was released in [[Shanghai]] as a bootleg DVD with Chinese [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]. The unknown producer of this DVD also chose to include English subtitles, which were in fact translated back into English from the Chinese translation, rather than using the original English script. This resulted in the subtitles being heavily mis-translated, often causing unintentional humor. For example, in the opening crawl the title is mis-translated as ''Star War: The Third Gathers - The Backstroke of the West''. One error that recurs several times in the subtitles is that the phrase "it seems" (好象) was rendered as "good elephant".

===Rating===
''Revenge of the Sith'' is the first ''Star Wars'' film to receive a [[PG-13]] rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), officially for "sci-fi violence and some intense images", namely for the scene in which Darth Vader is set aflame by lava and molten rock. Lucas had stated months before the MPAA's decision that he felt the film should receive a PG-13 rating, because of Anakin's final moments and the film's content being the darkest and most intense of all six films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/10/60minutes/main679325.shtml|title='Star Wars' Goes To Hell|publisher=CBS|date=March 13, 2005|accessdate=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, including [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Richard Roeper]], later responded that children would be able to handle the film as long as they had parental guidance, hence a "PG rating".&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web|work=At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper|title=Audio review of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|url=http://tvplex.go.com/buenavista/ebertandroeper/050516.html|accessdate=May 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415214600/http://tvplex.go.com/buenavista/ebertandroeper/050516.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; All previously released films in the series were rated PG. The PG-13 rating had not existed when the films in the [[original trilogy]] were released; however, the original trilogy's films were later re-submitted to the MPAA due to [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|changes in the re-released versions]] and once again received PG ratings. When ''Revenge of the Sith'' was released in [[Canada]], it was given a PG rating in most provinces, excluding [[Quebec]], where it was rated G. In the [[United Kingdom]] it received a 12A rating by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC). In [[Australia]], the film was rated M for mature audiences by the [[Australian Classification Board]] (ACB).

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD and VHS on October 31, 2005 in the UK and Ireland, on November 1, 2005 in the United States and Canada on DVD and on November 3, 2005 in Australia. It was also released in most major territories on or near the same day.&lt;ref name="DVDrelease"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=StarWars.com|title=November 1: Experience Episode III on DVD and Star Wars Battlefront II|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/release/video/news20050725.html|archivedate=July 28, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050728001642/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/release/video/news20050725.html|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD was a two-disc set, with picture and sound mastered from the original digital source material.

The DVD included a number of documentaries including a new full-length documentary as well as two featurettes, one which explores the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker as the Chosen One, the other looking at the film's stunts and a {{nowraplinks|15-part collection}} of web-documentaries from the official web site. Like the other DVD releases, included is an audio commentary track featuring Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, animation director [[Rob Coleman]], and ILM visual effects supervisors [[John Knoll]] and [[Roger Guyett]]. {{nowraplinks|Six deleted scenes}} were included with introductions from Lucas and McCallum. An [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game demo for ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'' along with a trailer for the ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]'' PC game was featured on the second disc.

Also, a special two-pack exclusive, sold only at [[Wal-Mart]] stores, included another bonus DVD, ''[[The Story of Star Wars]]''.

This release is notable because, due to marketing issues, it was the first ''Star Wars'' film never to be released on [[VHS]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Studio's first no-VHS release for major new title| publisher = Video Business | date = August 26, 2005| url = http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6251599.html | accessdate=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film was released on VHS in Australia, the U.K. and other countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith &lt;nowiki&gt;[2005]&lt;/nowiki&gt; | publisher = [[Amazon.co.uk|Amazon.com]] | url = https://www.amazon.co.uk/Star-Wars-Episode-III-Revenge/dp/B00097E6EK | accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2015, [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released ''Star Wars'' films. [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] released ''Revenge of the Sith'' through the [[iTunes Store]], [[Amazon Video]], [[Vudu]], [[Google Play]], and [[Disney Movies Anywhere]] on April 10, 2015.&lt;ref name="digital download"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vlessing|first1=Etan|title='Star Wars' Movie Franchise Headed to Digital HD|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-movie-franchise-headed-786673|accessdate=April 7, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===3D re-release===
On September 28, 2010, it was announced that all six films in the series were to be stereo-converted to [[3-D film|3D]].

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 79% based on 288 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "With ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', George Lucas brings his second ''Star Wars'' trilogy to a suitably thrilling and often poignant – if still a bit uneven – conclusion." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005)|work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_iii_revenge_of_the_sith/?search=Star%20Wars/| accessdate= October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/starwarsiii?q=star%20wars | title = Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith reviews | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average "A–" grade on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150405021357/http://m.cinemascore.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-05 |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most critics have considered the film to be the best of the prequel trilogy, with a few even calling it the best of the entire ''Star Wars'' saga.&lt;ref name="Yorker"&gt;{{cite web | work=[[The New Yorker]] | title=Star Wars: Episode III | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/23/050523crci_cinema|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' concluded that it was "the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed", and equal to ''The Empire Strikes Back'' as "the richest and most challenging movie in the cycle".&lt;ref name="nyt-aoscott"&gt;{{cite news | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Some Surprises in That Galaxy Far, Far Away | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/16/movies/some-surprises-in-that-galaxy-far-far-away.html|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 summary of the {{nowrap|100 Best Science-Fiction Films}} on Rotten Tomatoes, ''Revenge of the Sith'' was placed 51 out of 100, making it the only ''Star Wars'' prequel film to earn a rank on that list. Jonathan Rosenbaum, a critic who disliked ''A New Hope'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'', gave the film a positive review, saying that it had a "relatively thoughtful story". [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing "If [Lucas] got bogged down in solemnity and theory in ''Episode II: Attack of the Clones'', the Force is in a jollier mood this time, and ''Revenge of the Sith'' is a great entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050519/REVIEWS/50503002/1023|title=Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|last=Ebert|first=Roger|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=May 19, 2005|accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Glittering Images]]'' art critic [[Camille Paglia]] praised the film, comparing some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it "the greatest work of art in recent memory".&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille. Glittering Images: A Journey through Art from Egypt to Star Wars. Pantheon Books, 2012. p. 185, 189&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia explained that the film's finale {{quote|...has more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact than anything by the artists you name. It's because the art world has flat-lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over-praise. It's like the emperor's new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might think with their blinders off. ''Episode III'' epitomizes the modern digital art movement, more so than other piece from the last 30 years. I had considered using Japanese anime for the digital art chapter of the book, but it lacked the overwhelming operatic power and yes, seriousness of Lucas's ''Revenge of the Sith''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Max|title=Is ''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith'' a Work of Art?

Though many critics and fans viewed ''Revenge of the Sith'' as the strongest of the three prequels, some viewers thought it was more or less on par with ''The Phantom Menace'' and ''Attack of the Clones''.&lt;ref name="Yorker"/&gt; Much of the criticism for the film was directed towards the dialogue, particularly the film's romantic scenes, and for Christensen's performance (which won him his second [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor]]). Critics and fans criticised lines such as "Hold me, Ani. Hold me, like you did by the lake on [[Naboo]]...where there was nothing but our love...".&lt;ref name="Yorker"/&gt; Critics have claimed this demonstrated Lucas's weakness as a writer of dialogue, a subject with which Lucas openly agreed when receiving the [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] from the [[American Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="Writer"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | title =George Lucas admits he's no great writer | url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/06/10/lucas050610.html|accessdate=May 17, 2008 | date=June 10, 2005 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416072541/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/06/10/lucas050610.html | archivedate=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some American [[Conservativism|conservatives]] criticized the film, claiming it has a [[Liberalism|liberal]] bias and is a commentary on the [[George W. Bush]] [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration]] and the [[Iraq War]]. Some websites went so far as to propose a [[boycott]] of the film. Lucas defended the film, stating that the film's storyline was written during the [[Vietnam War]] and was influenced by that conflict rather than the war in [[Iraq]]. Lucas did say, however, that "The parallels between Vietnam and what we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable".&lt;ref name="Politics"&gt;{{cite news | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Politics creates a disturbance in the Force|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-05-17-sith-politics_x.htm|accessdate=May 17, 2008 | first1=César G. | last1=Soriano | date=May 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film was released in 115 countries. Its worldwide gross eventually reached $849 million—making it the second most financially successful film of 2005,&lt;ref name="Mojo" /&gt; behind ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2005 Worldwide Grosses |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2005&amp;p=.htm| accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned an estimated $16.91&amp;nbsp;million from 2,900 midnight screenings in North America upon its release. In total, it earned a record $50&amp;nbsp;million on its opening day.&lt;ref name="first day" /&gt; It was surpassed the following year by ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', which earned $55.5&amp;nbsp;million on its opening day.&lt;ref name="Pirates"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Coming Soon | title=Pirates Breaks Opening Day Record!! |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15303| accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With only the May 19 earnings, the film broke four box office records: midnight screenings gross (previously held by ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', $8&amp;nbsp;million), opening day gross (''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', with $40.4&amp;nbsp;million), single day gross (''[[Shrek 2]]'' with $44.8&amp;nbsp;million) and Thursday gross (''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' with $37.5&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="first day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1824|title='Sith' Destroys Single Day Record|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=May 20, 2005|accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its single day and opening day gross records were later surpassed by ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' on July 7, 2006, when that movie grossed $55.5&amp;nbsp;million on its opening day,&lt;ref name="Pirates"/&gt; and its midnight screening gross was broken by ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' on July 18, 2008 with $18.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2008/07/080721.aspx|title=Dark Knight Beats Spider-Man|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It still retains its record for Thursday gross, however.

According to box office analysis sites, the film set American records for highest gross in a given number of days for each of its first 12 days of release except for the seventh and eighth, where the record is narrowly held by ''Spider-Man 2''. On its fifth day, it became the highest-grossing film of 2005, surpassing ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'' ($177.6&amp;nbsp;million). The film earned $158.5&amp;nbsp;million in its first four-day period, surpassing the previous four-day record held by ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' ($134.3&amp;nbsp;million), and joining ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' as one the only films to make $100&amp;nbsp;million in three days. In eight days, it reached the $200&amp;nbsp;million mark (a record tied with ''Spider-Man 2'') and by its 17th day, the film had passed $300&amp;nbsp;million (surpassing the record of 18 days of ''[[Shrek 2]]''). It was eventually the third-fastest film (after ''Shrek 2'' and ''Spider-Man'') to reach $350 million.&lt;ref name="Mojo"/&gt;

The film ended its run in American theaters on October 20, 2005,&lt;ref name="Mojo"/&gt; finishing with a total gross of $380,270,577. It ranks 29th in all-time domestic grosses and is the highest-grossing U.S. of 2005, outgrossing second-place ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' by nearly $90&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Mojo"/&gt; The film sold an estimated 59,324,600 tickets in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starwars3.htm&amp;adjust_yr=1&amp;p=.htm|title=Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=June 3, 2016|date=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International grosses that exceeded $460 million include those Australia ($27.2 million), France and Algeria ($56.9 million), Germany ($47.3 million), Italy ($11.3 million), Japan ($82.7 million), Mexico ($15.3 million), South Korea ($10.3 million), Spain ($23.8 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($72.8 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&amp;id=starwars3.htm|title=Star Wars: Episode III - International Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
Following the release of ''Revenge of the Sith''—the completion of the [[Original trilogy|original]] and [[Prequel trilogy|prequel]] ''Star Wars'' series—on June 9, 2005, George Lucas was presented with the 33rd [[American Film Institute]] Lifetime Achievement Award.

Despite being the prequel trilogy's best reviewed and received film, it received fewer award nominations than the previous films. It became the only ''Star Wars'' film not to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]; however, it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] ([[Dave Elsey]] and [[Nikki Gooley]]), losing to ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/nomswins.html|title=Nominees and Winners: 78th Annual Academy Awards|publisher=[[AMPAS]]|accessdate=August 4, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703204819/http://www3.oscars.org/78academyawards/nomswins.html |archivedate = July 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won "Favorite Motion Picture" and "Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture" awards at the [[People's Choice Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=2006|title=Past Winners: 2006|publisher=[[People's Choice Awards]]|accessdate=August 4, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622141234/http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=2006 |archivedate = June 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hollywood Movie of the Year" award at the [[Hollywood Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodfestival.com/|title=2005 Hollywood Movie Awards|publisher=Hollywood Festival|accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empire Award]]s (Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/awards2006/winners/scifi.asp |title=Sony Ericsson Empire Awards 2006: Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616205230/http://www.empireonline.com/awards2006/winners/scifi.asp |archivedate=June 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie - Action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/tca2005/nominees.htm|title=The Teen Choice Awards 2005|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Network|Fox]]|accessdate=August 4, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308035958/http://www.fox.com/tca2005/nominees.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Score Soundtrack Album]] at the [[2006 Grammy Awards|48th Grammy Awards]] in 2006.

The film did, however, receive the fewest [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s nominations: only one, for Christensen as Worst Supporting Actor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomSActo.asp|title=Razzies© 2006 Nominees for Worst Supporting Actor|publisher=Golden Raspberry Foundation|accessdate=August 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623025710/http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomSActo.asp|archivedate=June 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[26th Golden Raspberry Awards|which he won]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.razzies.com/history/05winners.asp|title=26th Annual Golden Raspberry (Razzie©) Award "Winners"|publisher=Golden Raspberry Foundation|accessdate=August 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705030031/http://www.razzies.com/history/05winners.asp|archivedate=July 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''The Phantom Menace'' and ''Attack of the Clones'' received seven nominations each, with [[20th Golden Raspberry Awards|one]] and [[23rd Golden Raspberry Awards|two wins]], respectively.) It is the only ''Star Wars'' prequel not to receive a Razzie nomination for "Worst Picture". Christensen further won the "Best Villain" award at the [[MTV Movie Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/2006/|title=2006 MTV Movie Awards|publisher=MTV|accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
{{See also|Star Wars sources and analogues}}
Throughout ''Revenge of the Sith'', Lucas refers to a wide range of films and other sources, drawing on political, military, and mythological motifs to enhance his story's impact. Perhaps the most media coverage was given to a particular exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which led to the aforementioned controversy: "If you're not with me, then you're my enemy", Anakin declares. Despite Lucas' insistence to the contrary, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' concluded, "Without naming [[George W. Bush|Bush]] or the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]], it's all unmistakable no matter what your own politics may be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 17, 2008 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002278140_starwars18.html |title=The Force is with Lucas in his 'Star Wars' finale |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=May 18, 2005 |author=Rahner, Mark |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522140134/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002278140_starwars18.html |archivedate=May 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McDiarmid, Lucas, and others have also called Anakin's journey to the dark side [[Faust]]ian in the sense of making a "pact with the [[devil]]" for short-term gain, with the fiery volcano planet Mustafar representing [[hell]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas interview on CBS's [[60 Minutes]]. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/10/60minutes/main679325.shtml Transcript] March 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through the film, Lucas intercuts between Anakin and Padmé by themselves, thinking about one another in the Jedi Temple and their apartment, respectively, during sunset. The sequence is without dialogue and complemented by a moody, [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] soundtrack. Lucas' coverage of the exterior cityscapes, skylines and interior isolation in the so-called "Ruminations" sequence is similar to the [[cinematography]] and ''[[Mise en scène|mise-en-scène]]'' of ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', a film in which a husband makes a literal pact with the devil.&lt;ref name="DevilDeal"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|title=Star Wars III: "Titanic in Space"|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7224080/|accessdate=July 30, 2008|date=April 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the previous film and its allusions to ''The Empire Strikes Back'', some deliberately placed references have been made to draw allusions with ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (Episode VI). The title is similar in style to Episode VI's planned "Revenge of the Jedi". Some dialogue is mirrored in both films especially the line "I can feel your anger!" spoken by Palpatine, who also orders his personal entourage/bodyguards to "Leave us" at important moments in both films. Both films feature lightsaber duels before Palpatine with similar imagery and dialog; Palpatine's tacit encouragement of Anakin's hate and anger is analogous to  Darth Vader attempts to play on Luke's fear of loss by taunting him with threats against Leia. In Vader's earlier identity as Anakin, his own fear of the loss of Padmé is what draws him to the dark side. Prior to settling on the Ewoks as the main helpers, the Wookiee race was originally planned to be in ''Return of the Jedi''.  Anakin's decision to save Palpatine over Master Windu parallels the decision he would eventually make as Darth Vader to save Luke from Palpatine in ''Return of the Jedi.''

==Other media==

=== Novelization ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Anakin Skywalker]] --&gt;
{{Main|Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (novel)}}
The film's novelization was written by [[Matthew Stover]]. It includes much more dialogue than the film, including: a conversation between Count Dooku and Darth Sidious, where the reader learns Palpatine lied to Dooku about what the Empire would truly be; a conversation between Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi where Obi-Wan expresses self-doubt about whether he is the right Jedi to battle General Grievous; and a conversation between Anakin and Palpatine in which Palpatine promises to give Anakin anything he wants—whether it be a new speeder or the star system Corellia. The novel includes many minor details. For example, during the [[Coruscant|Battle of Coruscant]], Anakin's callsign is Red 5, a reference to Luke's callsign in the [[Battle of Yavin|climactic battle]] of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', and one of the Republic capital ships is commanded by Lieutenant Commander Lorth Needa, who becomes [[Captain Needa]] in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. There are also references to the ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' comic book series, such as the Battle of Jabiim (Volume 3). In addition to this, the siege of the Jedi Temple is much more violent and far more graphically explained than the cinematic version.&lt;ref name="Novel"&gt;''Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith'' – Novelization, 1st edition hardcover, 2005. Matthew Woodring Stover, George Lucas, {{ISBN|0-7126-8427-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some unseen or unheard-of elements of the story were fleshed out in the course of the novel. Such examples include more discussions between Anakin and Palpatine, in which Palpatine explicitly says that [[Darth Plagueis]] was his master; in the film, it is merely hinted at. Additionally, it is revealed that the primary reason for Anakin's outrage over not becoming a Jedi Master is that only Masters have access to the holocrons in the Temple Archives, which is where Anakin had hoped to find information about how to prevent Padmé's death. Not only is [[Saesee Tiin]] revealed to be a [[telepathy|telepath]], but his horn, lost in the Clone Wars, is revealed to have grown back. The book explains that Palpatine purposely manipulated the Council into sending Obi-Wan to fight General Grievous, because he knew he needed to get Obi-Wan off Coruscant before he could turn Anakin to the dark side. The novel also reveals Mace Windu's rationale for not bringing Anakin along to the fight with Palpatine: he can sense Anakin's fear and distress, and does not believe the young Jedi is in any mental state to fight a Sith Lord. These are a few examples of many descriptions of characters' feelings and inner narrative. There are even some humorous lines added in, including extra dialogue in the battle between Grievous and Obi Wan - Grievous says, "I was trained by Count Dooku," and Obi-Wan replies, "What a coincidence; I trained the man who killed him."&lt;ref name="Novel"/&gt;

An official prequel novel, ''Labyrinth of Evil'' ({{ISBN|0345475720}}) by [[James Luceno]], was published in 2005. It is set near the end of the Clone Wars and directly before the events of ''Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith''.

=== Video game ===
{{Main|Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (video game)}}
A [[video game]] based on the film was released on May 5, 2005, two weeks before the film. The game followed the film's storyline for the most part, integrating scenes from the film. However, many sections of the game featured [[Cutscene|scenes cut]] from the film, or entirely new scenes for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/608/608359p2.html |title= Revenge of the Sith: The Goods (Part II): Beyond The Movie |accessdate=July 7, 2008 |publisher= IGN |date= April 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of the game was mostly lightsaber combat and fighting as Obi-Wan or Anakin.&lt;ref name="IGN2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/608/608359p1.html |title= Revenge of the Sith: The Goods |accessdate=July 7, 2008 |publisher= IGN |date= April 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a form of multiplayer mode, which includes both "VS" and "Cooperative" mode.&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt; In the first mode, two players fight with characters of their choice against each other in a lightsaber duel to the death. In the latter mode, two players team up to combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies.&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt;

'''Terese Nielsen''' (born March 11, 1966)&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; is an American freelance [[fantasy]] artist and illustrator.

==Early life, education, and family==
Nielsen was born in [[Aurora, Nebraska]], in 1966.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Nielsen's brother, [[Ron Spencer]], is also an artist.&lt;ref name="tnielsenbio"/&gt;

In 1984 Nielsen followed her brother and relocated to [[Rexburg, Idaho]], where they studied art at [[Ricks College]].&lt;ref name="tnielsenbio"/&gt; Upon completing her studies there, she studied at the Art Center College of Design (ACCD) in [[Pasadena, California]], graduating with "great distinction" in 1991.&lt;ref name="tnielsenbio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bio |url= http://tnielsen.com/Bio.html |date=November 3, 2014 |website=tnielsen.com |publisher=Hidden Kingdom |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"&gt;{{cite web |title= Author/Artist Bios: Terese Nielsen |website= wizards.com| url= http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/Bios/default.aspx?doc=nielsenterese |date=2009  |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090224012640/http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/Bios/default.aspx?doc=nielsenterese |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |archivedate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Felt|first=Kevin|title=Painter of 'Magic' cards inspiring random acts of kindness|newspaper=[[San Gabriel Valley Tribune]]|date=November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married [[Cliff Nielsen]], another ACCD graduate, and they illustrated ''[[Ruins (comics)|Ruins]]'' (1995); they have since divorced.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;  She has four children and resides in [[Temple City, California]], with her wife.&lt;ref name="tnielsenbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name= brown&gt;{{cite interview | url= http://krcu.org/post/interview-artist-terese-nielsen#stream/0| website= [[KCRU|krcu]].org| first= Terese| last= Nielsen| title= An Interview With Artist Terese Nielsen| interviewer= Jason Brown | date= December 1, 2016| publisher= | access-date= July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Landmark Entertainment]] hired Nielsen to help design its themed [[amusement park]]s, and [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics]] hired her to illustrate several [[superhero]] [[trading card]]s.&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"/&gt; She illustrated Marvel graphic novels, one of which was ''[[Ruins (comics)|Ruins]]'', which she did with her then husband, [[Cliff Nielsen]].&lt;ref name="tnielsenbio"/&gt; For [[Topps Comics|Topps]] she painted several ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess (comics)|Xena]]'' covers, as well as ''[[Star Wars comics#Dark Horse|Star Wars]]'' covers for [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]].&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"/&gt;

Nielsen illustrated the graphic novella that was included as part of the 1993 video game ''[[Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers]]''. In a favorable review, Scott A. May wrote, "Nielsen's dark, disturbing visions carry over to many of the game's hand painted back-drops, drawn from a gloomy palette of deep red, blue, and black."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = May | first1 = Scott A. | year = 1994 | title = Entertainment choice—Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers | url = | journal = [[Compute!]] | volume = 16 | issue = 6| pages = 88–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video game genre, her influence can be seen in [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]]'s ''[[Gabriel Knight]]'' series, and in her work for [[The 3DO Company|3DO]]'s ''[[Meridian 59]]'', and she worked with [[Mythic Entertainment]] creating the look for the advertising campaign promoting the interactive internet game ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]''.&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"/&gt;

She began working for [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"/&gt; Nielsen has gained a fan following mainly because of her illustrations for the [[trading card game]] [[Magic: The Gathering]].&lt;ref&gt;Ednalino, Percy (September 4, 2000). "And tattoos, too: 'New school' artists versatile", ''[[The Denver Post]]'', p. G1.&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen has produced art for both Magic and Wizards of the Coast's other products since 1996, in addition to her work as an illustrator of book covers &amp; interiors and movie posters. She has served as a juror for the [[Spectrum Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| date= May 2002| title= 9th Spectrum Art Awards| work= Science Fiction Chronicle| volume= 23| number= 5| pages= 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created several images for the [[Harry Potter Trading Card Game]], released in 2001.&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"/&gt;

In reviewing her work "Savant" in the ''Wildstorm Gallery'' collection released in 1996, critic Joseph Szadkowski wrote, "Imagine British artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti tickled into a mood by a Sex Pistols album to fully appreciate the Nielsen style."&lt;ref&gt;Szadkowski, Joseph (April 27, 1996). "Artistry at a low price: Masterfully drawn 90-card collection leads the pack", ''[[The Washington Times]]'', p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; Szadkowski also praised Nielsen's work in the Marvel Comics ''Code of Honor'' series (1997).&lt;ref&gt;Szadkowski, Joseph (April 19, 1997). "Nazis, Daemonites and X-Men", ''[[The Washington Times]]'', p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt;

She created the look for the ''Sembia'' series of Forgotten Realms novels, and for [[Greg Keyes]]' ''[[The Age of Unreason|Age of Unreason]]'' series published by [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]].&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"/&gt; Endorsed by Lucas, she was involved in several Star Wars pieces for ''The New Jedi Order'', also published by Del Rey.&lt;ref name= "wizardsbio"/&gt; Nielsen did the cover artwork for the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' settings ''Jakandor, Land of Legend'' and ''Jakandor, Isle of Destiny'' in 1998 and illustrated the covers of three issues of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]''.

In 1999 the [[Alderac Entertainment Group]] published the ''Gamemasters' guide'' for the ''[[7th Sea (role-playing game)|7th Sea]]'' role-playing game, with all art covers since then (main guides and supplements) primarily painted by Nielsen. Also in 1999, she received a nomination for a [[Chesley Award]] for Best Gaming-Related Illustration for her illustration of the Magic: The Gathering card "Ertai, Wizard Adept".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| date= April–May 1999| title= Chesley Award nominations| work= Science Fiction Chronicle| volume= 20| number= 5| page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen was a [[Gen Con]] artist guest of honor in 2014.&lt;ref name="gencon2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aritist [''sic''] Guest of Honor |url=http://www.gencon.com/experience/artistgoh |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140625070214/http://gencon.com/experience/artistgoh |website= gencon.com | publisher= Gen Con LLC| date= 2014| archivedate= June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen has contributed art to ''[[Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft]]''.

==Magazines==
Each DVD came with a magazine, focused primarily on the episodes in the accompanying DVD. Some features recurred across all/most of the issues:

*'''Episode Guides:''' These provided a description of the episodes included on the DVD and a section entitled ''straight from the horse's mouth'' where series writer [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]] explained the roots of the episode.  Each guide would have a ''Del's lingo'', where one of [[Del Boy|the character]]'s foreign phrases was translated to his intended meaning; and a ''Rodders rant'' which saw a description of the episodes' events from the perspective of [[Rodney Trotter|the youngest Trotter brother]].
*'''Peckham Profiles:''' This featured a spotlight on a different character from the show each issue. This included a section called ''straight from the horse's mouth'', where John Sullivan talked about the creation of the character and how the actor who played him/her was chosen.  The final section of this feature was called ''The Secret World of...'', which listed several facts about the character in bullet points. A lot of the characters featured in two 'Peckham Profiles' over the course of the collection, with content split between their earlier and later years.
*'''Classic Clips:''' A description of one of the most memorable scenes, with episode stills and a commentary from John Sullivan.
*'''Hooky Street:''' A description of items that Del bought, owned, sold or talked about throughout the course of the show.
*'''Behind the Scenes:''' A insight into things or people associated with the production of ''Only Fools and Horses'', explaining how they became involved in the programme.
*'''The World According to:''' These articles would feature a discussion of a theme or topic that occurred in the series, from the perspective of one of the characters.

== Synopsis ==
Chase ([[Josh Stewart]]) is portrayed as a survivor seeking refuge on a rooftop near Atlanta, Georgia. Despite his intention to reunite with his sister (who is referenced to be in a separate caravan), Chase and companion Harris (Chris Nelson) decide to investigate a nearby storage facility. The two are quickly swarmed by walkers and Harris is killed in the attack, but Chase manages to escape, unharmed, to one of the storage units. It is revealed that the storage units are under the sole command of a former employee named B.J., who is initially hostile to Chase. B.J. changes his mind after Chase offers to restore a damaged basement generator in exchange for one of B.J's [[box truck]]s. Chase takes some clothes from a storage unit which also contains family photo albums indicating it belonged to [[Rick Grimes]]. 

After a nonchalant B.J. fails to mention the presence of walkers in the basement, Chase's suspicions are raised. Chase's suspicions are confirmed when B.J. shows Chase a pile of dead bodies and mercilessly fires a shot at Chase, who collapses into the pile of bodies, apparently dead. 

Chase survives the shooting with only a graze to his temple and returns to the compound to take revenge. He inadvertently finds Kelly (a female employee B.J. claimed had called in sick the day "shit hit the fan"), who explains that B.J. murdered the other employees and forced her into [[sexual slavery]]. B.J., realizing the situation, confronts Kelly and her liberator, refusing to let Chase leave with her. The events of this standoff culminate in B.J.'s decapitation (presumably by Kelly) while the two survivors escape the compound in a box truck (implied to be low on gas). B.J.'s zombified head is shown on a table watching the surveillance monitors as the compound is overrun by walkers.

'''The Wet Gunpowder Award''' ({{lang-fa|جایزه باروت خیس}}) is an [[Iran]]ian symbolic [[award]] that according to organizers, is given to "ridiculous people whose chaffy character is evident to everyone and when this nature of theirs is accompanied with self-belief turns into an indefinite foolishness for them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13921226000572|work=[[Fars News Agency]]|script-title=Ashton, Cronberg Receive Symbolic 'Wet Gunpowder' Award|date=March 17, 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizers, who have close ties to [[Basij]] and [[Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps]] (The award is unveiled by Basij commander [[Mohammad Reza Naqdi]]), claim award winner is “someone who is against the [[Islamic Revolution]]” and who “against their own wishes, performs a service to the revolution.”&lt;ref name="Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty"&gt;{{cite news|first=Golnaz|last=Esfandiari|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-obama-oscars-argo/24946043.html|work=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|script-title= Iran's Basij Awards U.S. First Lady Over Oscars Announcement |date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eliana |last=Johnson |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/344375/michelle-obama-receives-iranian-groups-wet-gunpowder-award-eliana-johnson|work=[[National Review]]|script-title= Michelle Obama Receives Iranian Group’s ‘Wet Gunpowder’ Award|date=April 1, 2013|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Monitor"/&gt;

The statue of the award is that of [[brain]] with [[dark glasses]] and [[hearing aids]] with a plaque of the [[Quran]]ic verse: “Unwilling to hear, unwilling to speak, unwilling to see, then, they will not return to the way.”&lt;ref name="Al-Monitor"&gt;{{cite news|first= Arash |last=Karami|url=http://iranpulse.al-monitor.com/index.php/2013/04/1698/iran-gives-michelle-obama-wet-gunpowder-award-for-argo/|work=[[Al-Monitor]]|script-title= Michelle Obama Receives Iranian Group’s ‘Wet Gunpowder’ Award|date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Édgar Ponce García''' (27 December 1977 &amp;ndash; 5 May 2005) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[actor]] and [[dancer]]. Ponce was a member of the male dance troupe ''[[Solo Para Mujeres|Sólo Para Mujeres]]'' (''For Women Only'') and appeared in a number of [[soap opera]]s (''[[telenovelas]]'') which were popular in both [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enelshow.com/news/sandra-ortega-mundo/2010/05/04/255/25674 Profile], enelshow.com; accessed 22 January  2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 2005, while filming a commercial with his troupe in [[Mexico City]], an overtaking car slammed into his [[motorcycle]] caravan, sending Ponce flying into the air and injuring three other actors. Ponce was rushed to the hospital but died early the next morning. Police charged the driver with [[manslaughter|involuntary homicide]] and detected alcohol on his breath, but believed he did not intend to kill Ponce. Ponce's co-star [[Alfonso de Nigris|Poncho de Nigris]] accused the man of trying to hit them, stating, "the car didn't hit the brakes or anything".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Other controversies ensued due to the troupe riding on the central section of Mexico City [[ring road]] ''(Periférico)'' in violation of a local traffic bylaw requiring  motorcycles to use the side lanes, as well as the actions of the producer, Sergio Mayer. Mayer was filming without permission and failed to ask for police assistance; authorities warned he could be charged with a crime.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
