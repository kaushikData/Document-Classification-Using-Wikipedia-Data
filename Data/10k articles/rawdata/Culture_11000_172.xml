'''AFS Intercultural Programs''' (or '''AFS''', originally the '''American Field Service''') is an international [[youth exchange]] organization. It consists of over 50 independent, [[not-for-profit organization]]s, each with its own network of [[Volunteering|volunteers]], professionally staffed offices, volunteer [[board of directors]] and [[#Official AFS Websites%5B24%5D|website]]. {{As of|2015|alt=In 2015}}, 12,578 students traveled abroad on an AFS cultural exchange program, between 99 countries.&lt;ref name="2015-annual-report" /&gt; The U.S.-based partner, AFS-USA, sends more than 1,100 U.S. students abroad and places international students with more than 2,300 U.S. families each year. More than 424,000 people have gone abroad with AFS and over 100,000 former AFS students live in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsusa.org/about-afs] About AFS&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Julien Bryan - Ambulance 646 - 60.jpg|thumb|'''A. Piatt Andrew''', director of the Field Service and Major Church, U. S. A., visiting in Champagne.]]
When war broke out in 1914, the American Colony of Paris organized an "ambulance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/Herrick/MTH04.htm#ch19] Col. T. Bentley Mott. Myron Herrick. Friend of France. An Autobiographical Biography. Garden City, New York. Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company, Inc., 1929&lt;/ref&gt;—the French term for a temporary military hospital—just as it had done in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 when the "American Ambulance" had been under tents set up near the Paris home of its founder, the celebrated Paris-American dentist, Dr. [[Thomas W. Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/1-roots/Evans/aaTC.html] Thomas W. Evans, History of the American Ambulance Established in Paris during the Siege of 1870–71, London: Low, Low and Searle, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; The "American Ambulance" of 1914 took over the premises of the unfinished [[Lycée Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)|Lycée Pasteur]] in the suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine—and was run by the nearby American Hospital of Paris.

The volunteer drivers of 1914 found themselves behind the wheels of motorized, not horse-driven, vehicles: Model-Ts, purchased from the nearby Ford plant in Levallois-Perret.

In the fall of 1914, when the war front moved away from Paris, the American Ambulance set up an outpost in Juilly and sent out detached units of volunteer drivers to serve informally with the British and Belgian armies in the north.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/Rock/R01.html] J. Paulding Brown. "The First Months of the American Ambulance (September 1914 to May 1915),”; in George Rock History of the American Field Service, 1920–1955&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1915, one of those drivers, [[A. Piatt Andrew]], was appointed “Inspector of Ambulances” by [[Robert Bacon]], head of the American Ambulance and one of Andrew's colleagues from the Taft Administration.

The newly appointed inspector toured the ambulance sections of Northern France and learned that the American volunteers were bored with so-called "jitney work," transporting wounded soldiers from railheads to hospitals far back from the front lines.  French army policy prohibited foreign nationals from traveling into battle zones.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Arlen (1996, 2011). Gentlemen Volunteers. Arcade Publishing. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1915, Andrew met with Captain Aime Doumenc, head of the French Army Automobile Service and pleaded his case for the American volunteers.  They desired above all, he said,  "to pick up the wounded from the front lines…, to look danger squarely in the face; in a word, to mingle with the soldiers of France and to share their fate!"&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Arlen (1996, 2011). Gentlemen Volunteers. Arcade Publishing. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Doumenc agreed to give Andrew a trial.  The success of Section Z was immediate and overwhelming, and by April 15, 1915, the French created American Ambulance Field Service operating under French Army command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/APA/APA2.html#Montravel] A. Piatt Andrew. Letters Written Home from France in the First Half of 1915. Privately printed, 1915&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/2/a/SSUs.html].Official Document&lt;/ref&gt;

This marked the formal beginning of American Ambulance Field Service, three units of which made their mark during battles in northern France, the Champagne, Verdun and the Vosges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/AFShist/AFS1b.htm#c4] Stephen Galatti, "The Growth of the Service" in ''History of the American Field Service in France''. "Friends of France". 1914–1917. Told by its Members with Illustrations. Boston and New York. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the summer of 1916, the Field Service severed its ties with the American Ambulance and moved its operations from cramped quarters in Neuilly to Paris, onto the spacious grounds of the Delessert château at 21 rue Raynouard in the Passy area of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/2/a/21.html]“21”&lt;/ref&gt; There, it grew rapidly over the next year, continuing to provide "sanitary sections" to the French Army, while also serving as a recruitment source of combat pilots for the newly formed [[Escadrille Lafayette]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/library/catalog.html#ww1-8Lafayette Flying Corps]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of whose prime movers, Dr. [[Edmund L. Gros, M.D. (1869–1942)|Edmund L. Gros]], was the Field Service’s in-house physician.

When the United States entered the war in April 1917, the French Army successfully appealed to the Field Service for drivers for its military transport sections&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/AFSBs/Mallet/RM.html] Mallet Reserve Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; —and so, no longer limited to medical transport, the organization renamed itself the “American Field Service”, thus establishing today’s well-known acronym, “AFS”.

Before the AFS was absorbed into the much larger, federalized [[United States Army Ambulance Service|U.S. Army Ambulance Service]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/Smucker/usaacTC.html] John R. Smucker, Jr. The United States Army Ambulance Service in Armies of France and Italy, 1917-1918-1919, USAAS Association. 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; it had numbered more than 2500 volunteers, including some 800 drivers of French military transport trucks. It had actively recruited its drivers from the campuses of American colleges and universities, promoting morale by creating units with volunteers from the same schools. All financed their own uniforms and transportation to France where they worked under the same conditions as French ambulance drivers—with the same pay—and often found themselves serving under extremely dangerous missions on the Front. By the end of the war, some 127 men who had served with the AFS were killed and a notable number of individuals and units earned the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille de Guerre for their heroic actions as drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/AFShist/AFS3i.htm#appc]“Decorations” in History of the American Field Service in France. “Friends of France”. 1914–1917. Told by its Members with Illustrations. Boston and New York. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other volunteer ambulance corps served the French Army as “foreign sanitary sections”  during World War I. The first was Henry Harjes’ “Formation” units under the American Red Cross,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/catalog.html#ww1-7] The Harjes Formation&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Richard Norton’s American Volunteer Motor-Ambulance Corps,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/Harvard/HGMdec18.html] William Fenwick Harris. “Richard Norton, 1872-1918” in Harvard Graduates' Magazine, December 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; organized in London under the St. John’s Ambulance (the British Red Cross). Later, both would merge —under the American Red Cross—as the “Norton-Harjes”. In the summer and fall of 1917, when all the volunteer ambulance services were invited to join the new U.S. Army Ambulance Service,  Norton’s units simply disbanded, while Harjes’, under the American Red Cross, moved into Italy where they would subsequently serve under the USAAS.

Once the Americans entered the war, many drivers joined combat units, both French and American, serving as officers in a variety of assignments, notably in air force and artillery units.  At the same time, a large percentage of volunteers signed up for the military, thenceforth members of USAAS units, but remaining identified with their AFS past—a past kept alive through the work of HQ, still at 21 rue Raynouard, where a Bulletin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/AFSBs/index.html] The American Field Service Bulletins, published at 21, rue Raynouard, Paris, 1917–1919.&lt;/ref&gt; was published and where visiting ambulance drivers could find temporary lodgings and meals.

=== WWI Publications ===
The young AFS drivers came from "prominent families in the States," and had attended, or were still attending, one of almost a hundred prominent colleges or universities around the country.  Also represented were a smaller group from America's professional class: doctors, lawyers, architects, painters, brokers, businessmen, poets and writers.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of France: the Field Service of the American Ambulance described by its members.  Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1916, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of the American Field Service in France, as told by its members, vol. 3.  Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1920, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of the American Field Service in France, as told by its members, vol. 1.  Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1920, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  This literate group produced many letters, diaries, journals, and even poetry.  The AFS collected many of these writings into ''Friends of France'', published in 1916.  The Service used this volume to recruit more volunteers to the "gloriously exciting and grandly humanitarian" work of an ambulancier on the Western Front.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Arlen (1996, 2011). Gentlemen Volunteers. Arcade Publishing. p. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also published in 1916, ''Ambulance Number 10'', by Leslie Buswell, was composed of the author's letters back to the States.  Buswell went on to assist [[Henry Davis Sleeper|Henry Sleeper]] in the AFS's recruiting and fundraising offices in Boston.

Other literary "ambulanciers" brought their letters and journals and memoirs to American publishers in the coming years.  William Yorke Stevenson produced ''To The Front in a Flivver'' in 1917, stayed on in France after militarization, and composed ''From "Poilu" to "Yank"'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, William Yorke.  To the Front in a Flivver.  Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, William Yorke.  From "Poilu" to "Yank."  Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Imbrie published ''Behind the Wheel of a War Ambulance'' in 1918, as did Julien Bryan with ''Ambulance 464: Encore des Blesses''&lt;ref&gt;Imbrie, Robert Whitney.  Behind the Wheel of a War Ambulance.  NY: Robert McBride and Co., 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, Julien H.  Ambulance 464: Encore des Blesses.  NY: Macmillan Co., 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFS recruits who joined the Service in late spring 1917, after Congress's declaration of war, were greeted by Piatt Andrew with a request: Would they forego ambulance driving for trucking supplies to the front?  Eight hundred AFS recruits joined the camion service, including John Kautz, who published ''Trucking to the Trenches'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;John Iden Kautz, Trucking to the Trenches: Letters from France, June–November, 1917. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war the Field Service produced three hefty volumes of writings from numerous AFS alumni, including excerpts from the previously published books above.&lt;ref&gt;History of the American Field Service in France, as told by its members, vols. 1-3, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Between the wars ===
Following the Great War, the AFS became sponsors for the French Fellowships&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/Rock/R02.html] George Rock. ”Between the Wars: The Fellowships for French Universities” in History of the American Field Service, 1920–1955. New York, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;—graduate student scholarships for study in France and in the US—which were ultimately administered by the [[Institute of International Education]] and were precedents for the [[Fulbright Foundation]] exchanges.  AFS also created an association for its veterans, publishing a bulletin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/3-FF/Bulletins/index.html] American Field Service Association Bulletins, 1920–1935&lt;/ref&gt; organizing reunions and contributing a wing to house its memorabilia at the Museum of Franco-American Cooperation in Blérancourt, France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/2/d/Bler/museumTC.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} The Museum of Franco-American Cooperation at Blérancourt&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WWII ===
When World War II broke out, AFS reorganized its ambulance service,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourstory.info/library/Rock/R00TC.html] George Rock. History of the American Field Service, 1920–1955. New York, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; sending units first to France and then to the British Armies in North Africa, Italy, India-Burma and with the Free French for the final drive from southern France to Germany.

=== Postwar ===
In September 1946, [[Stephen Galatti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afs.org/AFSI/content/page.php?uid=83 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927072335/http://www.afs.org/AFSI/content/page.php?uid=83 |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }} About Stephen Galatti&lt;/ref&gt;
president of AFS, established the American Field Service International Scholarships.  During the 1947–48 school year, the first students came from ten countries including [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and [[Syria]].

{{As of|2014}}, there are over 55 AFS organizations worldwide serving over 80 different countries, providing exchange opportunities for over 13,000 students and teachers annually.

AFS is one of the largest volunteer-based organizations of its kind in the world with more than 440,000 volunteers worldwide and more than 5,000 in the U.S. Tens of thousands of volunteers and a small staff make the AFS program happen worldwide. AFS volunteers are both young and old, busy professionals and retirees, and students and teachers. AFS provides development and training opportunities for volunteers.

AFS volunteers help in many areas including facilitating the AFS mission in the local community and schools by finding and interviewing students and families. Further involvement includes serving as a contact person for an AFS student, organizing fund raising events, and arranging activities for AFS students. As a volunteer-driven organization, AFS depends on donations of time to implement and monitor the delivery of programs.

Notable exception in the AFS network is its presence in China. Here AFS offers an outbound long-term student exchange program since 1997 and an inbound program since 2001. These programs however, are run and administrated by the China Education Association for International Exchange (CEAIE), an organization focusing on teacher exchanges that was founded by the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;AFS Schüleraustausch mit China URL: {{cite web|url=http://bildungsserver.hamburg.de/contentblob/2656982/data/china-austausch.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216085907/http://bildungsserver.hamburg.de/contentblob/2656982/data/china-austausch.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-16 |df= }} (Stand 9.März 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Two primary understandings of "andragogy" exist:

# The science of understanding (theory) and supporting (practice) lifelong education of adults.
# In the tradition of [[Malcolm Knowles]], a specific theoretical and practical approach. It is based on a humanistic conception of self-directed and autonomous learners as well as teachers as facilitators of learning.

Interpreted broadly throughout academic literature, the term also invites other definitions such as ''"[[adult education]] practice", "desirable values", "specific teaching methods", "reflections", and "academic discipline"'', with many authors claiming it to be better than traditional adult education.

The term has been used by some to allow discussion of contrast between self-directed and self-taught education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chris-kimble.com/CLEE/Book_1/Chapters/Chapter_15.html Hansman (2008)] Adult Learning in Communities of Practice: Situating Theory in Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was originally coined by German educator [[Alexander Kapp (German educator and editor)|Alexander Kapp]] in 1833. Andragogy was developed into a theory of adult education by [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]]. It later became very popular in the US by the American educator [[Malcolm Knowles]]. Knowles asserted that andragogy (Greek: "man-leading") should be distinguished from the more commonly used term ''[[pedagogy]]'' (Greek: "child-leading").

[[Malcolm Knowles|Knowles]] collected ideas about a theory of adult education from the end of [[World War II]] until he was introduced to the term "andragogy". In 1966, Knowles met Dusan Savicevic in Boston. Savicevic was the one who shared the term andragogy with Knowles and explained how it was used in the European context. In 1967, Knowles made use of the term "androgogy" to explain his theory of adult education. Then after consulting with [[Merriam-Webster]], he corrected the spelling of the term to "andragogy" and continued to make use of the term to explain his multiple ideas about adult learning.

Knowles' theory can be stated with six assumptions related to the [[motivation]] of adult learning:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Encyclopedia of Psychology |url=http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/andragogy.html |title=Instructional Design: Theories - Andragogy (M. Knowles) |accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/lifelonglearning/b-andra.htm |website=the encyclopedia of informal education |title=andragogy @ the informal education homepage |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Need to know:''' Adults need to know the reason for learning something. 
#'''Foundation:''' [[Experience]] (including [[error]]) provides the basis for learning activities.
#'''[[Self-concept]]:''' Adults need to be responsible for their decisions on education; involvement in the [[planning]] and [[evaluation]] of their instruction.
#'''Readiness:''' Adults are most interested in learning subjects having immediate [[relevance]] to their work and/or personal lives.
#'''Orientation:''' Adult learning is [[problem]]-centered rather than content-oriented.
#'''Motivation:''' Adults respond better to internal versus external motivators.

In most European countries, the Knowles discussion played at best, a marginal role. "Andragogy" was, from 1970 on, connected with emerging academic and professional institutions, publications, or programs, triggered by a similar growth of adult education in practice and theory as in the United States. "Andragogy" functioned here as a header for (places of) systematic reflections, parallel to other academic headers like "biology", "medicine", and "physics".

Examples of this use of andragogy are the Yugoslavian (scholarly) journal for adult education, named ''Andragogija'' in 1969, and the Yugoslavian Society for Andragogy; at Palacky University in Olomouc (Czech republic) the ''Katedra sociologie a andragogiky'' (Sociology and Andragogy Department) was established in 1990. Also, Prague University has a ''Katedra Andragogiky'' (Andragogical Department); in 1993, Slovenia's ''Andragoski Center Republike Slovenije'' (Slovenian Republic Andragogy Center) was founded with the journal ''Andragoska Spoznanja''; in 1995, Bamberg University (Germany) named a ''Lehrstuhl Andragogik'' (Androgogy Chair).

On this formal level "above practice" and specific approaches, the term "andragogy" could be used relating to all types of theories, for reflection, analysis, training, in person-oriented programs, or human resource development.

== Assumptions ==
Adult learning is based upon comprehension, organization and synthesis of knowledge rather than rote memory. There are seven Principles of Adult Learning:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literacy.ca/professionals/professional-development-2/principles-of-adult-learning/|title=Principles of Adult Learning|publisher=literacy.ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217103828/http://www.literacy.ca/professionals/professional-development-2/principles-of-adult-learning/|archivedate=2014-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communitycolleges.wy.edu/Data/Sites/1/commissionFiles/abe/training/abe-ntt/mod-6-articles/ntt---module-6---fs-11-teal-center-adult-learning-theory-fact-sheet-air-logo-rev12-06-11.pdf|title=TEAL Center Fact Sheet No. 11: Adult Learning Theories|year=2011|publisher=TEAL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Adults must want to learn''' – They learn effectively only when they are free to direct their own learning and have a strong inner and excited motivation to develop a new skill or acquire a particular type of knowledge, this sustains learning.
*'''Adults will learn only what they feel they need to learn''' – Adults are practical in their approach to learning; they want to know, "How is this going to help me right now? – Is it relevant (Content, Connection and Application) and does it meet my targeted goals."
*'''Adults learn by doing''' – Adolescents learn by doing, but adults do through an active practice and participation, this helps in integrating component skills into a coherent whole.  
*'''Adult learning focuses on problem solving''' – Adolescents tend to learn skills sequentially. Adults tend to start with a problem and then work to find a solution. A meaningful engagement, such as posing and answering realistic questions and problems is necessary for deeper learning. This leads to more elaborate, longer lasting, and stronger representations of the knowledge (Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972). 
*'''Experience affects adult learning''' – Adults have more experience than adolescents. This can be an asset and a liability, if prior knowledge is inaccurate, incomplete, or naive, it can interfere with or distort the integration of incoming information (Clement, 1982; National Research Council, 2000).
*'''Adults learn best in an informal situation''' – Adolescents have to follow a curriculum. Often, adults learn by taking responsibility by the value and need of content they have to understand and the particular goals it will achieve. Being in an inviting, collaborative and networking environment as an active participant in the learning process makes it efficient.
*'''Adults want guidance and consideration as equal partners in the process''' – Adults want information that will help them improve their situation. They do not want to be told what to do and they evaluate what helps and what doesn't. They want to choose options based on their individual needs and the meaningful impact a learning engagement could provide. Socialization is more important among adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Learning Techniques|website=Aacp.org|url=http://www.aacp.org/meetingsandevents/presenterresources/Documents/AdultLearningTips.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educating adult learners: twelve tips for teaching business professionals|website=University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, U.S.A|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED502732.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adult learning styles ==
{{See also|learning styles}}

Learning styles are referred and made by how certain people learn, categorize, and process new content they are descriptors of common behavior patterns. Each person may have multiple preferred learning styles and these are preferences that have mild-strong inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;Felder, R.M. Are learning styles invalid ? .NCSU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trigwell|first=Keith|last2=Prosser|first2=Michael|last3=Waterhouse|first3=Fiona|date=1999|title=Relations between teachers' approaches to teaching and students' approaches to learning|journal=Higher Education|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=57–70|doi=10.1023/a:1003548313194|issn=0018-1560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keefe formally defines learning styles as "characteristic cognitive, affective, and physiological factors that serve as relatively stable indicators of how learners perceive, interacts with, and respond to the learning environment".&lt;ref&gt;Keefe, J.W. (1979) Learning style: An overview. NASSP's Student learning styles: Diagnosing and proscribing programs (pp. 1-17). Reston, VA. National Association of Secondary School Principles.&lt;/ref&gt; The three primary learning styles are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/downloads/freebies/172/PR%20Pre-course%20Reading%20Assignment.pdf|title=Principles of Adult Learning &amp; Instructional Systems Design|publisher=National Highway Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdns3.trainingindustry.com/media/2068131/principlesofadultlearning_full.pdf|title=Principles of Adult Learning – Solution Design Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolb suggests to educate adult learners around the experiential cycle that reaches all types of learners.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, D. (1984). Experiential learning. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic discipline==

In the field of adult education during recent decades, a process of growth and differentiation emerged as a scholarly and scientific approach, andragogy. It refers to the academic discipline(s) within university programs that focus on the education of adults; andragogy exists today worldwide. The term refers to a new type of education which was not qualified by missions and visions, but by academic learning including: reflection, critique, and historical analyses.

Dusan Savicevic, who provided Knowles with the term andragogy, explicitly claims andragogy as a discipline, the subject of which is the study of education and learning of adults in all its forms of expression' (Savicevic, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;97,&lt;ref&gt;Savicevic, Dusan (1999): Understanding Andragogy in Europe and America: Comparing and Contrasting. In: Reischmann, Jost/ Bron, Michal/ Jelenc, Zoran (eds): Comparative Adult Education 1998: the Contribution of ISCAE to an Emerging Field of Study. Ljubljana, Slovenia: Slovenian Institute for Adult Education, p. 97-119.&lt;/ref&gt; similarly Henschke, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Henschke, John (2003): Andragogy Website http://www.umsl.edu/~henschkej/&lt;/ref&gt; Reischmann, 2003&lt;ref&gt;Reischmann, Jost (2003): Why Andragogy? Bamberg University, Germany http://www.andragogy.net&lt;/ref&gt;).

Recent research has expanded andragogy into the online world, finding that using collaborative tools like a [[wiki]] can encourage learners to become more self-directed, thereby enriching the classroom environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bowe, Hoewe &amp; Zeldes (2012) An Andragogical Approach to Developing Dialogic Learning through Wikis.

'''Andragologist'''
Andragologists are those who practice and specialize in the field of andragogy. Andragologists have received a doctoral degree from an accredited university in Education (EdD) or a doctorate in Psychology (PsyD), or Philosophy (PhD) and focused their dissertation utilizing andragogy as a main component of their theoretical framework.

== Differences from pedagogy ==
Here are some of the main differences between pedagogy and andragogy:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. K. (1996; 1999, 2010) 'Andragogy', the encyclopedia of informal education.

|'''Learner''' ||  —The learner is dependent on the [[Teacher|instructor]], the teacher schedules all the activities; determining how, when and where they should take place

—Teacher is the one who is responsible for what is taught and how it is taught

—Teacher evaluates the learning

—Learner is responsible for the learning

—Self-evaluation is seen

==Optimal learning==
Neuroscientist and educator Eric Jensen's factors for optimal learning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdRaQAAACAAJ|title=Super Teaching|first=Eric|last=Jensen|date=16 February 1998|publisher=SAGE Publications|accessdate=19 October 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781890460020}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:

* Personal meaning.
* Circumstances present.
* Personal-concept. (A person's collection of thoughts about beliefs, experiences, values and knowledge.)
* Mode of sensory input. (Visual; auditory; kinesthetic; olfactory; gustatory.)
* Information processing. (Learning styles; processing states like linear, holistic, random, logical, concrete, reality based, temporal, non-temporal...etc.; artistic/analytic orientation; abstract/concrete...etc.)
* Responses. ([[Theory of multiple intelligences]].)

==Critique==
Knowles himself changed his position on whether andragogy really applied only to adults and came to believe that "pedagogy-andragogy represents a continuum ranging from teacher-directed to student-directed learning and that both approaches are appropriate with children and adults, depending on the situation."&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, et al (2007). Learning in Adulthood: A Comprehensive Guide, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Merriam|Caffarella|Baumgartner|2007|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson (1996) argues that the difference in learning is not related to the age and stage of one's life, but instead related to individual characteristics and the differences in "context, culture and power" within different educational settings.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, A. (1996) The search for separate theories of adult learning: does anyone really need andragogy? In Edwards, R., Hanson, A., and Raggatt, P. (eds.) ''Boundaries of Adult Learning. Adult Learners, Education and Training'', ''Vol. 1'' (p. 107) London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another critique of Knowles' work, Knowles was not able to use one of his principles (Self-concept) with adult learners to the extent that he describes in his practices. In one course, Knowles appears to allow "near total freedom in learner determination of objectives" but still "intended" the students to choose from a list of 18 objectives on the syllabus.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel, J.R. (2002) Andragogy's detectives: A critique of the present and a proposal for the future. ''Adult Education Quarterly'', Vol. 52, No. 3, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Self-concept can be critiqued not just from the instructor's point of view, but also from the student's point of view. Not all adult learners will know exactly what they want to learn in a course and may seek a more structured outline from an instructor. An instructor cannot assume that an adult will desire [[self-directed learning]] in every situation.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, S.B. (2001) Andragogy and self-directed learning: Pillars of adult learning theory. ''New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education'', Vol. spring 2001, No. 89, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

J.R. Kidd goes further by claiming that principles of learning have to be applied to lifelong development. He suggested that building a theory on adult learning would be meaningless, as there is no real basis for it. P. Jarvis even implies that andragogy would be more the result of an ideology than a scientific contribution to the comprehension of the learning processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infed.org/mobi/andragogy-what-is-it-and-does-it-help-thinking-about-adult-learning/|title=infed.org - Andragogy: what is it and does it help thinking about adult learning?|website=infed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles himself mentions that andragogy is a "model of assumptions about learning or a conceptual framework that serves as a basis for an emergent theory."&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, M. (1989) ''The making of an adult educator: An autobiographical journey'' (Ed.). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be a lack of research on whether this framework of teaching and learning principles is more relevant to adult learners or if it is just a set of good practices that could be used for both children and adult learners.

'''Anti-Khmer sentiment''', '''Khmerophobia''' or sometimes refers as '''anti-Cambodian sentiment''', is a sentiment against [[Cambodia]], the [[Khmers]], overseas Khmer, or Khmer culture. As the Khmers are dominant in Cambodia, it can be coined to anti-Cambodian sentiment and hatreds against Cambodians.

==Notable anti-Khmer sentiment==
===Vietnam===
Historically, Southern part of Vietnam before was not under Vietnamese rule but under [[Khmer Empire]]'s subject, however, following the [[Nam tiến|Vietnamese invasion to the South]], the gate to the [[South China Sea]] has eventually closed for Cambodia. During the time of [[Minh Mạng]] of [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], Vietnam implied a policy as "Hán di hữu ngạn" 漢夷有限 ("the Vietnamese and the barbarians must have clear borders") when differentiating between Khmers and the Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Choi Byung Wook|title=Southern Vietnam Under the Reign of Minh Mạng (1820–1841): Central Policies and Local Response|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foZAdRgB-nwC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=SEAP Publications|isbn=978-0-87727-138-3|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Minh Mạng]], the son of Gia Long stated with regards to the Vietnamese forcing the ethnic minorities to follow Sino-Vietnamese customs that "We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Dirk Moses|title=Empire, Colony, Genocide: Conquest, Occupation, and Subaltern Resistance in World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBgoNN4MG-YC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=minh+mang+han&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cOZSUqPkLcbgyQHVzYD4AQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=minh%20mang%20han&amp;f=false|archiveurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbSWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=minh+mang+han&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cOZSUqPkLcbgyQHVzYD4AQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=minh%20mang%20han&amp;f=false|archivedate=2008|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-452-4|pages=209–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were numerous Vietnamese invasions and occupation of Cambodia, although it was rather short-lived.

After the [[Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia]] later, at 1979, overthrew the [[Khmer Rouge]], Vietnamese troops stationed to Cambodia until 1989 to stabilize the country as well as helping Cambodians recover from war. Since then, the two countries relationship was positive, and the people from both countries welcomed each other.

Currently, with the recent anti-Vietnamese and pro-Chinese movement in Cambodia launched by [[Sam Rainsy]] and Cambodia's support for [[China]] in the South China Sea's conflict, Vietnamese have become more hostile towards Cambodia and Cambodian people, seeing Cambodians as ungrateful and traitors who do not remember the past.

===Thailand===
Hatreds against Khmers began with the rise of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]. The Siamese had ransacked [[Angkor Wat]] and invaded Cambodia many times in the history. Notably, Siamese Prince and King [[Naresuan]] had launched a brutal invasion which ransacked entire of Cambodia and Khmers being forced to Siam as its slave labors. It became a cure which would be remembered as Siamese atrocities against Khmers.

In the later times, when Vietnam rose to become a fierce rival, Siam had fought against Vietnam. However, many of Siam's attempt mostly crossed through Cambodia, which they had raped, looted and enslaved many Khmers during its road of invading Vietnam, thus led to many hostilities and hatreds against Cambodians among Siamese.

Since then, a numerous of disputes continued. In January 2003, [[2003 Phnom Penh riots|riots broke out]] in Phnom Penh after a Cambodian newspaper incorrectly reported that a Thai actress had stated [[Angkor Wat]] properly belonged to Thailand. On 29 January, the Thai embassy was burned, and hundreds of Thai immigrants fled the country to avoid the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2708499.stm |title=Cambodia apologises to Thais |date=30 January 2003 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 August 2012 |archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FAjNqPoY?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2708499.stm |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambodians in Phnom Penh burned photos of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] and Thais in Bangkok protested in front of the Cambodian embassy, burning Cambodian flags. This eventually led to the Thai government to sever diplomatic ties with Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Aglionby |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/31/cambodia |title=Thais cut links with Cambodia after riots &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] banned Thai shows and films on TV stations. Throughout 2008-13, Thai and Cambodian military forces did skirmish on each other over the [[Preah Vihear Temple|Preah Vihear]] dispute, led to [[Cambodian–Thai border dispute]]. Later court's decision, which favored Cambodia, sparked angers among Thai citizens.

Many Thais also see Cambodians as poor and uneducated, and there are even hatreds against Khmer immigrants.

===Philippines===
The [[Philippines]], which also has disputes with China, has been the major critics who criticized Cambodia for backing China. This led to some Filipinos believe Cambodia is a traitor of [[ASEAN]] and a puppet of China.

===Malaysia and Indonesia===
Hatreds against Cambodians mostly target on Khmer immigrants.

'''Babulang''' is the largest or grandest of the many rituals, ceremonies and festivals of the traditional [[Bisaya (Borneo)]] community of Limbang, [[Sarawak]]. It is a joyful occasion; involving many people; and incurs quite a substantial amount of expenditure to organize. The festival showcases various music, songs, and dances; displaying colourful traditional costumes; decorations and handicrafts. 

It is only during 'Babulang' that these Bisaya's dances, songs, handicrafts and hospitality to their guests are on display. 

Highlights are the [https://sarawaktourism.com/event/buffalo-race-festival-babulang/ Ratu Babulang] competition and the [[domestic buffalo|Water buffalo]] races which can only be found in this town in [[Sarawak]].

'''''Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker''''' (known as '''''Batman of the Future: Return of the Joker''''' in Europe) is a [[scrolling beat 'em up]] video game, released by Ubisoft for [[Game Boy Color]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Nintendo 64]]. The game was released to coincide with the [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|film of the same name]], and is largely based on the [[Batman Beyond|original TV series]].

==Gameplay==
Similar to games like ''[[Final Fight]]'', ''Batman Beyond'' plays as a [[beat 'em up]]-type game where the player, as [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]], wanders through levels that are essentially [[side-scrolling]], but have some depth to allow for three dimensional movement. The game is fairly simple along those lines.

The PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions of the game allow the player to select and switch between four suits while playing the game. Each suit has its own abilities.

* Standard: Even mixture of offensive strength and shielding. The Standard Suit comes equipped with three weapons: Dark Knight Discus, which are thrown as projectiles and require ammunition; Magnetic Nunchuku, which can be charged and attacks in a short straight line; and the Dark Knight Staff, which attacks in a circular area.
* Offense: Capable of stronger attacks, but is more fragile than the other suits of the game. The Offense Suit allows the player to punch open gray crates, which grants access to extra items and a few extra areas.
* Defense: Deals weaker attacks, but better protects the player from damage. The Defense Suit is equipped with two shields that can be used to deflect nearly all enemy attacks. A special technique called the Shield Punch allows the player to deal heavy damage to enemies.
* Nimble: Allows the player to double-jump, glide, and perform jumping kicks. The double jump ability allows the player to access some extra items, but the glide ability seems to have only one function in the game.

"'''Bože pravde'''" ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Боже правде}}; {{IPA-sr|bǒʒe prâːʋde|}}; God of Justice)&lt;ref name=engleski/&gt; is the [[national anthem]] of [[Serbia]], as defined by the Article 7 of the [[Constitution of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav_odredbe.php?id=217 Constitution of Serbia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616134133/http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav_odredbe.php?id=217 |date=June 16, 2013 }} at the site of the Government of Serbia&lt;/ref&gt; "Bože pravde" was the state anthem of the [[Principality of Serbia]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] until 1918 when Serbia became a part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] which was formed that year. It was recommended by the regional [[Parliament of Serbia]] on August 17, 2004&lt;ref name=engleski/&gt; and constitutionally adopted on November 8, 2006, after Serbia became a sovereign state again. The recommended text was made Law on May 11, 2009.&lt;ref name="Zakon"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Zakon o izgledu i upotrebi grba, zastave i himne Republike Srbije |trans-title=Law on the Appearance and Use of the Coat of arms, the Flag and the Anthem of the Republic of Serbia |work=Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia – No. 36/2009 |publisher=Narodna skupština Republike Srbije – JP "Službeni glasnik" |date=2009-05-11|url=http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/lat/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=549&amp;t=Z |accessdate=2009-06-26 |language=Serbian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219072218/http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/lat/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=549&amp;t=Z |archivedate=2009-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original song was written in 1872 with music by [[Davorin Jenko]] and lyrics by [[Jovan Đorđević]]. It was then a piece for the theater play ''Marko kazuje na kome je carstvo'' ([[Prince Marko|Marko]] names the Emperor), and its immense popularity with audiences prompted its adoption as the Serbian national anthem.

[[File:Boze pravde, 1918.ogg|thumb|"Boze pravde" performed in the late 1910s]]
[[File:Bože pravde Arena.ogv|thumb|Fans singing "Bože pravde" in [[Belgrade Arena]] before the handball match Serbia vs Germany, [[2012 European Men's Handball Championship]]]]
While being the national anthem of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], it occasionally was referred to as the "Serbian National Prayer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/serbia-boze-pravde/ | title=Serbia - Bože pravde | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2011-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original lyrics contained a petition for the [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian king]]. Various rulers of Serbia changed the words of the anthem to suit them. During the rule of Prince [[Milan I of Serbia]], the words were "God, save Prince Milan" (''knez Milana Bože spasi''), which changed to ''King Milan'' when Serbia became a kingdom. Later it was tailored to [[Peter I of Yugoslavia|Peter I]] and [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=LJ. M. V. - J. Ž. S.|title=Hej, Bože pravde!|date=2006-08-01|work=[[Vecernje novosti]]|url=http://www.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=1&amp;status=jedna&amp;vest=92154&amp;datum=2006-07-25|accessdate=2007-04-17|language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (which later became the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]), "Bože pravde" was part of [[National Anthem of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|its national anthem]].

The current anthem uses slightly modified original lyrics, asserting that Serbia is no longer a [[monarchy]] — four verses are different. In three, "Serbian king" (''srpskog kralja'') is changed to "Serbian lands" (''srpske zemlje'') and in one, "God save the Serbian king" (''srpskog kralja Bože spasi'', literally "The Serbian king, O God, save") is changed to "O God, save; O God, defend" (''Bože spasi, Bože brani'').

It was also used as a state anthem of [[Republika Srpska]], an [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|entity]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] until 2006, when it was ruled down by the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina|country's constitutional court]]. The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has ruled against the use of "Bože pravde" as the anthem of [[Republika Srpska]] in 2006, declaring it unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ustavnisud.ba/eng/press/index.php?pid=1381&amp;sta=3&amp;pkat=507|title=Press Release|publisher=Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2007-01-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103184526/http://www.ustavnisud.ba/eng/press/index.php?pid=1381&amp;sta=3&amp;pkat=507|archivedate=2014-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the decision was upheld by the Constitutional Court of Republika Srpska.&lt;ref name=rfe&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2007/07-07-27.rferl.html#24|title=Republika Srpska court upholds complaint about anthem|publisher=RFE/RL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, "[[Vostani Serbije]]" and "[[Marš na Drinu]]" were proposed as the anthem of Serbia along with "Bоže pravde".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/arhiva_html/513/25.html|title=Zašto Srbija još nema himnu|publisher=Vreme|author=Konstantin Babić|date=2000-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, promulgated by then-ruling [[Socialist Party of Serbia]], even received a plurality of popular vote on [[Serbian constitutional referendum, 1992|referendum]], but was never officially adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr/vesti/politika/izdvajamo/2008_03_06/vest_53944.jsp|title=Svi naši referendumi|publisher=Radio-televizija Vojvodine|location=Novi Sad|date=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

God of Justice; Thou who saved us
when in deepest bondage cast,
Hear Thy Serbian children's voices,
Be our help as in the past.

With Thy mighty hand sustain us,
Still our rugged pathway trace;
''God, our hope; protect and cherish,''
''Serbian lands and Serbian race!''

Bind in closest links our kindred
Teach the love that will not fail,
May the loathed fiend of discord
Never in our ranks prevail.

Let the golden fruits of union
Our young tree of freedom grace;
''God, our Master! Guide and prosper,''(*)
''Serbian lands and Serbian race!''(*)

Lord! Avert from us Thy vengeance,
Thunder of Thy dreaded ire;
Bless each Serbian town and hamlet,
Mountain, meadow, heart and spire!

When our host goes forth to battle
Death or victory to embrace-
''God of armies! Be our leader,''(*)
''Strengthen then the Serbian race!''(*)

On our sepulchre of ages
Breaks the resurrection morn,
From the slough of direst slavery
Serbia anew is born.

Through five hundred years of durance
We have knelt before Thy face,

''Thus entreats the Serbian race!''(*)&lt;ref name=engleski&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.srbija.gov.rs/pages/article.php?id=5412&amp;change_lang=en| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105114/http://www.srbija.gov.rs/pages/article.php?id=5412&amp;change_lang=en| dead-url=yes| archive-date=July 20, 2011| title=National symbols and anthem of the Republic of Serbia | publisher=[[Government of Serbia]] | accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0ZteuDbZg4C&amp;pg=PA15|title=Serbia, Her People, History and Aspirations|year=1915|last=Petrovitch|first=Voislav|page=15 | isbn=978-1-60206-941-1 | publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|access-date=October 14, 2017}} Translated by Elisabeth Christitch, originally published in The Times.

'''William Brown Turei''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZM}} (12 December 1924 – 9 January 2017) was the Archbishop, Te Pīhopa o Aotearoa/Bishop of Aotearoa (senior bishop of the Māori Tikanga) and Primate/Te Pīhopa Mataamua of the [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia]]. He shared the primacy with [[Philip Richardson (bishop)|Philip Richardson]], archbishop for the New Zealand dioceses, and [[Winston Halapua]], Bishop of Polynesia.

==Biography==

===Childhood and education===
Turei was born in 1924 in [[Opotiki]], to the Waititi [[whānau]]. He became a ''whāngai'' to the Turei ''whanau'' in [[Cape Runaway]], on the [[East Cape]]. He was named after the Reverend Brown Turei, a ''Hāhi Mihinare'' priest on the east coast.

He spent his primary school years at Rangitukia and Cape Runaway and studied at [[Te Aute College]] for four years. He briefly attended [[College House (University of Canterbury)|College House]], [[Christchurch]], before enlisting with C Company of the [[Māori Battalion|28 Maori Battalion]] to serve in World War II.  After the war he attended [[St John's College, Auckland|St John's College]], [[Auckland]] and was [[ordained]] a priest in 1950.

On 15 October 2009, Turei was selected by Te Aute College to be a part of its 1st XV leaders group. The honour is given to former pupils over the age of 55 who have made a significant contribution to Māori society. Turei attended Te Aute College from 1939 to 1943.

===Ordained ministry===
Turei served the Anglican Church in parishes and Maori pastorates in [[Tauranga]], [[Whangara]], [[Te Puke]], [[Whakatane]], [[Manutuke]], Christchurch and Waipatu.  He was appointed Archdeacon of [[Te Pīhopatanga o Te Tairāwhiti|Tairāwhiti]] in 1982 and has had a long association with [[Hukarere Girls College]], becoming chaplain there in 1984. He was also chaplain of the Napier Prison for four years.

In 1992 Turei was elected as ''Te Pīhopa o Te Tai Rāwhiti'', following the reforms of the Anglican Church in 1990.  In February 2006 he was elected to succeed [[Whakahuihui Vercoe]] as ''Pihopa o Aotearoa'', at a [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]] at [[Turangawaewae]], and on May 11 he was installed and appointed co-presiding Bishop of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia alongside [[David Moxon]] and [[Jabez Leslie Bryce]].

In the [[2016 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2016 New Year Honours]], Turei was appointed an [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to the Anglican Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2016 | title=New Year honours list 2016 |date=31 December 2015 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Turei announced that he would retire as te Pihopa o Tairāwhiti by the year's end, and as Maori archbishop in March 2017.&lt;ref name="angl_Maor"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Maori Archbishop to retire in March 2017 | author =  | work = anglicannews.org | date = 23 August 2016 | accessdate = 2016-08-23 | url = http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/08/maori-archbishop-to-retire-in-march-2017.aspx | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he died before that date, on 9 January 2017, in [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]].&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Archbishop Brown Turei dies at 92 | author =  | work = anglicannews.org | date = 10 January 2017 | accessdate = 2017-01-10 | url = http://anglicantaonga.org.nz/News/Tikanga-Maori/Brown2| quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 92 years old.&lt;ref name="gisherald"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archbishop Brown Turei a ‘gentle and wise’ man|url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/2620464-135/archbishop-brown-turei-a-gentle-and|website=Gisborne Herald|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Camp-Settlement.jpg|thumb|A Camp settlement.]]
[[Image:Shantyvolunteerpoint.jpg|thumb|[[Volunteer Point]].]]

The '''Camp''' is the term used in the [[Falkland Islands]] to refer to any part of the islands outside the islands' only significant town, [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], and often the large [[RAF]] base at [[RAF Mount Pleasant|Mount Pleasant]]. It is derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''campo'', for "countryside".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falklandislands.com/section.php/80/1/camping  Stay with us » Camping:  Falkland Islands Tourist Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camp contains various small settlements, such as [[Fox Bay]], [[Goose Green]], [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]], and [[Port Howard]], which are usually little more than several houses. [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]] in the north of [[East Falkland]] is the oldest permanent settlement in the islands, established by the French in 1764. [[Port Egmont]] on [[Saunders Island, Falkland Islands|Saunders Island]], now abandoned, is the oldest British settlement. The majority of the Camp population lives on [[East Falkland]], followed by [[West Falkland]]. Outlying islands such as [[Pebble Island|Pebble]], [[Sea Lion Island|Sea Lion]], [[West Point Island|West Point]], [[Weddell Island|Weddell]] and [[Carcass Island]] are inhabited as well. Camp is used in formal contexts: e.g. the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly has Stanley and [[Camp (constituency)|Camp]] constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=5513&amp;source=3  Falkland Islands News Network: Eighteen Stand for Falklands' Elections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302210859/http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=5513&amp;source=3 |date=2012-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some British military installations such as RAF Mount Pleasant, [[Mare Harbour]], and Mount Alice, and there is also the [[Bodie Suspension Bridge]], the southernmost of its kind in the world. Many parts are still landmined from the time of the [[Falklands War]], particularly just outside Stanley.

[[Time in the Falklands|Officially]], the Falklands uses [[UTC-3]] in the summer months (and since September 2010 has been on UTC-3 permanently) but many residents of Camp use [[UTC-4]] all year round, known on the Falklands as "Camp Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footprinttravelguides.com/latin-america/falkland-islands/essentials/essentials-a-z/ |title=Essentials A-Z - Falklands |author= |date= |work= Foot Printtravel Guides |publisher= |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused confusion in 2009 when a team of [[Royal Engineers]] working in [[Hill Cove]] did not realise [[West Falkland]] was on a different time zone from [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sartma.com/artc_6373_FI_760_2.html |title=Hill Cove Repairs |author=Juanita Brock |date=4 April 2009 |newspaper= Falkland Islands News Network |publisher= sartma |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheep farming is the main industry. Others include fishing, and tourism (particularly wildlife or war-related tours). The Camp is represented by three members of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands]], currently [[Roger Edwards (Falkland Islands politician)|Roger Edwards]], [[Ian Hansen]] and [[Teslyn Barkman]].

[[File:EpcotCanadaTotem.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Totem pole by the Northwest Mercantile store]]
The '''Canada Pavilion''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]]-themed [[pavilion]] that is part of [[Epcot#World Showcase|World Showcase]] within [[Epcot]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[United States]]. Its location is next to the [[United Kingdom Pavilion at Epcot|British]] pavilion.

==Layout==
The Canada Pavilion is designed to remind guests of Canada's outdoors. It includes a canyon, a [[waterfall]], gardens, a [[reflecting pool|pool]] with fountains, and totem poles. The main attraction is ''[[O Canada! (film)|O Canada!]]'', a [[Circle-Vision 360°]] movie of Canada's cities, scenery and people. The pavilion also includes Le Cellier Steakhouse and the former home of the Celtic rock band [[Off Kilter (band)|Off Kilter]]. Characters from the animated films ''[[Brother Bear]]'' (Koda, Rutt and Tuke) and ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (Meeko and Flit) can sometimes be seen.

==Attraction history==
Prior to the construction of the pavilion, the Walt Disney Company sought financial support for the attraction from the Canadian government. The company wanted the federal government to fund the cost of building the attraction; in return the government would have input into the design and layout. The Canadian government was concerned about the [[stereotype]] of Canada that Disney wanted (i.e., [[lumberjacks]]). Funding was refused, and Disney threatened to pull the exhibit, but ultimately did not.

At one time during the planning, the pavilion was to have been divided by a main street of shops and restaurants, with one side representing [[French Canada]] and the other [[English Canada]].

At the opening in 1982, the original musical talent for the Canadian pavilion was a trio called the "Caledonian Pipe Band", consisting of two pipers and one drummer. The performers were Robert (Bob) Proctor (lead, drummer), Kenneth Mauchin (piper) and Robert Mauchin (piper). They were recruited by Ron Rodriguez (talent co-ordinator for Walt Disney World) from the Rosie O'Grady's Pipe Band of Orlando. Because all three had ties to [[Scotland]], they also performed in the British pavilion at various times.

In 2007, Disney updated the movie ''O Canada!'', filmed in 1979. For several years, the [[Canadian Tourism Commission]] lobbied to have the movie updated, partly to remove outdated stereotypes of Canadian life. On August 31, 2007, the updated edition opened with a new host, Canadian actor [[Martin Short]], and ''[[Canadian Idol]]'' winner [[Eva Avila]] reprising the original film's theme song, "Canada (You're a Lifetime Journey)".&lt;ref name="Canada.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/culture/story.html?id=185ec8a5-0600-400c-b2fc-7e04a0adc5ad|title=Epcot Center's O Canada! film gets an update|publisher=|access-date=August 10, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026015829/http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/culture/story.html?id=185ec8a5-0600-400c-b2fc-7e04a0adc5ad#|archive-date=October 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions and services==

===Attraction===
* '''''O Canada!''''', a [[Circle-Vision 360°]] movie of Canada's cities and scenery.

===Dining===
* '''Le Cellier Steakhouse''' provides sit down restaurant service.  The interior is to give the impression of a wine cellar as its name suggests. Food offerings include seafood and steaks, along with popular Canadian wines and beer. It is located in the main building of the pavilion, '''Hotel du Canada''' modeled after the [[Château Laurier]] hotel in [[Ottawa]]. The building is presented (with the aid of [[forced perspective]]) to look as if it is six stories in height, but is really three. The restaurant was originally a [[cafeteria-style restaurant|cafeteria-style]] dining hall. It actually is a cellar, located underneath the chateau; it was designed to appear as a wine cellar, with simulated stone arches and dark ambient lighting.
* '''Popcorn Cart''' sells popcorn, soda, [[Moosehead Brewery|Moosehead]] Lager, Moosehead Light and [[Labatt's]] Blue On Draft

===Shopping===
* '''Northwest Mercantile''' sells wilderness themed [[Christmas]] ornaments, [[NHL]] [[hockey jersey|jerseys]] and accessories for Canada's seven teams, a variety of animal plush, [[maple syrup]], and a selection of Canadian wines and ice wines. It is located in the trading post building, which is designed to look like a traditional West coast native [[longhouse]].
* '''The Wood Cart''' (located on the promenade) sells a variety of wine-themed merchandise, animal plush, flags and other assorted goods. The Cart also features an engraving stand, where guests can have their names engraved onto genuine leather bracelets, cuffs, cell phone strap charms, and Disney character keychains.

===Entertainment===
* Canadian Holiday Voyagers Began December 1, 2015 &lt;ref name="orlandosentinel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/theme-park-rangers-blog/os-disney-canadian-lumberjacks-epcot-20151124-post.html|title=Disney ends Canadian lumberjack show at Epcot - Orlando Sentinel|author=Orlando Sentinel|date=November 24, 2015|work=OrlandoSentinel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former Entertainment===
* '''[[Off Kilter (band)]]''' is a Celtic rock band which debuted at the Canada Pavilion July 1, 1997, and closed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allears.net/tp/ep/okilter.htm|title=On the Record with Off Kilter |publisher=R.Y.I. Enterprises, LLC|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Canadian Lumberjacks''' debuted in Fall 2014 - Ended November 30, 2015 &lt;ref name="orlandosentinel"/&gt;

===Totem poles===
The pavilion has three native [[totem pole]]s, up to 30' (9 metres) in height. Two are made of fibreglass, and one is carved out of wood. The wooden totem pole depicts three stories of the "Raven" tricking the "Sky Chief" into the release of [[sun]], [[moon]] and stars from a chest. It was carved by the [[Alaska]]n artist [[David A. Boxley]], and was officially put on display in April 1998.

===Gardens===
[[File:Epcotcanada.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gardens at the Canada Pavilion]]
The '''Victoria Gardens''' which are adjacent to the Hotel du Canada are inspired by the [[Butchart Gardens]] near [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. The gardens are the largest (and most labour-intensive) of all the national pavilions.

===Hidden Mickeys===
The Canada Pavilion contains three [[Hidden Mickeys]]:

# Just outside Northwest Mercantile, there is the largest totem pole in the Canada Pavilion.  The Mickey is just underneath the elbow of a set of arms near the top of the pole.
# Inside the Northwest Mercantile shop is a roughly foot-long fish hanging from a crate.  The Mickey is painted on the fish itself.
# Just inside Le Cellier steakhouse there is the counter where you would check in for your meal.  Behind that counter is a small [[wine storage]] room.  In the very top center of the rack are three bottles of wine, a large one with two small ones on top of it forming a familiar shape.

==Former attractions and services==

===Dining===
* '''Le Cellier Cafeteria''' (became Le Cellier Steakhouse)
* '''La Boutique des Provinces''' (located in Hotel du Canada) sells [[Anne of Green Gables]] gifts, Blue Mountain pottery, along with various handcrafted [[souvenirs]].
* '''Beaver Tails''' kiosk cart, which sold [[BeaverTails|Beaver tail]] goods. (Closed in 2005 and cart removed in late 2006).

===Films===
* Circle-Vision 360°:
** ''Portraits of Canada / Images du Canada'' - played for a short period after its debut at the Telecom Canada pavilion at [[Expo 86]] in Vancouver.
** ''Canada 67''

The '''Candy Desk''' has been a [[Traditions of the United States Senate|tradition]] of the [[United States Senate]] since 1968, whereby a senator who sits at a particular desk near a busy entrance keeps a drawer full of candy for members of the body. &lt;!--[THE BODY OF THE ARTICLE STATES THAT ALL THE OCCUPANTS HAVE BEEN REPUBLICANS, CANNOT FIND A SOURCE FOR AN 'ORIGINAL' DESK ON THE DEM SIDE:] The same desk has not always been used; the Candy Desk was moved to its present position on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] side of [[United States Senate Chamber|the chamber]] after over three decades on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] side, where it was used by several senators.--&gt; The current occupant of the Candy Desk is Pennsylvania Senator [[Pat Toomey]].

In 1965, California's [[George Murphy]] joined the Senate, and kept candy in his desk to offer his colleagues, and for himself, though eating is not allowed on the Senate floor. When he left the Senate after a six-year term, other Republican senators maintained the custom. The nascent tradition did not become publicly known until the mid-1980s, when Washington Senator [[Slade Gorton]] disclosed it in announcing that he would be sitting at the Candy Desk.

Senators who have maintained the Candy Desk tradition include [[John McCain]], [[Harrison Schmitt]], and [[Rick Santorum]], who stocked it with confectionery from his home state of Pennsylvania, including from the [[Hershey Chocolate Company]]. After Santorum left the Senate in 2007, the Candy Desk was maintained by a number of senators for a short time each, before Pennsylvania Senator Toomey began his stay in 2015.

==History==
[[File:GeorgeMurphy.jpg|thumb|[[George Murphy]], a one-term senator from California, is considered the founder of the candy desk tradition.]]

[[George Murphy]] [[United States Senate elections, 1964|was elected]] as the [[List of United States Senators from California|Senator from California]] in 1964, to take office the following year.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt; Murphy, known as a song-and-dance man from musicals such as ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'', ''[[Broadway Melody of 1940]]'' and ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]'', had a taste for sweets. A short time after joining the Senate, he started keeping candy in his desk; then, in 1968, he moved desks and ended up at the spot where the Candy Desk is now situated. Since more senators now passed his desk on a daily basis, he started offering the contents of his desk to his colleagues. Senators who were invited to partake in the sweets started calling Murphy's desk the "candy desk". Murphy was defeated in the [[United States Senate elections, 1970|1970 Senate elections]], but subsequent senators have carried on the tradition of supplying candy in their desk for the enjoyment of the Senate as a whole.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt;

[[Paul Fannin]], [[Harrison Schmitt]], [[Roger Jepsen]], and [[Steve Symms]] all continued the new candy desk tradition, in that order, after Murphy's one term was over. Fannin, Schmitt, and Jepsen supplied only hard candy, but Symms was the first to stock sweets supplied by "candy and chocolate associations."&lt;ref name="Durant" /&gt; During the tenures of these senators, the candy desk was not fixed to one particular spot. Senate seating charts show Schmitt, during his time with the candy desk, sat one seat to the right of its traditional spot for the [[95th United States Congress|95th Congress]], and then sat across the aisle from the traditional spot for the [[96th United States Congress|96th]].&lt;ref name = "1977 directory" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "1979 directory" /&gt;

None of the above was publicly known until 1985, when [[Slade Gorton]] put out a press release stating "He was now the occupant of this desk and would carry on the rich traditions started by Murphy."&lt;ref name="Durant" /&gt; He also named the past senators who had continued the tradition.&lt;ref name="Durant" /&gt;

In 1997, the candy desk was referenced by [[Kit Bond]] during a debate over the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] for fiscal year 1998. He compared the sizes of microchips to candy he had taken from the desk.&lt;ref name = "Congressional Record" /&gt;

The high point, in terms of well-known candy, came during the ten years [[Rick Santorum]] sat at the candy desk (1997–2007). Being a senator from [[Pennsylvania]], he filled the candy desk with [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]] candy and [[Just Born]] products (such as [[Mike and Ike]] and [[Hot Tamales]]).&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; During this time period, Hershey shipped roughly 100 pounds of chocolate and other candy four times a year for Santorum to fill the desk.&lt;ref name = "Straub" /&gt; When Santorum did not win re-election during the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|2006 U.S. Senate elections]], Kirk Saville, a spokesman for Hershey, said about the company's no longer being able to supply sweets for the candy desk, "We were pleased to be a small part of sweetening up congressional proceedings."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

Issues arose after Santorum was defeated for re-election to the Senate in 2006, and Senator [[Craig L. Thomas|Craig Thomas]] began his tenure at the candy desk. [[Wyoming]], the state he was representing, has no members of the [[National Confectioners Association]], and therefore no candymakers large enough to donate hundreds of dollars of candy to fill the desk. Senate [[Government ethics|ethics]] rules "forbid members accepting gifts worth $100 or more a year from a single source,"&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; which can become a problem if a large amount of candy is consumed from the desk each year. An exception to this rule allows larger gifts of objects created or produced in the state the senator is from, as long as the items are primarily not used by the senator and his staff. This is so senators can "offer visitors home-grown snacks, such as [[Florida]] [[orange juice]] or [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[peanut]]s."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; When asked about Thomas being in charge of the candy desk, Susan Smith, a representative from the National Confectioners Association, stated, "We're happy to provide candy if there are [association] members...It would be difficult for us to do now."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; These issues were worked around by asking many small, local, Wyoming confectionery businesses and [[chocolatier]]s to give small amounts of candy that were rotated in and out of the desk.&lt;ref name="trib" /&gt;

After Thomas's death in 2007, it was looked after by [[George Voinovich]] and then [[Mel Martinez]].&lt;ref name="Romano" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Compass" /&gt; Both had relatively short tenures. In 2009, [[George LeMieux]], Martinez's successor, began sitting at the desk&lt;ref name="Miami" /&gt; and was there until he left the Senate in 2011. [[Mark Kirk]] of Illinois occupied the desk from 2011 to 2015.

==Location==

The candy desk is not a specific desk in the Senate Chamber, but rather a specific seating within the chamber, and any desk that the senator seated in that position chooses to use becomes the candy desk.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; The desk's location has remained static since at least the [[97th United States Congress|97th Congress]] (1981–1983). It is next to the eastern door to the senate chamber.&lt;ref name = "Kirk" /&gt; Most senators enter the chamber through this door, which is adjacent to elevators leading to one of the stops on the [[United States Capitol subway system]]. The desk is the first desk on the right, or Republican, side, and is in the last row of desks.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; Traditionally, the candy desk is always on the Republican side of the Senate Chamber and is used by a Republican senator.&lt;ref name="Skiba" /&gt;  Since 2015 the desk has been occupied by Pennsylvania Senator [[Pat Toomey]].&lt;ref name = "Villalpando" /&gt;
&lt;!--[THE FOLLOWING SECTION APPEARS ONLY TO REPEAT INFORMATION ALREADY SUPPLIED IN THE LEDE AND OTHER SECTIONS:]
==Candy==
The tenant of the candy desk is charged with stocking it with candy from his or her home state, but funding has been an issue. Originally senators would ask for a specific candy and leave a few dollars to keep the desk stocked with their favorites, but as time continued, and the candy desk became a more solid [[Traditions of the United States Senate|tradition of the Senate]], [[lobby groups]] and organizations, specifically the [[National Confectioners Association]] and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association (before their merger in 2008), organized donations.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;--&gt;

==Other candy desks==
The Democrats have also had a candy desk since at least 1985.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; A [[rolltop desk]] located on the front wall, belonging to the [[United States Senate Democratic Conference Secretary]], is also filled with sweets. This tradition began "sometime later" than the better known candy desk;&lt;ref name="Compass" /&gt; [[Hershey Kisses]] were the most popular candy from this desk during the 1980s, followed by small caramels.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee" /&gt; Candy for this desk is paid for through a "candy fund" to which senators who would like to partake of the desk's contents contribute.&lt;ref name="Compass" /&gt; Until he left the Senate in 2015, [[Jay Rockefeller]] was responsible for collecting the money and purchasing the candy. This tradition is not widely known; in fact, it is so little-known that the [[Historian of the United States Senate]] does not know much about it.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;

Other senators sometimes keep candy in their desks as well. Katherine Buck, a [[United States Senate Page]] at the time, wrote the following in 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One senator with a particularly strong hankering for chocolate is [[Jim Talent]] from Missouri. Once during a vote, he called people away from the candy desk to his own on the other side of the row. There were oohs and aahs until six people walked away with Russell Stover Low-Carb Chocolates. (I guess the Atkins craze had made its way to the Senate.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''''Commonwealth Club Address''''' (23 September 1932) was a speech made by [[New York Governor]] and Democratic presidential nominee [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in San Francisco on his [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential campaign.]]&lt;ref&gt;Eden, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, pp 353-55&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt said the era of growth and unrestricted entrepreneurship had ended, and the individualism must give way to collective action. He was not at all specific, but he hinted at liberal reforms of the sort that emerged in [[First 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency|The First Hundred  Days]] after his inauguration in March 1933. Scholars rate it among the 100 greatest speeches made by a President in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Houck, ''Commonwealth Club Address: Redefining Individualism, Adjudicating Greatness'' (2004) p 259&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roosevelt's argument==
Roosevelt was long on history and short on specifics. He sketched a philosophical foundation for the [[New Deal]], and ultimately for a [[Second Bill of Rights]] that he was committed to achieving over the course of his administration.  Most historians consider it prophetic regarding the actual content of New Deal liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Houck, p 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The great era of rapid economic growth had ended, Roosevelt argued.&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from  Roosevelt, "Commonwealth Club Address," [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=88391 online version]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the days when growth was all-important, he agreed that it had been necessary to turn political and economic power over to entrepreneurs who were building the nation.  But the era of economic growth  was over he said;  the entrepreneurs are now dangerous:
: A mere builder of more industrial plants, a creator of more railroad systems, an organizer of more corporations, is as likely to be a danger as a help. The day of the great promoter or the financial Titan, to whom we granted anything if only he would build, or develop, is over.

Roosevelt said that further growth was unnecessary: "Our task now is not discovery or exploitation of natural resources, or necessarily producing more goods."  What America instead needed to do:
:Is the soberer, less dramatic business of administering resources and plants already in hand, of seeking to reestablish foreign markets for our surplus production, of meeting the problem of underconsumption, of adjusting production to consumption, of distributing wealth and products more equitably, of adapting existing economic organizations to the service of the people. The day of enlightened administration has come.

Parts of his speech had a gloomy tone: "A glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates that equality of opportunity as we have known it no longer exists." "We are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are not there already."  However he did hint at reforms that would bring about a better world:  "Every man has a right to life; and this means that he has also a right to make a comfortable living."

Biographer [[Frank Freidel]] emphasizes that Roosevelt wanted government to "act as a regulator for the common good within the existing economic system." Roosevelt believed his philosophy was in accord with the traditions of Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson, as modified to deal with a much more complex and mature economic order.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The response to the speech by  the 2000-member luncheon audience and by the national media was tepid. Some thought it too socialistic; others considered it too academic in tone, especially for its long passages on the lessons of American and European history. Roosevelt did not try to rework his material into simpler speeches. He moved on to other topics, and received a rousing reception to the more usual speech he gave that same evening.&lt;ref&gt;Houck, p 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech was written by [[Adolf A. Berle]] and his wife Beatrice, who worked on Roosevelt's campaign office.&lt;ref&gt;Eden, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10525">[[File:Medusa coin.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Gorgon]]'s head is a frequent [[numismatic]] [[iconography|icon]] (here with [[Sozopol#History|anchor]] on reverse) that may appear on a danake]]

The '''danake''' or '''danace''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δανάκη}}) was a small [[silver]] coin of the [[Persian Empire]] ([[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] ''dânake''), equivalent to the Greek [[obolus|obol]] and circulated among the [[Ionia|eastern Greeks]]. Later it was used by the Greeks in other metals.&lt;ref&gt;Albert R. Frey, ''A Dictionary of [[Numismatics|Numismatic]] Names'' (New York 1917), p. 60; A.D.H. Bivar, "[[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] Coins, Weights and Measures", in ''The Cambridge History of Iran'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), vol. 2, p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd-century grammarian [[Julius Pollux]] gives the name as ''danikê'' or ''danakê'' or ''danikon'' and says that it was a Persian coin,&lt;ref&gt;A. Cunningham, "Relics from Ancient Persia in Gold, Silver, and Copper", ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' 50 (1881), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; but by Pollux's time this was an [[anachronism]].&lt;ref name="A.D.H. Bivar 1985 p. 622"&gt;A.D.H. Bivar, "Achaemenid Coins, Weights and Measures", in ''The Cambridge History of Iran'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), vol. 2, p. 622.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term as used by [[archaeology|archaeologists]] is vague in regard to [[Denomination (currency)|denomination]]. A single coin buried with the dead and made of silver or [[gold]] is often referred to as a danake and presumed to be a form of [[Charon's obol]]. [[Numismatics|Numismatists]] have also found the danake an elusive coin to identify, speculating that the Greeks used the term loosely for a [[Legal tender#Demonetisation|demonetized]] coin of foreign origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Babelon]], entry on "Danaké", ''Traité des monnaies grecques et romaines'', vol. 1 (Paris: Leroux, 1901), pp. 514–518 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TmcCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA523&amp;dq=danaké+%22ce+nom%22+inauthor:Babelon&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA522,M1 full text online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Persia, the danake was originally a unit of weight for bulk silver, representing one-eighth of a [[shekel]] (1.05 gm).&lt;ref&gt;A.D.H. Bivar, "Achaemenid Coins, Weights and Measures", in ''The Cambridge History of Iran'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), vol. 2, p. 622, citing the evidence of the [[Persepolis#Ancient texts|Persepolis tablets]].&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the word became obsolete. In the [[Hellenistic period]] and later it designated the silver [[Attica|Attic]] obol, which originally represented the sixth part of a [[drachma]]; in [[Persian language#New Persian|New Persian]] ''dâng'' means "one sixth".&lt;ref name="A.D.H. Bivar 1985 p. 622" /&gt;

[[File:Charon&amp;Psychopomp.jpg|thumb|[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] receives a coin for the passage of a soul guided by [[Hermes]] ([[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]) as [[psychopomp]].]]

{{Main|Charon's obol}}
The danake is one of the coins that served as the so-called Charon's obol, which was placed on or in a dead person's mouth to pay the [[ferry]]man who conveyed souls across the river that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Albert R. Frey, ''A Dictionary of [[Numismatics|Numismatic]] Names'' (New York 1917), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Charon's obol is sometimes specifically called a ''naulum'' (Greek {{lang|grc|ναῦλον}}, "boat fare").&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]], [[The Frogs|''Frogs'']] 270; [[Juvenal]] 8.97; [[Apuleius]], ''Metamorphoses'' 6.18; Albert R. Frey, ''A Dictionary of Numismatic Names'' (New York 1917), p.158.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian-era [[lexicographer]] [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] gives "the obol for the dead" as one of the meanings of {{lang|grc|δανάκη}},&lt;ref&gt;Hesychius, entry on {{lang|grc|δανάκη}}, ''Lexicon'', edited by M. Schmidt (Jena 1858–68), I 549, as cited by Gregory Grabka, "Christian Viaticum: A Study of Its Cultural Background", ''Traditio'' 9 (1953) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Suda]] defines the danake as a coin traditionally buried with the dead for paying the ferryman to cross the [[Acheron]].&lt;ref&gt;Entry on {{lang|grc|δανάκη}}, ''[[Suda|Suidae]] Lexicon'', edited by A. Adler (Leipzig 1931) II 5f., cited by Gregory Grabka, "Christian Viaticum", ''Traditio'' 9 (1953) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In literary sources, the smallness of the [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] was taken as a reminder that death is an equalizer of rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Susan T. Stevens, "Charon's Obol and Other Coins in Ancient Funerary Practice," ''Phoenix'' 45 (1991), pp. 217, 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Charon's obol is usually regarded as [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]], archaeology indicates that the rite of placing of a coin in the mouth of the deceased was practiced also during [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and even [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanian]] times in the region that is present-day [[Iran]]. The coin, however, was customarily a drachma.&lt;ref&gt;A.D.H. Bivar, "Achaemenid Coins, Weights and Measures", in ''The Cambridge History of Iran'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), vol. 2, pp. 622–623, with citations on the archaeological evidence in note 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In his entry on the {{lang|grc|δανάκη}}, Hesychius implies that the coin was mentioned by [[Heracleides of Cyme]] in his lost work ''Persica'' around 350 B.C., placing its use (perhaps erroneously) in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] period.&lt;ref&gt;A.D.H. Bivar, "Achaemenid Coins, Weights and Measures", in ''The Cambridge History of Iran'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), vol. 2, p. 622. Bivar calls it a "bookman's notion" that danake was the correct name for the boat fare and blames a misunderstanding of a line in Callimachus.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funerary context ==
Gold danakes are frequently found in graves. In a [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] burial of the 4th century B.C., a gold danake had been placed on the lips of a woman, presumed from her religious paraphernalia to be an initiate into the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] or [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] [[mystery cult|mysteries]]. The coin was stamped with a [[Gorgon]]'s head.&lt;ref&gt;K. Tasntsanoglou and George M. Parássoglou, "Two Gold Lamellae from Thessaly," ''Hellenica'' 38 (1987) 3–16. For more on this particular burial, see article [[Totenpass]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geta coin.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A [[denarius]] of [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]], similar to the danake found ''(as described at right)'' in the well of a [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonian]] cemetery]]&lt;!--This denarius is not meant to represent in general what a danake is like; it resembles through its imagery of Geta the particular danake described in the text; I suspect but have not been able to verify that 'danake' = 'denarius' sometimes--&gt;

In archaeological investigations of Greece since the mid-1990s, danakes have tended to be found in cemeteries. At a [[List of necropoleis|necropolis]] at Hephaisteia on [[Lemnos]], exploration of which began in 1995, the many finds in unlooted graves included a gold danake.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackman, "Archaeology in Greece 2001–2002", ''Archaeological Reports'' 48 (2001–2002), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, a cemetery in northwest Greece yielded objects dating from the mid-4th to the early 3rd centuries B.C., including [[Oenochoe|oinochoai]], [[unguentarium|unguentaria]], a wreath with thin gold leaves (sometimes associated with [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] [[mystery cult|religion]]), a gold danake, and a silver obol with a winged [[Pegasus]].&lt;ref&gt;David Blackman, "Archaeology in Greece 1999–2000", ''Archaeological Reports'' 46 (1999–2000), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A gold danake of [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] dating 199–200 A.D. was among objects — including potsherds, animal bones and shells, and bronze coins —retrieved from a [[water well|well]] in the center of a cemetery in central [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. The well was surrounded by a paved floor and housed by a stone structure. It is thought that the deposition followed funerary meals and offerings to the dead.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackman, ''Archaeological Reports'' 45 (1998–1999), p. 78, with photograph of coin fig. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In investigations reported 2004–2005, a single gold danake was found along with bronze coins and [[Glass#History|glassware]] in an [[Achaea|Achaian]] cemetery where both adults and children had been buried in wooden coffins.&lt;ref&gt;James Whitley, "Archaeology in Greece 2004–2005", ''Archaeological Reports'' 46 (2004–2005), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Graves in [[Euboea|Euboia]] yielded [[Pottery of ancient Greece|pottery]] and [[Glass#History|glassware]], small bone tools, iron [[strigil]]s, and gold jewelry and danakes.&lt;ref&gt;James Whitley, "Archaeology in Greece 2004–2005", ''Archaeological Reports'' 46 (2004–2005), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Epirus (region)|Epiros]], graves and funerary chests yielded gold danakes along with [[Kantharos|kantharoi]], [[oil lamp|lamps]], [[pyxis (pottery)|pyxides]], figurines, gold rings, gold oak leaves, iron [[strigil]]s, a [[Flute#History|bone flute]], fragments of funerary [[stele|stelae]] and a [[marble sculpture|marble head]] of a young man. The items dated from the 4th to the 2nd century B.C. Excavations at a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] cemetery in the same area uncovered five gold danakes along with seventeen perfume flasks,&lt;ref&gt;[[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|Typical vase shapes]] for holding perfume oils are the [[lekythos]] and [[alabastron]]; but see also "[[Unguentarium]]."&lt;/ref&gt; twenty-six [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vessels]], a bronze [[strigil]], an iron [[spear]]head, [[Terra cotta|terracotta]] figurines and a funerary [[pelike]] with ''[[gorgon]]eia'' at the base of the handles.&lt;ref&gt;James Whitley, "Archaeology in Greece 2004–2005", ''Archaeological Reports'' 46 (2004–2005), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later use ==
The word "danake" continued in use into the [[Middle Ages]] as [[Arabic]] ''daneq'', [[Persian language|Persian]] ''dangh'' or ''daneh'', and post-classical [[Sanskrit]] ''tanka''.&lt;ref&gt;Albert R. Frey, ''A Dictionary of Numismatic Names'' (New York 1917), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The name has been connected to the silver ''tangka'' of  India, which had the same weight.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cunningham, "Relics from Ancient Persia in Gold, Silver, and Copper", ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' 50 (1881), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13041">'''Driekops Eiland''' (also called '''Driekopseiland''') is a [[petroglyphs|rock engraving]] or [[petroglyph]] site in the bed of the [[Riet River]] close to the town of [[Plooysburg]], near [[Kimberley, Northern Cape]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Fock, G.

==The engravings==
There are more than 3500 individual engravings at this site, predominantly pecked geometric images, occur on glaciated basement rock exposed in the bed of the river and are submerged when the river rises. Archaeologists and geomorphologists have estimated that the engravings may have been made in two episodes – before about 2500 years ago and after about 1000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
The site has been at the centre of a number of debates about South African rock engravings.

Sensational claims about the site and makers of the engravings are advanced by Brenda Sullivan, Cyril Hromnik and others in books such as ''Spirit of the rocks''.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, B. 1995. ''Spirit of the Rocks''. Pretoria: Human &amp; Rousseau; Mutwa, C. 1996. ''Song of the Stars: the Lore of a Zulu Shaman''. New York: Station Hill Openings, Barrytown Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideas set out by these authors, often involving ancient visitors from foreign lands, and alleged links between the engravings and Ogham inscriptions, are rejected by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.driekopseiland.itgo.com/catalog.html Off-beat conjectures at Driekops Eiland]; Morris, D., Steyn, M., &amp; Ribot, I. 2006. A burial from Driekopseiland, Northern Cape. ''South African Archaeological Bulletin'' 61: 133-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the archaeological fraternity the site has become important in collegial debates on authorship of rock art in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape; Smith, B. W., &amp; Ouzman, S. 2004. Taking stock: identifying Khoekhoen Herder rock art in southern Africa. ''Current Anthropology'' 45: 499-526.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst rock art specialists there are two principal ideas concerning Driekops Eiland. One of them suggests that whereas sites such as the nearby [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|Wildebeest Kuil]], with its profusion of engravings of animals and some human figures, is quintessentially [[Bushmen|San]]/hunter-gatherer in character, the site of Driekops Eiland, with its massive preponderance of geometric engravings and very few animals and hardly any human figures, most likely belongs to a different tradition of rock art, now believed to be a separate [[Khoekhoe]] herder rock art tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B. W., &amp; Ouzman, S. 2004. Taking stock: identifying Khoekhoen Herder rock art in southern Africa. ''Current Anthropology'' 45: 499-526.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been a persuasive argument, and the distribution of sites with geometric rock art appears to match the hypothesised migration routes by which herders are thought to have spread through South Africa about 2000 years ago. 

A different perspective on Driekops Eiland &lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt; does not discount this possibility, that different identity groups have given rise to some of the variability between sites,&lt;ref&gt;Parkington, J., Morris, D. &amp; Rusch, N. 2008. ''Karoo rock engravings''. Clanwilliam: Krakadouw Trust&lt;/ref&gt; but questions whether assigning variability in terms of ethnic or cultural differences in the first instance does not perhaps overlook degrees of complexity and other possible factors. This approach draws on archaeological sources, ethnographic clues, and palaeoenvironmental data to suggest that the environmental setting of the site was a locus of particular cultural and social significance. Ethnographic accounts, including those with reference to the social significance of water, show how features in the landscape could be imbued with meaning.  Places and rock faces could become meaningful supports, mediating spirit worlds, the surfaces bearing the rock art images being a “most fundamental part of the context”.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, J. D., &amp; Dowson, T.A. 1990. Through the veil: San rock paintings and the rock face. ''South African Archaeological Bulletin'' 45: 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The engravings as residues of ritual practices===
Ethnographic sources, moreover, refer to [[ritual]] practices, specifically the female [[Rite of passage|puberty rites]], which have (or had) a specific geographical focus at the water source. Facial or body marking, and sometimes the daubing of objects, with ochre, scarification, and other modes, was a widely consistent feature of the ceremonies of reintroduction that concluded the rites (the literature is vast, from across the Khoe-San spectrum&lt;ref&gt;From the /Xam [San] context: Bleek, D. F. 1933. Beliefs and customs of the |Xam Bushmen. Part V. The rain. ''Bantu Studies'' 7: 297-312 &amp;  Hewitt, R. L. 1986. Structure, meaning and ritual in the narratives of the Southern San. ''Quellen zur Khoisan Forschung'' (Hamburg: Helmut Buske Verlag) 2: 1-305; For a Nama [Khoekhoe] example: Hoernlé, A. W. 1918. Certain rites of transition and the conception of !nau among the Hottentots. ''Harvard African Studies'' 2: 65-82.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In Khoe-San ethnography, the spirit worlds over and under the earth are mediated by water in the form of rain and the waterhole&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, J. D. 1996. 'A visit to the Lion's House': the structures, metaphors and socio political significance of a nineteenth century Bushman myth. In J. Deacon, &amp; Dowson, T.A. (ed.). ''Voices from the past: |Xam Bushman and the Bleek and Lloyd collection'', pp. 122-141. Johannesburg: Witwatersrand University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt; that the hypothesized ritual practices and the rich field of social meanings in Khoe-San beliefs in relation to !''Khwa'', the rain/water (or its manifestation as a mythical ‘watersnake’), and the initiate, referred to as the ‘new maiden’, can be conceived as converging in the nearly palpable power of place at Driekops Eiland – where glacially smoothed basement rock, aligned with the flow of the river, ‘bulges’ and ‘dips’, snake-like, above or below the water according to the season. The site resonates with environmental rhythms, and these, in turn, were very likely resources for cultural construal. Upon this great, smooth, undulating surface (itself perhaps construed as a giant, fecund ‘watersnake’ – associated with rivers in many tales), more than 3,500 rock engravings are densely placed, such that they become submerged when the rains come in the wet season, but equally are left high and dry when river flow dwindles, or ceases altogether.

As  a powerful place, it is possible that Driekops Eiland became – in this view – a focus in rites, perhaps specifically those associated with the ‘new maiden’, who represented “the rain’s magic power” (according to ≠Kamme-an, Dia!kwain’s mother&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, J. D. 2000. ''Stories that float from afar: ancestral folklore of the San of Southern Africa.'' Cape Town: David Philip.&lt;/ref&gt;); that the place itself was an active element in these rites in the redefinition of social personhood; and that the power of the place was enhanced in particular periods in its history (perhaps periods of ritual intensification in response to environmental and/or social stress) by marking with engravings, which themselves may be a residue of ritual sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt;  These rituals are or were practised with great emotional and symbolic intensity. 

It is suggested&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt; that a metaphorical understanding of place – and the possibility that different parts of the landscape might vary in ritual significance (hilltops very likely being associated with rain-making rites) – may be factors more germane to the questions of variability in the rock art of the region than appeals primarily to ethnicity and cultural difference.

==Formal protection==
Driekops Eiland was declared a National Monument in 1944. It automatically became a Grade 2 Provincial Heritage Site when the National Heritage Resources Act (Act 25 of 1999) was promulgated.

==Detrimental impacts==
A weir was built across the upper part of the site in 1942, causing permanent submergence of an estimated 150 engravings above the weir, and changing flood dynamics and silt accumulation patterns. The latter triggered, in turn, increased reed growth and an invasion of eucalyptus saplings across silted parts of the site - helped along by increased flow after a canal was built from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Kalfontein Dam]] (on the Riet River) in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Appendix in Morris, D. 2002.

The '''flag of Finland''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen lippu}}, {{lang-sv|Finlands flagga}}), also called ''siniristilippu'' ("Blue Cross Flag"), dates from the beginning of the 20th century. On a white background, it features a blue [[Nordic Cross flag|Nordic cross]], which represents [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Jeroen Temperman"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Khag6tbsIn4C&amp;pg=PA88|author=Jeroen Temperman|title=State Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law|publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]]|quote=Many predominantly Christian states show a cross, symbolising Christianity, on their national flag.

The state flag has a [[Coat of arms of Finland|coat of arms]] in the centre, but is otherwise identical to the civil flag. The swallow-tailed state flag is used by the military. The presidential standard is identical to the swallow-tailed state flag but also has in its upper left corner the Cross of Liberty after the [[Order of the Cross of Liberty]], which has the President of [[Finland]] as its Grand Master. Like Sweden's, Finland's national flag is based on the Scandinavian cross. It was adopted after independence from Russia, when many patriotic Finns wanted a special flag for their country, but its design dates back to the 19th century. The blue colouring is said to represent the country's thousands of lakes and the sky, with white for the snow that covers the land in winter. This colour combination has also been used over the centuries in various Finnish provincial, military, and town flags.

==History==
[[File:Alkuperalippu.svg|thumb|Temporary merchant navy ensign "Flag of St. George", used 1853–56 in the [[Crimean War]].]]
[[File:Nylandska Jaktklubben flag 1861.jpg|thumb|Former flag of Nyländska Jaktklubben (1861–1919), on display at the [[Maritime Museum of Finland]] in [[Kotka]], Finland.]]
The first known "Flag of Finland" was presented in 1848, along with the national anthem [[Maamme]]. Its motif was the [[coat of arms of Finland]], surrounded by laurel leaves, on a white flag.

The current blue-crossed design was first used in Finland by [[Nyland Yacht Club|Nyländska Jaktklubben]], a [[yacht club]] founded in [[Helsinki]] in 1861. In addition to the blue cross on the white background, the yacht club flag had the crowned arms of the province of [[Uusimaa]] within two crossed branches in the upper hoist quarter. Except for the position of the cross, the flag was similar to the flag of the [[Neva Yacht Club|St. Petersburg Yacht Club]], founded the previous year. The design can be traced to the [[Russian Navy]] [[ensign]], which has a blue cross [[saltire]] on a white background. During the [[Crimean War]], Finnish merchant ships captured by the British-French fleet flew a flag called ''Flag of St. George'', which was based on the [[Russian Customs]] flag. In this variant, the cross was thinner than in the modern flag, and the proportions were equal. Another blue-cross flag was made official in 1861 for private vessels.

In 1910, in connection with [[Russification of Finland]], the Russian authorities decreed that a Russian flag was to be added to the canton. However, this was met with resistance; the flag was derided as the "slave's flag" (''orjalippu''), and most Finns refused to fly it. Instead, a triangular [[pennon|pennant]] without this modification was flown, thereby circumventing the decree concerning flags.

Shortly after Finland gained independence in 1917, a competition was held for the design of the Finnish flag. Several different designs were submitted. Regarding the colours, the entries fell mainly into two categories – one using the red and yellow from the [[Coat of Arms of Finland|Finnish coat of arms]], and the other using the present blue and white colours.

One entry had the [[Order of the Dannebrog|Dannebrog]] cross design, but with a yellow cross on a red background. Another entry had diagonal blue and white stripes, but it was criticized as being more suitable for a [[barber]] shop than a newly independent country. [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] proposed a similar cross flag, but with colors inverted (white cross on blue), but this was considered too similar to the [[Swedish flag]] and particularly the [[Greek flag]] of the time. Finally, artists [[Eero Snellman]] and Bruno Tuukkanen specified the final form of the flag.

The state flag was further modified in 1922, when the coronet was removed, and again in 1978 when the shield-shaped coat of arms was changed into a rectangular shape.

==Legal definition==

===Size===
Under Finnish law, the ratio of the flag is 11:18 (height:width), very close to the [[golden ratio]]. The swallow-tailed state flag is one unit longer and the tails are five units long. The cusp width of the blue cross is three units of measure, giving a ratio set of 4:3:4 (vertical) and 5:3:10 (horizontal). When flown from a flagpole, the flag is recommended to have a width equalling one sixth of the height of the pole.

===Usage===
[[File:Valtioneuvoston linna Helsingissä Senaatintorin laidalla.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of the [[Cabinet of Finland|Finnish Government]] on Senate Square, Helsinki, seen flying the State flag.]]
The Finnish flag is used in three main variants. The usual national flag is used by all citizens, organizations and Finnish [[municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] and [[regions of Finland|regions]]. Anyone is allowed to fly the national flag whenever they deem it suitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1978/19780380 ''Laki Suomen lipusta'' (380/1978)]. 4 §. Retrieved 3 October 2007. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rectangular state flag is used by&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1978/19780380 ''Laki Suomen lipusta'' (380/1978)]. 5 §. Retrieved 3 October 2007. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; bodies of the Finnish national and provincial governments, by the Cathedral Chapters of the two national churches ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Evangelical Lutheran]] and [[Orthodox Church of Finland|Orthodox]]), and non-naval vessels of the state.

The swallow-tailed national flag, which is also the naval ensign, is flown by the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]. The presidential standard and the command signs of the [[Minister of Defence (Finland)|Minister of Defence]], [[Chief of Defence (Finland)|Chief of Defence]], and Commander of the Finnish Navy are flown only by the respective persons.

All public bodies as well as most private citizens and corporations fly the flag on official [[flag days in Finland|flag days]]. In addition to the official flag days, there are about ten unofficial but generally observed flag days. Besides flag days, normally, no flags or corporate flags are flown.

The Finnish flag is raised at 8&amp;nbsp;am and lowered at sunset, however not later than 9&amp;nbsp;pm. On independence day, the flag is flown until 8&amp;nbsp;pm regardless of the dark. On the occasion of great national tragedies, the ministry of interior may recommend flying the flag at [[half mast]] throughout the country.

As a special custom in Finland, the flag is flown at [[Midsummer]] from 6&amp;nbsp;pm of Midsummer eve until 9&amp;nbsp;pm of Midsummer's day. This is done to symbolize the fact that the darkness does not come to any part of Finland during Midsummer's Night. Midsummer is also celebrated as the day of the Finnish flag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1978/19780383 Asetus Suomen lipusta (383/1978)]. 3–4 §.

There is no official RGB definition for the colors, because its [[color gamut]] is too narrow. From the CIE L*a*b* colors the unofficial approximations in [[sRGB]] are (range 0–255): blue R=24, G=68, B=126, red R=181, G=28, B=49 and yellow R=237, G=167, B=0. The yellow color actually lies outside the sRBG colorspace. The blue color is called "sea blue", which is a dark to medium blue. It is not very dark navy blue, and certainly not any bright or greenish shade such as turquoise or [[cyan]]. It may be substituted for heraldic tincture [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]].

Red and yellow are used in the coat of arms that appears on the state flag.

Alternatively, artists or students might find it helpful to know that the blue color in the current civic use National Flag (no variant), has an approximate hex color of: '''#002f6c''' or an RGB of '''R:'''0 '''G:'''47 '''B:'''108. These colors are converted from Pantone 294 C as stated above in the table.&lt;ref name="Pantone 294 C - Conversion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rgb.to/pantone/294-c |title=Pantone 294C |publisher=rgbTo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other rules==
By Finnish law it is forbidden to deface the flag or to use it in a disrespectful way. It is also illegal to remove a flag from its pole without permission. Anyone who breaks these regulations may be fined for disgracing the flag.

Finnish law also forbids the use of the presidential standard or state flag without permission, as well as the addition of any extra symbols to the flag. One may not sell a flag which has different colours or geometry than defined by the law. These are considered violations of the flag regulations and can lead to a fine.

There are also common rules on how to treat the flag respectfully. The flag must not be dirty or damaged. The flag must never touch the ground. When the flag is washed, it must be dried indoors. A worn-out flag must be disposed of by burning (though not with the intent to disgrace it), or alternatively by cutting it to pieces small enough not to be recognizable as parts of the flag. The flag must not be buried in the ground or the sea (including not throwing it into the garbage).

==Yachting club ensigns==
A Finnish specialty is that any [[yachting]] club registered in Finland may apply to have a flag with the club emblem officially approved for use on yachts. Such an ensign will be the civil ensign with a white cross, {{frac|3|5}} of a unit wide, superimposed on the blue cross and with the club emblem in the upper hoist corner. Most yachting clubs distribute these ensigns to their members, and they are much used, but their use is not recommended outside Finnish waters to avoid confusion. Officially, however, the yachting club ensign is valid even for international use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1978/19780380 ''Laki Suomen lipusta'' (380/1978)]. 4.2 §.

The '''flag of Namibia''' was adopted on March 21, 1990 upon independence from [[South Africa]].

==Design==
The National Symbols Sub-Committee received 870 entries for the national flag. Six designs were short-listed; this was reduced to three, those of three Namibains - Theo Jankowski of [[Rehoboth, Namibia|Rehoboth]], Don Stevenson of [[Windhoek]] and Ortrud Clay of [[Lüderitz]]. These three designs were combined to form the Namibia national flag, adopted unanimously on February 2, 1990 by the [[Constituent Assembly of Namibia|Constituent Assembly]]. The three designers were publicly acknowledged  by judge [[Hans Berker]], the chairman of the subcommittee, at the unveiling ceremony on 9 March 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=The Namibian flag: Its origins and spirit that inspire the nation | last1=Kangootui | first1=Herman | last2=Amagola | first2=Elizabeth | newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]] | date=14 June 2018 | url=https://www.newera.com.na/2018/06/14/the-namibian-flag-its-origins-and-spirit-that-inspire-the-nation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, two other claims were made - South African [[Frederick Brownell]] claimed that he had designed the flag in his role as [[South Africa]]n State [[Herald]].&lt;ref name=Brownell&gt;{{Citation |author= (reported by) FG Brownell |title= Coats of Arms and Flags in Namibia|date=December 1990 |accessdate=2008-11-24 }} (A series of 8 articles.)&lt;/ref&gt; The other claimant was Briton Roy Allen who claimed that the flag design was the result of a competition run by [[Hannes Smith]] of the ''[[Windhoek Observer]]'', and that he had won.&lt;ref name=Plymouth&gt;{{Cite news | title=Allen from Plymouth ... The man who designed the Namibian flag | last=Schütz | first=Helge | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=23 October 2015 | url=https://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?page=archive-read&amp;id=143453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
The chairman explained the symbolism of the flag's colours as follows:&lt;ref name=Brownell/&gt;
* Red - represents Namibia's most important resource, its people. It refers to their heroism and their determination to build a future of equal opportunity for all.
* White - refers to peace and unity.
* Green - symbolises vegetation and agricultural resources.
* Blue - represents the clear Namibian sky and the Atlantic Ocean, the country's precious water resources and rain.

==Description==
[[File:Flag of Namibia (construction sheet).svg|thumb|Dimensions of the flag.|200px]]
The flag has a white-edged red diagonal band radiating diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner. The upper triangle is blue with a gold sun with 12 triangular rays and the lower triangle is green.

''In [[Blazon]]: Tierced per bend sinister Azure, and Vert, a bend sinister Gules fimbriated Argent and in dexter chief a Sun with twelve straight rays Or charged with an annulet Azure.''

'''Fårikål''' ({{IPA-no|foːrɪkɔl}}) is a traditional [[Norway|Norwegian]] dish and also considered the national dish of the country. Consisting of pieces of [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]] with bone,  [[cabbage]], whole [[black pepper]] and often a little [[wheat flour]], cooked for several hours in a casserole, traditionally served with [[potato]]es boiled in their jackets. The dish is typically prepared in early autumn.

Fårikål is originally a Danish dish containing goose or duck, but was later amended to Norwegian conditions by replacing those with mutton. The transformation took place in the 1840s. Fårikål Feast Day is celebrated on the last Thursday in September each year.&lt;ref name="farikal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matprat.no/artikkel.aspx?artid=14544 |title=Fårikålens Festdag |publisher=Matprat.no |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2010-10-04 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farikal2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farikal.no/om-oss/farikalens-festdag2/ |title=Fårikålens Festdag |publisher=Farikal.no |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2010-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004190556/http://www.farikal.no/om-oss/farikalens-festdag2/ |archivedate=2010-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Fårikål is a compounded word that literally means "mutton in cabbage". The name was amended from Danish "gaas i hvidkaal" (goose in white cabbage).

==In popular culture==
September 29, 2012, [[Guinness World Records]] approved the World Record of making the largest portion of Fårikål ever. The result was 594.2&amp;nbsp;kg Fårikål, prepared to be finished at the same time, consisting of 60% [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] and 40% [[cabbage]]. The event happened in [[Spikersuppa]], [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], and there were 10,000 guests present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satte verdensrekord i fårikål |url=http://www.handelsbladetfk.no/id/26707 |publisher=Handelsbladet |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060600/http://www.handelsbladetfk.no/id/26707 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, fårikål was elected [[national dish]] of Norway by the popular radio programme ''Nitimen''. In 2014, after the controversial decision by the food and agriculture minister [[Sylvi Listhaug]] to hold a new competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.na-weekly.com/food/norways-national-dish-to-change/|title=Norway’s national dish to change - The Norwegian American|date=23 May 2014|website=Na-weekly.com|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/20140120/norway-to-replace|title=Norway to replace fårikål as national dish|date=20 January 2014|website=Thelocal.no|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was reconfirmed as the national dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2014/06/16/farikal-wins-again-as-norways-national-dish/|title=‘Fårikål’ wins again as Norway’s national dish|website=Newsinenglish.no|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/20140617/norway-replaces-frikl-as-national-dishwith-frikl|title=Norway sticks with fårikål as national dish|date=17 June 2014|website=Thelocal.no|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''GOLD''' ("'''General Ontology for Linguistic Description'''") is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] for [[descriptive linguistics]]. It gives a formalized account of the most basic categories and relations used in the scientific description of human language.

GOLD was first introduced by Farrar and Langendoen (2003). Originally, it was envisioned as a solution to the problem of resolving disparate markup schemes for linguistic data, in particular data from [[endangered language]]s. However, GOLD is much more general and can be applied to all languages. In its function, GOLD overlaps with the [[ISO_12620]] Data Category Registry (ISOcat), it is, however, more stringently structured. 

GOLD was maintained by the [[LINGUIST List]] and others from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguistics-ontology.org/version GOLD versions]&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://tla.mpi.nl/relish/ RELISH] project created a mirror of the 2010 edition of GOLD as a Data Category Selection within ISOcat. As of 2018, GOLD data remains an important terminology hub in the context of the [[LLOD|Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud]], but as it is not actively maintained anymore, its function is increasingly replaced by [[OLiA]] (for linguistic annotation, building on GOLD and ISOcat) and [http://lexinfo.net/ lexinfo.net] (for dictionary metadata, building on ISOcat).

'''Gender Park''' is an autonomous institution promoted by the Department of Social Justice, [[Government of Kerala|Government of Kerala State]], [[India]], to resolve the gender inequity in development. The institution has its headquarters at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]] and its [[Chief Executive Officer]] is [[P.T.Mohammed Sunish]] who is also the [[Managing Director]] of Kerala State Women's Development Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appointed KSWDC managing director|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/appointed-kswdc-managing-director/article5458234.ece|accessdate=26 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the [[objective (goal)|objective]]s of the institution are :

* To generate a space exclusively for women development activities, emphasizing entrepreneurship in service and cultural activities.
* To undertake research and documentation of the history and current trends in gender in different spheres of society through the Gender Park's International Institute for Gender and Development (IIGD). The IIGD is involved in research on gender at the local, national and international level, and aims to provide formal education in gender studies. 
* To strengthen women development activities undertaken by various departments/agencies/civil society movements, such as She-Taxi.

The Gender Park campus is located at [[Vellimadukunnu]] in [[Kozhikkode District]] in Kerala. The foundation stone for the Park was laid on 8 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bureau Report|title=‘Gender park' coming up in Kozhikode|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/gender-park-coming-up-in-kozhikode/article2817735.ece|accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=The Hindu: Business Line|date=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Geneva Centre for Education and Research in Humanitarian Action''' ({{lang-fr|Centre d'enseignement et de recherche en action humanitaire de Genève}}) (CERAH) offers a wide range of comprehensive and specialized postgraduate training programmes for professionals active in the humanitarian sector. A joint Centre of the [[University of Geneva]] and the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/research/research-community/centres-conjoints.html|title=The Graduate Institute, Geneva - Joint Programmes|website=graduateinstitute.ch|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; CERAH is firmly anchored in Geneva's rich academic environment. It is one of the few institutes dedicated to the study of humanitarian action. It offers modular and flexible academic training programmes, distance or residential ones, and scholarship opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/home/|title=CERAH Homepage|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Geneva's academic platform for humanitarian action, CERAH's focus lies on capacity strengthening and the reinforcement of both individual and collective competencies with the ultimate goal of contributing to an improved quality of the humanitarian response. Its programmes allow participants to develop a strong understanding of various conceptual and operational aspects of humanitarian action and equip them to define and implement strategic humanitarian responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/files/1914/7627/9340/CERAH-ActivityReport_2015-16_web.pdf|title=CERAH Activity Report 2015/16|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cerahgeneve.ch|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offering a variety of courses ranging from short courses (TSC) to a comprehensive Master's programme, CERAH provides flexible and modular opportunities for professionals to deepen their knowledge. The current educational offer encompasses seven postgraduate programmes (a [http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/master/ master programme], one diploma, and five certificate courses) and a dozen of intensive courses on specific issues (TSC). Responding to its international audience, CERAH offers a distance-learning course in "Designing Strategies and Projects for Humanitarian Action" which allows participants to study and learn from their own context, without having to be in Geneva. During the course students develop an action plan, which they can directly implement in their work situation. In addition, CERAH offers a Massive Open Online Course on Humanitarian Communications, in partnership with the University of Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CERAH launches its first massive open online course (MOOC): Humanitarian communication, addressing key challenges|url=http://www.geneve-int.ch/fr/cerah-launches-its-first-massive-open-online-course-mooc-humanitarian-communication-addressing-key-c|website=International Geneva|publisher=International Geneva|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanitarian studies lie at the crossroads of various disciplines. As a result, CERAH promotes a multi-disciplinary approach to learning, and draws on the expertise of a range of academics and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaq.ch/download/verfahrensberichte/vb-programm/2015-07-15%20UniGE%20MAS-HA%20External%20review%20report.pdf|title=Academic Programme Accreditation MAS in Humanitarian Action|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CERAH also undertakes critical research that aims to assess concepts, policies and responses in order to improve humanitarian responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|url=http://cerahgeneve.ch/research/|website=CERAH|publisher=CERAH|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
CERAH was founded in 1998 with the support of the University of Geneva and the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]]. Its existence is a testimony to the gradual and collective effort over the past 19 years of bringing together a multitude of academic and humanitarian actors.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of CERAH|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/cerah/history/|website=CERAH|publisher=CERAH|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre underwent several phases of transformation. At the time of its establishment, it was known as the Multifaculty Programme for Humanitarian Action (PPAH) and only offered a university diploma. It was set up to provide high-level, continuing university education to humanitarian practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geneva Centre for Education and Research in Humanitarian Action|url=http://www.masteretudes.fr/universites/Suisse/Geneva-Centre-for-Education-and-Research-in-Humanitarian-Action/|website=MASTERETUDES.FR|publisher=MASTERETUDES.FR|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was transformed in 2004, following its partnership with the Graduate Institute of International Aid Development studies. Renamed as the Interdisciplinary Programme in Humanitarian Action (PIAH), it introduced an advanced masters programme in collaboration with the I [https://www.icrc.org/en International Committee of the Red Cross] and [http://www.msf.ch/ Médecins Sans Frontières] (MSF) Suisse. A reform process in 2008 led to the creation of CERAH, as we know it today. Changes at the international level as well as in the academic and humanitarian fields led the Geneva university community to envisage a more ambitious role for CERAH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geneva Centre for Education and Research in Humanitarian Action|url=http://www.healthcarestudies.com/universities/Switzerland/Geneva-Centre-for-Education-and-Research-in-Humanitarian-Action/|website=HEALTHCARESTUDIES.COM|publisher=HEALTHCARESTUDIES.COM|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years, particularly after 2011, under the leadership of Professor Doris Schopper, CERAH revised its postgraduate educational offer to better respond to the needs of humanitarian organizations and professionals. It led to the development of seven postgraduate degrees (1 MAS, 1 DAS, 5 CAS) and several one-week intensive seminars on specific issues.

== Degree and Training Programmes ==

=== Master of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action (MAS) ===

The MAS in Humanitarian Action is a 10- to 12-month full-time programme of 60 [[European Credit Transfer System]] (ECTS) credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/master/|title=Master of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action (MAS)|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme is focused on building in-depth understanding of the central conceptual and operational aspects of humanitarian action.

The multidisciplinary and interactive programme, delivered in English, comprises three parts:
* A core curriculum of three months focusing on the theory and fundamental questions of humanitarian action (30ECTS);
* Two elective specialising courses of seven weeks each (20ECTS in total) to be chosen by the participants among different themes;
* An academic dissertation (10 ECTS), introduced by a 3 weeks course on research and methodology. 
Since 2012, the MAS in Humanitarian Action is offered to international managers in the humanitarian and development sector (with at least 2 years of working experience and holding a higher education institution degree), who wish to deepen their competencies in specific areas and add an academic and analytical dimension to their professional skills. Its modular set-up allows for maximum flexibility. Participant can complete the MAS in 1, 2 or 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/master/programme/|title=MAS modularity|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This programme was awarded unconditional accreditation by the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (AAQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaq.ch/download/verfahrensberichte/vb-programm/2015-07-15%20UniGE%20MAS-HA%20External%20review%20report.pdf|title=Programme Accreditation PDF|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cerahgeneve.ch|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diploma of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action (DAS) ===

The Diploma of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action is a 19-week programme of 30 ECTS credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/training/diploma/|title=Diploma of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action (DAS)|website=CERAH|publisher=CERAH|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This core course is divided in three modules and completed by an individual work (dissertation). Through the study of past and present humanitarian crises, participants acquire the tools needed to analyse, understand and engage in critical reflection on the response to humanitarian emergencies today.

Academics and experts from a wide range of NGOs and international organisations deliver lectures. The programme is participatory, based on case studies and discussions.

=== Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) ===

CERAH also offers seven-week 10-ECTS certificate courses. The courses are designed for managers to improve their competencies and leadership in defining and implementing specific strategies, while focusing on problem-solving in professional realities.

List of CAS courses available:

* [https://www.cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/courses-project-cycle-management/people-management/ People Management in Humanitarian Settings]

==== Distance Learning Programme ====
Within the CAS programmes, CERAH offers an 8-month distance-learning programme "[http://cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/distance-learning/designing-strategies-and-projects/ Designing Strategies and Projects in Humanitarian Action]", which comprises 15 ECTS. The course enhances the capacity of individual and institutional humanitarian actors to devise and implement effective humanitarian responses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerahgeneve.ch/training/humanitarian-distance-learning/|title=Measuring the Effectiveness of Humanitarian Capacity Building through Distance Learning|website=Inter Agency Working Group on Disaster Preparedness for East and Central Africa|publisher=Inter Agency Working Group on Disaster Preparedness for East and Central Africa|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Learn as you work, work as you learn."''' Specifically adapted to the needs of working humanitarian professionals, this course allows participants to study and learn from their own context. During the course students develop an action plan, which they can directly implement in their work situation. The programme is fairly autonomous where students develop their own learning objectives based on current challenges. At the end of the programme, participants develop relevant competencies to design and adapt humanitarian strategies and projects according to the specifics of each context.

The course involves e-learning, a residential session in Kampala (Uganda) and individual coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerahgeneve.ch/training/humanitarian-distance-learning/|title=HDL: Humanitarian Distance Learning|website=CERAH|publisher=CERAH|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CERAH developed the Humanitarian Distance Learning programme to increase access to training particularly for national staff as well as to allow students to study from their own context.

=== Thematic Short Courses (TSC) ===
Specific themes are proposed as 1-week Thematic Short Courses (TSC). Offering topics that matter (e.g. nutrition, sexual violence, forced migration, negotiation) the courses attract new audiences and eventually, encourage participants to enrol in other trainings.

=== MOOC ===
The Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) "Humanitarian communication: addressing key challenges" focuses on the challenges of communication in humanitarian settings and the means of addressing these. This 5-week online course is repeated throughout the academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/distance-learning/humanitarian-communication/|title=Humanitarian communication|website=www.cerahgeneve.ch|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

CERAH staff conducts research on a range of themes linked to humanitarian action including health, law, protracted crises and the political economy of humanitarian crises.

The [https://humanitarianencyclopedia.org/ Humanitarian Encyclopedia] is a flagship project from CERAH to explore the different ways key humanitarian concepts are understood across space, time and disciplines .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cerahgeneve.ch/research/res/|title=Research - Humanitarian Encyclopedia|last=|first=|date=|website=Humanitarian Encyclopedia|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new project offers a conceptual framework for humanitarian action, and providing a dynamic platform for national and international practitioners, community leaders, policy makers and academics to reflect on humanitarian concepts and practice for the 21st century.

[[File:Flora-Danica-Rubus-chamaemorus.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Plate 1 from ''Flora Danica'' fasc. 1 (1761); hand-coloured copperplate]]

'''Georg Christian Edler von Oldenburg Oeder''' (3 February 1728, [[Ansbach]] – 28 January 1791, [[Oldenburg (Oldenburg)]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Denmark|Danish]] [[botanist]], [[medical doctor]], [[economist]] and social reformer. His name is particularly associated with the initiation of the plate work ''[[Flora Danica]]''.

==Life and work==
Oeder was the son of a [[Bavaria]]n parish minister and theologian, [[Georg Ludwig Oeder]] (1694–1760).  He studied [[medicine]] at the [[University of Göttingen]] under [[Albrecht von Haller]].  He then settled as a doctor of medicine in the city of [[Schleswig (city)|Schleswig]].  The [[Frederick V of Denmark|king]] called him to [[Copenhagen]] in 1751, on [[Albrecht von Haller|von Haller's]] recommendation.  The autonomous – and conservative - [[University of Copenhagen]], reluctant as it was to employ foreign experts, resisted Oeder's appointment in an ordinary chair. Thus, he was appointed ''Professor botanices regius'' (Royal Professor) and soon led the installation of a new [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden|botanic garden]]. From 1753 he led the publication of a monumental botanical plate work, ''Flora Danica'', which at first was planned to cover all plants, including [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s and [[fungus|fungi]] native to crown lands of the [[Denmark|Danish]] king &amp;ndash; Denmark, [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Oldenburg]]-[[Delmenhorst]] and [[Norway]] &amp;ndash; with its [[North Atlantic]] dependencies [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;Oeder, Georg Christian (1761) ''[http://www.kb.dk/tekster/FloraEfterretning1761/index.html Efterretning om et Verk, som paa Kongelig Befaling skal udgives, FLORA DANICA kaldet, tilligemed en Prøve-Plade af Multebærs Planten (Rubus Chamæmorus)]''. [[Copenhagen|Kopenhagen]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oeder, Georg Christian ''Verzeichniss zur der Flora Danica gehörigen, in den Königreichen Dännemark und Norwegen, in den Herzogthümern Schleswig und Holstein, und in den Grafschaften Oldenburg und Delmenhorst wildwachsenden Kräuter''. Kopenhagen, 1770. 137 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Oeder visited the mountain regions of Norway up to [[Trondheim]] during the years 1758-1760. Consequently, the first fascicles of [[Flora Danica]] contain many [[alpine plant]] species. Oeder also corresponded with the Norwegian bishop and botanist [[Johan Ernst Gunnerus]] during the time.
Oeder also built up a considerable botanical library, mainly through purchase from colleagues abroad. English and American literature was obtained from [[Philip Miller]] of [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] and as many as 1327 volumes were bought from the estate of [[Richard Mead]] in 1754.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Peter &amp; Birgit Stauning (2001) Botanisk Centralbibliotek, p. 78-81 in: Bernhard Fabian, Handbuch deutscher historischer Buchbestände in Europa. Georg Olms Verlag {{ISBN|3-487-10360-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MAJOPc2ZvSkC&amp;dq Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Oeder, [[botany]] was amalgamated with [[economy]] at large. Oeder thus was also a member of a number of commissions on [[agrarian reform]]s (e.g. “Landkommissionen” in 1770) and state finances ('Finanskollegiet' in 1771). From the first Danish [[census]], which was soon destroyed, he extracted data on married couples, [[widow]]ers and widows in all parishes of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], [[Amager]], [[Møn]] and [[Bornholm]] – these excerpts are now valuable data to [[genealogy|genealogists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddd.dda.dk/andrekilder_uk.html “Oeders Efterretninger” 1771 in the Danish Demographic Database]&lt;/ref&gt; Oeder advocated the need for charities for widows.&lt;ref&gt;Oeder, G. C. (1771) ''Raisonnemens über Wittwen-Cassen''. Kopenhagen, 84 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; At large, Oeder was a spokesman of social reform and freedom of the rural population.&lt;ref&gt;Oeder, G. C. (1769) ''Bedenken über die Frage: Wie dem Bauernstande Freyheit und Eigenthum in den Ländern, wo ihm beydes fehlet, verschaffet werden könne?'' Frankfurt &amp; Leipzig, 112 pp. Additions: ''Zusäze zu dem Bedenken über die Frage: Wie dem Bauernstande etc''. Frankfurt &amp; Leipzig (1771) and ''Bedenken und Zusätze; von neuem aufgelegt sammt Zulagen''. Altona (1786)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oeder, G. C. (1781) ''Antwort auf [[Johan Christian Fabricius|J. C. Fabricius]] Zudringlichkeit in seiner Schrift über die Volks-Vermehrung in Dännemark''.[[Oldenburg]], 20 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] in 1771 and the consequent crisis in state finances and the strengthening of anti-[[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and anti-German conservative circles, Oeder lost his professorship. He was first given the post as [[prefect]] (stiftamtmand) of [[Diocese of Nidaros|Trondhjem stift]], but never installed. He then was given a little honorable post as bailiff ([[Vogt|Landvogt]]) in [[Oldenburg]], which was then under Danish rule, but to be exchanged to [[Holstein-Gottorp]] in 1773. Two years before his death, he was ennobled by emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].  He was buried in the churchyard of St. Gertrude's Chapel (''Gertrudenfriedhof'') in [[Oldenburg]].

==Plant taxa named for Oeder==
The plant genus ''[[Oedera]]'' [[Carl Linnaeus|L.]] was named to his honour. A number of species have been named similarly, e.g.  ''[[Pedicularis oederi]]'' [[Martin Vahl|Vahl]] and ''[[Carex pilulifera|Carex oederi]]'' [[Anders Jahan Retzius|Retz.]]

A '''groom's cake''' is a wedding tradition originating in Victorian England,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/8409609/US-style-grooms-cake-for-William-and-Kate.html|title=US-style 'groom's cake' for William and Kate | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph|date=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but observed more often in the modern age in the  [[Southern United States|American South]].
While a [[wedding cake]] may often be decorated in white and light in texture or color, the [[Bridegroom|groom's]] cake can take a variety of forms, many incorporating [[chocolate]] or [[fruit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weddingchannel.com/cakes/buildArticle.action?assetUID=88533|title=What is a Groom's cake?|accessdate=2009-01-08|publisher=WeddingChannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cheesecake]] sometimes serves as a groom's cake. The groom's cake is often served at a table separate from the wedding cake at a [[wedding reception]] or [[wedding breakfast]], though it may be served as a dessert for a [[rehearsal dinner]].

== History==
The tradition of  the groom's cake began in Britain. The groom's cake was often richer than the bride's, since stronger flavors such as chocolate, fruitcake, and alcohol were considered more appropriate to "the stronger sex." Groom's cakes during the Victorian era were heavy, dense [[fruitcake]]s. A characteristic recipe for the groom's fruit cake was published in ''The British Baker'' in 1897.&lt;ref name=Charsley&gt;{{cite book|last=Charsley|first=Simon R.|title=Wedding Cakes and Cultural History|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415026482|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, flour cakes, either white or chocolate, supplanted fruit cakes as the most popular choice.

Groom’s cake is a tradition most popular in the southeastern United States.  It was brought over from Britain by colonists.  The Southern groom's cake was traditionally a dark-liquor soaked fruitcake, especially in Virginia. The white-iced bride's cake was considered too light for masculinity.&lt;ref name=Bette&gt;{{cite book|last=Bette|first=Mathew|title=Cake|year=2000|publisher=Friedman/Fairfax|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chocolate groom's cakes became popular in the late 19th century, and can be any flavor, such as [[carrot cake]], [[red velvet cake]], etc."&lt;ref name=Charsley /&gt;

Groom's cakes are usually served at the wedding reception as a second flavor choice to the guests, but are often served at the rehearsal dinner in some regions. Groom's Cakes are often decorated to reflect the groom's hobbies or interests, such as golfing, fishing, hunting, or sports. The 1989 movie ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' features a famous scene with a red velvet groom's cake shaped as a giant armadillo.

Another tradition was to cut a piece of the cake and put it in a small box, then present the box to an unmarried woman attending the wedding.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Melanie|title=Wedding cakes sharing space with a groom's cake|newspaper=The Time Union|date=1998-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman was not expected to eat the cake, but rather to put it under her pillow. Superstition held that this tradition would help an unmarried woman find a husband.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

The '''guru–shishya tradition''', or '''''[[parampara]]''''' ("lineage"), denotes a succession of teachers and disciples in traditional [[India]]n culture and [[Indian religions|religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]]  (Tibetan and Zen tradition). It is the tradition of spiritual relationship and mentoring where teachings are transmitted from a ''[[guru]]'' "teacher" ({{lang-sa|गुरु}}) to a ''śiṣya'' "disciple" ({{lang-sa|शिष्य}}) or ''chela''. Such knowledge, whether it be [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]], [[Āgama (Hinduism)|agamic]], [[architectural]], [[music]]al or [[spirituality|spiritual]], is imparted through the developing relationship between the guru and the disciple. It is considered that this relationship, based on the genuineness of the guru, and the respect which is not based on age or how old one looks, commitment, devotion and obedience of the student, is the best way for subtle or advanced knowledge to be conveyed. The student eventually masters the knowledge that the guru embodies.

==Historical background==
In the early oral traditions of the [[Upanishads]], the ''guru–shishya'' relationship had evolved into a fundamental component of Hinduism. The term "Upanishad" derives from the Sanskrit words ''"upa"'' (near), ''"ni"'' (down) and ''"şad"'' (to sit) — so it means "sitting down near" a spiritual teacher to receive instruction. The relationship between [[Krishna]] and [[Arjuna]] in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] portion of the [[Mahabharata]], and between [[Rama]] and [[Hanuman]] in the [[Ramayana]], are examples. In the Upanishads, gurus and disciples appear in a variety of settings (e.g. a husband answering questions about immortality; a teenage boy being taught by [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], Hinduism's Lord of Death) Sometimes the sages are women, and the instructions may be sought by kings.

In the [[Vedas]], the knowledge of [[Brahman]] (''brahmavidya'') is communicated from guru to ''shishya'' by [[oral lore]].

==Common characteristics of the ''guru–shishya'' relationship==
[[File:Ekalavya's Guru Dakshina.jpg|thumb|Ekalavya's ''dakshina'' of his right hand thumb to his guru.]]
Within the broad spectrum of the Hindu religion, the ''guru–shishya'' relationship can be found in numerous variant forms including [[tantra]]. Some common elements in this relationship include:

* The establishment of a teacher/student relationship.
* A formal recognition of this relationship, generally in a structured initiation ceremony where the guru accepts the initiate as a ''shishya'' and also accepts responsibility for the spiritual well-being and progress of the new ''shishya''.
* Sometimes this initiation process will include the conveying of specific [[esoteric]] wisdom and/or [[meditation]] techniques.
* ''[[Gurudakshina]]'', where the ''shishya'' gives a gift to the ''guru'' as a token of gratitude, often the only monetary or otherwise fee that the student ever gives. Such tokens can be as simple as a piece of fruit or as serious as a [[thumb]], as in the case of ''[[Ekalavya]]'' and his guru ''[[Drona]]charya''.

==''Parampara'', ''Sampradaya'' and ''Akhara''==
{{main|Parampara|Sampradaya|Akhara}}

Traditionally the word used for a succession of teachers and disciples in ancient [[Hinduism|Indian]] culture is ''parampara'' (''{{IAST|paramparā}}'' in [[IAST]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bg. 4.2 ''{{IAST|evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ}} - This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = SDG/&gt;  In the ''parampara'' system, knowledge (in any field) is believed to be passed down through successive generations. The [[Sanskrit]] word figuratively means "an uninterrupted series or succession". Sometimes defined as "the passing down of Vedic knowledge", it is believed to be always entrusted to the ''[[Acharya|{{IAST|ācāryas}}]]''.&lt;ref name = SDG/&gt; An established ''[[parampara]]'' is often called ''{{IAST|sampradāya}}'', or school of thought. For example, in [[Vaishnavism]] a number of ''sampradayas'' are developed following a single teacher, or an [[acharya]]. While some argue for freedom of interpretation others maintain that "Although an ''{{IAST|ācārya}}'' speaks according to the time and circumstance in which he appears, he upholds the original conclusion, or ''[[siddhanta|{{IAST|siddhānta}}]]'', of the Vedic literature."&lt;ref name = SDG&gt;

[[Akhara]] is a place of practice with facilities for boarding, lodging and training, both in the context of [[Indian martial art]]ists or a ''Sampradaya'' monastery for religious renunciates.&lt;ref name=hin&gt;[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=9XC9bwMMPcwC&amp;pg=RA16-PA200&amp;dq=1954+Kumbh+stampede#PRA16-PA200,M1 Akharas and Kumbh Mela] ''What Is Hinduism?: Modern Adventures Into a Profound Global Faith'', by Editors of Hinduism Today, Hinduism Today Magazine Editors.

==''Guru–shishya'' relationship types==

There is a variation in the level of authority that may be granted to the guru. The highest is that found in [[bhakti]] [[yoga]], and the lowest is in the ''[[pranayama]]'' forms of yoga such as the [[Sankara Saranam]] movement. Between these two there are many variations in degree and form of authority.{{Or|date=May 2008}}

===Advaita Vedanta===
{{Main|Advaita Guru Paramparā}}
[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedānta]] requires anyone seeking to study Advaita Vedānta to do so from a [[guru]] (''teacher''). The guru must have the following qualities (see ''[[Mundaka Upanishad]]'' 1.2.12):
#''Śrotriya'' &amp;mdash; must be learned in the [[Hindu scriptures|Vedic scriptures]] and ''[[sampradaya]]''
#''Brahmanişţha'' &amp;mdash; figuratively meaning "established in [[Brahman]]"; must have ''realised'' the oneness of [[Brahman]] in everything and in himself.{{Or|date=May 2008}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
The seeker must serve the guru and submit his questions with all humility so that doubt may be removed. (see [[Bhagavad Gita]] 4.34). According to Advaita, the seeker will be able to attain ''[[moksha|liberation from the cycle of births and deaths]]'' (''moksha'').

===''Śruti'' tradition===
{{Main|Śrauta}}
The ''guru–shishya'' tradition plays an important part in the [[Shruti]] tradition of [[Vaidika dharma]]. The [[Hindus]] believe that the [[Vedas]] have been handed down through the ages from [[guru]] to ''[[shishya]]''. The [[Vedas]] themselves prescribe for a young [[Brahmacharya|brahmachari]] to be sent to a [[Gurukul]] where the [[Guru]] (referred to also as [[acharya]]) teaches the pupil the [[Vedas]] and [[Vedangas]]. The pupil is also taught the ''Prayoga'' to perform [[yajnas]]. The term of stay varies ([[Manu Smriti]] says the term may be 12 years, 36 years or 48 years). After the stay at the Gurukul the brahmachari returns home after performing a ceremony called [[samavartana]].

The word Śrauta is derived from the word Śruti meaning that which is heard. The Śrauta tradition is a purely oral handing down of the Vedas, but many modern Vedic scholars make use of books as a teaching tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part17/chap1.htm Hindu Dharma]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaktipat tradition===
{{main|Shaktipat}}
The guru passes his knowledge to his disciples by virtue of the fact that his purified consciousness enters into the [[Atman (Hinduism)|selves]] of his disciples and communicates its particular characteristic. In this process the disciple is made part of the spiritual family ([[Kaula (Hinduism)|kula]]) - a family which is not based on blood relations but on people of the same knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavagupta: The Kula Ritual, as Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, John R. Dupuche, Page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bhakti yoga===

The best known form of the ''guru–shishya'' relationship is that of [[bhakti]]. Bhakti (Sanskrit = Devotion) means surrender to [[God]] or guru. Bhakti extends from the simplest expression of devotion to the ego-destroying principle of [[prapatti]], which is total surrender. The bhakti form of the ''guru–shishya'' relationship generally incorporates three primary beliefs or practices:

# Devotion to the guru as a divine figure or [[Avatar]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
# The belief that such a guru has transmitted, or will impart [[moksha]], [[diksha]] or [[shaktipat]] to the (successful) ''shishya''.
# The belief that if the ''shishya’s'' act of focusing his or her devotion (bhakti) upon the guru is sufficiently strong and worthy, then some form of spiritual merit will be gained by the ''shishya''.{{Or|date=May 2008}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

=== Prapatti ===

In the ego-destroying principle of ''prapatti'' (Sanskrit, "Throwing oneself down"), the level of the submission of the will of the ''shishya'' to the will of God or the guru is sometimes extreme, and is often coupled with an attitude of personal helplessness, self-effacement and resignation. This doctrine is perhaps best expressed in the teachings of the four ''Samayacharya'' saints, who shared a profound and mystical love of Siva expressed by:

* Deep humility and self-effacement, admission of [[sin]] and weakness;
* Total surrender to God as the only true refuge; and
* A relationship of lover and beloved known as bridal [[mysticism]], in which the devotee is the bride and [[Shiva|Siva]] the bridegroom.

In its most extreme form it sometimes includes:

* The assignment of all or many of the material possessions of the ''shishya'' to the guru.
* The strict and unconditional adherence by the ''shishya'' to all of the commands of the guru. An example is the legend that ''[[Karna]]'' silently bore the pain of a [[wasp]] stinging his thigh so as not to disturb his ''guru'' ''[[Parashurama]]''.
* A system of various titles of implied superiority or deification which the guru assumes, and often requires the ''shishya'' to use whenever addressing the guru.
* The requirement that the ''shishya'' engage in various forms of physical demonstrations of affection towards the guru, such as bowing, kissing the hands or feet of the guru, and sometimes agreeing to various physical punishments as may sometimes be ordered by the guru.
* Sometimes the authority of the guru will extend to all aspects of the ''shishya's'' life, including sexuality, livelihood, social life, etc.

Often a guru will assert that he or she is capable of leading a ''shishya'' directly to the highest possible state of spirituality or consciousness, sometimes referred to within Hinduism as [[moksha]]. In the bhakti ''guru–shishya'' relationship the guru is often believed to have supernatural powers, leading to the deification of the guru.

=== Buddhism ===

In the Pali Buddhist tradition,magae the Bhikkus are also known as Sekhas (SN XLVIII.53 Sekha Sutta).
In the [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition, the teacher is a valued and honoured mentor worthy of great respect and a source of inspiration on the path to [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thurman, Robert A. F. |author2=Huntington, John |author3=Dina Bangdel |title=Beginning the process: The Great Masters and Selecting a Teacher - The Guru-Disciple relationship; in: The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art |publisher=Serindia Publications |location=London |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=1-932476-01-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan tradition]], however, the teacher is viewed as the very root of spiritual realization and the basis of the entire path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dreyfus, Georges B. J. |title=The sound of two hands clapping: the education of a Tibetan Buddhist monk |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2003 |pages= 61–3|isbn=0-520-23260-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the teacher, it is asserted, there can be no experience or insight. The guru is seen as [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. In Tibetan texts, emphasis is placed upon praising the virtues of the guru. [[Tantra|Tantric]] teachings include generating visualisations of the guru and making offerings praising the guru. The guru becomes known as the ''vajra'' (figuratively "diamond") guru, the one who is the source of initiation into the tantric deity. The disciple is asked to enter into a series of vows and commitments that ensure the maintenance of the spiritual link with the understanding that to break this link is a serious downfall.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In [[Vajrayana]] ([[Tantra|tantric]] Buddhism) as the guru is perceived as ''the way'' itself.  The guru is not an individual who initiates a person, but the person's own Buddha-nature reflected in the personality of the guru. In return, the disciple is expected to show great devotion to his or her guru, who he or she regards as one who possesses the qualities of a [[Bodhisattva]]. A guru is regarded as one which has not only mastered the words of the tradition, but one that with which the student has an intense personal relationship; thus, devotion is seen as the proper attitude toward the guru.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8264-1113-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gross, Rita M. |title=Soaring and settling: Buddhist perspectives on contemporary social and religious issues |publisher=Continuum |location=London |year=1998 |isbn=0-8264-1113-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]], speaking of the importance of the guru, said: "Rely on the teachings to evaluate a guru: Do not have blind faith, but also no blind criticism." He also observed that the term 'living Buddha' is a translation of the Chinese words ''huo fuo''.&lt;ref name="urlThe Teacher - The Guru"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/spiritual_teacher_guru.html |title=The Teacher - The Guru |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514220738/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/spiritual_teacher_guru.html |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological aspects==
Rob Preece, in ''The Wisdom of Imperfection,''&lt;ref name="Preece"&gt;Preece, Rob. "The teacher-student relationship" in ''[http://www.snowlionpub.com/html/product_8734.html The Wisdom of Imperfection: The Challenge of Individuation in Buddhist Life]'', Snow Lion Publications, 2006, {{ISBN|1-55939-252-5}}, p. 155 ff. At mudra.co.uk (author's website): [http://www.mudra.co.uk/mudra_teacher_part1.html Part 1], [http://www.mudra.co.uk/mudra_teacher_part2.html Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt; writes that while the teacher/disciple relationship can be an invaluable and fruitful experience, the process of relating to spiritual teachers also has its hazards.

As other authors had done before him,&lt;ref name="Schnabel1982V"&gt;{{nl}} [[Paul Schnabel|Schnabel]], ''Tussen stigma en charisma'' ("Between stigma and charisma"), 1982. [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/schn016tuss01_01/schn016tuss01_01_0012.htm Ch. V, p. 142], quoting [[Jan van der Lans]], ''Volgelingen van de goeroe: Hedendaagse religieuze bewegingen in Nederland''. Ambo, Baarn, 1981, {{ISBN|90-263-0521-4}}&lt;br /&gt;(''note'': "overdracht" is the Dutch term for "transference")&lt;/ref&gt; Preece mentions the notion of [[transference]] to explain the manner in which the guru/disciple relationship develops from a more Western psychological perspective. He writes:

{{quote|In its simplest sense transference occurs when unconsciously a person endows another with an attribute that actually is projected from within themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}}}

Preece writes that when we transfer an inner quality onto another person we may be giving that person a power over us as a consequence of the projection, carrying the potential for great insight and inspiration, but also the potential for great danger.

{{quote|In giving this power over to someone else they have a certain hold and influence over us it is hard to resist, while we become enthralled or spellbound by the power of the [[archetype]].{{cn|date=December 2012}}}}

{{Esperanto sidebar |expanded=History}}
[[L. L. Zamenhof]] developed [[Esperanto]] in the 1870s and 80s and published the first publication about it, ''[[Unua Libro]]'', in 1887. The number of Esperanto speakers has grown gradually since then, although it has not had much support from governments and international organizations and has sometimes been outlawed or otherwise suppressed.

==Standardized Yiddish ==
Around 1880, while in Moscow and approximately simultaneously with working on Esperanto, Zamenhof made an aborted attempt to standardize [[Yiddish]], based on his native Bialystok (Northeastern) dialect, as a unifying language for the Jews of the Russian Empire.  He even used a Latin alphabet, with the letters ''ć, h́, ś, ź'' (the same as in early drafts of Esperanto, later ''ĉ, ĥ, ŝ, ĵ'') and ''ě'' for [[schwa]].  However, he concluded there was no future for such a project, and abandoned it, dedicating himself to Esperanto as a unifying language for all humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Christer Kiselman, [http://www2.math.uu.se/~kiselman/pau2008.pdf "Esperanto: Its origins and early history"], in Andrzej Pelczar, ed., 2008, ''Prace Komisji Spraw Europejskich PAU'', vol. II, pp. 39–56, Krakaw.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]] proposed that Esperanto was not an arbitrary pastiche of major European languages but a Latinate [[relexification]] of Yiddish, a native language of its founder.&lt;ref&gt;

== Development of the language before publication ==
{{details|Proto-Esperanto}}

Zamenhof would later say that he had dreamed of a world language since he was a child. At first he considered a revival of [[Latin]], but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that [[grammatical conjugation|verb conjugations]] were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems could be much simpler than he had expected. He still had the problem of memorising a large vocabulary, until he noticed two Russian signs labelled ''Швейцарская'' (''švejtsarskaja,'' a porter's lodge – from ''швейцар'' ''švejtsar,'' a porter) and ''Кондитерская'' (''konditerskaja,'' a confectioner's shop – from ''кондитер'' ''konditer,'' a confectioner). He then realised that a judicious use of [[affix]]es could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.

Zamenhof taught an [[Proto-Esperanto|early version of the language]] to his high-school classmates.  Then, for several years, he worked on translations and poetry to refine his creation. In 1895 he wrote, "I worked for six years perfecting and testing the language, even though it had seemed to me in 1878 that it was already completely ready." When he was ready to publish, the Czarist censors would not allow it.  Stymied, he spent his time in translating works such as the Bible and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].  This enforced delay led to continued improvement.  In July 1887 he published his ''[[Unua Libro]]'' (''First Book''), a basic introduction to the language. This was essentially the language spoken today.

== ''Unua Libro'' to Declaration of Boulogne (1887–1905)==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ido (language)|Ido]] --&gt;
''[[Unua Libro]]'' was published in 1887. At first the movement grew most in the Russian empire and eastern Europe, but soon spread to western Europe and beyond: to Argentina in 1889; to Canada in 1901; to Algeria, Chile, Japan, Mexico, and Peru in 1903; to Tunisia in 1904; and to Australia, the United States, Guinea, [[Indochina]], New Zealand, [[Tonkin]], and Uruguay in 1905.

In its first years Esperanto was used mainly in publications by Zamenhof and early adopters like [[Antoni Grabowski]], in extensive correspondence (mostly now lost), in the magazine ''[[La Esperantisto]]'', published from 1889 to 1895 and only occasionally in personal encounters.

In 1894, under pressure from Wilhelm Trompeter, the publisher of the magazine ''La Esperantisto'', and some other leading users, Zamenhof reluctantly put forward a radical reform to be voted on by readers. He proposed the reduction of the alphabet to 22 letters (by eliminating the accented letters and most of their sounds), the change of the plural to ''-i'', the use of a positional accusative instead of the ending ''-n'', the removal of the distinction between adjectives and adverbs, the reduction of the number of [[participles]] from six to two, and the replacement of the [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|table of correlatives]] with more Latinate words or phrases. These reforms were overwhelmingly rejected, but some were picked up in [[esperantido|subsequent reforms]] (such as [[Ido (language)|Ido]]) and criticisms of the language.  In the following decade Esperanto spread into western Europe, especially France. By 1905 there were already 27 magazines being published ([[#References|Auld 1988]]).

A small international conference was held in 1904, leading to the first world congress in August 1905 in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], France.  There were 688 Esperanto speakers present from 20 nationalities.  At this congress, Zamenhof officially resigned his leadership of the Esperanto movement, as he did not want personal prejudice against himself (or [[anti-Semitism]]) to hinder the progress of the language.  He proposed a [[Declaration of Boulogne|declaration]] on founding principles of the Esperanto movement, which the attendees of the congress endorsed.

== Declaration of Boulogne to present (1905–present)==
World congresses have been held every year since 1905, except during the two World Wars.

The autonomous territory of [[Neutral Moresnet]], between Belgium and Germany, had a sizable proportion of Esperanto-speakers among its small and multiethnic population.  There was a proposal to make Esperanto its official language.

In the early 1920s, a great opportunity seemed to arise for Esperanto when the [[Iran|Iranian]] delegation to the [[League of Nations]] proposed that it be adopted for use in international relations, following a report by [[Nitobe Inazō]], an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esperanto.ie/en/zaft/zaft_2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, [[Gabriel Hanotaux]]. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat. However, two years later the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. Many people see the 1920s as the heyday of the Esperanto movement.

In 1941, the Soviet Union started performing mass arrests, deportations, and killings of many Esperantists and their relatives for fear of an anti-nationalistic movement, but it was interrupted by the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Encyclopedia of the Original Literature of Esperanto, 1887-2007|publisher=Mondial|isbn=978-1-59569-090-6|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was created as a universal language to unite the Jewish [[diaspora]].
The creation of a [[Judenrein|Jew-free]] [[National German Esperanto League]] was not enough to placate the Nazis.
The teaching of Esperanto was not allowed in [[List of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany|German prisoner-of-war camp]]s during World War II. Esperantists sometimes were able to get around the ban by convincing guards that they were teaching Italian, the language of Germany's closest ally.

[[File:Sixday.jpg|thumb|A Soviet calendar page for 22 October 1935 including the Esperanto ''oktobro'' among other translations.]]
In the early years of the [[Soviet Union]], Esperanto was given a measure of government support, and an officially recognized Soviet Esperanto Association came into being.&lt;ref name="Harlow"&gt;[http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap07.html Donald J. Harlow, The Esperanto Book, chapter 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201024512/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap07.html |date=1 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1937, Stalin reversed this policy. He denounced Esperanto as "the language of spies" and had Esperantists exiled or executed. The use of Esperanto was effectively banned until 1956.&lt;ref name="Harlow" /&gt;
While Esperanto itself was not enough cause for execution, its use was extended among Jews or trade unionists and encouraged contacts with foreigners.

[[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], on the other hand, made some efforts of promoting [[tourism in Italy]] through Esperanto leaflets and appreciated the similarities of Italian and Esperanto.

[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal's right-wing governments]] cracked down on the language from 1936 until the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} After the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Francoist Spain]] cracked down on the [[Anarchism in Spain|Anarchists]] and [[Catalan nationalist]]s among whom the speaking of Esperanto had been quite widespread; but in the 1950s, the Esperanto movement was tolerated again,&lt;ref name="Del Barrio"&gt;''[http://www.nodo50.org/esperanto/artik68es.htm La utilización del esperanto durante la Guerra Civil Española]'', [[Toño del Barrio]] and [[Ulrich Lins]].

The [[Cold War]], especially in the 1950s and 1960s, put a damper on the Esperanto movement as well, as there were fears on both sides that Esperanto could be used for enemy propaganda. However, the language experienced something of a renaissance in the 1970s and spread to new parts of the world, such as its veritable explosion in popularity in Iran in 1975. By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a pan-African congress. The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognised by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.

== Evolution of the language ==
The [[Declaration of Boulogne]] [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/9061/bulonja.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+05:59:00] (1905) limited changes to Esperanto.  That declaration stated, among other things, that the basis of the language should remain the ''Fundamento de Esperanto'' ("Foundation of Esperanto", a group of early works by Zamenhof), which is to be binding forever: nobody has the right to make changes to it.  The declaration also permits new concepts to be expressed as the speaker sees fit, but it recommends doing so in accordance with the original style.

Many Esperantists believe this declaration stabilising the language is a major reason why the Esperanto speaker community grew beyond the levels attained by other constructed languages and has developed a flourishing culture. Other constructed languages have been hindered from developing a stable speaking community by continual tinkering. Also, many developers of constructed languages have been possessive of their creation and have worked to prevent others from contributing to the language. One such ultimately disastrous case was [[Johann Martin Schleyer|Schleyer]]'s [[Volapük]]. In contrast, Zamenhof declared that "Esperanto belongs to the Esperantists", and moved to the background once the language was published, allowing others to share in the early development of the language.

The grammatical description in the earliest books was somewhat vague, so a consensus on usage (influenced by Zamenhof's answers to some questions) developed over time within boundaries set by the initial outline ([[#References|Auld 1988]]). Even before the Declaration of Boulogne, the language was remarkably stable; only one set of lexical changes were made in the first year after publication, namely changing "when", "then", "never", "sometimes", "always" from ''kian'', ''tian'', ''nenian'', ''ian'', ''ĉian'' to ''kiam'', ''tiam'', ''neniam'' etc., to avoid confusion with the accusative forms of ''kia'' "what sort of", ''tia'' "that sort of", etc. Thus Esperanto achieved a stability of structure and grammar similar to that which natural languages enjoy by virtue of their native speakers and established bodies of literature. One could learn Esperanto without having it move from underfoot. Changes could and did occur in the language, but only by acquiring widespread popular support; there was no central authority making arbitrary changes, as happened with [[Volapük]] and some other languages.

Modern Esperanto usage may in fact depart from that originally described in the ''Fundamento'', though the differences are largely semantic (involving changed meaning of words) rather than grammatical or phonological.  The translation given for "I like this one", in the sample phrases in the main [[Esperanto]] article, offers a significant example.  According to the ''Fundamento'', ''Mi ŝatas ĉi tiun'' would in fact have meant "I esteem this one".  The traditional usage is ''Tiu ĉi plaĉas al mi'' (literally, "this one is pleasing to me"), which reflects the phrasing of most European languages (French ''celui-ci me plaît'', Spanish ''éste me gusta'', Russian ''это мне нравится'' [eto mnye nravitsya], German ''Das gefällt mir'', Italian ''mi piace''). However, the original ''Ĉi tiu plaĉas al mi'' continues to be commonly used.

For later changes to the language, see [[Modern evolution of Esperanto]].

== Dialects, reform projects and derived languages ==
{{see also|Esperantido}}

Esperanto has not fragmented into regional [[dialect]]s through natural language use. This may be because it is the language of daily communication for only a small minority of its speakers. However at least three other factors work against dialects, namely the centripetal force of the Fundamento, the unifying influence of the Plena Vortaro and its successors, which exemplified usage from the works of Zamenhof and leading writers, and the transnational ambitions of the speech community itself. Slang and [[jargon]] have developed to some extent, but such features interfere with universal communication – the whole point of Esperanto – and so have generally been avoided.

However, in the early twentieth century numerous reform projects were proposed. Almost all of these [[Esperantido]]s were stillborn, but the very first, [[Ido (language)|Ido]] ("Offspring"), had significant success for several years. Ido was proposed by the [[Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language]] in Paris in October 1907. Its main reforms were in bringing the [[alphabet]], [[semantics]], and some [[Grammar|grammatical]] features into closer alignment with the [[Romance languages]], as well as removal of adjectival agreement and the accusative case except when necessary. At first, a number of leading Esperantists put their support behind the Ido project, but the movement stagnated and declined, first with the accidental death of one of its main proponents and later as people proposed further changes, and the number of current speakers is estimated at between 250 and 5000. However, Ido has proven to be a rich source of Esperanto vocabulary.

Some more focused reform projects, affecting only a particular feature of the language, have gained a few adherents. One of these is [[riism]], which modifies the language to incorporate [[non-sexist language]] and [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s. However, most of these projects are specific to individual nationalities (riism from English speakers, for example), and the only changes that have gained acceptance in the Esperanto community have been the minor and gradual bottom-up reforms discussed in the last section.

Esperanto is credited with influencing or inspiring several later competing language projects, such as [[Occidental language|Occidental]] (1922) and [[Novial]] (1928). These always lagged far behind Esperanto in their popularity. By contrast, [[Interlingua]] (1951) has greatly surpassed Ido in terms of popularity. It shows little or no Esperanto influence, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malmkjaer|first1=Kirsten|title=Linguistics Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134596997|page=113|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hDqCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113|language=en|date=2004-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline of Esperanto ==
* 1859: [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the creator of Esperanto, is born in [[Białystok]], Russia (now Poland).
* 1873: The Zamenhof family moves to [[Warsaw]].
* 1878: Zamenhof celebrates the completion of his universal language project, ''[[Proto-Esperanto#The Lingwe uniwersala of 1878|Lingwe Uniwersala]]'', with high school friends.

Meanwhile [[Johann Martin Schleyer|Schleyer]] publishes a sketch of [[Volapük language|Volapük]], the first [[constructed language|constructed international auxiliary language]] to acquire a number of speakers. Many Volapük clubs will later switch to Esperanto.
* 1881: Zamenhof returns to Warsaw to continue medical school, and starts to recreate his project.
* 1887: Zamenhof marries. In July, with his wife's financial help, he publishes ''[[Unua Libro]]'', the first publication introducing Esperanto, in Russian. Polish, German, and French translations are published later that year.

* 1889: The second English-language edition of ''Unua Libro'' is published in January, translated by [[Richard H. Geoghegan]], and becomes the standard English translation. Henry Phillips, Jr., of the American Philosophical Society, also translates ''Unua Libro'' into English. The first volume of ''[[La Esperantisto]]'' is published in September. The language begins to be called ''Esperanto''.

'''''Huǒhēiàn''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|火|黑|暗}}}}) is an ancient [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] system of [[aesthetics]] believed to serve as the philosophical [[yin and yang|yang]] to [[fengshui]]'s [[yin and yang|yin]]. It was originally described as an art of only theoretical use, although it was eventually adopted as the ''de facto'' alternative to fengshui.

''Huǒhēiàn'' translate as "fire and darkness" in English. This name refers to a passage from the ''[[Book of Burial]]'' of [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]]:&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Qi vapors in the fire, and is lost in the darkness.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.trinity.edu/sfield/Fengshui/Zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike fengshui, ''huǒhēiàn'' values [[diagonal]] and non-orthogonal arrangements, closed spaces, corners, dim lighting, blocked pathways, and [[Chinese jade|jade]] statuettes of snakes (a trademark of the art).

Early practitioners of the aethetic system were considered cruel, brash, and unpleasing to human tastes in their creations.  However, like the dark [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s of [[Gothic architecture]] (believed by some to be a Western [[analogy]] of sorts), ''huǒhēiàn'' grew to mainstream acceptance at various points in [[Chinese history]]. The mixing of the grandiose and unseen blended to give many a feelings of mystery and [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]].

The art of ''huǒhēiàn'' countermands many of fengshui's stylistic imperatives, such as screen walls facing the main entrance of the house, talismans to ward off evil, and elevated landscapes to the anterior of the house.  Additionally, ''huǒhēiàn'' enjoins against the presence of ponds, pools, wells, or indeed water sources of any kind. In fact, this prohibition was the origin of the now-canonical [[Chinese rock garden]].

{{Education in the U.S.}}
[[File:Mark Schneider official photo.jpg|thumb|Mark Schneider, current director]]
The '''Institute of Education Sciences''' ('''IES''') is the independent, non-partisan statistics, research, and evaluation arm of the U.S. Department of Education. IES' stated mission is to provide scientific evidence on which to ground education practice and policy and to share this information in formats that are useful and accessible to educators, parents, policymakers, researchers, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Institute of Education Sciences (IES) Home Page, part of the U.S. Department of Education |url=http://ies.ed.gov/|website=ies.ed.gov|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created as part of the [[Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002]].

The first director of IES was [[Grover Whitehurst]], who was appointed in November 2002 and served for six years. Dr. Mark Schneider is currently the Director of IES.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-welcomes-new-leadership-ies-nces|title=Secretary DeVos Welcomes New Leadership to IES, NCES|last=|first=|date=April 25, 2018 |website=ed.gov|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IES is divided into four major research and statistics centers:
* National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE)—NCEE conducts large-scale evaluations and provides research-based technical assistance and information about high-quality research to educators and policymakers in a variety of different formats. NCEE’s work includes evaluations of education programs and practices supported by federal funds; the Regional Educational Laboratory Program; the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC); the What Works Clearinghouse; and the National Library of Education. Dr. Matthew Soldner is the Commissioner of NCEE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2018/06/higher_ed_researcher_matthew_s.html|title=Higher Ed Researcher Matthew Soldner to Lead Evaluations at IES|last=|first=|date=June 25, 2017|website=blog.edweek.com|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Center for Education Research (NCER)—NCER supports research to improve student outcomes and education quality in the United States and pursue workable solutions to the challenges faced by educators and the education community. NCER also supports training programs to prepare researchers to conduct high quality, scientific education research. Dr. Elizabeth Albro is the Commissioner of NCER.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aera.net/Newsroom/AERA-Highlights-E-newsletter/AERA-Highlights-July-2018/Albro-Appointed-IES-Commissioner-of-NCER-Other-Education-Appointments-Confirmed|title=Albro Appointed IES Commissioner of NCER|last=|first=|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Delphic Council''' (IDC) is a charitable, non-governmental organization (NGO), headquartered in [[Berlin, Germany]]. It claims to be the highest authority for all matters regarding the [[Delphic Games of the modern era]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delphic.org/english/04idc/idc.htm The International Delphic Council (IDC)]&lt;/ref&gt; although there is a similar but separate organization, [[International Delphic Committee]], headquartered in Russia.

== Historical reference ==
The Delphic Games of the modern era were inspired by the ancient Greece traditional [[Pythian Games]] of [[Delphi]] as a symbol for peace. The original Games were between artists and ethnic cultural groups. They took place each year preceding to the Olympic Games. The historic Pythian Games in Delphi can be traced as far back as 2,600 years ago. The spiritual leaders formed the Pan-Hellenic to perform wonders, theatre, music, and poetry to praise the god [[Apollo]] of wonderful light, the symbol of the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]]. The Pythian Games were one of the four [[Panhellenic Games]], a forerunner of the modern [[Olympic Games]], held every four years at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485272/Pythian-Games Pythian Games], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the revival of the [[Olympic Games]], [[art competitions at the Summer Olympics|art competitions]] were held from 1912 to 1948 at the initiative of [[Pierre de Coubertin]]. Competitions in various forms of art were thematically related exclusively to the sport.

Also in the first half of the 20th century, there was a move to revive the Pythian Games at Delphi, at the initiative by the Greek poet [[Angelos Sikelianos]]. In 1927, the Delphic Festival was held for the first time, but the revival was then abandoned due to the cost of organizing it. Delphic Festivals are held in the summer in Delphi, focused largely on tourists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greeka.com/sterea/delphi/delphi-festivals.htm Information about the Festivals of Delphi Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding ==
[[Image:Delphi-logo-2.jpg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the International Delphic Council, was designed and patented by Christian Kirsch, 1995]]

The International Delphic Council (IDC) was founded in 1994. The founder J. Christian B. Kirsch invited people from eighteen nations to Berlin to the founding congress in [[Schönhausen Palace]], aiming to revive the Delphic Games and to provide a forum for worldwide arts and culture. Representative were from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, Kazakhstan, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Switzerland, United States.&lt;ref name = "die welt"&gt;''Ralf Schuler''.

== Founding of the national Delphic organizations ==
The International Delphic Council (IDC) is the co-ordinator and chief executive body of the worldwide Delphic Network. The member countries will establish{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} national Delphic organisations (council, committee, association, union, etc.) which will coordinate with the IDC to promote and organize the Delphic Games. They receive from the IDC, the confirmation of admission after the official registration in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delphic.de/uploads/media/membership_approval_02.pdf Membership_approval. 24. März 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718225038/http://delphic.de/uploads/media/membership_approval_02.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://delphic.de/uploads/media/National_Delphic_Council_of_Russia_letter_02.pdf Official letters of the NDC Russia, 01.

After 1994, national chapters in Belarus, Germany, Georgia, Greece, China, Japan, Nigeria, Philippines, Russia and the United State were particularly active.&lt;ref&gt;''Артемий Понявин''.

Москва Дельфийская. //«Новая Берлинская Газета», Берлин, № 15, 13 — 19 декабря 1996 года&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Delphic organizations design their own logo, which includes some of the IDC symbols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peeep.us/611ff2da Logo, Delphischer Rat Deutschland]&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation of the national qualifications specially designed logos of these national games, which are endorsed by IDC.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Файл:Delphic1999Logo.gif|Logo - Delphic Games Russia 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Файл:Delphic2001Logo.gif|Logo - Delphic Games Russia 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;

NDC Korea won the bid to host the third Delphic Games 2009 in [[Jeju City|Jeju]]. The decision on the venue of the next Delphic Games will be taken by vote of the members of the IDC Board at an extraordinary meeting.

The national Delphic organization of the host country together with IDC prepare for holding Delphic Games. This initiative has received greetings from [[Yehudi Menuhin]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://delphic.de/uploads/media/SYM_music_company_letter_01.pdf Greeting from Yehudi Menuhin 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718225545/http://delphic.de/uploads/media/SYM_music_company_letter_01.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elena Obraztsova]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insea.europe.ufg.ac.at/news/Obraztsova.pdf Greeting from Elena Obraztsova 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

The National Delphic organizations of host countries produce after meeting with the IDC thematic posters, brochures, stamps and other products that are dedicated to the Delphic Games and the IDC Congress.

'''IDC and NDC Russia'''

The National Delphic Council of Russia (NDC Russia) held its founding in December 1998, at conference in Kursk, where secretary general of the IDC Christian Kirsch participated. 19 March 1999 was NDC Russia at the Ministry of Justice registered, and soon afterwards officially recorded in the International Delphic Council recorded, according to IDC-status.

26 June 2000, the head of NDC Russia V. Ponyavin turned to the secretary general of the IDC C. Kirsch, with the request, the first Delphic Games for adults in Moscow from 1 to 10 December 2000 let to hold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delphic.de/uploads/media/I.Delphic_Games_letter_01.pdf The official letter. 26. Juni 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718225605/http://delphic.de/uploads/media/I.Delphic_Games_letter_01.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This request was granted.

Later, however, the Russian NDC split off from the International Delphic Council. Today, various Russian websites and Pressa claim, the Delphic idea was originated by the Russians in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=264575 Дельфийскому совету России исполнилось 10 лет]&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the withdrawal of the Russian National Delphic Council from the International Delphic Council, the Russian delegations took part in the International Delphic Games in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Марина Чернявская''.

'''''It's Like, You Know...''''' is an American [[sitcom]] television series broadcast by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It starred [[Steven Eckholdt]], [[Chris Eigeman]], [[Evan Handler]], [[A. J. Langer]], and [[Jennifer Grey]], and depicted life in Los Angeles as viewed through the eyes of Eigeman's character, a diehard New Yorker named Arthur Garment. The series aired for two seasons, from March 24, 1999 until January 5, 2000.

==Synopsis==
The show sought to lampoon an upper class Los Angeles lifestyle, in part by presenting the Manhattan writer, Garment, as a fish out of water among Hollywood notables and the idle rich.  In the pilot his character arrives with unconcealed hostility, intent on treating his readers to a bitter satire on the absurdities and excesses of LA culture.  While staying with an old friend from college, Garment finds himself increasingly torn between button-down stern contempt for West Coast attitudes and a growing enchantment with the relaxed whimsy constantly swirling around him.

The show was also notable for featuring the actress Jennifer Grey playing herself, the source of a running joke related to her real-life [[rhinoplasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Huff, Richard |date=March 28, 1999 |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-03-28/entertainment/18101411_1_mehlman-nose-jennifer-grey

==Broadcast==
When ABC canceled the series, seven episodes remained unaired (six episodes from the planned second season, in addition to the original unaired pilot). These episodes have since aired abroad, including in [[Argentina]] on [[Fox Latin America]] and in Australia on [[The Comedy Channel]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Reception==
Ratings for the series were low, due in part to the sudden explosion of reality programming and ABC's decision to dedicate much of its primetime schedule to the then-popular ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''.

An '''Independence Day''' is an annual event commemorating the [[anniversary]] of a [[nation]]'s independence or [[Sovereign state|statehood]], usually after ceasing to be a group or part of another nation or state; more rarely after the end of a [[military occupation]]; and in the unique case of Singapore, [[Singapore in Malaysia|expulsion from Malaysia]].

Most countries observe their respective independence days as [[National day|national holidays]].

|Portugal was officially an autonomous state, but the country was in a personal union with the Spanish crown from 1580 to 1640 - date of the restoration of full Portuguese autonomy from [[Iberian Union]] with [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;The country's original independence (from the [[Kingdom of León]]) occurred in June 24, 1128 ([[Battle of São Mamede]]) and was recognized on October&amp;nbsp;5, 1143. That day is a holiday in Portugal, but for a different reason. (Implantation of the Republic, or Republic Day. [[5 October 1910 revolution|Event of 1910]].) Note that none of these events are similar to today's declarations or recognition of independence as these are in fact the recognition of the rule of a king to the land.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32198">A [[stone circle]] is a monument of stones arranged in a circle or ellipse. Such monuments have been constructed in many parts of the world throughout history for many different reasons. The best known tradition of stone circle construction occurred across the [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|British Isles and Brittany in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age]], with over 1000 surviving examples, including [[Avebury]], the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and [[Stonehenge]]. Another prehistoric tradition occurred in [[Stone circle (Iron Age)|southern Scandinavia during the Iron Age]], where stone circles were built to be mortuary monuments to the dead. Outside Europe, examples of stone circles include the 6300~6900 BCE [[Atlit Yam]] in Israel and 3000~4000 BCE [[Gilgal Refaim]] nearby, and the [[Stone Circles (Hong Kong)|Bronze Age monuments in Hong Kong]]. Stone circles also exist in a megalithic tradition located in Senegal and the Gambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01118143 | doi=10.1007/BF01118143 | volume=11-11 | title=Field survey in the tumulus zone of Senegal | journal=The African Archaeological Review | pages=73–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor = 2843758 | pages=173–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an incomplete photographic list of these [[stone circle]]s.

==Australia==
See also [[Aboriginal stone arrangement]]
Stone circles in Australia are sometimes revered as sacred sites by the Australian Aboriginal people. While often small, there are some large stones comparable to their European counterparts, particularly in Victoria. While some are small and not well attended, others are well-known, for instance the stone arrangements in Victoria at [[Carisbrook stone arrangement|Carisbrook]] and [[Lake Bolac stone arrangement|Lake Bolac]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, A. &amp; Schell, P., 1999, Lake Bolac stone arrangement (AAV 7422-394); management plan. An unpublished report to Aboriginal Affairs Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain, Ireland and Brittany==
Aubrey Burl's gazetteer lists 1,303 stone circles in Britain, Ireland and Brittany. Most of these are found in Scotland, with 508 sites recorded. There are 316 in England; 187 in Ireland; 156 in Northern Ireland; 81 in Wales; 49 in Brittany; and 6 in the Channel Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany|last = Aubrey|first = Burl|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = New Haven; London|pages = 395|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cL5KcoqiOnoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Stone%20Circles%20of%20Britain%2C%20Ireland%20and%20Brittany&amp;pg=PA395#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Channel Islands===
Aubrey Burl records six sites in the [[Channel Islands]], four on [[Guernsey]] and two on [[Jersey]]. All six are Cist-in-Circle monuments, which are influenced by chambered tomb design. Their relationship with the stone circle tradition of Britain, Ireland and Brittany is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany|last = Burl|first = Aubrey|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = New Haven; London|pages = 403|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cL5KcoqiOnoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Stone%20Circles%20of%20Britain%2C%20Ireland%20and%20Brittany&amp;pg=PA403#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ōyu Stone Circles
Ōyu Stone Circles (大湯環状列石 Ōyu Kanjyō Resseki) is a late Jōmon period (approx. 2,000 – 1,500 BC) archaeological site in the city of Kazuno, Akita Prefecture, in the Tōhoku regionof northern Japan.
The site consists of two large stone circleslocated on an artificially flattened plateau on the left bank of the Oyu River, a tributary of the Yoneshiro River in northeastern Akita Prefecture. The site was discovered in 1931, with detailed archaeological excavations taking place in 1946, and in 1951-1952.

The larger circle, named the “Manza” circle has a diameter of 46 meters, and is the largest stone circle found in Japan. A number of reconstructions of Jomon period dwellings have been built around the site. The slightly smaller circle, named the “Nonakado” circle, is 42 meters in diameter and is located around 90 meters away, separated from the “Manza” circle by Akita Prefectural Route 66. Each circle is made from rounded river stones brought from another river approximately 7 kilometers away. Each circle in concentric, with and inner and an outer ring separated by an open strip approximately 8 meters wide.[2]Each circle contains smaller clusters of stone, including standing stones surrounded by elongated stones in a radiating orientation, forming a sundial which points toward the sunset on the summer solstice and allows for calculation of the winter solstice, the vernal equinox and the sun's movements.[3]

Each circle is surrounded by the remains of buildings, storage pits and garbage dumps, and clay figurines, clayware and stoneware (including everyday pottery), stone swords and objects have been discovered. Although the form of the stone circles made have been based on the shape of circular settlements, there is no indication of permanent settlement on the site.

The site has been submitted for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List as one of the Jōmon Archaeological Sites in Hokkaidō, Northern Tōhoku, and other regions

The phrase “lusterweibchen” refers to the statue while the lamp itself is categorized as a part of [[horn furniture]].

== History ==

The artist behind that particular piece is unknown, but the extraordinary chandelier encouraged many other artists to create their own pieces.

During the 16th century lusterweibchen boomed, with famous designs by artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Veit Stoss]], and [[Tilman Riemenschneider]]. Lusterweibchen chandeliers may have had an almost magical appeal. reflecting the spirit of the era. The most famous lusterweibchen design was a dragon chandelier carved according to a drawing by [[Albrecht Dürer]].

As part of horn furniture antlers are treasured parts for collectors and suited perfectly for decoration. The combination of antler and a carved statue created a perfect unit for decoration and room illumination. With the rising prosperity of the European middle class at the end of the 19th century, lusterweibchen became a famous design part.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Dettelbacher: Meister Heinz Schiestl: Ein Würzburger Bildhauser, Verlag Ingrid Beck (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Artists created various designs ranging from copies of old drawings to modern noble ladies, mermaid busts, dianas, lustermaennchen, shields, and guilds.

[[File:Mixed Berry Pavlova.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Pavlova (food)|Pavlova]], one of the icons in Australian and New Zealand cuisine.]]
'''New Zealand cuisine''' is largely driven by local ingredients and seasonal variations. An island nation with a primarily agricultural economy, New Zealand yields produce from land and sea. Similar to the [[Australian cuisine|cuisine of Australia]], the [[cuisine]] of New Zealand is a diverse [[British cuisine|British-based cuisine]], with Mediterranean and [[Pacific Rim]] influences as the country becomes more cosmopolitan.

Historical influences came from [[Māori culture]]. [[New American cuisine]], [[Asian cuisine#Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian]], [[Asian cuisine#East Asia|East Asian]], and [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] culinary traditions have become popular since the 1970s.

In New Zealand households, [[dinner]] is the main meal of the day, when families gather and share their evening together. Restaurants and takeaways provide an increasing proportion of the diet.

==Māori cuisine==
[[File:Hāngi dinner.jpg|thumb|A [[hāngi]] dinner as served to tourists.]]
When the [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Māori people|Māori]] arrived in New Zealand from tropical [[Polynesia]] they had a number of food plants, including [[Sweet potato|kūmara]] (sweet potato), [[taro]] and [[Cordyline terminalis|tī]]. The plants grew well only in the north of the [[North Island]]. Native New Zealand plants such as [[Pteridium esculentum|fernroot]] became a more important part of the diet, along with insects such as the [[huhu grub]]. Problems with horticulture were made up for by an abundance of bird and marine life. The large flightless [[moa]] were soon hunted to extinction.{{citation needed||date=January 2016}}  [[Rāhui]] (resource restrictions) included forbidding the hunting of certain species in particular places or at certain times of year, so that the numbers could regenerate.
[[File:Hangi prepare.jpg|thumb|left|Preparation of a modern hāngi for tourists at Mitai Maori Village, Rotorua.]]

Like other Polynesian people, Māori cooked food in earth ovens, known in New Zealand as [[hāngi]], although the word ''umu'' is also used{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} as in other Pacific languages. Stones are heated by fire and food packed in leaves are placed on top. The packs are further covered with foliage and cloth, or, wet sacks, then earth.  Other cooking methods included roasting and, in [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] areas, boiling or steaming using natural hot springs and pools. Occasionally food would be boiled in non-geothermal areas by putting hot stones into a bowl with water and the food; and some food was also cooked over the open fire. Some foods were preserved using smoke, air-drying, or layers of fat—particularly muttonbirds. Māori were one of the few people to have no form of [[alcoholic beverage]].

===Food and religion===
In traditional [[Māori religion]] food was noa, or non-sacred. This meant care had to be taken to prevent it coming into contact with [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] places or objects. If it did, the tapu of the place or object, and often the people associated with it, would be at risk. High chiefs, and people engaged in tapu work such as tattooing, were tapu and were restricted in how they could deal with food; the most tapu needing to be fed by others. One story tells of a war party which had to be postponed as no non-tapu people were available to load the food supplies into the party's [[Waka (canoe)|waka]].

===European influences===
[[File:Whitecliffs Sheep.jpg|thumb|Sheep grazing in Canterbury. Early British settlers introduced Western stock and crops, [[New Zealand agriculture]] now produces an abundance of fresh produce.]]

When Europeans ([[Pākehā]]) first arrived in New Zealand from the late eighteenth century, they brought their own foods with them. Some of these, especially [[pork]] and [[potatoes]], were quickly adopted by Māori and helped end the threat of food shortages that had long plagued many Māori tribes. Potatoes were particularly popular as they were grown in a similar way to [[Sweet potato|kūmara]] but produced a much higher yield with less effort. Other European foods such as [[wheat]], [[pumpkin]], [[mutton]], [[sugar]], and many types of fruit also became a common part of the Māori diet. American sailors brought new varieties of [[sweet potato|kumara]] to New Zealand, and these high-yield varieties quickly superseded the original varieties of kumara.

[[Alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]], initially rejected as 'wai piro' (stinking water), also became part of Māori life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_40/rsnz_40_00_002400.html 'Wai Piro'] in ''[[Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Most Māori tribes grew surpluses of food for trade with other tribes and with European visitors and settlers. Some tribes grew wealthy from this trade, although the Māori food industry declined in the mid-nineteenth century because of land loss and competition from settler farmers. Many traditional food sources, such as the [[kereru]] (wood pigeon) and other birds, as well as some types of fish and plants, became scarce as forests were destroyed and species were over-hunted.

===Māori cuisine today===
[[File:Maori boil-up.jpg|thumb|A Māori boil-up]]
Present day Māori cuisine is a mixture of Māori tradition, old-fashioned English cookery, and contemporary dishes. Most large Māori gatherings feature a [[hāngi]], which is likely to contain foods brought to New Zealand by Māori and by Pākehā. In recent decades there has been much concern that Māori have picked up the worst of European eating habits and as a result are disproportionately likely to suffer from [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], and [[diabetes]].

Two dishes regarded as distinctively Māori are the boil-up - of pork, potatoes, kūmara, and dumplings, and pork and puha (''[[Sonchus|sow thistle]]'') which combine introduced and indigenous foods. Both dishes owe much to nineteenth century British cooking methods.

Also distinctive is ''[[rēwena]]'' or "Maori bread", which is made with fermented potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/interactive/40265/making-rewena-bread&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand European cuisine==
The majority of New Zealanders are Pākehā of British descent, so it is not surprising that the cuisine owes much to [[British cuisine]].

===British Isles settler food===
Nineteenth-century British settlers in New Zealand tried as much as possible to reproduce the foods of their homeland. In the early stages of colonisation this was difficult as many ingredients were unavailable. [[Pakeha settlers|Pākehā settlers]] ate native birds and fish, and used local ingredients in substitution for those which were unavailable, for example brewing [[tea]] and [[beer]] using unconventional plants. Most of these innovations were abandoned as the Pākehā population increased and conventional ingredients began to be mass-imported or produced in New Zealand. One innovation which was commonly served on New Zealand tables until the mid-1980s was [[colonial goose]], a stuffed leg of lamb which substituted for goose.&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Burton |date=March 2008 |title=Pavlova Paradise Lost |journal=Cuisine |volume=127 |pages=124–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major difference between British and Pākehā food was that meat was much more readily available to all social classes in New Zealand. Whereas in nineteenth century [[United Kingdom|Britain]], labourers ate meat in very small quantities, in New Zealand they could have it for every meal. Since meat was a high status food in Britain, British settlers in New Zealand ate vast quantities of it.&lt;ref name="'Food' in Te Ara"&gt;{{cite web |title=Food, drink and dress |work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealandInBrief/Society/9/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the British, Pākehā have traditionally preferred sweet foods, and a wealth of baking dishes celebrate important occasions, reflected through [[cakes]], [[scones]], [[muffins]] and other mainly sweet baking dishes. The country's most iconic recipe book, the ''[[Edmonds Cookery Book]]'', originally began as publicity material for a [[baking powder]] company, and contains a high proportion of baking recipes.

===From Antipodean British fare to Asia-Pacific fusion===
For most of the twentieth century, New Zealand cuisine remained highly derivative of British food.&lt;ref name="'Food' in Te Ara"/&gt; From about the 1960s, the advent of affordable air travel allowed New Zealanders to travel overseas more easily. Many New Zealanders went to Europe on [[overseas experience]] where they encountered French and Italian cooking, and also the Indian and Chinese restaurants of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as well as the [[Modern British cuisine|New British cuisine]]. When they returned home they helped create a demand for better quality food and more variety.&lt;ref name="'Food' in Te Ara"/&gt; They also tried to discover what New Zealand cuisine was, experimenting with [[hangi]] and gaining a greater appreciation of New Zealand produce.

The United Kingdom's joining of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) (now the [[European Union]]) in 1973 sounded the death knell of New Zealand's identity as an agricultural producer for the British Isles, and the formal cultural ties, including cuisine, with the United Kingdom started to become diluted.  During this period, certain non-British or Irish European dishes, such as [[beef bourguignon]], had shed the 'ethnic' connotation and entered the mainstream New Zealand cooking.

The 1980s was marked with economic liberalisation dubbed [[Rogernomics]] (named for the then Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas) that abolished farm subsidies, forcing many farmers to find alternative means of survival.  Many chose to produce specialty cheese types like [[Havarti]], [[Brie]] and [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]], or diversified into growing olives{{efn|As an example, in 1984 there were only two producers of olive oil hailing from New Zealand. Twenty years later, the figure stood at 600.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Taber|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} or grapes instead of traditional meat and dairy farming. [[Avocado oil]] for cooking was commercialised in New Zealand in 1999 by a group of growers based in the [[Tauranga]] region.

Rogernomics also abolished much of import tariffs and instituted a more relaxed agricultural product import quarantine regime. This allows hereunto prohibited or prohibitively expensive specialty foods, such as genuine [[Jamón serrano|serrano]] ham from Spain, [[extra virgin olive oil]] from Italy, and [[mango]] from Thailand, to be available in New Zealand at reasonable costs. These two developments from Rogernomics have given birth to a proliferation of specialist food products available in New Zealand.

On top of changes in available ingredients, the 1980s also witnessed a wholescale liberalisation in attitude towards the formerly 'foreign muck' cooking styles and segmentation of lifestyles according to income and socio-economic status.  New Zealand had by this time developed a largely distinct cultural outlook away from the British Isles, and this also made foreign cooking styles more acceptable among the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Veart|2008|pp=216–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same era also saw the moneyed populations feeling free to openly emulate the luxurious eating and drinking habits of upper and upper middle classes overseas, as the traditional New Zealand preference of egalitarianism, manifested in widespread prejudice against any deviation from lower middle class lifestyles, waned in influence. In the words of New Zealand-based anthropologist [[David Veart]], this period of seachange in New Zealand's culinary culture was akin to "being let out after a long school detention".

==Other cuisines in New Zealand==
People from many different backgrounds have settled in New Zealand, and many have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in New Zealand. Similar to early Pākehā settlers, this often proved difficult. Larger ethnic groups, such as the Chinese, were able to import some ingredients, but often dishes had to be modified to use local ingredients. Ethnic restaurants have served as community meeting places and have also given other New Zealanders a chance to try different cuisines. However, for most of its history there were few ethnic restaurants in New Zealand other than inauthentic Chinese, Indian and Italian eateries.

The Immigration Act 1986 completely abolished nationality preference for immigration, and immigration from [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] has skyrocketed since. Many of these immigrants have brought their different cuisines to New Zealand, and often opened ethnic restaurants and takeaway eateries, giving New Zealanders a chance to try more authentic editions of [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[Malay cuisine|Malay]], regional [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], and other [[Asian cuisine]]s.  Over time these ethnic cuisines have been gradually accepted by Pākehā and Māori New Zealanders.  Consequently, most New Zealand cities have a wide variety of ethnic restaurants, and foods such as [[kebabs]], [[couscous]], and [[sushi]] are served virtually everywhere. Many ethnic origin dishes have been willingly adopted by New Zealanders as their own, including sushi, [[antipasto]], [[butter chicken]], [[pad thai]], [[pasta]], such that they appear in home cooking, as well as in generic New Zealand restaurants.

Ingredients for many ethnic dishes have become much easier to find in major cities, mostly through speciality or ethnic food stores started by many of the post-1987 migrants to New Zealand, but in some cases also through mainstream New Zealand supermarket chains. Similar to Australia, in time the increasing availability of ingredients gave birth to a more authentic style of ethnic cooking, and some ethnic food ingredients have been adopted for local cooking: ingredients such as [[extra virgin olive oil]] and [[sun dried tomatoes]], and to a lesser extent [[fish sauce]] and [[rice paper]] were already seen as ordinary ingredients by the year 2000, whereas even by the late 1980s many people would still have regarded them as highly exotic.{{efn|Peta Mathias in 2005 claims ingredients such as [[fish sauce]] and [[rice paper]] are now a normal part of New Zealand household pantries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mathias|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many New Zealanders still regard these as 'ethnic' ingredients, although as in Australia the foreign connotation is decreasing with the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvp|Veart|2008|pp=295–314}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary scene==
[[File:Hamburger in New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|This [[hamburger]] at a Botany fast food chain contains slices of canned [[beetroot]].]]
As a result of various developments, the food scene of New Zealand in the early 21st century is in a state of flux: cosmopolitan [[Pacific Rim]] fare's reign is now the norm in much of metropolitan eating out scenes,{{efn|There are even reports that in Auckland by 2007, the traditional fund-raising [[sausage sizzles]] at many schools in the more affluent suburbs have been replaced with sushi, a supposedly lower fat and healthier alternative.}} and traditional hearty settlers food, now dubbed ''Kwisine Kiwiana'', but reinterpreted through Pacific Rim cooking knowledge, is a popular cooking style for eating out scenes even in the most remote rural regions. Most of the home cooking prepared at households in [[Auckland]] is now a mix of traditional Kiwiana dishes heavily modified by Mediterranean and Asian techniques and ingredients, and adapted versions of [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]], Chinese, and Indian dishes. In the more culturally traditional parts of the country, such as rural [[Canterbury (New Zealand)|Canterbury]] and the [[West Coast (New Zealand)|West Coast]], however, traditional Kiwiana fare is still the norm at many homes.

Certain vestiges of traditional Kiwiana dishes remain popular throughout the country, such as [[fish and chips]], [[Australian meat pie|meat pies]], [[Mille-feuille|custard squares]], [[Pavlova (food)|pavlova]], and others.{{efn|The author David Burton has witnessed plenty of New Zealand comments that they are thankful New Zealand no longer eats much of traditional Kiwiana fare.&lt;ref name="Burton"/&gt;}} An active nostalgia movement supports the traditional Kiwiana cuisine, as spreadheaded by the popularity of television series [[Kiwi Kitchen]] presented by Richard Till, which is believed to be a public response to a common perception that the traditional Kiwiana dishes are disappearing from the New Zealand tables.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_603656"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/lifestyle/603656 |title=The way we ate |author=Matthews, Philip |date=29 August 2008 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home baking is particularly believed to be the last bastion of New Zealand cuisine still unaffected by international trends.

Concurrently, food habits are changing in Australia to lighter fares influenced by the Mediterranean, and subsequently Southeast Asian, styles of cooking. The proximity, common history, and strong modern political, economic, cultural, and family ties between the two countries means many New Zealand diners and chefs have always been well informed of the trends in the Australian dining scene.  Many chefs had worked in Australia and endeavour to learn from their trans-Tasman counterparts, and in time the changing Australian culinary scene has trickle-down effects on the New Zealand cuisine as well.{{efn|An example is Judith Tabron, owner of the Soul Bar and Bistro in Auckland. Tabron invites Australian chefs such as [[Bill Marchetti]], [[Philip Johnson]], [[Stephanie Alexander]], and [[Greg Malouf]] across the Tasman to New Zealand as guest chefs at Soul from time to time specifically to teach her staff about current Australian food trends, and some of their styles of cooking have become part of the standard menu at Soul which subsequently become New Zealand eating scene via the publishing of these dishes' recipes in popular home cookbooks in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tabron|2005|pp=7-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In general, there are minimal differences between the food preference of New Zealand and Australia. The food trends in New Zealand tend to trail its trans-Tasman counterparts by a few years to a decade, such as the Mediterranean cookery did not become mainstream in New Zealand until the dawn of the 1990s, while its influence was already felt in Australia by the 1980s; and while Australia has by the early 21st century developed a well established niche specialist produce distributing channel, a similar system is still in its infancy across the Tasman.  However, in recent times [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]] have food fashions moving essentially in sync with that of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].{{efn|A positive Australian comment on modern urban New Zealand cooking, specifically Auckland, is from [[Bruce Elder (journalist)|Bruce Elder]] of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], "...here was a time when discriminating eaters [from Australia] were told to take a packed lunch when visiting New Zealand. Now it is consistently good and also, at the upper end, very cheap. With an exchange rate of around $NZ1.20 equalling A$1 meals at the best restaurants in Auckland work out at around A$25 for mains and that, literally, is half what you would pay for the same in Sydney's upmarket restaurants."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Elder, ''Eating in New Zealand (Part 2)'' http://blogs.smh.com.au/trampaboutnz/archives//007306.html&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Sydney and Melbourne fine-dining restaurants have Auckland connections - such as Wildfire restaurant in Sydney is owned by the former owner of Cin Cin in Auckland. [[Molecular cuisine]] has also landed in Auckland as in Sydney by 2006, but is still unheard of in much of the country.}}

One major recent development in the food scene is the emergence of a genuine [[coffee culture|cafe culture]] and disappearance of the traditional institution of [[Tearoom (U.K. and U.S.)|tearooms]] at large. Before the 1990s, tearooms proliferated throughout the country offering [[cream tea]], with [[scones]], [[cream]], and cucumber sandwiches, [[muffins]], and [[Mille-feuille|custard squares]], with filtered coffee or tea as drinks.  New Zealanders have copied the Australian habits of adopting Mediterranean practice of drinking [[espresso]] derived coffees.{{efn|This is alluded to by Peta Mathias.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mathias|2005|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In time, cafes became wildly popular and many tearoom owners converted their businesses to cafes. Cream tea has gone out of fashion in the contemporary New Zealand dining scene, and scones are baked at homes rather than served in eateries.

[[Vegetarianism]] had been regarded as an alternative lifestyle for many years; but became more mainstream during the 1980s even though consistent vegetarians are still rare. Despite exhortations by the Ministry of Health and their allies for people to eat less meat, and more cereals, fruits, and vegetables, a highly meat-based diet remains a part of New Zealand culture, albeit with decrease of red meat consumption and intake of fish and chicken has been on the rise.

[[Gluten free]] foodstuffs have become part of the dietary trends in New Zealand, with cafes and restaurants increasingly offering gluten free versions of popular foods such as [[cakes]], [[pizza]], and [[hamburger]] buns. Some supermarkets, delicatessens and bakeries similarly offer gluten free products and there has been a rise in specialty stores.

A number of organic raw food operations have developed in the last decade in the major cities.

==New Zealand cuisine in other countries==
New Zealand cuisine has made minor impacts on the world at large, although Australia does feel influences from New Zealand cuisine, with certain renowned chefs such as [[Iain Hewitson]], [[Justin North]], [[Ben Shewry]] and [[Philip Johnson (Chef)|Philip Johnson]] being New Zealand-born and [[Stephanie Alexander]]{{efn|The second edition of Australian foodie Stephanie Alexander's ''The Cook's Companion'' includes several recipes made with ingredients traditionally produced in New Zealand but not her own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tabron|2005|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and [[Neil Perry]] actively including New Zealand culinary styles into their works. Certain personalities, such as foodie [[Lauraine Jacobs]], baker [[Dean Brettschneider]], and writers David Burton and [[Julie Biuso]], are widely respected among the professional food industry around the world.  The famed chef [[Peter Gordon (chef)|Peter Gordon]] of London hails from New Zealand originally. The country's most famous culinary export, the [[Pavlova (food)|pavlova]], has been the object of a decades-long battle with Australia over where it was invented.

[[Fusion cuisine]] and the [[Pacific Rim]] style of cooking are major cuisine styles that interact with modern New Zealand cuisine, with chefs from New Zealand actively learning overseas trends,{{efn|Mark McDonough of Zarbo Cafe and Deli claims how he actively sources overseas food and accompanying culinary ideas for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonough|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and chefs like Peter Gordon, bakers such as Dean Brettschneider, and foodies such as Lauraine Jacobs impacting fusion and Pacific Rim cuisines from New Zealand cuisine. ''[[Cuisine (magazine)|Cuisine]]'' magazine, first published in 1986, has earned global fame and is held in high prestige among the worldwide foodie communities.{{efn|For example, the ''Cuisine'' magazine was selected as the best food magazine in the world at the 2007 Le Cordon Bleu World Food Media Awards run by Tasting Australia and sponsored by Le Cordon Bleu, beating other food magazines published in other parts of the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuisine.co.nz/index.cfm?pageID=54996&amp;r=1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Alcoholic beverages==
{{Main article|Alcohol in New Zealand|Beer in New Zealand|New Zealand wine}}

New Zealand has a successful wine industry, with about 76 million litres being exported in the year to June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzwine.com/assets/NZW_Stats_Annual_2007_Final_for_web.pdf|title=New Zealand Winegrowers Statistical Annual|year=2007|format=PDF|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first vines are thought to have been introduced by missionary [[Samuel Marsden]], and planted in 1817 by Charles Gordon, superintendent of agriculture for the missionaries, according to Dr Richard Smart who was viticultural editor of both editions of The Oxford Companion to Wine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/jr7045.html Dr Sherlock unravels a grape mystery]&lt;/ref&gt; Official British resident [[James Busby]] is credited with producing wine at [[Kerikeri]] in 1833, and [[Charles Darwin]] noted the winery in his diary when he visited Kerikeri in 1835.

Small vineyards were also planted by French settlers in [[Akaroa]] in the 1840s. However wine was drunk in relatively small qualities well into the twentieth century, with the average [[per capita]] consumption only about 2.6 litres in 1966. The high price of imported wines probably prevented New Zealanders from developing a taste for wine, although it did help sales of local vintages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/1966/W/WinesOfNewZealand/en 'WINES OF NEW ZEALAND', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, originally published in 1966.]&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of these wines slowly improved, with New Zealand wines winning three gold and 13 silver medals at the [[International Wine Fair]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/W/WinesOfNewZealand/NamesAndTypesOfNewZealandWines/en 'Names and Types of New Zealand Wines' in 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand.]&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by the deregulation of the economy in the 1980s and 1990s, domestic wine consumption increased and New Zealand wine won increasing accolades internationally.

There are 10 major wine-producing areas in New Zealand, with [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]] famed for its [[sauvignon blanc]], [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] for its [[chardonnay]], and [[Central Otago]] and [[Martinborough]] building a reputation for [[pinot noir]] and [[pinot gris]]. [[Hawkes Bay]] is known for its bold [[Cabernet Sauvignon|cabernets]] and [[Auckland]]'s [[Waiheke Island]] is home to one of the top 20 cabernet blends in the world. Marlborough and Hawkes Bay are New Zealand's two premium wine-growing regions.

[[Beer]] is the most popular alcoholic drink in New Zealand, accounting for 63% of available alcohol for sale.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10713655"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10713655 |title=Beer hops off buyers' lists |author=Carroll, Joanne |date=20 March 2011 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand is ranked 27th in [[List of countries by beer consumption per capita|beer consumption per capita]], at around 64.7 litres per person per annum. The vast majority of beer produced in New Zealand is a type of [[lager]], either pale or amber in colour, and between 4% – 5% alcohol by volume. 
There are also over 100 smaller craft breweries and brewpubs producing a vast range of beer styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beer-pages.com/stories/new-zealand-beers.php ''Impressions of New Zealand''] Tom Cannavan, March 2006, www.beer-pages.com.

==Patterns of eating==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
[[Image:Fish and chips.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Fish and chips]], a popular take-away food in New Zealand.]] 
Most New Zealanders eat their main meal – known as ''dinner'', or sometimes ''[[Tea (meal)|tea]]'' – in the evening. Most families living in one household try to eat dinner together several times a week. The formality and structure of these meals varies from family to family. Although, a few New Zealanders cook most things 'from scratch', most New Zealand home cooks are dependent to some extent on pre-made ingredients (in particular, packaged soup and sauce mixes). Cakes are very rarely made from packet mix - this has never really taken on in New Zealand. Most families eat takeaways (take-out), such as fast food, [[fish and chips]], Chinese food, or [[pizza]] about once or twice a week. In [[Flat (domicile)|flats]] (households shared by a group of unrelated young people), flatmates will generally either take turns cooking or each cook and eat individually.

In the summer, the [[barbecue]] is common, generally as a social event. Guests will usually be invited to bring [[beer]] (or wine), and on occasion meat, which the host will cook.  Sometimes guests contribute a salad to the gathering instead. It is traditional for the men to cook the meat, and for the women to do everything else, although these patterns are changing.  Similar Māori gatherings will often feature a [[hangi]] (pronounced ''hung-ee''), a pit in which meats or fish are cooked with vegetables. A deep hole is dug in the ground, lined with red-hot stones and covered with vegetation. The food is then placed on top. The whole oven is sprinkled with water and sealed with more vegetation. The hole is then filled with earth and left to steam for several hours. Traditionally, men dig and prepare the hole, and women prepare the food to go in it. All members of an extended family (whanau) help out for such a feast. The occasion is relaxed, friendly and fun, with people often eating the meal under a marquee.

Many New Zealand gatherings feature a custom known as '[[bring a plate]]' or '[[potluck]]' in which each guest will bring a plate of food to share. This allows people to host large groups without incurring serious expense. Similar customs include guests bringing salads or meat to a barbecue. Most New Zealand parties are '[[BYO]]' (bring your own alcohol), but in this case the drinks are not usually shared. This is especially the case with parties hosted by young people, who cannot usually afford alcohol for more than a few people. One exception is sometimes the 21st birthday party, which will often be funded by the host's family. Weddings are also normally catered for by the hosts and their family.

New Zealand's eating out culture has developed strongly after the mid-1970s, thanks partially to the liberalisation of liquor licensing laws and popularisation of [[coffeehouse|cafes]] and other similar casual dining establishments. It is common for people to visit cafes regularly for lunch or morning or afternoon snacks.  On the other hand, visits to restaurants are still regarded as special occasion treats for most of the population.

There is a '[[fast food]]' culture similar to that in the United States, Australia and Britain. Many American fast food chains have a presence in New Zealand, and local variants based on quality local produce (such as [http://burgerfuel.co.nz Burger Fuel] and [http://www.hell.co.nz Hell Pizza] for example) have arisen. The pie is possibly the nearest thing New Zealand has to [[street food]], though its popularity has waned. Pies are actually still the most common take away lunch and are sold everywhere, in dairies, bakeries, supermarkets, petrol stations, school lunch tuck-shops. Pies can be made with beef, lamb, chicken, pork, apple, berries, rhubarb or custard.  Traditionally pies are a savory food as opposed to sweet pies. A fast food chain based on pies, [[Georgie Pie]], was founded in 1977, but went out of business in the mid-1990s after its acquisition by [[McDonald's New Zealand]], which later brought it back as a one-off special in the early 21st century.  Currently another fast food chain selling pies exists: Australian-based [http://www.jesters-pies.co.nz Jester's] produces pies throughout New Zealand's North Island, predominantly Auckland.

In the main centres, food courts have become popular, with several in [[Auckland]] alone. Immigration has led to an increase in choice and quality, with many food halls offering [[Asian cuisine]]s including [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] and [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], as well as distinctly New Zealand fare such as roast dinners.

'''Nude weather reports''' are weather reports performed in the nude, either on television or on radio, or in any other context.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Examples==

'''Počasíčko''' (a diminutive of the [[Czech language|Czech]] word for weather) is the name of a late-night weather report that ran on [[Nova (Czech TV)|TV Nova]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. In this reverse [[strip tease]], a [[model (person)|model]] would appear in the nude and then gradually put on clothes appropriate for the next day's weather forecast. The programme aired for some time during 2002 and was then discontinued. It has resumed (in a reversed format, i.e., with "regular" strip-tease) on 1 February 2007.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

'''Radio Tango''' in [[Norway]] was the world's first radio channel to broadcast nude weather reports, simultaneously providing a glimpse of the nude reporter on its web site.&lt;ref name="radiotango"&gt;Reuters (2001-05-04).

'''Plastic Paddy''' is a sometimes pejorative term for members of the [[Irish diaspora]] who [[cultural appropriation|misappropriate]] stereotypical aspects of [[Irish people|Irish]] customs and identity. Sometimes the adopted imagery is not only inaccurate, but seen as [[Anti-Irish sentiment|offensive]] by members of Irish cultures. The term has also been applied to those with distant, or zero, ancestral connection to Ireland who falsely claim Irish identity or nationality. A ''plastic Paddy'' may know little of actual [[Irish culture]], but nevertheless assert an Irish identity.&lt;ref name="Nagle"&gt;{{cite report| author= John Nagle |date= 2004 |title= "Is 'Everybody Irish on St. Paddy's'?

==Usage==
The name [[Paddy (given name)|Paddy]] is a diminutive form of the Irish name Patrick (''Pádraic'', ''Pádraig'', ''Páraic'') and, depending on context, can be used either as an affectionate or a pejorative reference to an Irishman.

The term "plastic Paddy" came into use in the 1980s when it was frequently employed as a term of abuse by recently arrived middle-class Irish migrants to London.&lt;ref name=Hickman/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marc Scully 2009 p126-127"&gt;Marc Scully. (2009). 'Plastic and Proud'?: Discourse of Authenticity among the second generation Irish in England. Open University p126-127. Marc Scully. (2009). 'Plastic and Proud'?: Discourse of Authenticity among the second generation Irish in England. Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; Hickman states: it 'became a means of distancing themselves from established Irish communities.' And the use was a part of the process by which the second-generation Irish are positioned as inauthentic within the two identities, of Englishness and Irishness.&lt;ref name="Marc Scully 2009 p126-127"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, M.J. et al., (2005). The Limitations of Whiteness and the Boundaries of Englishness. Ethnicities, 5 160–182. Cited in Marc Scully. (2009). 'Plastic and Proud'?: Discourse of Authenticity among the second generation Irish in England. Open University.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Ironically, both English hostility when faced with the spectre of Irish identities, and Irish denials of authenticity of those same identities, utilises the pejorative term 'plastic paddy' to stereotype and undermine processes 'of becoming' of Irish identities of second-generation Irish people. The message from each is that second-generation Irish are 'really English' and many of the second-generation resist this.&lt;ref name="Marc Scully 2009 p126-127"/&gt;}}

People who were not born in Ireland, and who did not grow up in Ireland, but nonetheless possess [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizenship]] and an [[Irish passport]] are sometimes labelled{{by whom|date=March 2016}} as ''plastic Paddies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term can have a different connotation depending on where it is used.

===Ireland===
Within Ireland, "plastic paddy" may refer to someone who misrepresents the Irish culture by enacting [[ethnic stereotypes]] that portray an inaccurate, outdated and offensive image of Ireland and Irish culture. This is often seen in non-Irish citizens who have a [[romanticism|romantic]] or [[noble savage]] image of "the Irish Race," and those who enact stereotypes to appeal to tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Hegarty, Shane (3 March 2007). '[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/newsfeatures/2007/0317/1173880425189.html Slang and the art of Oirishness]', ''The Irish Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/oops-now-its-signor-tripattoni-1472855.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Jason | last=O'Brien | title=Oops, now it's Signor Tripattoni | date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/st-patricks-day/heard-the-one-about-the-drunk-horny-leprechaun-1675071.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Heard the one about the drunk, horny leprechaun? | date=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This naming is a critical reaction to, and defiance of, the demeaning, inaccurate depictions of the Irish at celebrations that originated in the [[Irish diaspora]], as well as the commercialisation and distortion of [[Saint Patrick's Day|St. Patrick's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Wearing of the green'' by Mike Cronin and Daryl Adair. p240&lt;/ref&gt;

The Killarney Active Retirement Association displayed a banner promising to "Chase the plastic Paddy out of Ireland" in the Kerry 2005 St Patrick's Day celebrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/thousands-salute-the-wearing-of-the-green-white-and-orange-269679.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Thousands salute the wearing of the green, white and orange | date=18 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irish journalists have used the term to characterise Irish bars in the diaspora as inauthentic and with the "minimum of plastic paddy trimmings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/where-to-stay-what-to-do-and-where-to-eat-205630.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Where To Stay, What To Do And Where To Eat | date=20 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Plastic paddy' has also be used as a derogatory term for Irish people who show more allegiance to English culture than Irish culture, such as those who support English football teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/letters/growth-bridge-queen-families-gaa-2198114.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Growth. . .

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Dermot Oleary.jpg|thumb|upright|English broadcaster [[Dermot O'Leary]] described his upbringing as "classic plastic Paddy"]]
[[Mary J. Hickman]] writes that "plastic Paddy" was a term used to "deny and denigrate the second-generation Irish in Britain" in the 1980s, and was "frequently articulated by the new middle-class Irish immigrants in Britain, for whom it was a means of distancing themselves from established Irish communities."&lt;ref name=Hickman&gt;[[Mary J. Hickman]]. 2002. "'Locating' the Irish Diaspora." ''Irish Journal of Sociology'' 11(2):8-26.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bronwen Walter, Professor of Irish Diaspora Studies at [[Anglia Ruskin University]], "the adoption of a [[hyphenated identity]] has been much more problematic for the second generation Irish in Britain. The Irish-born have frequently denied the authenticity of their Irish identity, using the derogatory term ''plastic Paddy'', and the English regard them as "assimilated" and simply "English."&lt;ref name=Walter&gt;Bronwen Walter, 2005, "Irish Diaspora" in ''Immigration and asylum: from 1900 to the present, Volume 3'' edited by Matthew J. Gibney, Randall Hansen. {{ISBN|1-57607-796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used to taunt [[List of Republic of Ireland international footballers born outside the Republic of Ireland|non-Irish born players]] who choose to play for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2093-2472060.html Teenager under fire] (26 November 2006) Times (UK)&lt;/ref&gt; fans of Irish teams, who are members of supporters clubs outside Ireland,&lt;ref name="McCullough"&gt;{{cite news | first = Ian | last = McCullough | title = Back of the Net| url =http://www.irishabroad.com/news/irishpost/sport/Backofnet.asp | publisher = The Irish Post | accessdate = 5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Irish individuals living in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishpost/2006/05/10/story4153.asp "A proud celebration of our new Irish identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629121702/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishpost/2006/05/10/story4153.asp |date=29 June 2011 }}" in ''The Irish Post'' (Wednesday, 10 May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[University of Strathclyde]] and [[Nil by Mouth (charity)|Nil by Mouth]] found the term was used abusively on [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] supporters' [[Internet forum]]s in reference to Celtic supporters and the wider [[Catholic]] community in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;O'Loan, Sara; Poulter, Alan; McMenemy, David (2005).

The prosecutor said the man had made racist remarks about the officer, including accusations that the officer was a "plastic Paddy".&lt;ref name=birminghammail&gt;McCarthy, Ross (11 August 2009).

In the book ''Why I Am Still a Catholic: Essays in Faith and Perseverance'' by [[Peter Stanford]], the television presenter [[Dermot O'Leary]] describes his upbringing as "classic plastic Paddy", where he would be "bullied in a nice way" by his own cousins in Wexford for being English "until anyone else there called me English and then they would stick up for me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GjPg3pPFtSAC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22plastic+paddy%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=ccDtSvXmDJXGywTlr_CcDw# "More than a Plastic Paddy"] in ''Why I Am Still a Catholic: Essays in Faith and Perseverance''&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] uses the term to refer to "second-generation wannabe" Irishmen,&lt;ref name=Spiked/&gt; and writes that some of those guilty of "plastic Paddyism" (or, in his words, "[[Dermot]]-itis") are [[Bill Clinton]], [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], and [[Shane MacGowan]].&lt;ref name=Spiked&gt;[http://www.spiked-online.com/Printable/000000005523.htm We're all Irish now] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528052926/http://www.spiked-online.com/Printable/000000005523.htm |date=28 May 2013 }} from ''Spiked'' online magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alex Massie (journalist)|Alex Massie]], a Scottish journalist, wrote in ''[[National Review]]'':

{{quote|When I was a student in Dublin we scoffed at the American celebration of St. Patrick, finding something preposterous in the green beer, the search for any connection, no matter how tenuous, to Ireland, the misty sentiment of it all that seemed so at odds with the Ireland we knew and actually lived in. Who were these people dressed as Leprechauns and why were they dressed that way? This Hibernian [[Brigadoon]] was a sham, a mockery, a Shamrockery of real Ireland and a remarkable exhibition of plastic paddyness. But at least it was confined to the Irish abroad and those foreigners desperate to find some trace of green in their blood.&lt;ref name="Massie"&gt;

The '''Presidential Seal of [[Turkey]]''' is the [[Coat of arms|official seal]] of the [[President of Turkey]]. It has a large 16-pointed Sun which symbolizes the [[Republic of Turkey]] in the center, which is surrounded by 16 five-pointed [[star]]s, symbolizing the [[16 Great Turkish Empires]] in history.&lt;ref name="Presidency"&gt;[http://www.tccb.gov.tr/sayfa/cumhurbaskanligi/fors/ Official website of the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey: Detailed description of the Presidential Seal]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The roots of the Presidential Seal and Presidential Flag of Turkey go back to September 1922, when a similar flag was used on the [[automobile]] that took [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] to [[İzmir]] during the final days of the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish National Campaign]].&lt;ref name="Presidency" /&gt; This flag is currently on display at the [[Anıtkabir|Anıtkabir Museum]] in [[Ankara]].&lt;ref name="Presidency" /&gt; The Presidential Flag's characteristics and proportions were legalized with the ''Sancak Talimatnamesi'' law on October 22, 1925.&lt;ref name="Presidency" /&gt; According to this law, the Presidential Seal's dimensions were defined as "70cm x 70cm", while the Sun in the center (which looked similar to the current one) was a 20-pointed star containing 10 sharp-edged and 10 oval-edged light rays.&lt;ref name="Presidency" /&gt; The "70cm x 70cm" dimensions of the Presidential Seal were maintained in the Turkish Flag Law of May 29, 1936; but were later reduced to "30cm x 30cm" with a new legal amendment that was made on September 14, 1937.&lt;ref name="Presidency" /&gt; The number of the light rays in the Sun of the Presidential Seal were reduced to 16 (8 long and 8 short light rays, all of them sharp-edged) in order to symbolize the 16 [[Turkic states]] in history, with another legal amendment on February 18, 1978.&lt;ref name="Presidency" /&gt; The seal and flag took their current shape and proportions with the final legal amendment on January 25, 1985.&lt;ref name="Presidency" /&gt;

The ''[[16 Great Turkic Empires]]'' are a [[Pan-Turkist]] concept introduced in 1969 by Akib Özbek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haberyayinlari.net/sonDakika/nihal-atsiz-yazmisti-16-devlet-masali-ve-uydurma-bayraklar/48770-haber Haber yayınları (Nihal Atsız's essay)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150118131342/http://haberyayinlari.net/sonDakika/nihal-atsiz-yazmisti-16-devlet-masali-ve-uydurma-bayraklar/48770-haber |date=2015-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its association with the seal was introduced in 1985, under president [[Kenan Evren]].&lt;ref name="tcbb"&gt;[http://www.tccb.gov.tr/pages/presidency/ Official website of the presidency]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this assertion, the 16 stars had been taken as representing sixteen [[Anatolian beyliks|medieval beyliks]] which succeeded the [[Seljuk Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;''X.

== Measurements ==
The 16 stars are aligned with a 22.5 degree angle, equidistantly surrounding the sun. One edge of each star points to the center of the sun. The unit of measurement of the seal is the diameter of the circle around the edges of any one of the 16 stars (A). The lengths of the rays of the sun, the distance between the rays and the edges of the stars and the diameter of the outmost circle are determined as multiples of the unit A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9277">{{Sound change}}
'''Quantitative metathesis''' (or '''transfer of quantity''')&lt;ref name="general"&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth|Smyth]], ''Greek Grammar'', [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_uni.htm#34 paragraph 34] on [[Christian Classics Ethereal Library|CCEL]]: transfer of quantity&lt;/ref&gt; is a specific form of ''[[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]'' or ''transposition'' (a [[sound change]]) involving ''quantity'' or [[vowel length]]. By this process, two [[vowel]]s near each other – one long, one short – switch their lengths, so that the long one becomes short, and the short one becomes long.

In theory, the definition includes both
:long-short → short-long
and
:short-long → long-short,
but [[Ancient Greek]], which the term was originally created to describe, displays only the former, since the process is part of long-vowel shortening.

==Ancient Greek==
In the [[Attic Greek|Attic]] and [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] dialects of Ancient Greek, ''ēo'' and ''ēa'' often exchange length, becoming ''eō'' and ''eā''.&lt;ref name="general"/&gt;

This quantitative metathesis is more accurately described as one form of long-vowel shortening. Usually if quantitative metathesis affects a word, other kinds of shortening do as well, in the forms where quantitative metathesis cannot occur:

* ''ēwo'' → ''eō'' (quantitative metathesis)
* ''ēws'' → ''ews'' (shortening of long diphthong before consonant)
* ''ēi'' → ''ei'' (analogical shortening)

In general, the vowels affected by this shortening were separated by the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[semivowel|semivocalic]] versions of ''u'' or ''i'', usually [[deletion (phonology)|deleted]] in later Greek: ''w'' (written [[digamma|ϝ]] or υ̯ ) or ''y'' (written ι̯ ).

===First declension===
The [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] form of the genitive singular in the masculine [[first declension]] sometimes undergoes quantitative metathesis:&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2a_notes.htm#214D paragraph 214 footnote]: dialectal first-declension forms&lt;/ref&gt;

*Πηλεΐδης ''Pēleḯdēs'' ([[patronymic|patronym]] from Πηλεύς ''Pēleús'': "[[Peleus]]-son", [[Achilles]])
:Πηλεΐδᾱο ''Pēleḯdāo'' → *Πηλεΐδηο ''*Pēleḯdēo'' → Πηλεΐδεω ''Pēleḯdeō'' (genitive singular; alternate form Πηληϊάδεω ''Pēlēïádeō'' in the first line of the [[Iliad]])&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*phleu/s|Πηλεύς|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attic genitive singular Πηλεΐδ-ου ''Pēleḯd-ou'' uses a copy of the [[second declension|second-declension]] ending, which came from the same original form as the Thessalian [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] ending ''-oio'' (used in Homer)&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kiparsky]], "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/411806 Sonorant Clusters in Greek]", ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', Vol. 43, No. 3, Part 1, pp. 619-635: Sep. 1967&lt;/ref&gt; — ''o-syo'', [[thematic vowel]] ''o'' and case-ending ''-syo''). The Homeric form comes from the same case ending, with the first-declension pseudo-thematic vowel ''ā''.

===Second declension===
Nouns in a small subclass of the [[second declension]] (known as the "[[Attic declension]]") lengthen the ''o, oi'' of the ending to ''ō, ōi''. Sometimes this is quantitative metathesis:&lt;ref name="attic declension"&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2c_uni.htm#238c paragraph 238 c]: transfer of quantity and shortening in "Attic declension" forms&lt;/ref&gt;

:Ionic ληός ''lēós'' (from λᾱϝός ''lāwós'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lao/s1|λαός|ref}} (end of entry)&lt;/ref&gt; → Attic λεώς ''leṓs'' "people"
:ληοί ''lēoí'' → λεῴ ''leōí'' (nominative plural)

But sometimes, when a long vowel occurs in the ending, ''ē'' is shortened to ''e'' without an accompanying lengthening of the vowel in the ending (but ''ou'' changes to ''ō'' to follow the other forms):&lt;ref name="shortening"&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_uni.htm#39 paragraph 39]: shortening of long vowel before another long vowel&lt;/ref&gt;

:ληοῦ ''lēoú'' → λεώ ''leṓ'' (genitive singular)
:ληῷ ''lēōî'' → λεῴ ''leōí'' (dative singular)

===Third declension===
Some [[third declension|third-declension]] [[noun]]s had, in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], stems in ''-u'' or ''-i'' in [[Indo-European ablaut#Ablaut in Proto-Indo-European|zero-grade]], ''-ew'' or ''-ey'' in short e-grade, and ''-ēw'' or ''-ēy'' in long ''ē''-grade.&lt;ref name="i-stems"&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2f_uni.htm paragraph 270]: stem variation of i, u-stems&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stem variation"&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2g_uni.htm#278 paragraph 278]: stem variation of au, eu, ou-stems&lt;/ref&gt; Others had ''-āw'' with no variation in ablaut grade, which changed in some forms to ''ēw'', by the Attic-Ionic ''ā'' → ''ē'' shift.

In many cases, the ''w'' or ''j'' was deleted, but sometimes it is preserved as the last element of a [[diphthong]] (''-eus'', ''-aus'').

Stems with ''ē'' underwent shortening in Classical Attic-Ionic, but early forms with long ē are preserved in [[Homer]] to maintain the original [[meter (poetry)#Greek and Latin|meter]]. Some forms exemplify the quantitative-metathesis type of shortening:

*βασιλεύς ''basileús'' (shortened from *βασιλήϝς ''*basilḗws'')&lt;ref name="semivowel liquid"&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_uni.htm#40 paragraph 40]: shortening of long vowel before u, i, nasals, liquid + a consonant&lt;/ref&gt; "king"
:[[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] (early [[Attic Greek|Attic]]-[[Ionic Greek|Ionic]]) βασιλῆος ''basilêos'' (from βασιλῆϝος ''basilêwos'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|basileu/s|βασιλεύς|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; → Classical Attic βασιλέως ''basiléōs'' (genitive singular)
:βασιλῆα ''basilêa'' → βασιλέᾱ ''basiléā'' (accusative singular)
:βασιλῆας ''basilêas'' → βασιλέᾱς ''basiléās'' (accusative plural)

*Attic ναῦς ''naûs'' "ship" (from *νᾱῦς ''*nāûs'' by shortening of ''ā'': [[Latin]] ''nāv-is'')
:νηός ''nēós'' (from *νᾱϝός ''*nāwós'') → νεώς ''neṓs)'' (genitive singular)&lt;ref name="stem variation" /&gt;

*πόλις ''pólis'' "city"
:πόληος ''pólēos'' (from *πόληι̯ος ''*pólēyos'') → πόλεως ''póleōs'' (genitive singular)

*ἄστυ ''ástu'' "town"
: *ἄστηος ''*ástēos'' (from *ϝάστηϝος ''*wástēwos'') → ἄστεως ''ásteōs'' (genitive singular)

The accent of the genitive singular of the last two words violates the [[Ancient Greek phonology#Accent|rules of accentuation]]. Normally the long vowel of the last syllable would force the accent forward to the second-to-last syllable, giving *πολέως ''*poléōs'' and *ἀστέως ''*astéōs'', but instead the accent remains where it was before shortening.&lt;ref name="genitive"&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2f_uni.htm#271 paragraph 271]: accent of genitive singular and plural of some i, u-stems&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accent"&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1f_uni.htm#163a paragraph 163 a]: exceptions to rules for antepenult accent&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of these nouns shorten ''ē'' to ''e'', but because the vowel of the ending is long, no quantitative metathesis occurs:&lt;ref name="shortening"/&gt;
:*βασιλήων ''*basilḗōn'' → βασιλέων ''basiléōn'' (genitive plural)

Some forms shorten ''ē'' to ''e'' before ''i'' according to the [[analogy#Linguistics|analogue]] of the other forms, but without lengthening the ''i'':
:Homeric βασιλῆi ''basilêi'' → Attic βασιλεῖ ''basileî'' (dative singular)

Other forms involve no shortening, since they come from a short [[Indo-European ablaut#Ablaut in Proto-Indo-European|''e''-grade]] form of the stem.&lt;ref name="i-stems" /&gt; The accent of the genitive plural is sometimes irregular because it follows the analogue of the genitive singular:
: *πολέι̯-ων ''poléy-ōn'' → πόλεων ''póleōn'' (genitive plural — re-accented after genitive singular)

: *ϝαστέϝ-ων ''
*wastéw-ōn'' → ἄστεων ''ásteōn'' (also re-accented)

===Participle===
The perfect participle of the verb θνῄσκω ''thnēískō'' "die" undergoes vowel shortening, and quantitative metathesis in the [[oblique case|oblique]] forms:&lt;ref name="general"/&gt;
* *τεθνηϝώτς ''tethnēwṓts''&lt;ref name="participle"&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2j_uni.htm#301c paragraph 301 c]: masculine/neuter endings for perfect active participle&lt;/ref&gt; → τεθνεώς ''tethneṓs'' "dead" (masculine nominative singular: [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] with [[Proto-Indo-European verb#Stative|stative]] meaning)
: *τεθνηϝότος ''*tethnēwótos'' → τεθνεῶτος ''tethneôtos'' (masculine/neuter genitive singular)

{{inconsistent citation style|date=August 2013}}
'''Reverence''' ({{IPA|/ˈrɛvərəns/}}) is "a feeling or attitude of deep [[respect]] tinged with [[awe]]; veneration".&lt;ref&gt;Reverence | Define Reverence at Dictionary.com. (n.d.). Dictionary.com | Free Online Dictionary for English Definitions. Retrieved April 28, 2011, from http://dictionary.reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "reverence" in the modern day is often used in relationship with [[religion]].  This is because religion often stimulates the emotion through recognition of [[God]], the [[supernatural]], and the [[ineffability|ineffable]].  Reverence involves a humbling of the self in respectful recognition of something perceived to be greater than the self.  Thus religion is commonly a place where reverence is felt.

However, similar to [[awe]], reverence is an emotion in its own right, and can be felt outside of the realm of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gibbons|first= Kendyl   |date=  May 15, 2012 |title= Primal reverence |journal= UU World |volume=   XXVII No. 2 |issue= Summer 2012 |pages=  |publisher= [[Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations]] |id=   |doi= |url=  http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/199598.shtml |quote= Reverence is an organic human experience that requires no supernatural explanations.'|accessdate= July 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas awe may be characterized as an overwhelming "[[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] to greatness," reverence is seen more as "acknowledging a [[subjectivity|subjective]] response to something [[excellence|excellent]] in a personal ([[moral]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]]) way, but qualitatively above oneself" &lt;ref&gt;Roberts, R. C. (2003). Emotions: An essay in aid of moral psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon describes awe as passive, but reverence as active, noting that the [[feeling]] of awe (i.e., becoming awestruck) implies [[paralysis]], whereas feelings of reverence are associated more with active [[engagement]] and responsibility toward that which one reveres.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, R. C. (2002). Spirituality for the skeptic: The thoughtful love of life. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nature]], [[science]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]], great [[philosophers]], [[leaders]], [[artists]], [[art]], [[music]], [[wisdom]], and [[beauty]] may each act as the stimulus and focus of reverence.

== Religion and music ==
David Pugmire’s article, "The Secular Reception of Religious Music" explores the unique experience of reverence through music.  In particular he looks at how religious music has the capacity to instill emotions of reverence, awe, wonder, and veneration in secular people who lack the context to fully understand the transcendent through religion.  "Sacred music seems to have a surprising power over unbelievers not just to quicken or delight them as other music does, but also to ply them, as little else can, with what might be called devotional feelings".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"&gt;Pugmire, D. (2006). The Secular Reception of Religious Music. Philosophy, 81(315), 65-79. {{doi|10.1017/S0031819106000040}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with this though, Pugmire argues that the secularist cannot fully comprehend the nature of sacred art including sacred music.  "Its undoubted expressiveness can lead him at most to accesses of feeling, not to emotion in the fullest sense, i.e., emotion with appropriate objects sustained by appropriate judgments".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;

Pugmire believes that reverence belongs to the range of emotions that can be classified in their devotional or [[sacred]] forms, "Emotions of reverence, solemnity, agape, hope, serenity, and ecstasy".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But this classification of emotions poses an interesting question: can any emotion be purely religious?  "A central candidate for a distinctively religious emotion would be reverence".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But it is not entirely distinct from the rest of the emotions that are not related to transcendence or religion.  "Reverence is indeed graver, and an attitude in which one is more given over, than its secular approximations in the shape of approval or esteem or respect".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But this does not make it purely religious.  In fact, "[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] was able to claim reverence as our principal moral emotion without invoking any grounding theological basis for this".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  "Similarly for its bracing sibling, awe: it figures in our experience of the sublime, of which Kant purports to find an entirely secular account".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  To connect the secular and the sacred emotions Pugmire looks at the emotions which can be experienced equally in both contexts.  These are, "Love, humility, sorrow, pity, joy, serenity, ecstasy".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  Pugmire then suggests that devotional emotion is: "The transfiguring of mundane emotion into what one might call emotion of the last instance, to the reception and expression of which religious imagery is especially well-suited, and not accidentally".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  The emotion of the last instance refers to the capacity of the emotional imagination to lose the sense of self and engage in the infinite and the ineffable.  Pugmire is suggesting that religion, "Provides a strikingly apt vocabulary for the expression of emotion of the last instance".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  Reverence is perhaps the most critical of these "emotions of the last instance" and can be adequately accessed through religious music.

==Major Theorists of Reverence ==

=== Paul Woodruff ===
[[Paul Woodruff]] in his book, ''Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue'', assesses the current understanding of the emotion reverence in the modern era.  He assesses that a true understanding of reverence is missing from both modern society and the "modern discussions of the ancient cultures that prized it" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;3).  Specifically these ancient cultures include [[Greece]] and [[China]].  Woodruff’s best definition of Reverence is, "The well-developed capacity to have the feelings of [[awe]], [[respect]], and [[shame]] when these are the right feelings to have" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;8).  Thus Woodruff’s definition of reverence includes the combination of three other emotions: respect, shame, and awe.  "Respect is for other people, shame is over one’s own shortcomings, and awe is usually felt toward something transcendent" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;65).
Although Woodruff acknowledges the relationship between reverence and religion he argues that, "Reverence has more to do with politics than with religion" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;4).  Woodruff in his book is trying to separate the common misunderstanding that reverent emotions can only be related to religion.

Woodruff sees [[ceremony]] and [[ritual]] as key elements in meaningful human life when practiced with reverence.  "Without reverence, rituals are empty" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;19).  Ceremony and ritual are found at home, in meetings, in voting, and in religion and these acts provide the context for feeling reverence.  But often these situations are so common the emotion reverence disappears from human consciousness. "Ritual and reverence in common life are so familiar that we scarcely notice them until they are gone" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;35).  Woodruff argues that, "Reverence, ceremony and respect do not disappear, they cannot disappear from a functioning society" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;36).  He states that "What we are losing is not reverence, but the idea of reverence" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;36).  It is his hope that the importance of reverence will be recognized in society again and that this recognition will better humanity. He proposes to "Restore the idea of reverence to its proper place in ethical and political thought" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

Woodruff understands true reverence to be for things beyond human control.  "The object of reverence is the ideal of unity, because that transcends politics altogether" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;28).  Thus reverence focuses on an ideal that transcends the scope of humankind.  This ideal can vary from God, to unity, to anything else that transcends human capacity.  "Reverence sets a higher value on the truth than on any human product that is supposed to have captured the truth" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;39). He goes on to say that, "The principal object of reverence is Something that reminds us of human limitations" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;65).  Reverence therefore is related to truth and the recognition that mankind cannot acquire absolute truth and that human life is finite.

Woodruff describes how reverence is often activated through [[music]].  Woodruff claims that "Reverence cannot be expressed in a creed; its most apt expression is in music" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;123).  He gives the analogy of a quartet of varying skill levels playing a piece by [[Mozart]].  They embody reverence because: "(1) The musicians have been engaged, more or less harmoniously, on a project as a group; (2) their project involved ceremony; (3) they have felt themselves largely without ego; (4) they have felt themselves to be part of a clearly defined hierarchy that was painless for all of them; and (5) they have achieved in the end a shared feeling of inarticulate awe" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;48-49).  This coincides with his belief that "Art speaks the language of reverence better than philosophy does, and speak(s) it to the reverence that is already in the town" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;25).  By "in the town" Woodruff is referring to the recognition of reverence that is already present.

"In the presence of death we expect ourselves and others to be reverent; the expectation feels natural, and yet the ceremonies through which we express reverence at such times take very different forms in different cultures" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;50).  In his conversation on funerals as times of reverence he makes the point that reverence transcends faith and that it is constant throughout human history even when religions change (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;54.).  "You need not believe in God to be reverent, but to develop an occasion for reverence you must share a culture with others, and this must support a degree of ceremony" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;50).  Reverence is not dependent on religion, but true religious experience is dependent on the emotion reverence.

Paul Woodruff builds his case on reverence by analyzing the historical significance of reverence as a virtue.  In Ancient Greek and Chinese civilizations, "Both cultures celebrate reverence in the belief that it is reverence above all that maintains social order and harmony" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;60).  For the Greeks reverence was rooted in [[mythology]]. "[[Protagoras]] invented a myth in which the highest god gave reverence and justice to human beings as means for the survival of society" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;57).  This foundation was critical because "Emotions affect action; they are motivators" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;62).  Reverence in classical Greek society then motivated the populous to act rightly and be humble to improve society.  "We feel awe for what we believe is above us all as human beings, and this feeling helps us to avoid treating other human beings with contempt" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;63).

Woodruff uses the Greek heroes and Athenian tragedies to illustrate his conception of reverence.  He uses the story of [[Croesus]] by [[Herodotus]] to help shape an understanding of reverence that includes respect for those lower in hierarchical status.  "A reverent soul listens to other people even when they are inferior; that is a large part of remembering that you are human together with them" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;83).  He also illustrates reverence with the [[Iliad]], [[Antigone]], [[Pentheus]], [[Pericles]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Oedipus]], and the [[Odyssey]].  Through these figures he shows that reverence was quite significant in Greek culture.  In Oedipus, Woodruff asserts that, "[[Hubris]] is best understood simply as the opposite of reverence, in action or attitude" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;91).

After building his case with a look at classical Greek culture he looks at classical Chinese [[Confucian]] society.   "[[Filial piety]] expresses reverence within the family" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;103).  The most important part of his connection between reverence and the Chinese is his understanding of [[Li (Confucian)|li]].  "Li refers also to civility or reverence" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;105).  One interesting connection between Greek and Chinese societies is that, "Both conceptions of reverence blossom with the passing away of polytheism and the rise of agnosticism.  Reverence survives and flourishes in these circumstances because it is something that human beings need in order to face the most obvious, common, and inevitable facts of human life – [[family]], [[hierarchy]], and [[death]]" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;110).  Most of his information on reverence in Chinese culture derives from the [[Analects]]. Woodruff believes that a break in tradition is not necessarily irreverent and that [[relativism]] is flawed.  People should be critical of all cultures and forms of reverence (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;155).

=== Abraham Maslow ===

[[Abraham Maslow]] in his significant work, ''Religions, Values, and Peak-Experiences'', deals extensively with reverence.  Reverence is critical in having a peak-experience.  He makes the case that peak-experiences happen for the religious and non-religious alike and that they are critical to having a fulfilling life.  For Maslow the distinction between the secular and the profane is unfortunate.  Maslow points out that, "Religionizing only one part of life secularizes the rest of it".&lt;ref name="MAH"&gt;Maslow, A. H. (1964). Religions, values, and peak-experiences, . Columbus: Ohio State University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Maslow contends that religion seeks to make the emotion reverence possible through ritual, but that the familiarity of it often negates any reverent feelings.&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;  In defining peak-experiences Maslow states that, "Such emotions as wonder, awe, reverence, humility, surrender, and even worship before the greatness of the experience are often reported".&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;  Reverence therefore is a key ingredient in the peak-experiences that make life worth living and make mankind feel fully human.

=== Albert Schweitzer ===

[[Albert Schweitzer]], winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and holder of four PhD degrees, sought for years for the basis of a new worldview. One day, while in a boat on the river in Gabon, it struck him with great force and clarity: "Reverence for life" (In German: Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben).

== Empirical Studies ==

=== Reverence and Patient Recovery ===
Empirical studies on reverence are scarce.  However, one intriguing study on reverence is, "Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass," conducted by Ai ''et al.'' (2009).&lt;ref name="AAL et al."&gt;Ai, A. L., Wink, P., Tice, T. N., Bolling, S. F., &amp; Shearer, M. (2009). Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 32(6), 570-581. {{doi|10.1007/s10865-009-9228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These researchers looked at reverence following a coronary artery bypass.  Ai ''et al.'' (2009) examined a "sense of reverence in religious and secular contexts" by interviewing 177 patients.&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  Specifically they were investigating the faith-health relationship and seeking to find if religious forms of reverence practiced through faith and prayer yielded similar results to secular forms of reverence in patient recovery.  Ai ''et al.'' (2009)state that, "Because reverence includes an affective as well as a cognitive component, we see it as a form of positive feeling/emotion associated with injection of the sacred into various worldviews".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  These positive emotions were believed to help in patient recovery.  The first finding of Ai ''et al.'' (2009) was consistent with other research that found "Positive influences of traditional religious involvement on health outcomes".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  The second finding of Ai ''et al.'' (2009) was the "Positive effect of secular reverence on postoperative no-complication".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  From this Ai ''et al.'' (2009) inferred that, "The capacity to sense reverence in significant naturalistic, moralistic, and aesthetic contexts seems to enhance recovery following bypass".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  Strangely, "Religious reverence did not have the same beneficial effect as secular reverence on bypass recovery".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  This inconsistency suggests that more research needs to be done on reverence in patient recovery.

=== Awe ===
Keltner and Haidt’s extensive study on awe focuses on the importance of vastness and accommodation in experiencing awe.  "Vastness refers to anything that is experienced as being much larger that the self".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"&gt;Keltner, D., &amp; Haidt, J. (2003). Approaching awe, a moral, spiritual, and aesthetic emotion. Cognition and Emotion, 17(2), 297-314. {{doi|10.1080/02699930302297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accommodation refers to the "Process of adjusting mental structures that cannot assimilate a new experience".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"/&gt;  Their research on awe, which is a part of reverence, and how it is experienced through moral, spiritual, and aesthetic means, sheds light on the greater understanding of reverence.  Their study also consists of a comprehensive summary on what has been "Written about awe in religion, philosophy, sociology, and psychology" and their own addition of "Related states such as admiration, elevation, and the epiphanic experience".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"/&gt;

Haidt (2000) &lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2000). The positive emotion of elevation. Prevention and Treatment, 3 Article 3. p 287. Available online at: http://journals.apa.org/prevention/volume3/pre0030003c.html&lt;/ref&gt; notes that since Maslow (1964) &lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt; studied the changes that [[actualizing]] experiences can bring about in people's identities and in their [[moral]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] lives, little [[empirical research]] has been done to examine the peak experiences and moral transformations associated with positive moral emotions such as [[gratitude]], [[elevation]], [[awe]], admiration, and reverence.  Haidt’s own work in these areas suggests that potent feelings of reverence may be associated with the peak experiences accompanying moral transformations, where, "Powerful moments of elevation sometimes seem to push a mental ‘reset button,’ wiping out feelings of [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] and replacing them with feelings of [[hope]], [[love]], and [[optimism]], and a sense of moral inspiration." &lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2000), p 287&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art and Mortality ===
Great artists in the creation of their art sometimes give concrete form to the culturally derived [[beliefs]], [[values]], and group identities that provide meaning and purpose to [[existence]]. Moreover, reverence for artwork that instantiates these central aspects of [[culture]] can provide a means of buffering the [[existential]] [[anxiety]] that follows from reminders of the inevitability of human mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, M. J., Sullivan, D., &amp; Solomon, S. (2010) On graves and graven images: A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of art. European Review of Social psychology, 21, 114-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Across history, cultures have revered art as a "forum for representing in an enduring medium those individuals who are held up as embodiments of [[virtue]] and lasting significance." &lt;ref&gt;Landau et al. (2010), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transpersonal Reverence ===
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer in, "A Place for the Aesthetic in Experiential Personal Construct Psychology," look at reverence through the lens of experiential personal construct psychology (EPCP).   Leitner &amp; Pfenninger, in 1994, theorized this form of psychology in "Sociality and optimal functioning."  Under this umbrella of psychology, "Reverence felt in meaningful interpersonal connectedness is one starting point for the development of a larger sense of connection with the world and the many others (human and nonhuman) in it".&lt;ref name="TJC &amp; SMW"&gt;Thomas, J. C., &amp; Schlutsmeyer, M. W. (2004). A place for the aesthetic in experiential personal construct psychology. Journal of Constructivist Psychology, 17(4), 313-335. {{doi|10.1080/10720530490483239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is referred to as transpersonal reverence.
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer make the case for reverence in therapy: "In EPCP, reverence, as we stated earlier, is a goal of therapy, a sign of optimal functioning".&lt;ref name="TJC &amp; SMW"/&gt;  The therapist must revere the patient and the patient must learn to revere others and themselves in order for the therapy to be effective.

[[Image:roberto busa e index thomisticus.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Roberto Busa - 2006 - In the background the Index Thomisticus]]

==Biography==
Born in [[Vicenza]], the second of five children, he attended primary school in [[Bolzano]] and grammar school in [[Verona]] and in [[Belluno]]. In 1928 he entered the Episcopal Seminary of Belluno, completing high school there, and took the first two-year course of Theology with Albino Luciani, the future [[Pope John Paul I]]. In 1933 he joined the [[Society of Jesus]], where he got a diploma in Philosophy in 1937 and one in Theology in 1941 and where he was ordained priest in 1940. From 1940 till 1943 he was an auxiliary army chaplain in the National Army and later in the partisan forces. In 1946 he graduated in Philosophy at the Papal Gregorian University of Rome with a degree thesis entitled "The Thomistic Terminology of Interiority", which was published in 1949. He was full professor of [[Ontology]], [[Theodicy]] and [[Scientific methodology|Scientific Methodology]] and, for some years, a librarian in the "Aloisianum" Faculty of Philosophy of [[Gallarate]].

==The ''Index Thomisticus''==
In 1946 he planned the ''Index Thomisticus'', as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. In 1949 he met with [[Thomas J. Watson]], the founder of [[IBM]], and was able to persuade him to sponsor the ''Index Thomisticus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project lasted about 30 years, and eventually produced in the 1970s the 56 printed volumes of the ''Index Thomisticus''. In 1989, a CD-ROM version was produced. In addition, in 2005 a [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age web-based version] made its debut, sponsored by the Fundación Tomás de Aquino and CAEL; the design and programming of this version were carried about by E. Alarcón and E. Bernot, in collaboration with Busa. In 2006 the [http://itreebank.marginalia.it ''Index Thomisticus'' Treebank] project (directed by Marco Passarotti) started the syntactic annotation of the entire corpus.

==The Busa Prize==
The [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) awards the "Busa Prize", which honors leaders in the field of [[digital humanities|humanities computing]]. The
first Busa Prize was awarded in 1998 to Busa himself. Later winners include:

==Recent projects==
Before his death, Busa had been teaching at the Papal [[Gregorian University]] in Rome, at the "Aloisianum" Faculty of Philosophy in [[Gallarate]], and at the Catholic Sacred Heart University in [[Milan]]. He was also working at the LTB project (LTB stands for Bicultural Thomistic Lexicon), which aims at understanding the Latin concepts used by Thomas Aquinas in the terms of contemporary culture.

Non-religious '''secular music''' and sacred music were the two main genres of [[Western world|Western]] music during the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance era]]. The oldest written secular music are songs with Latin lyrics.&lt;ref name="g60"&gt;Grout, 1996, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many secular songs were sung in the [[vernacular language]], unlike the sacred songs that followed the Latin language of the [[Christian Church|Church]].  These earliest types were known as the [[chanson de geste]] (song of deeds) and were popular amongst the traveling jongleurs and [[minstrel]]s of the time.&lt;ref name="g61"&gt;Grout, 1996, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest collection of secular music from this period comes from poems of celebration and [[chivalry]] of the [[troubadour]]s from the south of France. These poems contain clever rhyme-schemes, varied use of refrain-lines or words, and different [[Metre (music)|metric]] patterns. The minstrels of this time were not themselves poets or composers. Instead they adapted the compositions of others to sing, play, and dance to in their own unique versions.&lt;ref name="g61"/&gt;  Other styles included love songs, [[political satire]], dances, chansons, and dramatic works.

According to Grout’s A History of Western Music (1996), common musical instruments of this time period included: [[harp]]s, imported to continental Europe from Ireland and Britain sometime before the ninth century; Vielle, a prototype of the Renaissance viol and modern viola with five strings, one of which was a drone, popular amongst the jongleurs to accompany their singing and recitations; Organistrum, a three-stringed instrument similar to the vielle but played by the turning of a crank, with strings ‘stopped by a set rods instead of the player’s fingers); and Psaltery, a type of zither played by plucking or ‘striking’ the strings, which frequently appears in medieval art. The most common wind instruments included both recorder and transverse style flutes; the reeded Shawms, a precursor to the oboe; trumpets and [[Bagpipes]].&lt;ref&gt;Grout, 1996, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;
    
[[Drum]]s, [[harp]]s, [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s, and [[bagpipes]] were the [[Musical instrument|instruments]] of choice when performing secular music due to ease of transportation.  Jongleurs and minstrels learned their trade through oral tradition.

[[Composers]] like [[Josquin des Prez]] wrote sacred and secular music. He composed 86 highly successful secular works and 119 sacred pieces. Secular music also was aided by the formation of [[literature]] during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] that included a collection of secular and semi-secular songs.  Guillaume de Machaut was another example of a leading composer who continued the trouvere tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Grout, 1996, p. 106/107&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surveillance Art''' is the use of technology intended to record human behavior in a way that offers commentary on the process of [[surveillance]] or the technology used to surveil.  Surveillance Art manifests itself in many different forms, from short films to architecture, but all have been shown to provide some type of critical response to the rise of surveillance by various authorities and the technology used to achieve it, especially when dealing with issues of security and enforcing laws.

==History==
With new technology, came new surveillance and new ways of responding to it through artistic media. With the advent of video-recording devices, closed circuit television, and digital cameras, remote surveillance of subjects became possible. One of the most popular figures to adapt these new methods of surveillance to art was [[Andy Warhol]].

Warhol’s movie, ''Outer and Inner Space'', introduced the performance-art possibilities of high-tech surveillance to the modern world. At the same time, it provided the observed subject with the image or knowledge of being observed, in this case the actress [[Edie Sedgwick]]. "On the left, Sedgwick's video image, in full profile, gazes off to the right, looking up as if she were talking to someone standing above her. On the right, the 'real' (or 'live') Edie sits in three-quarter profile facing left, addressing someone sitting off-screen to the left of Warhol's movie camera -- an arrangement which at times creates the illusion that we are watching Sedgwick in conversation with her own image."&lt;ref&gt;Angell, Callie. "Andy Warhol. Outer and Inner Space.." CNTRL[SPACE]. hosting.zkm.de/ctrlspace/e/texts/56 (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late twentieth century, the AIDS epidemic, cancer rates, and other health concerns created a new form of surveillance. Suddenly, the condition of the human body and potential for contagion became an addition to existing systems of observation.

"The ‘my body, my business’ ideal in the clinical setting dovetailed with broader societal concerns about snoops, spies, and surveillance, setting the stage for a fundamental recasting of the politics of surveillance in the last decades of the twentieth century. The encounter over HIV represented the high water mark of patient participation in the politics of surveillance. "&lt;ref&gt;"H-Net Announcement." Humanities and Social Sciences Net Online. www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=150810  (accessed April 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post Modern===

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 sparked a new wave of American surveillance of the citizen body. This was primarily a form of electronic information gathering—monitoring of phones and email, Internet use, tracking and tracing of cell phones and GPS units. In certain instances, the detaining and/or monitoring of U.S. citizens of various ethnicities compounded the already growing debate on the violation of civil liberties. In July 2006, Ms. [[Mary DeRosa]], a Senior Fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, testified at a congressional hearing on the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]. At this point, different organizations within the United States government had been applying separate acts to monitor perceived threats of foreign agents, sometimes at cross-purposes and with varying degrees of rights violation.

DeRosa stated: "The national security agencies and their employees are charged with protecting the United States from harm. When faced with a decision about whether to take a step that invades liberties they will not always be able to judge whether it is the only way or the best way to address a problem -- or whether it is simply the easiest way."&lt;ref&gt;"Statement of Mary B. DeRosa on FISA for the 21st Century." FAS Intelligence Resource Program. www.fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/072606derosa.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

As homeland security issues forced questions of the infringement of civil liberties, the response of various practitioners of surveillance art questioned the notion of privacy. In one of the most notorious cases, the price of innocence and freedom seems to be the willing sacrifice of one’s personal privacy.

The case of [[Hasan Elahi]] has also addressed new technologies in surveillance: tracking and tracing of cell phones, the capabilities of [[GPS]] technology, and worldwide Internet access by both the observer and the observed. The relationship between the watcher and the body watched becomes an impetus to the artwork itself.

Elahi has stated of his art: "Both quantitative and qualitative information is incorporated into my work, and the entire process results in translations and mistranslations between the physical and the virtual, between the body politic and the singular citizen. The mutual misunderstandings that inevitably occur provide the inertial energy for the continuing activity and effectiveness of the work."&lt;ref&gt;Elahi, Hasan. "Hasan Elahi." Hasan Elahi. http://elahi.sjsu.edu/ (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Futurist===

The latest evolution of response to surveillance systems is to become the system. New forms of [[biometric]] surveillance—such as heart rate monitors, and facial recognition software—are being utilized for personalized experiences and amusement park rides.&lt;ref&gt;Pohflep, Sascha. "Biometric." We Make Money not Art.  http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/biometric/ (accessed April 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond biometrics is the integration of cybernetic technology into Surveillance Art. The Canadian filmmaker, Robert Spence, has adapted a miniature camera into his prosthetic eye. In an odd reversal, Spence has finally come full circle with the concept of Surveillance Art: ‘"Originally the whole idea was to do a documentary about surveillance. I thought I would become a sort of super hero … fighting for justice against surveillance," Spence said. "In Toronto there are 12,000 cameras. But the strange thing I discovered was that people don’t care about the surveillance cameras, they were more concerned about me and my secret camera eye because they feel that is a worse invasion of their privacy."&lt;ref&gt;Klint, Finley. "Surveillance." Renegade Futurist.  http://renegadefuturist.com/archives/category/surveillance/ (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularized Areas==

===Performance===

On May 3, 2008, artists Robin Hewlett and Ben Kinsley staged a simulated street scene in a Pittsburgh neighborhood when the [[Google Street View]] team came through. They named the project "Street with a View" which they describe as introducing "fiction, both subtle and spectacular, into the doppelganger world of Google Street View." Using an array of local residents and actors, scenes included a marathon, a parade, a garage band practice, firemen rescuing a cat, and a sword fight. This was the first time that Google Street View had been used as a means of art, specifically, as surveillance art.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, Robin, and Ben Kinsley. "STREET WITH A VIEW: a project by Robin Hewlett &amp; Ben Kinsley." STREET WITH A VIEW: a project by Robin Hewlett &amp; Ben Kinsley. http://www.streetwithaview.com/index.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surveillance Camera Players (SCP), based in New York City and founded by Bill Brown, are one of the main innovators of this art form. This group of actors stages various plays in public spaces, their first one being [[Alfred Jarry]]’s "[[Ubu Roi]]" on December 10, 1996 at the 14th Street-Union Square Subway station. They have performed other famous works such as [[Samuel Beckett]]’s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]’s ''[[The Raven]]'', [[George Orwell]]’s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|"1984"]] and ''[[Animal Farm]]''. Their plays are staged in very public places such as subway stations, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Washington Square Park, Union Square, and various other landmarks throughout the city. Their primary purpose is to create a public spectacle in order to get people to question the role surveillance plays in their lives. These performances may be witnessed by the public, yet the actual recordings of these performances remain inaccessible. The SCP is said to have been inspired by the anti-surveillance manifesto, "Guerilla Programming of Surveillance Equipment," but state that they were not the first to stage surveillance camera theater.&lt;ref&gt;"Setting the Stage for the Surveillance Camera Players." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/gpvse.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; They state that it was the invention of comedy writers:

Properly speaking, surveillance camera theater was invented by a comedy writer, not a privacy advocate or a performance artist: i.e., the person(s) who in 1981 wrote the "On the Job" episode of the American TV sit-com ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', in which Alex Reiger (played by [[Judd Hirsch]]) temporarily gets a job as a camera-watching security guard. Bored by the isolation and silence, Alex eventually learns to pass the time by improvising skits in front of the surveillance camera and watching himself on the monitor at the same time. When Alex's shift is over, he is replaced by a veteran of the place (played by "Grampa" [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]]), who pulls out a ventriloquist's dummy and starts performing in front of the surveillance camera as soon as his shift begins! The implication was that every security guard—when no one (else) was looking—was passing the time in this way. On October 12, 1992, [[Saturday Night Live]] included a skit that imagined that during the night, when everyone else had gone home, the people who worked at Rockefeller Center would amuse themselves and each other by putting on little skits in front of the building's surveillance cameras. As in Taxi, none of these skits had any political content and none of them concerned privacy rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Before the Formation of the Surveillance Camera Players." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/scp-antecedents.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCP has a wide following around the world and has even spawned sister groups in Arizona, California, Italy, Lithuania, Sweden, and Turkey suggesting how the issue of surveillance is one which transcends nationalities and cultures, bringing people together to make one synonymous public statement.&lt;ref&gt;"Surveillance Camera Players." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/the-scp.html (accessed April 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural===

Some surveillance artists choose to use architecture as canvases. The buildings and structures they use are in highly visible areas with lots of pedestrians. The artists install a surveillance system that tracks human movement through and/or around the structure. The system is connected to a viewing format, such as a large screen or light installation, which are triggered by human movement. As one artist describes it, "All the visual elements in the projection result from people’s movements through the space."&lt;ref&gt;Abundance. "Camille Utterback." Camille Utterback :: interactive video art.http://www.CamilleUtterback.com/abundance.html (accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance art elicits interaction from viewers while making them more aware of the pervasiveness of surveillance.

Some architectural surveillance art pieces involve large screen installations or projections on highly visible buildings in populated areas. Artist [[Christian Moeller]]’s 2006 project, "Nosy," includes a street-level camera which records the active surrounding environment, including pedestrians, cars, and a nearby train in Osaki City, Japan. The real-time video is "displayed in bitmap graphics [and projected] onto three towers covered with white LEDs behind frosted glass panels."&lt;ref&gt;"A TIME AND PLACE - Christian Moeller." A TIME AND PLACE - Christian Moeller. http://www.christian-moeller.com/display.php?project_id=59&amp;play=true (accessed March 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Nosy.jpeg|Christian Moeller's Mojo utilizes a street-level camera to record the active surrounding environment in Osaki City, Japan. --&gt;

Artist [[Camille Utterback]] created a similar installation in 2007, called "Abundance," using the domed city hall of San Jose, California, as her interactive canvas. The installation includes a large surveillance camera focused on pedestrians and an abstract art animation, projected onto the city hall building. Pedestrians’ location and movement within the field of the camera are translated into abstract shapes that appear in the projection. As the pedestrian moves, the corresponding shape moves within the animation and interacts with other shapes in the projection. Utterback’s website states, "Movements and paths through the plaza become part of a collective visual record, and transform the building into a playful and dynamic canvas."&lt;ref&gt;Abundance. "Camille Utterback." Camille Utterback :: interactive video art. http://www.CamilleUtterback.com/abundance.html (accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Abundance.jpg|Camille Utterback's Abundance uses San Jose's city hall as an interactive canvas. --&gt;

The Los Angeles-based artist team, Electroland, has been dedicated to working on interactive art projects.&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Connection." Electroland –Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/connection (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their projects are architectural surveillance art through the use of light installations or electronic displays. One of their architectural installations, "Enteractive," uses both the inside and outside of a building in Los Angeles. This project, finished in 2006, involves tracking indoor participants’ movements and locations over a large floor light grid. Outside, their real-time locations and movement patterns are broadcast to anyone within view of the colored light grid installed onto the face of the building.&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Connection." Electroland –Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/connection (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Enteractive.png |The outside of Electroland's Enteractive at 11th and Flower. --&gt;

Another of Electroland’s projects was incorporated into the Pedestrian Bridge of the Indianapolis Airport in 2008. The project, named "Connection," is made up of light "dots" that cover the length of the bridge, which light up in different colors as people pass through. The colored dots follow people’s movements and often interact with participants, "exhibit[ing] a range of intelligent and playful behaviors, accompanied by sounds."&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - EnterActive." Electroland –Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/enteractive (accessed March 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Electroland has similar projects, including Target Breezeway, Lumen, and Drive By.&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Lumen." Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/projects/lumen (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley - Target Breezeway." Electroland -Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley. http://electroland.net/projects/targetbreezeway (accessed April 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley ." Electroland - Cameron McNall and Damon Seeley . http://electroland.net/about/ (accessed March 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Connection Bridge.png|Electroland's Connection on the Indianapolis Airport's Pedestrian Bridge. The lights change colors as pedestrians pass through the bridge. --&gt;

The French art team, Hehe, also works with architectural surveillance art but they prefer to take a "green" approach. Like Electroland, they have also done light installations, like their 2007 project in Luxembourg, "Grandes Lignes." This project includes light installations along a pedestrian footbridge that only light up where a pedestrian is located. Hehe describes the selective lighting as "the personal light sphere, which surrounds the traveler as they move from one end to the other." Hehe explains the intent behind the project: "The responsiveness of the system functions ecologically and economically – saving energy – and also metaphorically: Your shadow – of light – walks with you and follows you."&lt;ref&gt;"Grandes Lignes." HeHe. http://hehe.org.free.fr/hehe/grandeslignes/index.html(accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hehe has also started a set of projects under the title, "Pollstream," all of which are environmentally-focused. Of these, Nuage Vert, or "green cloud" in English, is architectural surveillance art. The 2008 project uses a thermo-sensitive camera and a laser with a green, cloud-shaped beam. Installed on a nearby building, the beam is projected onto the stream of pollution from a power plant in Helsinki, as a constant reminder to residents of their energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuage Vert." HeHe. http://hehe.org.free.fr/hehe/texte/nv/index.html (accessed March 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Hehe’s focus in this project moves from direct surveillance of people to the surveillance of their factories and plants. Here, humans are being indirectly watched through what they produce, like air pollution. This is potentially the beginning of a move into air surveillance art.

===Inverse Surveillance/Sousveillance===

Inverse surveillance, or "[[sousveillance]]", makes use of surveillance technology such as cameras from the perspective of the participant, allowing the object of surveillance essentially to become the subject.  The term sousveillance was coined by [[Steve Mann]], a noted media artist.

Typical instances of sousveillance as art involve voluntarily recording and broadcasting one’s own activities (via webcam, for example).  The expressed purpose for this, in some cases, is to take away the value of the knowledge of the artist’s whereabouts and current activity. [[Hasan Elahi]], an interdisciplinary media artist who was falsely suspected of terrorism and detained by government authorities, has said that the goal of broadcasting his daily life is to devalue information about him since "Intelligence agencies, regardless of who they are, all operate in a market where their commodity is information, and the reason their information has value is because no one else has access to it."&lt;ref&gt;Hasan Elahi, Interview with Stephen Colbert.  http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/167606/may-07-2008/hasan-elahi (accessed 23 Apr. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by increasing access to the information, he is taking away the surveilling authority’s monopoly on it.

==Critical Responses==

The Surveillance Studies Network is an organization that focuses on surveillance and its various effects on society, and their online journal, ''Surveillance and Society'', publishes academic articles that present different aspects of surveillance.  In 2005, ''Surveillance and Society''’s second issue of the year featured two articles that included surveillance as an art form.

''The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment'' by Anders Albrechtslund and Lynsey Dubbeld takes an in depth look at surveillance and the roles it plays in art and popular culture.  Although Albrechtslund and Dubbeld focus on the entertainment factor of Surveillance Art, they also acknowledge its serious explorations and implications.  While Surveillance Art is entertainment, the artists "tend to focus on controversial aspects of surveillance practices or revealing the operation of surveillance technologies."  To illustrate this point, Albrechtslund and Dubbeld specifically referenced installation artist [[David Rokeby]].  "For instance, like several of Rokeby’s other works, ‘Sorting Daemon’ was concerned with revealing the powers of vision and surveillance, and bringing to the fore the discriminatory, judgmental classifications that computers are increasingly producing as they take over human tasks of observation and monitoring."&lt;ref&gt;Albrechtslund, Anders, and Lynsey Dubbeld. "The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/entertainment.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is observed that although surveillance has been prominent in art and other forms of entertainment, it hasn’t been studied in depth by Surveillance Studies scholars.  Albrechtslund and Dubbeld see a need for further exploration of this area of surveillance.  Surveillance as a form of entertainment isn’t paid as much attention as it deserves because it truly is a diverse field that is continuously developing.  "The entertaining side of surveillance is a phenomenon worth studying in itself, and we expect that this type of study will contribute to an understanding of the multi-faceted nature of surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;Albrechtslund, Anders, and Lynsey Dubbeld. "The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/entertainment.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In article, "Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces," Robert W. Sweeny, an art educator at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, questioned surveillance technologies and the role that visual arts plays with those technologies.  He then raised the question of how one would handle acknowledging surveillance technologies in the classroom.  He is a firm believer that "Those involved with the visual arts might learn much from studies regarding current surveillance technologies, going beyond the boundaries of traditional research methodologies, informing practices that interrogate the dynamics of power and vision in art educational settings."&lt;ref&gt;Sweeny, Robert W. "Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/parasights.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching at The Pennsylvania State University, Sweeny used one project in particular to encourage his students to reveal "the power of the gaze" by exploring how surveillance brings about other ways of "seeing:"
&lt;blockquote&gt;
These students chose the museum as a space that is based in looking and the ‘male gaze’, influenced by our readings of the course text, ''Ways of Seeing'' (Berger, 1972). Doubling the gaze of the surveillance camera through hand held video, then recording the individual recording the camera, they created a layered experience that lead to confusion. Through a tight editing process, they constantly reminded the viewer of the position of the camera operator (and the apparent laxness of the security guard) through the rapidly shifting camera shots. The images begin to break up as filmed image was filmed, layered with music that approached noise, only to return to a calm denouement, backing out of the doors that introduced the walking protagonist into a panoptic hall of mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeny, Robert W. "Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces." Surveillance and Society 3 (2005), http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3(2)/parasights.pdf. (accessed February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this project, the students not only created Surveillance Art, but by becoming the watchers, or what Sweeny would call the parasite, they were able to see beyond the environment that the museum created with its own surveillance cameras.

In his essays, interactive artist David Rokeby writes about the control and subjectivity that is created by artists who use technologies such as cameras:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The expressive power of the interface, in conjunction with the increasing 'apparent' transparency of interface technologies raises complicated ethical issues regarding subjectivity and control.  Interactive artists are in a position to take the lead in generating a discussion of these concerns, but, on the other hand, are also in danger of becoming apologists for industrial, corporate, and institutional uses of these technologies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rokeby has also written an essay for students who wish to create interactive art and he goes on to explain his perspective on the pieces he creates.&lt;ref&gt;Rokeby, David. "Transforming Mirrors: Subjectivity and Control in Interactive Media." David Rokeby - Media Installation Artist. http://homepage.mac.com/davidrokeby/mirrors.html. (accessed February 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surveillance Camera Players have been the inspiration for others who have gone on to create artistic project that involve some form of surveillance, however, they say that although they are flattered that they inspire others, they’re rarely impressed by the work that is created.  Their complaint is that in the videos that are created, the artists usually end up promoting "several of the primary ideological supports for generalized surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;Surveillance Camera Players. "Biting the Hands that Applaud Us." NOT BORED!. http://www.notbored.org/the-scp.html. (accessed April 1, 2009)..&lt;/ref&gt; These works of art fail to connect their audiences to the everyday people who are being watched.

==Legalities==

Legally, police officials consider Surveillance Art as an extraordinary method of keeping people safe. According to police officials in State College, Pennsylvania, surveillance is divided into three major concepts "national, mechanical, and perceived; all of which have transformed from legally used terms into art."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

National Surveillance is government-based surveillance that aids police officers as well as the community. As far as aiding the community with national surveillance, "all police vehicles are equipped with a hidden GPS locater that has the ability to transmit the position of a police vehicle anywhere in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For the community, National Surveillance means that a police official’s vehicle is heavily monitored at all times, causing him to be reprimanded if not at the location reported. From a governmental perspective, National Surveillance is essential for aiding police officials in investigations or simply identifying criminals. The [[Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (IAFIS) allows police officials to "fingerprint and receive information on anyone who has ever been fingerprinted in only fifteen to twenty minutes."&lt;ref&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation. "Integrated Automated Fingerprint System." 13 March 2008. &lt;http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/iafis.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  With the information gathered from an interview with a State College, Pennsylvania police officer, it is clear that National Surveillance has generated a type of "system balance" (between the government and the community) whose purpose with advancements in surveillance technology is to portray "truth."

Mechanical surveillance, although sharing similarities with National Surveillance, plays a somewhat different role in surveillance as an art form.  During the interview with the State College police officer, it was noted that "the camera in a police vehicle begins recording as soon as its emergency lights are switched on whether the vehicle is stopped or in motion."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of mechanical surveillance plays a huge role in police investigation along with helping create surveillance art. With Internet sites like YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace, people have the ability to create and share any type of video feed that interests them. As an example, the anonymous State College police officer referred to the riots at Penn State University after Penn State beat Ohio State University during the 2008-2009-football season. Several videos were posted on YouTube depicting celebratory acts that quickly transitioned into destructive malicious behavior. First, State College Police referred to these posted videos as police evidence in which they were able to apprehend and fine individuals involved in the riots. On the other hand, however, there are several videos of the riots in which inspirational music was added to portray "Penn State Pride" rather than committing an illegal act. Adding music to these types of videos transforms mechanical surveillance into Surveillance Art by creating an emotional attachment for the individuals who can relate to what the video visually portrays.

Perceived surveillance is a concept of Surveillance Art that is purely territorial and usually created by individuals involved with that particular community. Using State College, Pennsylvania as an example, an anonymous police officer stated that he believes Surveillance Art "creates a presence in the community that lowers the likelihood of crime, portraying a sense of ownership." With the advancement of technology in today’s society, it has become apparent that it is relatively easier for individuals to create "Perceived Surveillance Art." The interesting aspect of Perceived Surveillance Art is the fact that it can be anything. Examples of Perceived Surveillance Art can range from a mural on the side of a building to a simple statue of the baby Jesus in the front yard of an individual's home.

"With these created websites, YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace, it has become relatively easy for individuals to post and spread Surveillance Art throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. Pennsylvania State University. 19 February 2009. &lt;http://www.police.psu.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, there are highly controversial videos (Rodney King beating and the shooting death of Oscar Grant by police officers) placed on these sites that have been edited to portray a specific individuals perception of that specific event or a different perspective on how that event should possibly be taken. When asking the State College police officer about how these sites affect police investigations, he stated that they "have no bearing on anything having to do with police work."&lt;ref&gt;Police Officer Interview. State College, Pennsylvania. 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the new interpretations presented by the videos on these sites are welcomed by some police officers that like the idea and believe in Surveillance Art.

While discussing surveillance as an art form with a New York City bus driver, it was found to be "impossible for an individual to travel more than three blocks anywhere in New York without being on camera."&lt;ref&gt;Bus Driver Interview. Brooklyn, New York. 13 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When considering the three forms of surveillance (national, mechanical, and perceived) as art forms, it is clear that our society has evolved into a technically dependent era in which even the most reliable footage (unedited surveillance footage) can become art by simply transforming or even editing raw footage (adding music, or text) creating new material, resulting in Surveillance Art. Although the amount of surveillance in State College, Pennsylvania may not be as high as the amount of surveillance in New York City, it is interesting and notable that surveillance as an art form exists everywhere.

==Notable Examples==

These examples are representative of Surveillance Art's methods and effects. Although they use different technologies and tactics, they are united by an interest in the increasing prevalence of surveillance in modern society, and its effects on citizens and communities.

'''''The Perfect Storm''''' is a 2000 American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[Disaster film|disaster]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and based on the 1997 [[non-fiction]] [[The Perfect Storm (book)|book of the same name]] by [[Sebastian Junger]]. The film tells the story of the ''[[Andrea Gail]]'', a commercial fishing vessel that was lost at sea with all hands after being caught in the [[1991 Perfect Storm|Perfect Storm of 1991]]. The film stars [[George Clooney]], [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Michael Ironside]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Diane Lane]], [[Karen Allen]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]].&lt;ref name="reelviews"&gt;Berardinelli, James, [http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/p/perfect_storm.html The Perfect Storm Film Review] – reelviews.net, 2000 (Retrieved on 2007-01-25)&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on June 30, 2000, by [[Warner Bros.]]

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Perfect Storm1.jpg|left|frame]] --&gt;
In October 1991, the commercial fishing boat ''[[Andrea Gail]]'' returns to port in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]], with a poor catch. Desperate for money, Captain Billy Tyne ([[George Clooney|Clooney]]) convinces the ''Andrea Gail'' crew to join him for one more late season fishing expedition. The crew heads out past their usual fishing grounds on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], leaving a developing [[tropical storm]] behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the [[Flemish Cap]], where their luck greatly improves. At the height of their fishing, the ice machine breaks; the only way to sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. After debating whether to sail through the building storm or to wait it out, the crew decides to risk the storm. However, between ''Andrea Gail'' and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a [[Hurricane Grace|hurricane]], which the ''Andrea Gail'' crew underestimates.

After repeated warnings from other ships, ''Andrea Gail'' loses her antenna, forcing Captain [[Linda Greenlaw]] ([[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio|Mastrantonio]]) of sister ship ''Hannah Boden'' to call in a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]]. A [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk]] rescue helicopter responds, but after failing to perform a midair refueling with an [[HC-130 Hercules]], the helicopter crew ditch their aircraft. All but one of the [[Air National Guard]] crew members are rescued by a [[USCG Medium Endurance Cutter#Reliance class cutters|Coast Guard vessel]], the [[USCGC Tamaroa (WMEC-166)|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']].

After ''Andrea Gail'' endures various problems, the crew struggles to sail through pounding waves and shrieking winds, while friends and family worry and wait for a ship that never comes home. The vessel encounters an enormous [[rogue wave]]. They attempt to drive the boat over the wave but it crests before it can get to the top and is overturned; Billy elects to [[The captain goes down with the ship|go down with his ship]], the rest of the crew are trapped inside and only one, rookie fisherman Bobby Shatford ([[Mark Wahlberg|Wahlberg]]), manages to get out. He surfaces and watches as ''Andrea Gail'' rights herself before sinking stern-first into the Atlantic. As Bobby silently says his goodbyes to his loved ones, the rapidly rising swell carries him away.

There are no survivors; Linda reads the eulogy at the memorial, followed by her remembering Billy's voice soliloquising about what it means to be a swordboat captain.

==Cast==
*[[George Clooney]] as Frank William "Billy" Tyne, Jr., captain of ''[[Andrea Gail]]'', a swordfishing boat. Billy is a divorced father of two daughters, who is determined to undertake one last fishing trip before the end of the season to make up for a recent string of poor catches.
*[[Mark Wahlberg]] as Robert "Bobby" Shatford, the least experienced of the crew of ''Andrea Gail''. Bobby is the son of Ethel Shatford, the owner of the Crow's Nest, and boyfriend to Chris Cotter. He enjoys commercial fishing, but his deepening relationship with Chris (coupled with her reluctance to let him sail again) creates conflict within himself and between the couple. Yet, he is compelled by the potential to earn more money at sea than he could make with a job on shore to sign on for one last trip.
*[[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as [[Linda Greenlaw]], the captain of ''Hannah Boden''. Linda and Billy both captain ships for the same owner and maintain a friendly rivalry. She is concerned about Billy and his crew's going out in what she considers dangerous weather. Linda is the last to speak to ''Andrea Gail''.
*[[Diane Lane]] as Christina "Chris" Cotter, girlfriend of Bobby Shatford. She does not want Bobby to go on the trip because of a bad feeling she has about it. She spends her time during the last fishing trip decorating an apartment she has rented as a surprise for Bobby to symbolize her commitment to him. 
*[[John C. Reilly]] as Dale "Murph" Murphy, crewmember on ''Andrea Gail''. Murph is a veteran fisherman who is divorced with a son with whom he's very involved. Murph has a rocky relationship with crewmember David "Sully" Sullivan that is eventually resolved during the trip.
*[[William Fichtner]] as David "Sully" Sullivan, crewmember on ''Andrea Gail''. He signed on for the trip at the last minute when another fisherman suddenly backed out. Sully and Murph initially have an antagonistic relationship that is fueled in part by Sully's past involvement with Murph's ex-wife, although the details are not made clear in the film. The relationship is eventually resolved during the trip.
*[[Michael Ironside]] as Bob Brown, owner of ''Andrea Gail'' and ''Hannah Boden''. Although Brown seems to harbor a deep-seated recognition of Tyne's skills at catching fish, he nevertheless pressures Tyne over the latter's recent inability to bring in larger hauls, resulting in an uneasy relationship between the two.
*[[Bob Gunton]] as Alexander McAnally III, owner of ''Mistral'', a yacht caught in the storm.
*[[Karen Allen]] as Melissa Brown, crewmember on ''Mistral''.
*[[Cherry Jones]] as Edie Bailey, crewmember on ''Mistral''.
*[[Allen Payne]] as Alfred Pierre, one of the crew of ''Andrea Gail''.
*[[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Michael "Bugsy" Moran, a member of ''Andrea Gail'''s crew. Bugsy's somewhat comic inability to connect with women appears to change on the eve of the trip, when he meets a divorced mother at the Crow's Nest, who later comes to the dock to see him off. They hint at the prospect of a budding relationship that fatefully never materializes.
*[[Janet Wright]] as Ethel Shatford, Bobby's mother.
* [[Christopher McDonald]] as [[Todd Gross]], a Boston [[Meteorology|meteorologist]] working for the WNEV-TV (the present day [[WHDH-TV]]).
*[[Dash Mihok]] as Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell, a crewmember on the [[New York Air National Guard]] rescue helicopter.

== Historical accuracy ==
===The Andrea Gail===
[[File:Hurricane Grace (1991).JPG|thumb|left|Hurricane Grace on October 28, 1991, when the Andrea Gail went missing.]]

A ship similar to ''Andrea Gail'', ''Lady Grace'', was used during the filming of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warnerbros.com/studio/news/“-perfect-storm’s”-“andrea-gail”-comes-home-massachusetts|title=''The Perfect Storm's'' ''Andrea Gail'' Comes Home to Massachusetts|publisher=Warner Bros.|date=July 14, 2000|accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Candus Thomson| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-06-23/features/0006230001_1_andrea-gail-lady-grace-perfect-storm |title=Ocean City boat sails off to stardom |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=June 23, 2000|accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the names used were not changed for the fictional film, but in response two [[The Perfect Storm (film)#Lawsuits|lawsuits]] were later filed by certain families of the crew members. The film only claims to be "based on a true story", and differs in many ways from the [[The Perfect Storm (book)|book]] starting with the fictionalization of the material into a "story". The events shown in the film after the Andrea Gail's last radio contact are pure speculation, as the boat and the bodies of the crew were never found.

Contrary to the movie's storyline, Captain Linda Greenlaw says she did not place a distress call on behalf of ''Andrea Gail''. "Without a distress call (directly) from the imperiled vessel, the [[U.S. Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] will not initiate a search until the vessel is five days overdue in port," Greenlaw said. The 1993 U.S. Coast Guard's investigative report said that ''Andrea Gail'' was experiencing 30-foot waves and winds from anywhere from 50 to 80 knots &lt;small&gt;(58 - 92 MPH)&lt;/small&gt; around the time of the last communication. The conditions, though threatening, were probably not unfamiliar to Tyne, who had been a successful fisherman for about a decade on other vessels, taking trips to the Grand Banks and fishing off Florida, the Carolinas, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="GAIL"&gt;[http://www.offsoundings.com/WEB%20PDF/PERFECT_STORM_20TH_ANNIVERSARY.pdf What really happened to the Andrea Gail?]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Hurricane Grace (1991)]] was described by a weather forecaster as a [[Saffir–Simpson scale|category 5]] storm in the movie, though it never achieved those wind speeds. In the movie, Tyne and his crew agreed to head into the dangerous storm in order to save their fish from spoiling. Greenlaw acknowledged that Tyne did mention having ice problems, but that was not unusual. "My one gripe about [the] movie was how Warner Brothers depicted Billy Tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous," said Greenlaw. "That is not what happened. ''Andrea Gail'' was three days into their steam home when the storm hit. Whatever happened to ''Andrea Gail'' happened very quickly."&lt;ref name="GAIL" /&gt;

An Air National Guard helicopter was dispatched from [[Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base]] on [[Long Island, New York]], but not in response to the Andrea Gail or Satori (''Mistral'' in the movie). The helicopter departed mid-storm on a mission to help save a lone Japanese fisherman from a sinking sailboat 250 miles off the New Jersey coast. Unsuccessful and running low on fuel, the Air National Guard HH-60G helicopter was compelled to attempt a mid-flight refueling maneuver. The zero-visibility conditions thwarted their efforts, however, and lacking enough fuel to make the flight back to the Long Island base, the crew were forced to ditch the helicopter. After a search by ''Tamaroa'', four of the HH-60's crew were picked up; one was never seen again.  The Japanese yachtsman was later rescued by a Romanian cargo ship.&lt;ref name="GAIL" /&gt;

When asked about the portrayal of "Sully" in the movie, Cathy Sullivan Mustone, an older sister of David "Sully" Sullivan, said she was disappointed. "They made my brother's character out to be a hothead," she said. "I guess every movie needs a villain, but my brother was a funny guy with a loud laugh and a big smile. He had a lot of guts and he loved fishing." In fact, David's bravery and quick thinking made headlines on a different boat—''Harmony''. One night during a winter fishing trip, ''Harmony'' began taking on water while tied to another boat. The crew of ''Harmony'' yelled for help, hoping to wake the nearby crew. No one woke, so David dove into the icy water, pulling himself on the ropes that tied the boats together. As a result of his bravery, ''Harmony'''s crew was saved. Mustone said, "At least in the movie, they did represent my brother's bravery in a water rescue scene. He was a good man. And I just know he is at peace in heaven, safe with our Dad."&lt;ref name="GAIL" /&gt;

===The Satori===

The crew members of ''Satori'' (renamed ''Mistral'' in the movie) were not rescued by an [[Air National Guard]] helicopter, but rather a [[U.S. Coast Guard]] helicopter.  The helicopter was changed in the film after the Air National Guard had issues consulting with the movie producers. According to the owner's son, ''Satori'' never made a 360° roll, although it had two knockdowns, during which it lay on its side for about 30 seconds.&lt;ref name=Satori&gt;{{cite web|title=Satori - Perfect Storm|url=http://www.westsail.org/satoristorm|publisher=Westsail Owners Association|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to requests by the crew, Captain Ray Leonard permitted the two crewmembers to make a position report over radio, during which they made an unauthorized Mayday call. One of those crewmembers reported that she was so convinced that she was going to die that she wrote her name down and put it into a plastic bag so that her body could be identified when it was finally found.

There is controversy over whether the Captain was drunk, as charged by the women in the book, with Leonard objecting to this characterization.  Out of compassion for the expected loss of his boat, the Coast Guard did not test his blood alcohol levels at the time.  The Coast Guard declared the voyage manifestly unsafe and ordered everyone off-board, including the unwilling skipper.&lt;ref name=Satori /&gt; The Coast Guard first tried to take them on board via an inflatable boat, but after it was damaged when trying to approach ''Satori'' they sent a helicopter, which is a much riskier approach, as a rescue swimmer must jump into dangerous seas. The Coast Guard helicopter did not try to lower rescue gear onto the yacht (as shown in the movie, where it gets entangled with the mast), but rather asked the crew of ''Satori'' to jump overboard to meet a rescue swimmer in the water. Leonard eventually complied with the request.

After the storm, Leonard searched for the "Satori", hoping to find her still afloat, but in spite of his attempts she was found a few days later washed ashore on a Maryland beach, a bag of personal belongings still on deck. Leonard paid for a 60-foot fishing vessel to drag her off the beach, helped by a channel dug by Park Rangers who had been guarding the boat. He continued to sail the boat until 2000, and she remained in use with a new owner {{As of|2000|5|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=Satori /&gt;

== Reception ==
''The Perfect Storm'' received mixed reviews from critics, with a 47% approval rating on critic site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with a consensus of, "While the special effects are well done and quite impressive, this film suffers a lack of any actual drama or characterization. The end result is a film that offers nifty eye-candy and nothing else."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/perfect_storm/ The Perfect Storm on RT]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Perfect Storm'' was a box office success. On its opening weekend, it debuted with $42 million ahead of Sony's ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'' and eventually brought in over $182.6 million in the United States, and $146.1 million around the world to a total of $328.7 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=perfectstorm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was nominated for 2 [[Academy Awards]], Best Visual Effects ([[Walt Conti]], [[Stefen Fangmeier]], [[John Frazier]] and [[Habib Zargarpour]]) and Best Sound ([[John T. Reitz]], [[Gregg Rudloff]], [[David E. Campbell (sound engineer)|David E. Campbell]] and [[Keith A. Wester]]), but lost both to ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''.&lt;ref name="Oscars2001"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/73rd-winners.html |title=The 73rd Academy Awards (2001) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-11-19|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==

After the film was released, the families of two crew members sued the film makers for the fictionalization of events which happened prior to the loss of ''Andrea Gail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/12/TampaBay/Court_revives__Perfec.shtml |title=Court Revives 'Perfect Storm' Lawsuit |publisher=St. Petersburg Times Online |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Florida Supreme Court]] ruled against the family of Captain Tyne by a 6–2 vote. Some unnamed families also sued the producers in [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida|federal district court]], claiming that their names were used without their permission, and that facts were changed.&lt;ref name="ccase"&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Howard M.|title=Judge sinks 'Perfect Storm' lawsuit|publisher=Sarasota Herald Tribune|date=2002-05-31|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2074/perfectstorm.html|accessdate=2007-11-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207152811/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2074/perfectstorm.html|archivedate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district court, which is also located in Florida, dismissed the case, as in their opinion the defendants' [[First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]] barred the suit. The plaintiffs appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit]], which could not decide how to interpret the Florida law at issue and certified the question to the Florida Supreme Court. In the end, the Florida Supreme Court upheld the district court's interpretation of Florida law, and remanded the case to the 11th Circuit, which affirmed the prior decision to dismiss the case.&lt;ref name="ccase"/&gt;

"'''The Tallow Candle'''" ({{lang-da|Tællelyset}}) is a 700-word [[fairytale fantasy|literary fairytale]] by Danish writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805&amp;ndash;1875).

It was written in the 1820s, making it one of his earliest works and his first known work in the fairytale genre, but its existence was apparently unknown to scholars or the public for almost two centuries. A copy of the manuscript was discovered in a filing box in the National Archives of [[Funen]] in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tallow Candle: Hans Christian Andersen's 'first work'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20706230|publisher=BBC|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A [[tallow]] candle, whose parents are a sheep and a [[Crucible|melting pot]], becomes more and more disheartened as it cannot find a purpose in life. It meets a [[tinderbox]] who lights a flame on the candle, and it finally finds its right place in life and spreads joy and happiness for itself and its fellow creatures.

==Discovery==
The manuscript was discovered in late 2012 in a suitcase with documents belonging to the Plum family in the local branch of the [[Danish National Archives]] in [[Funen]], Denmark. The first people to come across the document were a couple doing amateur research into their family history, but they thought nothing of it since it seemed unrelated to [[genealogy]]. Later the archivist and local historian Esben Brage noted the document's signature and realized that it might be an original H. C. Andersen document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilly|first=Tatiana|title=Ægtepar fandt nyt Andersen-eventyr først: "Vi anede ikke, hvad det var"|language=Danish|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE1843404/aegtepar-fandt-nyt-andersen-eventyr-foerst-vi-anede-ikke-hvad-det-var/|work=Politiken|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raatz|first=Mie|title=Manden, der fandt H.

==Commentaries and criticism==
Andersen scholars agree that the work is not of the same literary quality as his later tales, and that it has many similarities with other writings from his time at the Latinate schools in [[Slagelse]] and [[Elsinore]]. It was dedicated to Madame Bunkeflod, a vicar's widow and one of the young Andersen's benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Bubandt|title=Local historian finds Hans Christian Andersen’s first fairy tale|url=http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ECE1841147/local-historian-finds-hans-christian-andersens-first-fairy-tale/|work=Politiken|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argued that the tale was overly [[didactic]] and [[moralistic]], and lacking Andersen's later sense of humor, probably to impress his benefactress, who had paid for his education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilly|first=Tatiana|title=H.C. Andersen-forfatter om 'Tællelyset': "Den er pædagogisk, så det er til at brække sig over"|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE1842128/hc-andersen-forfatter-om-taellelyset-den-er-paedagogisk-saa-det-er-til-at-braekke-sig-over/|work=Politiken|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=13 December 2012|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish author and Andersen specialist [[Johannes Møllehave]] opined that the tale could have been written by any bright 15-year-old and that it displayed nothing of Andersen's later virtuosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilly|first=Tatiana|title=Møllehave: 'Tællelyset' kunne være skrevet af ethvert begavet barn på 15|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE1842323/moellehave-taellelyset-kunne-vaere-skrevet-af-ethvert-begavet-barn-paa-15/|work=Politiken|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=14 December 2012|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Danish [[Philology|philologists]] have expressed doubts about the authorship of the fairy tale. They argue that the tale is too close in form to the models used in the Latinate schools of the time for it to be likely to be an original composition, and they have also expressed disbelief in the use of the word ''formfuldendt'' ("flawless") which does not otherwise appear in texts until much later. Since the manuscript is difficult to read there is a possibility that what is written is in fact another word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munk|first=Andreas|title=Flere forskere tvivler på Andersen-eventyr|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Kultur/Boeger/2012/12/21/173449.htm|work=Kultur|publisher=[[Danish Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 December 2012|language=Danish|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Graugaard]], a Danish poet and professor of [[sexology]], has analyzed the tale as a covert autoerotic tale, in which the candle symbolizes the [[phallus]] and the melting tallow the semen in an ejaculation. According to him Andersen often added erotic undertones and metaphoric phallic imagery in his tales. He characterizes the fairy tale as "a literary [[cumshot]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lohse|first=Gregers|last2=Runge|first2=Morten|title=Professor: Nyt H.C.

'''Western Christianity''' is the [[Latin Church]], and [[Protestantism]], together with the offshoots of these such as [[independent Catholicism]] and [[Restorationist]] churches taken together. The large majority of the world's 2.4 billion Christians are Western Christians (about 2 billion – 1.2 billion Latin Catholic / 800 million Protestant).  The original and still major part, the [[Latin Church]], developed under the [[bishop of Rome]] (the Patriarch of the West) in the former [[Western Roman Empire]] in Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/ancient-medieval/christianity/a/roman-culture|title=Christianity in the Roman Empire|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the Latin Church emerged a wide variety of independent [[Protestant denominations]], including [[Lutheranism]] and [[Anglicanism]], starting from the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, as did Independent Catholicism in the 19th century. Thus, the term "Western Christianity" does not describe a single [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] or [[religious denomination]], but is applied  to distinguish all these denominations collectively from [[Eastern Christianity]].

The establishment of the distinct Latin Church, a [[particular church]] [[sui iuris]] of the [[Catholic Church]] (in contrast to the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], also in [[full communion]] with the [[Pope]] in [[Holy See|Rome]]) coincided with the consolidation of the [[Holy See]] in [[Rome]], where the bishop claimed a particular role since Antiquity. The terms "Western" and "Eastern" in this regard originated with geographical divisions mirroring the cultural divide between the [[Greek East and Latin West|Hellenistic east and Latin West]], and the political divide between the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman empires]]. During the [[Middle Ages]] adherents of the Latin Church, irrespective of ethnicity, commonly referred to themselves as "Latins" to distinguish themselves from Eastern Christians.&lt;ref name="Orbilat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orbilat.com/General_Survey/Terms--Latins_and_Romans.html |title=Distinguishing the terms: Latins and Romans |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Orbis Latinus]] |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the expansion of [[European colonialism]] from the [[Early Modern era]], the Latin Church, in time along with its Protestant secessions, spread throughout the [[Americas]], much of the [[Philippines]], [[Southern Africa]], pockets of [[West Africa]], and throughout [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Thus, when used for historical periods after the 16th century, the term "Western Christianity" does not refer to a particular geographical area, but is rather used as a collective term for the Latin Church, the Protestant denominations, and Independent Catholicism that trace their lineage to the original Latin Church in Western Europe.

Today, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is not nearly as absolute as in Antiquity or the Middle Ages, due to the spread of [[Christian missionaries]], [[Human migration|migration]]s, and [[globalisation]]. The adjectives "Western Christianity" and "Eastern Christianity" are typically used to refer to historical origins and differences in [[Christian theology|theology]] and [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], rather than present geographical locations.

While the Latin Church maintain the [[Latin liturgical rites]], Protestant denominations and Independent Catholicism retain a wide variety of liturgical practices.

For most of its history the church in Europe has been [[Greek East and Latin West|culturally divided]] between the Latin-speaking west, whose centre was [[Rome]], and the Greek-speaking east, whose centre was [[Constantinople]]. Cultural differences and political rivalry created tensions between the two churches, leading to disagreement over [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences|doctrine]] and [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic ecclesiastical differences|ecclesiology]] and ultimately to [[East-West schism|schism]].&lt;ref name="west_christ"&gt;[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/christ/west/westessay.html "General Essay on Western Christianity"], ''Overview Of World Religions''.  Division of Religion and Philosophy, University of Cumbria.  © 1998/9 ELMAR Project.  Accessed 1 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--old reference //&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/christ/west/westessay.html |title=Western Christianity |publisher=Philtar.ucsm.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;// --&gt;

Like [[Eastern Christianity]], Western Christianity traces its roots directly to the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] and other early preachers of the religion. In Western Christianity's  original area [[Latin]] was the principal language. Christian writers in Latin had more influence there than those who wrote in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], or other Eastern languages. Though the first Christians in the West used Greek (such as [[Clement of Rome]]), by the [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]] Latin had superseded it even in the cosmopolitan city of [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]], while there is evidence of a Latin translation of the [[Bible]] in the 2nd century (see also [[Vetus Latina]]) in [[Early centers of Christianity#Southern Gaul|southern Gaul]] and the [[Early centers of Christianity#Carthage|Roman province of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article "Latin"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], distinctions appeared also in organization, since the bishops in the West were not dependent on the [[Byzantine Empire|Emperor in Constantinople]] and did not come under the influence of the [[Caesaropapism#Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church|Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church]]. While the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|see of Constantinople]] became dominant throughout the Emperor's lands, the West looked exclusively to the [[Holy See|see of Rome]], which in the East was seen as that of one of the five [[patriarch]]s of the [[Pentarchy (Christianity)|Pentarchy]], "the proposed government of universal [[Christendom]] by five [[patriarch]]al sees under the auspices of a single universal empire. Formulated in the legislation of the emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565), especially in his [[Corpus Juris Civilis#Novellae|Novella]] 131, the theory received formal ecclesiastical sanction at the [[Quinisext Council|Council in Trullo]] (692), which ranked the five sees as Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9059117/pentarchy Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Pentarchy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, disagreements separated Western Christianity from the various forms of Eastern Christianity: first from [[Church of the East|East Syriac Christianity]] after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus (431)]], then from that of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), and then from [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054. With the last-named form of Eastern Christianity, reunion agreements were signed at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274) and the [[Council of Florence]] (1439), but these proved ineffective.

The rise of [[Protestantism]] led to major divisions within Western Christianity, which still persist, and wars&amp;mdash;for example, the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]] of 1585–1604 had religious as well as economic causes.

In and after the [[Age of Discovery]], [[Europe]]ans spread Western Christianity to the [[New World]] and elsewhere. Roman Catholicism came to the Americas (especially South America), Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. Protestantism, including Anglicanism, came to North America, Australia-Pacific and some African locales.

Today, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is now much less absolute, due to the great migrations of Europeans across the globe, as well as the work of [[missionary|missionaries]] worldwide over the past five centuries.

=== Original sin ===
Although "[[original sin]]" can be taken to mean the sin that Adam committed, it is usually understood as a consequence of the first sin, the hereditary stain with which we are born on account of our origin or descent from Adam.
With the exception of tendencies such as [[Pelagianism]], Western Christianity is thought to hold this doctrine, which was championed especially by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], who wrote: "The deliberate sin of the first man is the cause of original sin" (De nupt. et concup., II, xxvi, 43).&lt;ref&gt;Harent, Stéphane. "Original Sin." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 7 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filioque clause ===
{{See also|Filioque}}
Most Western Christians use a version of the [[Nicene Creed]] that states that the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] "[[Filioque|proceeds from the Father and the Son]]", where the original text as adopted by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] had "proceeds from the Father" without the addition of either "and the Son" or "alone". This Western version also has the additional phrase "God from God" (in [[Latin]] ''Deum de Deo''), which was in the Creed as adopted by the [[First Council of Nicaea]], but which was dropped by the First Council of Constantinople.

=== Date of Easter ===
{{Main|Easter controversy}}
The [[Easter#Date|date of Easter]] usually differs between Eastern and Western Christianity, because the calculations are based on the [[Julian calendar]] and [[Gregorian calendar]] respectively. However, before the Council of Nicea various dates including Jewish Passover were observed. Nicea "Romanized" the date for Easter and anathematized a "Judaized" (i.e. Passover date for) Easter. The date of observance of Easter has only differed in modern times since the promulgation of the Gregorian calendar in 1582; and further, the Western Church did not universally adopt the Gregorian calendar at once, so that for some time the dates of Easter differed as between the Eastern Church and the Roman Catholic Church, but not necessarily as between the Eastern Church and the Western Protestant churches. For example, the Church of England continued to observe Easter on the same date as the Eastern Church until 1753.

Even the dates of other Christian holidays differ between Eastern and Western Christianity.

== Western denominations ==

Today, Western Christianity makes up close to 90% of [[Christianity by country|Christians worldwide]] with the Catholic Church accounting for over half and various Protestant denominations making up another 40%. 

[[Hussite]] movements of 15th century [[Bohemia]] preceded the main Protestant uprising by 100 years and evolved into several small Protestant churches, such as the [[Moravian Church]]. [[Waldensians]] survived also, but blended into the [[Reformed tradition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2133">'''YbGaGe''' is an [[alloy]] of [[Ytterbium]], [[Gallium]] and [[Germanium]]. It sparked interest because one group of researchers reported that it exhibits zero [[thermal expansion]], while being conductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nature02011|pmid = 14562099|title = Zero thermal expansion in YbGa ''Ge'' due to an electronic valence transition|journal = Nature|volume = 425|issue = 6959|pages = 702–705|year = 2003|last1 = Salvador|first1 = James R|last2 = Guo|first2 = Fu|last3 = Hogan|first3 = Tim|last4 = Kanatzidis|first4 = Mercouri G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such materials have applications in space and other environments where low [[thermal expansion]] materials are required.&lt;ref name="Michael Freemantle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/NCW/8142notw1.html | title=Zero Expansion Conductor | date=October 20, 2003 | accessdate=May 23, 2011 | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent measurements by other groups were however not able to reproduce their results, but rather found expansion coefficients similar to copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = cond-mat/0407683|last1 = Janssen|first1 = Y|title = YbGaGe: Normal thermal expansion|last2 = Chang|first2 = S|last3 = Cho|first3 = B.

Nevertheless, YbGaGe does show anomalous thermal expansion. Near zero thermal expansion was observed by Booth et al. It was found that near-zero thermal expansion (NZTE) in YbGaGe is sensitive to stoichiometry and defect concentration, however, the NZTE mechanism remains elusive &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.75.012301|title = Ytterbium divalency and lattice disorder in near-zero thermal expansion YbGaGe|journal = Physical Review B|volume = 75|year = 2007|last1 = Booth|first1 = C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2494">The '''Ökofeszt''' or '''Ecofest''' is [[festival]] which is held to celebrate [[eco friendly]] ideas every year in [[Hungary]]. The first Ökofeszt was organized by [[Védegylet NGO|Védegylet]] and Zöld Fiatalok and held on 15 and 16 April 2005 in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zofi.hu/%C3%B6kofeszt|title=Ökofeszt Zöld Fiatalok|publisher=zofi.hu|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://est.hu/cikk/32052|title=Ökofeszt|publisher=est.hu|date=1 April 2005|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan of the festival was ''Politics Can Be Different'' which led to the formation of an [[eponymous]] political party in 2009. [[Politics Can Be Different]] won seats in the [[National Assembly of Hungary|National Assembly]] in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.lehetmas.hu/|title=Ökofeszt|publisher=lehetmas.hu|date=30 June 2012|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key issues of the festival were [[environmental protection]], [[sustainable development]] and the fight against [[corruption]] in the current Hungarian political elite. The public face of the party is [[András Schiffer]], who presented a talk at the first Ökofeszt in 2005 and is a former member of the [[Hungarian Civil Liberties Union]].
