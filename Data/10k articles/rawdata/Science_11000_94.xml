      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12903">{{Advanced Placement}}
'''Advanced Placement Calculus''' (also known as '''AP Calculus''', '''AP Calc''', or simply '''AB / BC''') is one of two distinct [[Advanced Placement]] [[calculus]] courses and exams offered by [[College Board]].

AP Calculus AB covers limits, derivatives, and [[integrals]].

AP Calculus BC covers all AP Calculus AB topics plus additional topics (including more integration techniques such as [[integration by parts]], [[Taylor series]], [[parametric equation]]s, [[polar coordinate]] functions, and curve interpolations).

==AP Exam==
The College Board intentionally schedules the AP Calculus AB exam at the same time as the AP Calculus BC exam in order to make it impossible for a student to take both tests in the same academic year, though the College Board does not make Calculus AB a pre-requisite class for Calculus BC. Some schools do this, though many others only require precalculus as a prerequisite for Calculus BC. The AP awards given by College Board count both exams. However, they do not count the AB subscore piece of the BC exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/college/ap-exam-schedule|title=2018 AP Exam Dates {{!}} The Princeton Review|website=www.princetonreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Format===
The structures of the AB and BC exams are identical. Both exams are three hours and fifteen minutes long, comprising a total of 45 [[multiple choice]] questions and six [[free response]] questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/calculus_ab/exam.html?calcab|title=The Exam|date=|work=Calculus AB|publisher=College Board|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219070621/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/calculus_ab/exam.html?calcab|archivedate=2008-12-19|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2008-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two parts of the multiple choice section are timed and taken independently.

Students are required to put away their calculators after 30 minutes have passed during the Free-Response section, and only at that point may begin Section II Part B. However, students may continue to work on Section II Part A during the entire Free-Response time, although without a calculator during the later half.

===Scoring===
The multiple choice section is scored by computer, with a correct answer receiving 1 point, with omitted and incorrect answers not affecting the raw score. This total is multiplied by 1.2 to calculate the adjusted multiple-choice score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/calculus/ap-cd-calc-0607.pdf|title=2006, 2007 AP Calculus Course Description|year=2005|publisher=College Board|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720151001/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/calculus/ap-cd-calc-0607.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-20|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free response section is hand-graded by hundreds of educators each June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_set.html|title=AP: The Grade-Setting Process|date=|publisher=College Board|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218181203/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_set.html|archivedate=2008-12-18|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2008-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The raw score is then added to the adjusted multiple choice score to receive a composite score. This total is compared to a composite-score scale for that year's exam and converted into an AP score of 1 to 5.

For the Calculus BC exam, an AB sub-score is included in the score report to reflect their proficiency in the fundamental topics of introductory calculus.  The AB sub-score is based on the correct number of answers for questions pertaining to AB-material only.

==AP Calculus AB==
AP Calculus AB is an [[Advanced Placement]] [[calculus]] course. It is traditionally taken after [[precalculus]] and is the first calculus course offered at most schools except for possibly a regular calculus class. The Pre-Advanced Placement pathway for math will help prepare students for further Advanced Placement classes and exams. 

===Purpose===
According to the [[College Board]]:{{quote |text=An AP course in calculus consists of a full high school academic year of work that is comparable to calculus courses in colleges and universities. It is expected that students who take an AP course in calculus will seek college credit, college placement, or both, from institutions of higher learning.

The AP Program includes specifications for two calculus courses and the exam for each course. The two courses and the two corresponding exams are designated as Calculus AB and Calculus BC. Calculus AB can be offered as an AP course by any school that can organize a curriculum for students with advanced mathematical ability.&lt;ref name="collegeboard1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/calculus/ap-cd-calc-0607.pdf |title=2006, 2007 AP Calculus Course Description |format=PDF |year=2005 |publisher=College Board |accessdate=2008-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720151001/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/calculus/ap-cd-calc-0607.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Topic Outline===
The material includes the study and application of [[derivative (calculus)|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], and graphical analysis including [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[asymptotes]], and continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/calculus_ab/topic.html?calcab |title=Topic Outline |work=Calculus AB |publisher=College Board |date= |accessdate=2008-11-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219070626/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/calculus_ab/topic.html?calcab |archivedate=2008-12-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An AP Calculus AB course is typically equivalent to one semester of college calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-calculus-course-description.pdf|title=Course Descriptions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Independent research on the academic benefits of the Advanced Placement Calculus course indicates that not all students receive academic benefits from participating in the course. In a study with a sample size of over 90,000, the authors found that students who took the AP Calculus course did not receive any increase in academic achievement unless they also prepared for and took the AP test. The authors controlled for over 70 intervening variables and found that AP students who took and passed the AP Calculus AB or BC exam had ACT scores that were 1.8 points higher than non-AP students or AP Calculus students who did not take their course's AP test.&lt;ref name="Warne et al. (2015)"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Larsen|first2=Ross|last3=Anderson|first3=Braydon|last4=Odasso|first4=Alyce J.|date=2015|title=The impact of participation in the Advanced Placement program on students' college admissions test scores|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00220671.2014.917253|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|volume=108|issue=5|pages=400–416|doi=10.1080/00220671.2014.917253|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the authors to state that AP participation... is not beneficial to students who merely enroll in the courses ..."&lt;ref name="Warne et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">The '''ab initio multiple spawning''', or '''AIMS''', method is a time-dependent [[formulation]] of [[quantum chemistry]].

In AIMS, nuclear dynamics and electronic structure problems are solved [[simultaneously]]. [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum mechanical effects]] in the nuclear dynamics are included, especially the [[vibronic coupling|nonadiabatic effects]] which are crucial in modeling dynamics on multiple electronic states.

The AIMS method makes it possible to describe [[photochemistry]] from first principles molecular dynamics, with no empirical parameters. The method has been applied to two molecules of interest in organic photochemistry - [[ethylene]] and [[cyclobutene]].

The photodynamics of [[ethylene]] involves both [[covalent]] and [[ion]]ic electronic excited states and the return to the ground state proceeds through a pyramidalized geometry. For the photoinduced ring opening of cyclobutene, is it shown that the disrotatory motion predicted by the [[Woodward–Hoffmann rules]] is established within the first 50 fs after optical excitation.

The method was developed by chemistry professor [[Todd Martinez]].

'''Alberts Glacier''' ({{coord|66|52|S|64|53|W|type:glacier_region:AQ|display=inline,title}}) is a heavily crevassed [[glacier]] in [[Antarctica]]. It is about {{convert|8|mi|0}} long, and flows east from [[Avery Plateau]], [[Graham Land]], until entering [[Mill Inlet]] between [[Balch Glacier]] and [[Southard Promontory]]. The glacier was photographed from the air by the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1968. It was delineated from these photographs by [[Directorate of Overseas Surveys]], 1980, and positioned from surveys by [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]], 1947&amp;ndash;57. In association with the names of Antarctic [[historian]]s around the area, it was named by [[United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] after [[Fred G. Alberts]], an American [[toponym]]ist, and secretary of the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] 1949&amp;ndash;80.

In [[chemical bond|chemical bonding]] theory, an '''antibonding orbital''' is a type of [[molecular orbital]] (MO) that weakens the bond between two atoms and helps to raise the energy of the molecule relative to the separated atoms. Such an orbital has one or more [[Node (physics)|node]]s in the bonding region between the nuclei. The density of the electrons in the orbital is concentrated outside the bonding region and acts to pull one nucleus away from the other and tends to cause mutual repulsion between the two atoms.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins P. and de Paula J. ''Atkins Physical Chemistry''. 8th ed. (W.H. Freeman 2006), p.371 {{ISBN|0-7167-8759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miessler G.L. and Tarr D.A., ''Inorganic Chemistry'' 2nd ed. (Prentice-Hall 1999), p.111 {{ISBN|0-13-841891-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diatomic molecules==
Antibonding [[molecular orbital]]s (MOs) are normally ''higher'' in energy than bonding molecular orbitals. Bonding and antibonding orbitals form when atoms combine into molecules. If two [[hydrogen]] atoms are initially far apart, they have identical [[atomic orbital]]s. However, as the spacing between the two atoms becomes smaller, the electron [[wave function]]s begin to overlap. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prohibits any two electrons in a molecule from having the same set of [[quantum number]]s.  Therefore each original atomic orbital of the isolated atoms (for example, the ground state energy level, 1''s'') splits into two molecular orbitals belonging to the pair, one lower in energy than the original atomic level and one higher. The orbital which is lower than the orbitals of the separate atoms is the bonding orbital, which is more stable and promotes the bonding of the two H atoms into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The higher-energy orbital is the antibonding orbital, which is less stable and opposes bonding if it is occupied. In a molecule such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the two electrons normally occupy the lower-energy bonding orbital, so that the molecule is more stable than the separate H atoms.

[[File:He2 antibonding orbital.png|250px|right|thumb|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electron configuration. The four electrons occupy one bonding orbital at lower energy, and one antibonding orbital at higher energy than the atomic orbitals.]]
A molecular orbital becomes antibonding when there is less [[electron density]] between the two nuclei than there would be if there were no bonding interaction at all. When a molecular orbital changes sign (from positive to negative) at a ''nodal plane'' between two atoms, it is said to be ''antibonding with respect to those atoms''. Antibonding orbitals are often labelled with an [[asterisk]] (*) on molecular orbital diagrams. 
 
In [[Homonuclear molecule|homonuclear]] diatomic molecules, σ* (''sigma star'') antibonding orbitals have no nodal planes passing through the two nuclei, like [[sigma bonds]], and π* (''pi star'') orbitals have one nodal plane passing through the two nuclei, like [[pi bonds]]. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] dictates that no two electrons in an interacting system may have the same quantum state. If the bonding orbitals are filled, then any additional electrons will occupy antibonding orbitals. This occurs in the He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, in which both the 1sσ and 1sσ* orbitals are filled. Since the ''antibonding orbital is more antibonding than the bonding orbital is bonding'', the molecule has a higher energy than two separated helium atoms, and it is therefore unstable.

==Polyatomic molecules==
[[File:Butadiene-pi-MOs-Spartan-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|Butadiene pi molecular orbitals. The two colors show opposite signs of the wavefunction.]]
In molecules with several atoms, some orbitals may be [[delocalized electron|delocalized]] over more than two atoms. A particular molecular orbital may be ''bonding with respect to some adjacent pairs of atoms'' and ''antibonding with respect to other pairs''. If the bonding interactions outnumber the antibonding interactions, the MO is said to be ''bonding'', whereas, if the antibonding interactions outnumber the bonding interactions, the molecular orbital is said to be ''antibonding''. 

For example, [[butadiene]] has [[pi orbital]]s which are delocalized over all four carbon atoms. There are two bonding pi orbitals which are occupied in the [[ground state]]: π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is bonding between all carbons, while π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is bonding between C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and between C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and antibonding between C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. There are also antibonding pi orbitals with two and three antibonding interactions as shown in the diagram; these are vacant in the [[ground state]], but may be occupied in [[excited state]]s.

Similarly [[benzene]] with six carbon atoms has three bonding pi orbitals and three antibonding pi orbitals.
Since each [[carbon]] atom contributes one electron to the [[pi bond|π-system]] of benzene, there are six pi electrons which fill the three lowest-energy pi molecular orbitals (the bonding pi orbitals). 

Antibonding orbitals are also important for explaining [[chemical reaction]]s in terms of molecular orbital theory. [[Roald Hoffmann]] and [[Kenichi Fukui]] shared the 1981 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their work and further development of [[qualitative data|qualitative]] molecular orbital explanations for chemical reactions.

He has also provided consultation and training overseas.

== Biography ==

'''Freitas-Magalhães''' ({{IPA-pt|fɾɐjtɐʒ mɐɡɐʎɐ̃ȷ̃ʃ}}) (1966-) was born in [[Fafe Municipality|Fornelos]], [[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte region]], Portugal. He studied at the [[University of Coimbra]], and he did a Ph.D. in Psychology at [[University Aberta]], Lisbon. He is the author of the book "The Psychology of Human Smile".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufp.pt/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=17&amp;Itemid=158 UFP - Edições UFP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006 he is Professor of the Psychology of Emotions, Psychology and Law, Applied Psychology and Experimental Psychology at [[University Fernando Pessoa]] (UFP), in [[Porto]]. He is founder and current director of the [[Facial Emotion Expression Lab]] (FEELab) at that university. He is fellow of several international scientific societies (e.g. [[American Psychological Association]], [[Association for Psychological Science]], [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology]], International Society for Research on Emotions, [[International Brain Research Organization]], International Neuropsychological Society and European Health Psychology Society), as well as being member of several literary societies. His studies focus on the recognition from basic emotions, particularly the smile. He founded the National Front for the Defense of Culture (Lisbon, 1992) with among others [[José Saramago]]. He lives in [[Porto]] with his wife, Ana, and son, Gonçalo.

== Work ==
His research is devoted to understanding emotions in individuals and society. Among Freitas-Magalhães's professional interests are physiological psychology, psychology of emotions, facial emotion expression and human-computer interaction, human smile and cross-cultural nonverbal behavior. During the last twenty years his principal research has been on human emotions and the influence of smile on emotional disorders such as depression. More recently he has conducted research on the cognitive and emotional processes of reading human faces. Freitas-Magalhães is the author of several IT applications and interfaces in relation to emotions and facial expression.&lt;ref&gt;http://fm.ufp.pt/fmit180408.swf&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of more than 100 articles, empirical reports, research reviews and theorical papers, as well as attendee to conferences, and has written six books on psychology. Freitas-Magalhães is also the author of 11 novels and has published poetry. The common theme of his research and fiction is on furthering our understandings of interactions within complex systems, especially complex emotional systems. Freitas-Magalhães's theories of fiction includes the idea that novels and poetry are simulations that run not on machines but on our minds. His books have been translated into several languages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The '''atom probe''' was introduced at the [http://www.fieldemission.org/article.php?id=proceeding 14th Field Emission Symposium in 1967] by [[Erwin Wilhelm Müller]] and [[J. A. Panitz]]. It combined a [[field ion microscope]] with a mass spectrometer having a single particle detection capability and, for the first time, an instrument could “... determine the nature of one single atom seen on a metal surface and selected from neighboring atoms at the discretion of the observer”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=Erwin W.|authorlink1=Erwin Wilhelm Müller|authorlink2=J. A. Panitz|last2=Panitz|first2=John A.|authorlink3=S. Brooks McLane|last3=McLane|first3=S. Brooks|year=1968|title=The Atom-Probe Field Ion Microscope|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–86|issn=0034-6748|doi=10.1063/1.1683116|bibcode = 1968RScI...39...83M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atom probes are unlike conventional optical or [[electron microscope]]s, in that the magnification effect comes from the magnification provided by a highly curved electric field, rather than by the manipulation of radiation paths. The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are removed from the sample surface. Through coupling of this magnification method with [[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time of flight mass spectrometry]], ions evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-charge ratio computed.&lt;ref name="Müller70"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Müller, E. W. |title=The Atom-Probe Field Ion Microscope |series=Naturwissenschaften|year=1970|volume=5|pages=222–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through successive evaporation of material, layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not only of the surface, but also through the material itself.&lt;ref name="MillerSmith"&gt;{{cite book|title=Atom Probe Microanalysis: Principles and Applications to Materials Problems|year=1989|publisher=Materials Research Society|author=Miller, M |author2=Smith, G.|isbn=0-931837-99-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer methods are used to rebuild a three-dimensional view of the sample, prior to it being evaporated, providing atomic scale information on the structure of a sample, as well as providing the type atomic species information.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|author=Miller, M.|title=Atom Probe Tomography: Analysis at the Atomic Level |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|year=2000|isbn=0-306-46415-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to billions of [[atom]]s from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes of 10,000-10,000,000&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Overview ==
Atom probe samples are shaped to implicitly provide a highly curved electric potential to induce the resultant magnification, as opposed to direct use of lensing, such as via [[magnetic lens]]es. Furthermore, in normal operation (as opposed to a field ionization modes) the atom probe does not utilize a secondary source to probe the sample. Rather, the sample is evaporated in a controlled manner (field evaporation) and the evaporated ions are impacted onto a detector, which is typically 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;cm away.

The samples are required to have a needle geometry and are produced by similar techniques as TEM sample preparation [[electropolishing]], or [[focused ion beam]] methods.  Since 2006, commercial systems with laser pulsing have become available and this has expanded applications from metallic only specimens into semiconducting, insulating such as ceramics, and even geological materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=John W.|last1=Valley|first2=David A.|last2=Reinhard|first3=Aaron J.|last3=Cavosie|first4=Takayuki|last4=Ushikubo|title=Nano- and micro-geochronology in Hadean and Archean zircons by atom-probe tomography and SIMS: New tools for old minerals|url=http://ammin.geoscienceworld.org/content/gsammin/100/7/1355.full.pdf|journal=American Mineralogist|date=2015-07-01|issn=0003-004X|pages=1355–1377|volume=100|issue=7|doi=10.2138/am-2015-5134|first5=Daniel F.|last5=Lawrence|first6=David J.|last6=Larson|first7=Thomas F.|last7=Kelly|first8=David R.|last8=Snoeyenbos|first9=Ariel|last9=Strickland|bibcode=2015AmMin.100.1355V}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Preparation is done, often by hand, to manufacture a tip radius sufficient to induce a high electric field, with radii on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]].

To conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped specimen is placed in an [[ultra high vacuum]] chamber. After introduction into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100&amp;nbsp;K) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage is applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2&amp;nbsp;kV) with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from the sample surface at a known time.  Typically the pulse amplitude and the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio.

Whilst the uncertainty in the atomic mass computed by time-of-flight methods in atom probe is sufficiently small to allow for detection of individual isotopes within a material this uncertainty may still, in some cases, confound definitive identification of atomic species. Effects such as superposition of differing ions with multiple electrons removed, or through the presence of complex species formation during evaporation may cause two or more species to have sufficiently close time-of-flights to make definitive identification impossible.

== History ==

=== Field ion microscopy ===
{{main|Field ion microscopy}}
Field ion microscopy is a modification of [[field emission microscopy]] where a stream of tunneling electrons is emitted from the apex of a sharp needle-like ''tip'' cathode when subjected to a sufficiently high electric field (~3-6&amp;nbsp;V/nm).&lt;ref name="Gomer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Field emission and field ionization|author=Gomer, R|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1961|isbn=1-56396-124-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The needle is oriented towards a phosphor screen to create a projected image of the [[work function]] at the tip apex. The image resolution is limited to (2-2.5&amp;nbsp;nm), due to quantum mechanical effects and lateral variations in the electron velocity.&lt;ref name="Tsong"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tsong, T| title=Atom probe field Ion Microscopy: Field Ion emission and Surfaces and interfaces at atomic resolution|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-36379-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In field ion microscopy the tip is cooled by a cryogen and its polarity is reversed. When an ''imaging gas'' (usually hydrogen or helium) is introduced at low pressures (&lt; 0.1 Pascal) gas ions in the high electric field at the tip apex are ''field ionized'' and produce a projected image of protruding atoms at the tip apex. The image resolution is determined primarily by the temperature of the tip but even at 78 Kelvin atomic resolution is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=Erwin W.|first2=Kanwar|last2=Bahadur|year=1956|title= Field Ionization of gases at a metal surface and the resolution of the field ion microscope |journal= Phys.

===10-cm Atom Probe===
The '''10-cm Atom Probe''', invented in 1973 by [[J. A. Panitz]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Panitz |first=John A. |year=1973 |title=The 10 cm Atom Probe |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=1034–1038 |doi=10.1063/1.1686295 |bibcode=1973RScI...44.1034P }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a “new and simple atom probe which permits rapid, in depth species identification or the more usual atom-by atom analysis provided by its predecessors ... in an instrument having a volume of less than two liters in which tip movement is unnecessary and the problems of evaporation pulse stability and alignment common to previous designs have been eliminated.” This was accomplished by combining a [[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometer]] with a proximity focussed, dual channel plate detector, an 11.8&amp;nbsp;cm drift region and a 38° field of view. An FIM image or a desorption image of the atoms removed from the apex of a field emitter tip could be obtained. The 10-cm Atom Probe has been called the ''progenitor'' of later atom probes including the commercial instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seidman |first=David N. |year=2007 |title=Three-Dimensional Atom-Probe Tomography: Advances and Applications |journal=[[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Review of Materials Research]] |volume=37 |pages=127–158 |doi=10.1146/annurev.matsci.37.052506.084200 |bibcode=2007AnRMS..37..127S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imaging Atom Probe===
The '''Imaging Atom-Probe''' ('''IAP''') was introduced in 1974 by [[J. A. Panitz]]. It incorporated the features of the 10-cm Atom-Probe yet “... departs completely from [previous] atom probe philosophy. Rather than attempt to determine the identity of a surface species producing a preselected ion-image spot, we wish to determine the complete crystallographic distribution of a surface species of preselected mass-to-charge ratio. Now suppose that instead of operating the [detector] continuously, it is turned on for a short time coincidentally with the arrival of a preselected species of interest by applying a ''gate pulse'' a time T after the evaporation pulse has reached the specimen. If the duration of the gate pulse is shorter than the travel time between adjacent species, only that surface species having the unique travel time T will be detected and its complete crystallographic distribution displayed.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Panitz|first=John A.|authorlink=J.

J. Waugh in 1978 and the instrument was described in detail by J. A. Panitz in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waugh |first=A.

===Atom Probe Tomography (APT)===
Modern day atom probe tomography (APT) uses a position-sensitive detector to deduce the lateral location of atoms. The idea of the APT, inspired by J. A. Panitz's ''Field Desorption Spectrometer'' patent, was developed by Mike Miller starting in 1983 and culminated with the first prototype in 1986.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Various refinements were made to the instrument, including the use of a so-called position-sensitive (PoS) detector by Alfred Cerezo, Terence Godfrey, and George D. W. Smith at Oxford University in 1988. The Tomographic Atom Probe (TAP), developed by researchers at the University of Rouen in France in 1993, introduced a multichannel timing system and multianode array. Both instruments (PoSAP and TAP) were commercialized by [[Oxford Instruments|Oxford Nanoscience]] and [[CAMECA]] respectively. Since then, there have been many refinements to increase the field of view, mass and position resolution, and data acquisition rate of the instrument.  The Local Electrode Atom Probe was first introduced in 2003 by Imago Scientific Instruments.  In 2005, the commercialization of the pulsed laser atom probe (PLAP) expanded the avenues of research from highly conductive materials (metals) to poor conductors (semiconductors like silicon) and even insulating materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunton|first1=J.|last2=Lenz|first2=D|last3=Olson|first3=J|last4=Thompson|first4=K|last5=Ulfig|first5=R|last6=Larson|first6=D|last7=Kelly|first7=T|year=2006|title=Instrumentation Developments in Atom Probe Tomography: Applications in Semiconductor Research|journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis (2006)|volume=12|issue=2|pages=1730–1731|issn=1431-9276|doi=10.1017/S1431927606065809|bibcode = 2006MiMic..12.1730B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[AMETEK]] acquired [[CAMECA]] in 2007 and [[Imago Scientific Instruments]] (Madison, WI) in 2010, making the company the sole commercial developer of APTs with more than 90 instruments installed around the world in 2016.

The first few decades of work with APT focused on metals. However, more recent work has been done on semiconductors, ceramic and geologic materials, with some work on biomaterials.&lt;ref name=annrev&gt;{{Cite journal

== Theory ==

=== Field evaporation ===
Field evaporation is an effect that can occur when an atom bonded at the surface of a material is in the presence of a sufficiently high and appropriately directed electric field, where the electric field is the differential of electric potential (voltage) with respect to distance. Once this condition is met, it is sufficient that local bonding at the specimen surface is capable of being overcome by the field, allowing for evaporation of an atom from the surface to which it is otherwise bonded.

=== Ion flight ===

Whether evaporated from the material itself, or ionised from the gas, the ions that are evaporated are accelerated by electrostatic force, acquiring most of their energy within a few tip-radii of the sample.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Subsequently, the accelerative force on any given ion is controlled by the [[electrostatic equation]], where ''n'' is the ionisation state of the ion, and ''e'' is the fundamental electric charge.

:&lt;math&gt;F=ne \nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt;

This can be equated with the mass of the ion, ''m'', via Newton's law (F=ma):

:&lt;math&gt; ma = q \nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a = \frac{q}{m} \nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt;

Relativistic effects in the ion flight are usually ignored, as realisable ion speeds are only a very small fraction of the speed of light.

Assuming that the ion is accelerated during a very short interval, the ion can be assumed to be travelling at constant velocity. As the ion will travel from the tip at voltage V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to some nominal ground potential, the speed at which the ion is travelling can be estimated by the energy transferred into the ion during (or near) ionisation. Therefore, the ion speed can be computed with the following equation, which relates kinetic energy to energy gain due to the electric field, the negative arising from the loss of electrons forming a net positive charge.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}mU_{\mathrm{ion}}^2 = -neV_1&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''U'' is the ion velocity. Solving for ''U'', the following relation is found:

:&lt;math&gt; U =\sqrt{ \frac{ 2neV_1}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

Let's say that for at a certain ionization voltage, a singly charged [[hydrogen]] ion acquires a resulting velocity of X&amp;nbsp;ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. A singly charged [[deuterium]] ion under the sample conditions would have acquired roughly X/1.41&amp;nbsp;ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. If a detector was placed at a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;m, the ion flight times would be 1/X and 1.41/X&amp;nbsp;s. Thus, the time of the ion arrival can be used to infer the ion type itself, if the evaporation time is known.

From the above equation, it can be re-arranged to show that

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{m}{n} = -\frac{2eV_1}{U^2} &lt;/math&gt;

given a known flight distance. F, for the ion, and a known flight time, t,

:&lt;math&gt; U = \frac{f}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

and thus one can substitute these values to obtain the mass-to-charge for the ion.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{m}{n} = -2eV_1 \left(\frac{t}{f}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus for an ion which traverses a 1&amp;nbsp;m flight path, across a time of 2000&amp;nbsp;ns, given an initial accelerating voltage of 5000&amp;nbsp;V (V in Si units is kg.m^2.s^-3.A^-1) and noting that one amu is 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, the mass-to-charge ratio (more correctly the mass-to-ionisation value ratio) becomes ~3.86 amu/charge. The number of electrons removed, and thus net positive charge on the ion is not known directly, but can be inferred from the histogram (spectrum) of observed ions.

=== Magnification ===
The magnification in an atom is due to the projection of ions radially away from the small, sharp tip. Subsequently, in the far field, the ions will be greatly magnified. This magnification is sufficient to observe field variations due to individual atoms, thus allowing in field ion and field evaporation modes for the imaging of single atoms.

The standard projection model for the atom probe is an emitter geometry that is based upon a revolution of a [[conic section]], such as a sphere, [[hyperboloid]] or [[paraboloid]]. For these tip models, solutions to the field may be approximated or obtained analytically. The magnification for a spherical emitter is inversely proportional to the radius of the tip, given a projection directly onto a spherical screen, the following equation can be obtained geometrically.

:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{r_{screen}}{r_{tip}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Where r&lt;sub&gt;screen&lt;/sub&gt; is the radius of the detection screen from the tip centre, and r&lt;sub&gt;tip&lt;/sub&gt; the tip radius. Practical tip to screen distances may range from several centimeters to several meters, with increased detector area required at larger to subtend the same [[field of view]].

Practically speaking, the usable magnification will be limited by several effects, such as lateral vibration of the atoms prior to evaporation.

Whilst the magnification of both the field ion and atom probe microscopes is extremely high, the exact magnification is dependent upon conditions specific to the examined specimen, so unlike for conventional [[electron microscope]]s, there is often little direct control on magnification, and furthermore, obtained images may have strongly variable magnifications due to fluctuations in the shape of the electric field at the surface.

=== Reconstruction ===
The computational conversion of the ion sequence data, as obtained from a position sensitive detector, to a three-dimensional visualisation of atomic types, is termed "reconstruction". Reconstruction algorithms are typically geometrically based, and have several literature formulations. Most models for reconstruction assume that the tip is a spherical object, and use empirical corrections to [[stereographic projection]] to convert detector positions back to a 2D surface embedded in 3D space, R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. By sweeping this surface through R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; as a function of the ion sequence input data, such as via ion-ordering, a volume is generated onto which positions the 2D detector positions can be computed and placed three-dimensional space.

Typically the sweep takes the simple form of an advancement of the surface, such that the surface is expanded in a symmetric manner about its advancement axis, with the advancement rate set by a volume attributed to each ion detected and identified. This causes the final reconstructed volume to assume a rounded-conical shape, similar to a badminton [[shuttlecock]]. The detected events thus become a [[point cloud]] data with attributed experimentally measured values, such as ion time of flight or experimentally derived quantities, e.g. time of flight or detector data.

This form of data manipulation allows for rapid computer visualisation and analysis, with data presented as point cloud data with additional information, such as each ion's mass to charge (as computed from the velocity equation above), voltage or other auxiliary measured quantity or computation therefrom.

=== Data features ===

The canonical feature of atom probe data, is its high spatial resolution in the direction through the material, which has been attributed to an ordered evaporation sequence. This data can therefore image near atomically sharp buried interfaces with the associated chemical information.

The data obtained from the evaporative process is however not without artefacts that form the physical evaporation or ionisation process. A key feature of the evaporation or field ion images is that the data density is highly inhomogeneous, due to the corrugation of the specimen surface at the atomic scale. This corrugation gives rise to strong electric field gradients in the near-tip zone (on the order of an atomic radii or less from the tip), which during ionisation deflects ions away from the electric field normal.

The resultant deflection means that in these regions of high curvature, atomic terraces are belied by a strong anisotropy in the detection density. Where this occurs due to a few atoms on a surface is usually referred to as a "pole", as these are coincident with the crystallographic axes of the specimen ([[Cubic crystal system|FCC]], [[Cubic crystal system|BCC]], [[Close-packing of spheres|HCP]]) etc.  Where the edges of an atomic terrace causes deflection, a low density line is formed and is termed a "zone line".

These poles and zone-lines, whilst inducing fluctuations in data density in the reconstructed datasets, which can prove problematic during post-analysis, are critical for determining information such as angular magnification, as the crystallographic relationships between features are typically well known.

When reconstructing the data, owing to the evaporation of successive layers of material from the sample, the lateral and in-depth reconstruction values are highly anisotropic. Determination of the exact resolution of the instrument is of limited use, as the resolution of the device is set by the physical properties of the material under analysis.

== Systems ==
Many designs have been constructed since the method's inception. Initial field ion microscopes, precursors to modern atom probes, were usually glass blown devices developed by individual research laboratories.

=== System layout ===
At a minimum, an atom probe will consist of several key pieces of equipment.

* A vacuum system for maintaining the low pressures (~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa) required, typically a classic 3 chambered UHV design.
* A system for manipulation of samples inside the vacuum, including sample viewing systems.  
* A cooling system to reduce atomic motion, such as a helium refrigeration circuit - providing sample temperatures as low as 15K.
* A high voltage system to raise the sample standing voltage near the threshold for field evaporation.
* A high voltage pulsing system, use to create timed field evaporation events
* A counter electrode that can be a simple disk shape (like the EIKOS™, or earlier generation atom probes), or a cone shaped Local Electrode, like on a LEAP® system.  The voltage pulse (negative) is typically applied to the counter electrode.  
* A detection system for single energetic ions that includes XY position and TOF information.

Optionally, an atom probe may also include laser-optical systems for laser beam targeting and pulsing, if using laser-evaporation methods. In-situ reaction systems, heaters, or plasma treatment may also be employed for some studies as well as pure noble gas introduction for FIM.

=== Performance ===

Collectable ion volumes were previously limited to several thousand, or tens of thousands of ionic events. Subsequent electronics and instrumentation development has increased the rate of data accumulation, with datasets of hundreds of million atoms (dataset volumes of 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).  Data collection times vary considerably depending upon the experimental conditions and the number of ions collected.  Experiments take from a few minutes, to many hours to complete.

== Applications ==

=== Metallurgy ===
Atom probe has typically been employed in the chemical analysis of alloy systems at the atomic level. This has arisen as a result of voltage pulsed atom probes providing good chemical and sufficient spatial information in these materials. Metal samples from large grained alloys may be simple to fabricate, particularly from wire samples, with hand-electropolishing techniques giving good results.

Subsequently, atom probe has been used in the analysis of the chemical composition of a wide range of alloys.

Such data is critical in determining the effect of alloy constituents in a bulk material, identification of solid-state reaction features, such as solid phase precipitates. Such information may not be amenable to analysis by other means (e.g. [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) owing to the difficulty in generating a three-dimensional dataset with composition.

=== Semiconductors ===
Semi-conductor materials are often analysable in atom probe, however sample preparation may be more difficult, and interpretation of results may be more complex, particularly if the semi-conductor contains phases which evaporate at differing electric field strengths.

Applications such as ion implantation may be used to identify the distribution of dopants inside a semi-conducting material, which is increasingly critical in the correct design of modern nanometre scale electronics.

==  Limitations ==

* Materials implicitly control achievable spatial resolution.
* Specimen geometry during the analysis is uncontrolled, yet controls projection behaviour, hence there is little control over the magnification. This induces distortions into the computer generated 3D dataset. Features of interest might evaporate in a physically different manner to the bulk sample, altering projection geometry and the magnification of the reconstructed volume. This yields strong spatial distortions in the final image.
* Volume selectability can be limited. Site specific preparation methods, e.g. using [[Focussed ion beam]] preparation, although more time consuming, may be used to bypass such limitations.
* Ion overlap in some samples (e.g. between oxygen and sulfur) resulted in ambiguous analysed species. This may be mitigated by selection of experiment temperature or laser input energy to influence the ionisation number (+, ++, 3+ etc.) of the ionised groups. Data analysis can be used in some cases to statistically recover ovelaps.
* Low molecular weight gases ([[Hydrogen]] &amp; [[Helium]]) may be difficult to be removed from the analysis chamber, and may be adsorbed and emitted from the specimen, even though not present in the original specimen. This may also limit identification of Hydrogen in some samples. For this reason, [[deuterated]] samples have been used to overcome limitations.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* Results may be contingent on the parameters used to convert the 2D detected data into 3D. In more problematic materials, correct reconstruction may not be done, due to limited knowledge of the true magnification; particularly if zone or pole regions cannot be observed.

An '''avulsion fracture''' is a [[bone fracture]] which occurs when a fragment of bone tears away from the main mass of bone as a result of [[physical trauma]].  This can occur at the [[ligament]] due to the application forces external to the body (such as a fall or pull) or at the [[tendon]] due to a muscular contraction that is stronger than the forces holding the bone together.  Generally muscular avulsion is prevented due to the neurological limitations placed on [[muscle contraction]]s.  Highly trained athletes can overcome this neurological inhibition of strength and produce a much greater force output capable of breaking or avulsing a bone.

== Treatment ==

If the fracture is small, it is usually sufficient to treat with rest and [[Splint (medicine)|support bandage]], but in more severe cases, surgery may be required. Ice may be used to relieve [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]].&lt;ref name="FirstRef"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]]|date=April 8, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2010|title=Avulsion fracture: How is it treated?|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/avulsion-fracture/AN00200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Displaced avulsion fractures are best managed by either [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|open reduction]] and internal fixation or closed reduction and pinning. Open reduction (using surgical incision) and [[internal fixation]] is used when pins, screws, or similar hardware is needed to fix the bone fragment.

==Dental avulsion==
{{Main article|Dental avulsion}}
[[dental trauma|Traumatic]] complete displacement of a [[tooth]] from its socket in [[alveolar bone]]. It is a serious [[dental emergency]] in which [[Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth|prompt management]] (within 20–40 minutes of injury) affects the [[prognosis]] of the tooth.&lt;ref name="AlDT"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y |title=Algorithm of first-aid management of dental trauma for medics and corpsmen |journal=Dent Traumatol |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=698–701 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19021668 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00649.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Tuberosity avulsion}}5th metatarsal tuberosity avulsion==
The [[tuberosity]] avulsion fracture (also known as '''pseudo-Jones fracture''' or '''dancer's fracture'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/825060-overview |title= Foot Fracture |author = Robert Silbergleit |publisher = Medscape.com |accessdate= October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a common fracture of the [[fifth metatarsal]] (the bone on the outside edge of the foot extending to the little toe).&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |title= Treatment Strategies for Acute Fractures and Nonunions of the Proximal Fifth Metatarsal |author= Gary A. Rosenberg |author2= James J. Sferra |last-author-amp= yes |date= September–October 2000 |volume = 8 |number= 5 |pages= 332–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fracture is likely caused by the lateral band of the [[plantar aponeurosis]] (tendon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= American Journal of Roentgenology |date= October 1984 |volume=143 |issue=4 |pages= 889–91 |title= Avulsion fracture of the fifth metatarsal: experimental study of pathomechanics |vauthors= Richli WR, Rosenthal DI |doi=10.2214/ajr.143.4.889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these fractures are treated with a hard-soled shoe or walking cast. This is needed until the pain goes away and then the patient can return to normal activities.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt; Healing is usually completed within eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= JC DeLee |title= Fractures and dislocations of the foot |editor= RA Mann |editor2= MJ Coughlin |work= Surgery of the Foot and Ankle |edition= 6th |location= St Louis |publisher= Mosby-Year Book |year= 1993 |volume= 2 |pages= 1627–1640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tibial tuberosity avulsion==
[[File:Avulsion fracture of tibial tuberosity, annotated.jpg|thumb|X-ray of a 15 year old male, showing an older avulsion fracture of the [[tibial tuberosity]].]]
A [[tibial tuberosity]] avulsion fracture is an incomplete or complete separation of the [[tibial tuberosity]] from the [[tibia]]. This occurs as a result of a violent [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of the [[Quadriceps femoris muscle|quadriceps muscles]], most often as a result of a high-power jump. Incomplete fractures are usually treatable with the traditional RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) method, but complete/displaced fractures will most often require surgery to pin the tuberosity back in place. Tibial tuberosity avulsions occur most often in teenagers that engage in a large amount of sporting activities, and many studies have shown a history with [[Osgood-Schlatter's disease]] to be linked to the fracture.

==Other animals==

===Dinosaurs===
In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and other [[paleontologists]] published a study examining evidence for [[tendon avulsions]] in [[theropod]] dinosaurs. Among the dinosaurs studied, [[Avulsion injuries]] were only noted among ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]''. [[Scars]] from these sorts of injuries were limited to the [[humerus]] and [[scapula]]. A divot on the humerus of [[Sue the T. rex|Sue the ''T. rex'']] was one such avulsion. The divot appears to be located at the origin of the [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]] or [[teres major]] muscles.  The localization in theropod scapulae as evidenced by the tendon avulsion in Sue suggests that theropods may have had a musculature more complex and functionally different from those of [[Origin of birds|their descendants]], the birds.&lt;ref name="rothschild-dino"&gt;Rothschild, B., Tanke, D. H., and Ford, T. L., 2001, Theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 331-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cefn-cerig road''', a road near Cefn-cerig Farm, [[Llandovery]], [[Wales]], is the location of the [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] (GSSP) which marks the boundary between the [[Aeronian]] and [[Telychian]] stages of the [[Silurian]] period on the [[geologic time scale]]. The GSSP was ratified in 1984.

The boundary is defined as a point immediately above the highest record of the [[brachiopod]] ''Eocoelia intermedia'' and below the [[first appearance datum|first appearance]] of the succeeding species ''Eocoelia curtisi''. The boundary also corresponds to the incoming of the [[acritarch]]s ''Deunffia monospinosa'', ''Domasia bispinosa'' and ''Pterospermella''.  The section, part of the [[Wormwood Formation]], is [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7669">'''Effective permittivity and permeability''' are averaged dielectric and magnetic characteristics of a microinhomogeneous medium. They are subject of [[Effective medium theory |Effective medium theory]] &lt;ref name="Choy"&gt; T.C. Choy, "Effective Medium Theory", Oxford University Press, (2016) 241 p.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are two widely used formulae &lt;ref name="Scheller"&gt; M. Scheller, C. Jansen, M. Koch, "Applications of Effective Medium Theories in the Terahertz Regime" in ''Recent Optical and Photonic Technologies'', ed. by K.Y. Kim, Intech, Croatia, Vukovar (2010), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;. They both were derived in [[Quasistatic approximation|quasi-static approximation]] when electric field inside a mixture particle may be considered as homogeneous. So, these formulae can not describe the particle size effect. Many attempts were undertaken to improve these formulae.

== Maxwell Garnett's formula ==

The first formula was proposed by J.C. Maxwell Garnett &lt;ref name="Garnet"&gt; J.C. Maxwell Garnett, "Colours in Metal Glasses and in Metallic Films", ''Philosophical Trans. of Royal Society of London. Ser. A'', (1904), Vol. 203, P. 385–420 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/90866?origin=JSTOR-pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Maxwell Garnett|Maxwell Garnett]] was the son of physicist [[William Garnett (professor)|William Garnett]], and was named after Garnett's friend, [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Clerk Maxwell]]. He proposed his formula to explain colored pictures that are observed in glasses doped with metal nanoparticles. His formula has a form

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{eff}=\epsilon_d\left[1+3c_m\frac{\epsilon_m-\epsilon_d}{\epsilon_m+2\epsilon_d-c_m(\epsilon_m-\epsilon_d)}\right], &lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;(1)&lt;/big&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is effective [[Permittivity|relative complex permittivity]]  of the mixture, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_d&lt;/math&gt; is relative complex permittivity of the background medium containing small spherical inclusions of relative permittivity &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_m&lt;/math&gt; with volume fraction of &lt;math&gt;c_m&lt;&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. This formula is based on the equality

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{eff}=\epsilon_d+c_m \frac{p_m}{\epsilon_0 E},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;(2)&lt;/big&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Vacuum permittivity|absolute permittivity of free space]] and &lt;math&gt;p_m&lt;/math&gt; is [[Electric dipole moment|electric dipole moment]] of a single inclusion induced by the external [[Electric field|electric field]] {{mvar|E}}. However this equality is good only for [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous medium]] and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_d=1&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover the formula (1) ignores the interaction between single inclusions. Because of these circumstances, formula (1) gives too narrow and too high resonant curve for plasmon excitations in metal nanoparticles of the mixture &lt;ref name="Belyaev"&gt; B.A. Belyaev, V.V. Tyurnev, "Electrodynamic calculation of effective electromagnetic parameters of a dielectric medium with metallic nanoparticles of a given size", ''Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics'', (2018), Vol. 127, Iss. 4, P. 608-619.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Bruggeman's formula ==

The second popular formula was proposed by D.A.G. Bruggeman &lt;ref name="Bruggeman"&gt; D.A.G. Bruggeman, "Berechnung verschiedener physikalischer Konstanten von heterogenen Substanzen",  ''Annalen der Physik'', (1935), Vol. 24, Iss. 5, P. 636–664.&lt;/ref&gt;. His formula has a form

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{eff}=\frac{H_b+\sqrt{H_b^2+8\epsilon_m \epsilon_d}}{4},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;H_b=(2-3c_m)\epsilon_d-(1-3c_m) \epsilon_m.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;(3)&lt;/big&gt;

Here positive sign before the square root must be altered to negative sign in some cases in order to get correct imaginary part of effective complex permittivity which is related with electromagnetic wave attenuation. This formula is based on the equality

&lt;math&gt;\Delta\Phi=\int \int \epsilon_r(\mathbf r)E_n (\mathbf r)ds-\epsilon_{eff} \int \int E_0,ds=0,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;(4)&lt;/big&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the jump of [[Electric displacement field|electric displacement]] flux all over the integration surface, &lt;math&gt;E_n(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt; is the component of microscopic electric field normal to the integration surface, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r (\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt; is the local relative complex permittivity which takes the value &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_m&lt;/math&gt; inside the picked metal particle, the value &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_d&lt;/math&gt; inside the picked dielectric particle and the value &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; outside the picked particle, &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is the normal component of the macroscopic electric field. Formula (4) comes out of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equality]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{div}(\epsilon_r\mathbf E)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus only one picked particle is considered in Bruggeman's approach. The interaction with all the other particles is taken into account only in mean field approximation described by &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{eff}&lt;/math&gt;. Formula (3) gives a reasonable resonant curve for plasmon excitations in metal nanoparticles if their size is 10 nm or smaller. But it is unable to describe the size dependence for the resonant frequency of plasmon excitations that are observed in experiment &lt;ref name="Oldenburg"&gt; S.J. Oldenburg, "Silver Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications", [https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/materials-science/nanomaterials/silver-nanoparticles.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formula describing size effect ==

A new formula describing size effect was proposed &lt;ref name="Belyaev"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. This formula has a form

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{eff}=\frac{H_{\epsilon}+i\sqrt{-H_{\epsilon}^2-8\epsilon_m \epsilon_dJ(k_ma)}}{4},&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H_{\epsilon}=(2-3c_m) \epsilon_d-(1-3c_m) \epsilon_m J(k_m a),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;(5)&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;math&gt;J(x)=2\frac{1-x\mathrm{cot}(x)}{x^2+x\mathrm{cot}(x)-1}&lt;/math&gt;,

where {{mvar|a}} is the nanoparticle radius and &lt;math&gt;k_m=\sqrt{\epsilon_m\mu_m\omega/c}&lt;/math&gt; is wave number. It is supposed here that the time dependence of the electromagnetic field is given by the factor &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{exp}(-i \omega t).&lt;/math&gt; In this paper Bruggeman's approach was used, but electromagnetic field for electric-dipole oscillation mode inside the picked particle was computed without applying [[Quasistatic approximation|quasi-static approximation]]. Thus the function &lt;math&gt;J(k_m a)&lt;/math&gt; is due to the field nonuniformity inside the picked particle. In quasi-static region &lt;math&gt;(k_m a&lt;&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 10 nm for Ag&lt;math&gt;)&lt;/math&gt; this function becomes constant &lt;math&gt;J(k_m a)=1&lt;/math&gt; and formula (5) becomes identical with Bruggeman's formula (3).

== Effective permeability formula ==

Formula for effective permeability of mixtures has a form &lt;ref name="Belyaev" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mu_{eff}=\frac{H_{\mu}+i\sqrt{-H_{\mu}^2-8\mu_m \mu_d J(k_m a)}}{4}, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;(6)&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H_{\mu}=(2-3c_m)\mu_d-(1-3c_m)\mu_m J(k_m a).&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mu_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is effective [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|relative complex permeability]] of the mixture, &lt;math&gt;\mu_d&lt;/math&gt; is relative complex permeability of the background medium containing small spherical inclusions of relative permeability &lt;math&gt;\mu_m&lt;/math&gt; with volume fraction of &lt;math&gt;c_m&lt;&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. This formula was derived in dipole approximation. Magnetic octupole mode and all other magnetic oscillation modes of odd orders were neglected here. When &lt;math&gt;\mu_m=\mu_d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_m a&lt;&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; this formula has a simple form

&lt;math&gt;\mu_{eff}=\mu_d \left( 1+\frac{c_m}{10} \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}a^2 \epsilon_m \right).  &lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;(7)&lt;/big&gt;

A '''Fibonacci prime''' is a [[Fibonacci number]] that is [[prime number|prime]], a type of [[integer sequence prime]].

The first Fibonacci primes are {{OEIS|id=A005478}}:

:[[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[13 (number)|13]], [[89 (number)|89]], [[233 (number)|233]], 1597, 28657, 514229, 433494437, 2971215073, ....

==Known Fibonacci primes==
{{unsolved|mathematics|Are there an infinite number of Fibonacci primes?}}
It is not known whether there are [[Infinity|infinitely]] many Fibonacci primes. With the indexing starting with {{nowrap|1=''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}, the first 34 are ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for the ''n'' values {{OEIS|id=A001605}}:
:''n'' = 3, 4&lt;!--DO NOT REMOVE 4. n is the index. n=4 gives the Fibonacci number F_4 = 3 which is prime so 4 belongs in this list.--&gt;, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 29, 43, 47, 83, 131, 137, 359, 431, 433, 449, 509, 569, 571, 2971, 4723, 5387, 9311, 9677, 14431, 25561, 30757, 35999, 37511, 50833, 81839, 104911.

In addition to these proven Fibonacci primes, there have been found [[probable prime]]s for
:''n'' = 130021, 148091, 201107, 397379, 433781, 590041, 593689, 604711, 931517, 1049897, 1285607, 1636007, 1803059, 1968721, 2904353, 3244369, 3340367.&lt;ref name="prptop"&gt;[http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/searchform.php?form=F%28n%29&amp;action=Search PRP Top Records, Search for : F(n)]. Retrieved 2018-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for the case ''n'' = 4, all Fibonacci primes have a prime index, because if ''a'' divides ''b'', then &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; also divides &lt;math&gt;F_b&lt;/math&gt;, but not every prime is the index of a Fibonacci prime.

''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is prime for 8 of the first 10 primes ''p''; the exceptions are ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; = 4181 = 37 &amp;times; 113. However, Fibonacci primes appear to become rarer as the index increases. ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is prime for only 26 of the 1,229 primes ''p'' below 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane's {{OEIS2C|A005478}}, {{OEIS2C|A001605}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of prime factors in the Fibonacci numbers with prime index are:
:0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 5, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 4, 2, 1, ... {{OEIS|A080345}}

{{As of|2017|03}}, the largest known certain Fibonacci prime is ''F''&lt;sub&gt;104911&lt;/sub&gt;, with 21925 digits. It was proved prime by Mathew Steine and Bouk de Water in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Caldwell, [https://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=120463 The Prime Database: U(104911)] from the [[Prime Pages]]. Status: Fibonacci number, [https://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=27 Elliptic Curve Primality Proof]. Retrieved 2018-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest known probable Fibonacci prime is ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3340367&lt;/sub&gt;. It was found by Henri Lifchitz in 2018.&lt;ref name="prptop"/&gt;
It was shown by Nick MacKinnon that the only Fibonacci numbers that are also members of the set of [[prime twins]] are 3, 5 and 13.&lt;ref&gt;N. MacKinnon, Problem 10844, Amer. Math. Monthly 109, (2002), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisibility of Fibonacci numbers==
A prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;F_{p-1}&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] ''p'' is [[Modular arithmetic|congruent]] to ±1 modulo 5, and ''p'' divides &lt;math&gt;F_{p+1}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if is congruent to ±2 modulo 5. (For ''p'' = 5, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 5 so 5 divides ''F''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)

Fibonacci numbers that have a prime index ''p'' do not share any common divisors greater than 1 with the preceding Fibonacci numbers, due to the identity:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paulo Ribenboim]], ''My Numbers, My Friends'', Springer-Verlag 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(F_n, F_m) = F_{\gcd(n,m)},&lt;/math&gt;

which implies the [[Euclid's theorem|infinitude of primes]].

For {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3}}, ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' divides ''F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' [[iff]] ''n'' divides ''m''.&lt;ref&gt;Wells 1986, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

If we suppose that ''m'' is a prime number ''p'', and ''n'' is less than ''p'', then it is clear that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, cannot share any common divisors with the preceding Fibonacci numbers.

:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(F_p, F_n) = F_{\gcd(p,n)} = F_1 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that ''F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' will always have characteristic factors or be a prime characteristic factor itself. The number of distinct prime factors of each Fibonacci number can be put into simple terms.

* ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''nk''&lt;/sub&gt; is a multiple of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for all values of n and k from 1 up.&lt;ref&gt;The mathematical magic of Fibonacci numbers [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibmaths.html#section2 Factors of Fibonacci numbers]&lt;/ref&gt; It's safe to say that ''F&lt;sub&gt;nk&lt;/sub&gt;'' will have "at least" the same number of distinct prime factors as ''F&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. All ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; will have no factors of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, but "at least" one new characteristic prime from [[Carmichael's theorem]].

* Carmichael's Theorem applies to all Fibonacci numbers except 4 special cases: &lt;math&gt;F_1 =F_2 =1, F_6 = 8&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{12} = 144.&lt;/math&gt; If we look at the prime factors of a Fibonacci number, there will be at least one of them that has never before appeared as a factor in any earlier Fibonacci number. Let ''π&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the number of distinct prime factors of ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. {{OEIS|id=A022307}}
::If ''k'' | ''n'' then &lt;math&gt;\pi_n \geqslant \pi_k +1&lt;/math&gt; except for &lt;math&gt;\pi_6 = \pi_3 =1.&lt;/math&gt;
::If ''k'' = 1, and ''n'' is an odd prime, then 1 | ''p'' and &lt;math&gt;\pi_p \geqslant \pi_1 +1 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

|}

The first step in finding the characteristic quotient of any ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is to divide out the prime factors of all earlier Fibonacci numbers ''F&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' for which ''k'' | ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;Jarden - Recurring sequences, Volume 1, Fibonacci quarterly, by Brother U. Alfred&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact quotients left over are prime factors that have not yet appeared.

If ''p'' and ''q'' are both primes, then all factors of ''F&lt;sub&gt;pq&lt;/sub&gt;'' are characteristic, except for those of ''F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''F&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\gcd (F_{pq}, F_q ) &amp;= F_{\gcd(pq, q)} = F_q \\
\gcd (F_{pq}, F_p ) &amp;= F_{\gcd(pq, p)} = F_p 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_{pq} \geqslant \begin{cases} \pi_p + \pi_q + 1 &amp; p\neq q \\ \pi_p + 1 &amp; p = q \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of distinct prime factors of the Fibonacci numbers with a prime index is directly relevant to the counting function. {{OEIS|id=A080345}}

==Rank of Apparition==

For a prime ''p'', the smallest index ''u'' &gt; 0 such that ''F&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' is divisible by ''p'' is called the '''rank of apparition''' (sometimes called '''Fibonacci entry point''') of ''p'' and denoted ''a''(''p''). The rank of apparition ''a''(''p'') is defined for every prime ''p''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEIS|A001602}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rank of apparition divides the [[Pisano period]] π(''p'') and allows to determine all Fibonacci numbers divisible by ''p''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Relation of the Period Modulo ''m'' to the Rank of Apparition of ''m'' in the Fibonacci Sequence |author=John Vinson |journal=Fibonacci Quarterly |volume=1 |year=1963 |pages=37–45 |url=http://www.fq.math.ca/Scanned/1-2/vinson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the divisibility of Fibonacci numbers by powers of a prime, &lt;math&gt;p \geqslant 3, n \geqslant 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p^n \mid F_{a(p)kp^{n-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular

:&lt;math&gt;p^2 \mid F_{a(p)p}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Wall-Sun-Sun primes ==
{{main article|Wall–Sun–Sun prime}}

A prime ''p'' ≠ 2, 5 is called a Fibonacci–Wieferich prime or a [[Wall-Sun-Sun prime]] if &lt;math&gt;p^2 \mid F_q,&lt;/math&gt; where 

:&lt;math&gt;q = p - \left(\frac{{p}}{{5}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{{p}}{{5}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Legendre symbol]] defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p}{5}\right) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; p \equiv \pm 1 \bmod 5\\ -1 &amp; p \equiv \pm 2 \bmod 5 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It is known that for ''p'' ≠ 2, 5, ''a''(''p'') is a divisor of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steven Vajda |title=Fibonacci and Lucas Numbers, and the Golden Section: Theory and Applications |series=Dover Books on Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p-\left(\frac{{p}}{{5}}\right) = \begin{cases} p-1 &amp; p \equiv \pm 1 \bmod 5\\ p+1 &amp; p \equiv \pm 2 \bmod 5 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

For every prime ''p'' that is not a Wall-Sun-Sun prime, &lt;math&gt;a(p^2) = p a(p)&lt;/math&gt; as illustrated in the table below:

{| class="wikitable"  style="text-align:right"
|-

| 2 || 3 || 5 || 7 || 11 || 13 || 17 || 19 || 23 || 29 || 31 || 37 || 41 || 43 || 47 || 53 || 59 || 61 
|-

| 3 || 4 || 5 || 8 || 10 || 7 || 9 || 18 || 24 || 14 || 30 || 19 || 20 || 44 || 16 || 27 || 58 || 15

The existence of Wall-Sun-Sun primes is conjectural.

==Fibonacci primitive part==
The [[primitive part]] of the Fibonacci numbers are
:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 13, 7, 17, 11, 89, 6, 233, 29, 61, 47, 1597, 19, 4181, 41, 421, 199, 28657, 46, 15005, 521, 5777, 281, 514229, 31, 1346269, 2207, 19801, 3571, 141961, 321, 24157817, 9349, 135721, 2161, 165580141, 211, 433494437, 13201, 109441, ... {{OEIS|id=A061446}}

The product of the primitive prime factors of the Fibonacci numbers are
:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 13, 7, 17, 11, 89, 1, 233, 29, 61, 47, 1597, 19, 4181, 41, 421, 199, 28657, 23, 3001, 521, 5777, 281, 514229, 31, 1346269, 2207, 19801, 3571, 141961, 107, 24157817, 9349, 135721, 2161, 165580141, 211, 433494437, 13201, 109441, 64079, 2971215073, 1103, 598364773, 15251, ... {{OEIS|id=A178763}}

The first case of more than one primitive prime factor is 4181 = 37 × 113 for &lt;math&gt;F_{19}&lt;/math&gt;.

The primitive part has a non-primitive prime factor in some cases. The ratio between the two above sequences is
:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, .... {{OEIS|id=A178764}}

The natural numbers ''n'' for which &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one primitive prime factor are
:3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 51, 52, 54, 56, 60, 62, 63, 65, 66, 72, 74, 75, 76, 82, 83, 93, 94, 98, 105, 106, 108, 111, 112, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 131, 132, 135, 136, 137, 140, 142, 144, 145, ... {{OEIS|id=A152012}}

[[If and only if]] a prime ''p'' is in this sequence, then &lt;math&gt;F_p&lt;/math&gt; is a Fibonacci prime, and if and only if 2''p'' is in this sequence, then &lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lucas prime]] (where &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lucas sequence]]), and if and only if 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is in this sequence, then &lt;math&gt;L_{2^{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt; is a Lucas prime.

Number of primitive prime factors of &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; are
:0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, ... {{OEIS|id=A086597}}

The least primitive prime factor of &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; are
:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 13, 7, 17, 11, 89, 1, 233, 29, 61, 47, 1597, 19, 37, 41, 421, 199, 28657, 23, 3001, 521, 53, 281, 514229, 31, 557, 2207, 19801, 3571, 141961, 107, 73, 9349, 135721, 2161, 2789, 211, 433494437, 43, 109441, 139, 2971215073, 1103, 97, 101, ... {{OEIS|id=A001578}}

| The North Brabantian flag dates from the Middle Ages and has the highest seniority among all Dutch province flags. The colours gules and argent have been used in Brabant standards, flags and pennants since the proclamation of the County of Louvain (942 CE) during the Lotharingian period. Later, the Duchy of Brabant continued using these colours. During the Middle Ages and the centuries after, the red and white would often be used. At the end of the 18th century, the flag fell into disuse. Since 1959, the red and white checkered flag has become the official flag of the province of North Brabant. See [[Flag of North Brabant]]

'''Folksonomy''' is the system in which users apply public [[Tag (metadata)|tags]]  to online items, typically to aid them in re-finding those items. This can give rise to a classification system based on those tags and their frequencies, in contrast to a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] classification specified by the owners of the content when it is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but online sharing and interaction expanded it into collaborative forms. '''Social tagging''' is the application of tags in an open online environment where the tags of other users are available to others. '''Collaborative tagging''' (also known as group tagging) is tagging performed by a group of users. This type of folksonomy is commonly used in cooperative and collaborative projects such as research, content repositories, and social bookmarking.

The term was coined by [[Thomas Vander Wal]] in 2004&lt;ref name="folksonomy-coinage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vander Wal, T. (2005). "[http://www.vanderwal.net/random/category.php?cat=153 Off the Top: Folksonomy Entries]." Visited November 5, 2005. See also: Smith, Gene. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20040828035712/http://atomiq.org/archives/2004/08/folksonomy_social_classification.html Atomiq: Folksonomy: social classification]." Aug 3, 2004. Retrieved January 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vanderwal.net/folksonomy.html Origin of the term]&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Volk (German word)|folk]]'' and ''[[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]''. Folksonomies became popular as part of [[social software]] applications such as [[social bookmarking]] and photograph annotation that enable users to collectively classify and find information via shared tags. Some websites include [[tag cloud]]s as a way to visualize tags in a folksonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Folksonomies can be used for K-12 education, business, and higher education. More specifically, folksonomies may be implemented for social bookmarking, teacher resource repositories, e-learning systems, collaborative learning, collaborative research, and professional development.

==Benefits and disadvantages==
Folksonomies are a trade-off between traditional centralized classification and no classification at all,&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, M., et al., ''An Overview of Social Tagging and Applications, in Social Network Data Analytics'', C.C. Aggarwal, Editor. 2011, Springer. p. 447-497.&lt;/ref&gt; and have several advantages:&lt;ref&gt;Quintarelli, E., ''Folksonomies: power to the people''. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathes, A., ''Folksonomies - Cooperative Classification and Communication Through Shared Metadata''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wal, T.V. ''Folksonomy''. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* tagging is easy to understand and do, even without training and previous knowledge in classification or indexing
* the vocabulary in a folksonomy directly reflects the user’s vocabulary
* folksonomies are flexible, in the sense that the user can add or remove tags
* tags consist of both popular content and long-tail content, enabling users to browse and discover new content even in narrow topics
* tags reflect the user’s conceptual model without cultural, social, or political bias
* enable the creation of communities, in the sense that users who apply the same tag have a common interest
* folksonomies are multi-dimensional, in the sense that users can assign any number and combination of tags to express a concept

There are several disadvantages with the use of tags and folksonomies as well,&lt;ref&gt;Kipp, M. and D.G. Campbell, ''Patterns and Inconsistencies in Collaborative Tagging Systems: An Examination of Tagging Practices''. Proceedings Annual General Meeting of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and some of the advantages (see above) can lead to problems. For example, the simplicity in tagging can result in poorly applied tags.&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, S., ''Folksonomies and Tagging: New developments in social bookmarking'', in Proceedings of Ark Group Conference: Developing and Improving Classification Schemes, 2007, Sydney. 2007: Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, while controlled vocabularies are exclusionary by nature,&lt;ref&gt;Kroski, E., The Hive Mind: ''Folksonomies and User-Based Tagging. 2005''&lt;/ref&gt; tags are often ambiguous and overly personalized.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, M. and E. Tonkin, ''Folksonomies: Tidying up Tags?'' D-Lib Magazine, 2006. 12(Number 1): p. 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Users apply tags to documents in many different ways and tagging systems also often lack mechanisms for handling [[Synonym|synonyms]], [[Acronym|acronyms]] and [[Homonym|homonyms]], and they also often lack mechanisms for handling [[spelling]] variations such as misspellings, [[Grammatical number|singular/plural]] form, [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] and [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] words. Some tagging systems do not support tags consisting of multiple words, resulting in tags like “viewfrommywindow”. Sometimes users choose specialized tags or tags without meaning to others.

==Elements and types==
A folksonomy emerges when users tag content or information, such as web pages, photos, videos, podcasts, tweets, scientific papers and others. Strohmaier et al.&lt;ref&gt;Strohmaier, M., C. Körner, and R. Kern, ''Understanding why users tag: A survey of tagging motivation literature and results from an empirical study''. Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, 2012. 17: p. 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; elaborate the concept: the term “tagging” refers to a "voluntary activity of users who are annotating resources with term-so-called 'tags' – freely chosen from an unbounded and uncontrolled vocabulary". Others explain tags as an unstructured textual label &lt;ref&gt;Ames, M.N.M., ''Why We Tag: Motivations for Annotation in Mobile and Online Media'', in SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems. 2007, ACM Press: New York, NY, USA. p. 971-980.&lt;/ref&gt; or keywords,&lt;ref&gt;Guy, M. and E. Tonkin, Folksonomies: ''Tidying up Tags?'' D-Lib Magazine, 2006. 12(Number 1): p. 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they appear as a simple form of metadata.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, C.H. and N. Montanez, ''Improved annotation of the blogosphere via autotagging and hierarchical clustering'', in WWW '06: Proceedings of the 15th international conference on World Wide Web. 2006, ACM Press: New York, NY, USA. p. 625-632.&lt;/ref&gt;

Folksonomies consist of three basic entities: users, tags, and resources. Users create tags to mark resources such as: web pages, photos, videos, and podcasts. These tags are used to manage, categorize and summarize online content. This collaborative tagging system also uses these tags as a way to index information, facilitate searches and navigate resources. Folksonomy also includes a set of URLs that are used to identify resources that have been referred to by users of different websites. These systems also include category schemes that have the ability to organize tags at different levels of granularity.&lt;ref name="Berlin, B. 1992"&gt;Berlin, B. (1992). Ethnobiological Classification. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vander Wal identifies two types of folksonomy: broad and narrow.&lt;ref name="Vander Wal"&gt;{{cite web |title=Explaining and Showing Broad and Narrow Folksonomies |url=http://www.vanderwal.net/random/entrysel.php?blog=1635 | last = Vander Wal | first=Thomas |accessdate= 2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A broad folksonomy arises when multiple users can apply the same tag to an item, providing information about which tags are the most popular. A narrow folksonomy occurs when users, typically fewer in number and often including the item's creator, tag an item with tags that can each be applied only once.  While both broad and narrow folksonomies enable the searchability of content by adding an associated word or phrase to an object, a broad folksonomy allows for sorting based on the popularity of each tag, as well as the tracking of emerging trends in tag usage and developing vocabularies.&lt;ref name="Vander Wal"/&gt;

An example of a broad folksonomy is [[Delicious (website)|del.icio.us]],  a website where users can tag any online resource they find relevant with their own personal tags. The photo-sharing website [[Flickr]] is an oft-cited example of a narrow folksonomy.

==Folksonomy vs. taxonomy==
'Taxonomy' refers to a hierarchical categorization in which relatively well-defined classes are nested under broader categories. A ''folksonomy'' establishes categories (each tag is a category) without stipulating or necessarily deriving a hierarchical structure of parent-child relations among different tags. (Work has been done on techniques for deriving at least loose hierarchies from clusters of tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laniado|first1=David|title=Using WordNet to turn a folksonomy into a hierarchy of concepts|journal=CEUR Workshop Proceedings|volume=314|issue=51|url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-314/51.pdf|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Supporters of folksonomies claim that they are often preferable to taxonomies because folksonomies democratize the way information is organized, they are more useful to users because they reflect current ways of thinking about domains, and they express more information about domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberger|first1=David|title=Folksonomy as Symbol|url=http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/?p=6254|website=Joho the Blog|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that folksonomies are messy and thus harder to use, and can reflect transient trends that may misrepresent what is known about a field.

An empirical analysis of the complex dynamics of tagging systems, published in 2007,&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref" &gt;Harry Halpin, Valentin Robu, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602 The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging], Proc. International Conference on World Wide Web, ACM Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that consensus around stable distributions and shared vocabularies does emerge, even in the absence of a central [[controlled vocabulary]]. For content to be searchable, it should be categorized and grouped. While this was believed to require commonly agreed on sets of content describing tags (much like keywords of a journal article), some research has found that in large folksonomies common structures also emerge on the level of categorizations.&lt;ref name="TWEB-ref" &gt;V. Robu, H. Halpin, H. Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1594173.1594176 Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems], ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), art. 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, it is possible to devise mathematical [[models of collaborative tagging]] that allow for translating from personal tag vocabularies (personomies) to the vocabulary shared by most users.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wetzker, Carsten Zimmermann, Christian Bauckhage, and Sahin Albayrak [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1718487.1718497 I tag, you tag: translating tags for advanced user models], Proc. International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, ACM Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Folksonomy is unrelated to [[folk taxonomy]], a cultural practice that has been widely documented in anthropological and [[folkloristics|folkloristic]] work. Folk taxonomies are culturally supplied, intergenerationally transmitted, and relatively stable classification systems that people in a given culture use to make sense of the entire world around them (not just the [[Internet]]).&lt;ref name="Berlin, B. 1992"/&gt;

The study of the structuring or classification of folksonomy is termed ''folksontology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heppnetz.de/files/vandammeheppsiorpaes-folksontology-semnet2007-crc.pdf | title=FolksOntology: An Integrated Approach for Turning Folksonomies into Ontologies | accessdate=April 20, 2012 | author=Van Damme, Céline|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This branch of [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] deals with the intersection between highly structured taxonomies or hierarchies and loosely structured folksonomy, asking what best features can be taken by both for a system of classification. The strength of flat-tagging schemes is their ability to relate one item to others like it. Folksonomy allows large disparate groups of users to collaboratively label massive, dynamic information systems. The strength of taxonomies are their browsability: users can easily start from more generalized knowledge and target their queries towards more specific and detailed knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Trattner, C., Körner, C., Helic, D.: [http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/iknow2011.pdf Enhancing the Navigability of Social Tagging Systems with Tag Taxonomies]. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Technologies, ACM, New York, NY, USA, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Folksonomy looks to categorize tags and thus create browsable spaces of information that are easy to maintain and expand.

== Social tagging for knowledge acquisition ==
Social tagging for knowledge acquisition is the specific use of tagging for finding and re-finding specific content for an individual or group. Social tagging systems differ from traditional taxonomies in that they are community-based systems lacking the traditional hierarchy of taxonomies. Rather than a top-down approach, social tagging relies on users to create the folksonomy from the bottom up.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Held, C., &amp; Cress, U. (2009). Learning by Foraging: The impact of social tags on knowledge acquisition. In Learning in the synergy of multiple disciplines (pp. 254-266). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common uses of social tagging for knowledge acquisition include personal development for individual use and collaborative projects. Social tagging is used for knowledge acquisition in secondary, post-secondary, and graduate education as well as personal and business research. The benefits of finding/re-finding source information are applicable to a wide spectrum of users. Tagged resources are located through search queries rather than searching through a more traditional file folder system.&lt;ref&gt;Fu, W. (2008). The microstructures of social tagging: a rational model. In: Proceedings of the ACM 2008 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, pp. 229–238. ACM, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The social aspect of tagging also allows users to take advantage of metadata from thousands of other users.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Users choose individual tags for stored resources. These tags reflect personal associations, categories, and concepts. All of which are individual representations based on meaning and relevance to that individual. The tags, or keywords, are designated by users. Consequently, tags represent a user’s associations corresponding to the resource. Commonly tagged resources include videos, photos, articles, websites, and email.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kimmerle, J., Cress, U., &amp; Held, C. (2010). The interplay between individual and collective knowledge: technologies for organisational learning and knowledge building. Knowledge Management Research &amp; Practice, 8(1), 33-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Tags are beneficial for a couple of reasons. First, they help to structure and organize large amounts of digital resources in a manner that makes them easily accessible when users attempt to locate the resource at a later time. The second aspect is social in nature, that is to say that users may search for new resources and content based on the tags of other users. Even the act of browsing through common tags may lead to further resources for knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tags that occur more frequently with specific resources are said to be more strongly connected. Furthermore, tags may be connected to each other. This may be seen in the frequency in which they co-occur. The more often they co-occur, the stronger the connection. Tag clouds are often utilized to visualize connectivity between resources and tags. Font size increases as the strength of association increases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Tags show interconnections of concepts that were formerly unknown to a user. Therefore, a user’s current cognitive constructs may be modified or augmented by the metadata information found in aggregated social tags. This process promotes knowledge acquisition through cognitive irritation and equilibration. This theoretical framework is known as the co-evolution model of individual and collective knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The co-evolution model focuses on cognitive conflict in which a learner’s prior knowledge and the information received from the environment are dissimilar to some degree.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When this incongruence occurs, the learner must work through a process cognitive equilibration in order to make personal cognitive constructs and outside information congruent. According to the coevolution model, this may require the learner to modify existing constructs or simply add to them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The additional cognitive effort promotes information processing which in turn allows individual learning to occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Francis Alfred Broad''' [[Justice of the peace|JP]] (1874 &amp;ndash; 3 January 1956), usually known as '''Frank Broad''', was a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour politician]] in the [[United Kingdom]] who served as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Municipal Borough of Edmonton]] during the years 1922&amp;ndash;1931 and 1935&amp;ndash;1945.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr F A Broad|newspaper=The Times|date=4 January 1956|agency=Galegroup via Cambridgeshire libraries|page=11|id=Issue 53419; col C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HansardPeople&gt;{{cite web|last=Broad|first=Francis|title=Hansard 1805-2005 People|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-francis-broad|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the founder members{{#tag:ref|A printed union membership card suggests F.

He remained a member of the AEU until his death,&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt; stating in [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|the commons]] in 1931 that "...

In July 1923, on the subject of birth control, Broad "... asked the Minister of Health whether his Department will raise any objection to birth control information being given at infant welfare centres to married women who desire it by voluntary workers attached to the centres, or otherwise to their being informed, on request, where such information can be obtained?". [[Neville Chamberlain|Mr Chamberlain]] replied that his "... view is that such information as is referred to should not be given at infant welfare centres, but that women for whom it appears to be needed on medical grounds should be referred to a private doctor or a hospital".&lt;ref&gt;{{ukhansard | house=HC | date= 25 July 1923| vol= 167| c= 480W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1924, Broad led a delegation of the [[Birth control#Etymology and movement|birth control movement]] to the then health minister, [[Clydesdale]] MP [[John Wheatley]]. The delegates included [[H G Wells]], the Hon.

[[File:Geneticcounseling.jpg|thumb|A Genetic Counselor]]
A '''geneticist''' is a [[biologist]] who studies [[genetics]], the science of [[genes]], [[heredity]], and [[genetic variation|variation]] of [[organism]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Career Opportunities in Science|last=Echaore-McDavid|first=Susan|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2008|isbn=1438117159|location=|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A geneticist can be employed as a [[scientist]] or [[lecturer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Geneticists perform general research on genetic processes as well as development of genetic technologies to aid in the medicine and agriculture industries&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Some geneticists perform experiments in model organisms such as [[Drosophila]], [[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]], [[Zebrafish]], [[rodents]] or [[Humans]] and analyze data to interpret the inheritance of biological traits. A geneticist can be a [[scientist]] who has earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in [[Genetics]] or a [[physician]] (who has earned any of the following medical degrees: [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS/MBChB]] (non-U.S.), [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] (U.S.-only), or [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]) who has been trained in genetics as a specialization. They evaluate, diagnose, and manage patients with [[hereditary disorder|hereditary conditions or congenital malformations]], [[Genetic counseling|genetic risk calculation]]s, and [[mutation analysis]] as well as refer patients to other medical specialties.  The geneticist carries out studies, tests and counsels patients with genetic disorders.

Geneticists participate in courses from many areas, such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[microbiology]], [[cell biology]], [[bioinformatics]], and [[mathematics]]. They also participate in more specific genetics courses such as [[molecular genetics]], transmission genetics, [[population genetics]], [[quantitative genetics]], [[ecological genetics]], and [[genomics]].

Geneticists can work in many different fields, doing a variety of jobs. There are many careers for geneticists in [[medical genetics|medicine]], [[agriculture]], [[wildlife]], general sciences, or many other fields.

The '''Gravity and Extreme Magnetism SMEX''' ('''GEMS''') mission was a cancelled space observatory mission. The main scientific goal of GEMS was to be the first mission to systematically measure the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of cosmic [[X-ray astronomy|X-Ray]] sources. GEMS would have provided data to help scientists study the shape of space that has been distorted by a spinning [[black hole]]'s gravity and the structure and effects of the magnetic fields around [[Neutron star]]s.  It was cancelled by [[NASA]] in June 2012 for potential cost overruns due to delays in developing the technology.

GEMS was managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [[NASA]], the United States space agency, at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. The project was an [[astrophysics]] program reporting to NASA's [[Science Mission Directorate]] (SMD) in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name="SMDGEMSpageMay2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/missions/gems/|title=NASA Science Mission Directorate GEMS Site|publisher=NASA|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft would have been launched on in July 2014 on a nine-month mission with a possible 15-month extension for a guest observer phase;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AAS...21548113K GEMS], [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]], accessed 2011-05-23&lt;/ref&gt; but the mission was terminated at the Confirmation Review stage on May 10, 2012 due to expected cost overruns.

Cancelled missions can be reinstated{{mdash}}for example [[NuSTAR]] was cancelled in 2006, but reinstated a year later and launched in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/06/orbitals-pegasus-launch-nasas-nustar-spacecraft/ W. Graham - Orbital’s Pegasus successfully launches NASA’s NuSTAR spacecraft (June 13th, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, NuSTAR was not cancelled due to project overruns, but rather due to changes in the overall NASA budget, so the circumstances for cancellation were very different. Small missions of the Explorer program offer a lot of flexibility and launch opportunities, and the lessons learned can be applied to the same missions goals, but on a different mission (Compare [[Vanguard 1]] to [[Explorer 1]]). Several years later two new X-ray polarimetry mission won a NASA award to develop a X-ray polarimetry missions.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-proposals-to-study-neutron-stars-black-holes-and-more NASA Selects Proposals to Study Neutron Stars, Black Holes and More]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
[[File:GEMS MoviePoster.jpg|thumb|Mission poster for the GEMS telescope]]
The GEMS [[X-ray telescope]] was designed to indirectly measure the regions of distorted space around spinning [[black hole]]s through a measurement of the polarization of X-rays emitted. It will thereby probe the structure and effects of the [[magnetic field]] around [[magnetar]]s and dead stars with magnetic fields trillions of times stronger than Earth's.

GEMS could reveal:
* How spinning black holes affect space-time and matter as they are drawn in and compressed by strong gravitational fields.
* What happens in the super strong magnetic fields near pulsars and magnetars.
* How cosmic rays are accelerated by shocks in supernova remnants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/gems.html|title=Proposed NASA Mission Could Explore Twisted Space Around Black Holes|date=2008-06-30|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current missions cannot do this because the required [[angular resolution]] is limited and magnetic fields are invisible.

The detector in GEMS would have been a small chamber filled with gas. When an X-ray is absorbed in the gas, an electron carries off most of the energy, and starts out in a direction related to the polarization direction of the X-ray. This electron loses energy by ionizing the gas; the instrument measures the direction of the ionization track, and thereby the polarization of the X-ray. The GEMS detector readout will employ a time projection chamber to image the track. The GEMS instrument is about 100 times more sensitive than previous X-ray polarization experiments.

Mission costs were capped at [[US$]]105 million (in Fiscal Year 2008 dollars), excluding the launch vehicle,&lt;ref name="SMEX2"/&gt; but an independent confirmation review board at NASA claimed it would grow to an estimated $150 million, leading to cancellation of the mission.

The cancellation of GEMS marks the end of a multi-year-long binge of cancellations and attempted cancellations of current and future missions: it was at the time the last funded future U.S. space telescope besides JWST. The cancellation of GEMS may have jeopardized the  [[Pegasus XL]] launcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/civil/1206-demise-gems-cost-orbital-jobs.html D. Leone - Demise of GEMS May Cost Orbital 150 Jobs, Doom Pegasus (2012) - Space News]&lt;/ref&gt; (The Pegasus XL has successfully launched other small explorer missions)

==Project Status==

GEMS was one of six Small Explorer missions selected in May 2008 for the [[NASA]] [[Small Explorer]] (SMEX) Program Phase A study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/may/HQ_C08029_SMEX_Awards.html NASA Selects Small Explorer Investigations for Concept Studies], [[NASA]] media release C08-029, 2008-05-29, accessed 2009-08-14&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, GEMS was chosen to be the second of these missions to go forward into Phase B, starting in October 2010 for a launch in April 2014.&lt;ref name="SMEX2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/jun/HQ_09-141_SMEX_Selections.html|title=NASA Awards Two Small Explorer Development Contracts|publisher=NASA|date=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project completed and successfully passed the Systems Requirements Review (SRR) [[Design review (US Government)]] in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/welcome/ NASA SMD Astrophysics Program Letter], [[NASA]], 2011-04-28, accessed 2010-05-23&lt;/ref&gt;

GEMS  did not pass a confirmation review conducted on 2012-05-10, which effectively cancelled the project. The project team intended to appeal the cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacenews.com/civil/nasa-cancel-gems-x-ray-telescope.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203005819/http://spacenews.com/civil/nasa-cancel-gems-x-ray-telescope.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 February 2013 |title=NASA To Cancel GEMS X-Ray Telescope |publisher=Space News |date=4 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA on June 7, 2012 announced the cancellation of the GEMS project. The Gravity and Extreme Magnetism Small Explorer mission was supposed to blast off in 2014 to study black holes and neutron stars. But external reviews found the project would likely come in over budget. GEMS was supposed to hold at $119 million, not counting the rocket. NASA's astrophysics director, Paul Hertz, says the technology needed for the instrument took longer to develop than expected, and that drove up the price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2012-06-nasa-gems-x-ray-telescope-blames.html NASA kills GEMS X-ray telescope, blames project's cost]&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA later studied X-ray polarimetry missions in 2015 for future explorer program observatories.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt; Just as Galileo once turned his new telescope skyward to study the heavens, NASA continues to develop new telescopes that shed light on the Earth's universe

The '''Grévy's zebra''' (''Equus grevyi''), also known as the '''imperial zebra''', is the largest living wild [[equid]] and the largest and most threatened of the three species of [[zebra]], the other two being the [[plains zebra]] and the [[mountain zebra]]. Named after [[Jules Grévy]], it is the sole extant member of the subgenus ''Dolichohippus''. Grévy's zebra is found in [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]]. Compared with other zebras, it is tall, has large ears, and its stripes are narrower.

The Grévy's zebra lives in semi-arid grasslands where it feeds on [[grass]]es, [[legumes]], and [[Browsing (predation)|browse]]; it can survive up to five days without water. It differs from the other zebra species in that it does not live in [[Harem (zoology)#Harem|harems]] and has few long-lasting social bonds. Male territoriality and mother–foal relationships form the basis of the social system of the Grévy's zebra. This zebra is considered to be [[endangered]]. Its population has declined from 15,000 to 3,000 since the 1970s. However, as of 2008, the population is stable.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The Grévy's zebra was first described by French naturalist [[Émile Oustalet]] in 1882. He named it after [[Jules Grévy]], then [[president of France]], who, in the 1880s, was given one by the government of [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]. Traditionally, this species was classified in the subgenus ''Dolichohippus'' with [[plains zebra]] and [[mountain zebra]] in ''Hippotigris''. Fossils of zebra-like equids have been found throughout Africa and Asia in the [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] deposits.&lt;ref name="Prothero 2003"/&gt; Notable examples include ''E. sanmeniensis'' from China, ''E. cautleyi'' from India, ''E. valeriani'' from central Asia and ''E. oldowayensis'' from East Africa.&lt;ref name="Prothero 2003"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horns, Tusks, and Flippers: The Evolution of Hoofed Mammals'|author1=Prothero D.R |author2=Schoch R.

The [[Mane (horse)|mane]] is tall and erect; juveniles have a mane that extends to the length of the back and shortens as they reach adulthood.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt;

As with all zebra species, the Grevy's zebra's pelage has a black and white striping pattern. The stripes are narrow and close-set, being broader on the neck, and they extend to the hooves.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; The belly and the area around the base of the tail lack stripes which is unique to the Grevy's zebra. Foals are born with brown and white striping, with the brown stripes darkening as they grow older.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; [[Embryology|Embryological]] evidence has shown that the zebra's background colour is dark and the white is an addition.&lt;ref name="Prothero 2003"/&gt; The stripes of the zebra may serve to make it look bigger than it actually is or disrupt its outline. It appears that a stationary zebra can be inconspicuous at night or in shade.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; Experiments have suggested that the stripes polarize light in such a way that it discourages biting [[Horse-fly|horse-flies]] in a manner not shown with other coat patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egri | first1 = Ádám | last2 = Blahó | first2 = Miklós | last3 = Kriska | first3 = György | last4 = Farkas | first4 = Róbert | last5 = Gyurkovszky | first5 = Mónika | last6 = Åkesson | first6 = Susanne | last7 = Horváth | first7 = Gábor | year = 2012 | title = Polarotactic tabanids find striped patterns with brightness and/or polarization modulation least attractive: an advantage of zebra stripes | url = | journal = J Exp Biol | volume = 215 | issue = Pt 5| pages = 736–745 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.065540 | pmid=22323196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest that, when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, via two [[visual illusion]]s, the [[wagon wheel effect]], where the perceived motion is inverted, and the [[barber pole illusion]], where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944200613000974 | title=Motion camouflage induced by zebra stripes |author1=How, Martin J. |author2=Zanker, Johannes M. | journal=Zoology | year=2014 | pages=163–170 | doi=10.1016/j.zool.2013.10.004 | pmid=24368147 | volume=117| issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range and ecology==
[[File:Equus grevyi in Samburu.jpg|thumb|left|Zebra in dense brush]]
The Grévy’s zebra largely inhabits northern [[Kenya]], with some isolated populations in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="Kingdon 1988"/&gt;{{rp|147}}&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; It was [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from [[Somalia]] and [[Djibouti]] and its status in [[South Sudan]] is uncertain.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{IUCN2008|assessor=Moehlman, P.D.|assessor2=Rubenstein, D.I.|assessor3=Kebede, F.|last-assessor-amp=yes|year=2008|id=7950|title=Equus grevyi|downloaded=10 April 2009}} Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is endangered.&lt;/ref&gt; It lives in ''[[Acacia]]''-''[[Commiphora]]'' bushlands and barren plains.&lt;ref name="Estes 1991"/&gt; Ecologically, this species is intermediate between the arid-living [[African wild ass]] and the water-dependent plains zebra.&lt;ref name="Estes 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingdon 1988"/&gt;{{rp|147}} [[Lactation|Lactating]] females and non-territorial males use areas with green, short grass and medium, dense bush more often than non-lactating females and territorial males.&lt;ref name="Sundaresan 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sundaresan|first1=Siva R.|last2=Fischhoff|first2=Ilya R.|last3=Hartung|first3=Helen M.|last4=Akilong|first4=Patrick|last5=Rubenstein|first5=Daniel I.|year=2008|title= Habitat choice of Grevy's zebras (''Equus grevyi'') in Laikipia, Kenya|journal= African Journal of Ecology|volume= 46|issue= 3|pages= 359–64|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2028.2007.00848.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grévy's zebras rely on [[grass]]es, [[legume]]s, and [[Browsing (predation)|browse]] for nutrition.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; They commonly browse when grasses are not plentiful.&lt;ref name="Estes 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bauer |first1=I.

==Behaviour and life history==
[[File:Zebre grevy 2.jpg|thumb|right|Herd of zebras]]
Adult males mostly live in territories during the wet seasons but some may stay in them year round if there's enough water left.&lt;ref name="Estes 1991"/&gt; Stallions that are unable to establish territories are free-ranging&lt;ref name="Kingdon 1988"/&gt;{{rp|151}} and are known as bachelors. Females, young and non-territorial males wander through large home ranges. The females will wander from territory to territory preferring the ones with the highest-quality food and water sources.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg 1990"/&gt; Up to nine males may compete for a female outside of a territory.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; Territorial stallions will tolerate other stallions who wander in their territory, however when an oestrous female is present the territorial stallion keeps other males at bay.&lt;ref name="Estes 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingdon 1988"/&gt;{{rp|151}} Non-territorial males may avoid territorial ones because of harassment.&lt;ref name="Sundaresan 2008"/&gt; When females are not around, a territorial stallion will seek the company of other stallions. The stallion shows his dominance with an arched neck and a high-stepping gait and the least dominant stallions submit by extending their tail, lowering their heads and nuzzling their superior's chest or groin.&lt;ref name="Kingdon 1988"/&gt;{{rp|151}}

Zebras produce numerous sounds and vocalisations, when alarmed, they produce deep hoarse grunts. Whistling and squealing are made when alarmed, during fights, or when scared or in pain. Snorting may be produced when scared or as a warning. A male will bray in defense of its territory, when driving females, or keeping other males at bay. Barking may be made during copulation and distressed foals will squeal.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; The call of the Grévy's zebra has been described as "something like a [[hippo]]'s grunt combined with a [[donkey]]'s wheeze".&lt;ref name="Estes 1991"/&gt; To get rid of flies or parasites, they roll in dust, water or mud or, in the case of flies, twitch their skin. They also rub against trees, rocks and other objects to get rid of irritations like itchy skin, hair or parasites.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; Although Grévy's zebras do not perform [[Social grooming|mutual grooming]], they do sometimes rub against a conspecific.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Grevy Zebra.jpg|thumb|left|Zebra foal resting]]
Grévy's zebras can mate and give birth year-round, but most mating takes place in the early rainy seasons and births mostly take place in August or September after the long rains.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Churcher C.S. | year = 1993 | title = Equus grevyi | url = http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-453-01-0001.pdf | journal = Mammalian Species | volume = 453 | issue = 453| pages = 1–9 | doi=10.2307/3504222| jstor = 3504222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Estrous#Estrus|oestrous]] mare may visit though as many as four territories a day&lt;ref name="Ginsberg 1990"/&gt; and will mate with the stallions in them. Among territorial stallions, the most dominant ones control territories near water sources, which mostly attract mares with dependant foals,&lt;ref name="Rubenstein 2010"/&gt; while more subordinate stallions control territories away from water with greater amounts of vegetation, which mostly attract mares without dependant foals.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein 2010"&gt;Rubenstein, D.

Gestation of the Grévy's zebra normally lasts 390 days,&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; with a single foal being born. A newborn zebra will follow anything that moves, so new mothers prevent other mares from approaching their foals while imprinting their own striping pattern, scent and vocalisation on them.&lt;ref name="Churcher 1993"/&gt; Females with young foals may gather into small groups.&lt;ref name="Becker 1990"/&gt; Mares may leave their foals in "kindergartens" while searching for water.&lt;ref name="Becker 1990"/&gt; The foals will not hide, so they can be vulnerable to predators.&lt;ref name="Estes 1991"/&gt; However, kindergartens tend to be protected by an adult, usually a territorial male.&lt;ref name="Becker 1990"/&gt; A female with a foal stays with one dominant territorial male who has exclusive mating rights to her.

==Relationship with humans==
[[File:Equus grevyi 1882 (a).jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of the zebra given to Jules Grévy and kept at the [[Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes]] in 1882]]
The Grévy's zebra was known to the Europeans in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and was used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in [[circuses]].&lt;ref name="Prothero 2003"/&gt; It was subsequently forgotten in the Western world for a thousand years.&lt;ref name="Prothero 2003"/&gt; In the seventeenth century, the king of [[Shewa|Shoa]] (now central Ethiopia) exported two zebras; one to the Sultan of Turkey and another to the Dutch governor of [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref name="Prothero 2003"/&gt; A century later, in 1882, the government of Abyssinia sent one to French president [[Jules Grévy]]. It was at that time that the animal was recognised as its own species and named in Grévy’s honour.&lt;ref name="Prothero 2003"/&gt;

===Status and conservation===
[[File:Samburu Grevy's zebra.jpg|thumb|left|Grevy's zebras in [[Samburu National Reserve]]]]
The Grévy's zebra is considered [[endangered]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Its population was estimated to be 15,000 in the 1970s and by the early 21st century the population was lower than 3,500, a 75% decline.&lt;ref name="Moelman 2002"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Equids. Zebras, Asses and Horses. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan'|author= Moelman, P.D|chapter= Status and Action Plan for the Grévy's Zebra (''Equus grevyi'') by Stuart D. Williams|publisher= IUCN/SSC Equid Specialist Group|pages= 11–27|year=2002|isbn=978-2-831-70647-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} It is estimated that there are less than 2,500 Grévy's zebras still living in the wild.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; There are also an estimated 600 Grévy's zebras in captivity.&lt;ref name="Moelman 2002"/&gt;{{rp|20}} Captive herds have been known to thrive, like at [[White Oak Conservation]] in [[Yulee, Florida]], United States, where more than 70 foals have been born. There, research is underway in partnership with the Conservation Centers for Species Survival on semen collection and freezing and on artificial insemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grevy's Zebra|url=http://www.whiteoakwildlife.org/animal-programs/grevys-zebra/|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grévy's zebra population trend is considered stable as of 2008.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

The Grévy's zebra is legally protected in Ethiopia. In Kenya, it is protected by the hunting ban of 1977. In the past, Grévy's zebras were threatened mainly by hunting for their skins which fetched a high price on the world market. However, hunting has declined and the main threat to the zebra is habitat loss and competition with livestock. Cattle gather around watering holes and the Grévy's zebras are fenced from those areas.&lt;ref name="Moelman 2002"/&gt;{{rp|17}} Community-based conservation efforts have shown to be the most effective in preserving Grévy's zebras and their habitat. Less than 0.5% of the range of the Grévy's zebra is in protected areas. In Ethiopia, the protected areas include Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve, [[Yabelo Wildlife Sanctuary]], Borana Controlled Hunting Area and Chalbi Sanctuary. In Kenya, important protected areas include the [[Buffalo Springs National Reserve|Buffalo Springs]], [[Samburu National Reserve|Samburu]] and [[Shaba National Reserve|Shaba]] National Reserves and the private and community land wildlife conservancies in Isiolo, Samburu and the Laikipia Plateau.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

The [[mesquite]] plant was introduced into Ethiopia around 1997 and is endangering the zebra's food supply. An invasive species, it is replacing the two grass species, ''Cenchrus ciliaris'' and ''Chrysopogon plumulosus,'' which the zebras eat for most of their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Devil Tree Threatens the World's Rarest Zebras|url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/devil-tree-zebras/|accessdate = 2015-08-07|first = John R.|last = Platt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Livestock-Mediated Dispersal of Prosopis juliflora Imperils Grasslands and the Endangered Grévy's Zebra in Northeastern Ethiopia|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550742415000962|journal = Rangeland Ecology &amp; Management|doi = 10.1016/j.rama.2015.07.002|first = Almaz T.|last = Kebede|first2 = D.|last2 = Layne Coppock|volume=68|issue = 5|pages=402–407|date = September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22428">The '''history of chromatography''' spans from the mid-19th century to the 21st.  [[Chromatography]], literally "color writing",&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=chromatography|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chromatography&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used&amp;mdash;and named&amp;mdash; in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant [[pigments]] such as [[chlorophyll]] (which is green) and [[carotenoid]]s (which are orange and yellow).  New forms of chromatography developed in the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for a wide range of [[separation process]]es and [[chemical analysis]] tasks, especially in [[biochemistry]].

==Precursors==

The earliest use of chromatography&amp;mdash;passing a mixture through  an inert material to create separation of the solution components based on differential [[adsorption]]&amp;mdash;is sometimes attributed to German chemist [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]], who in 1855 described the use of paper to analyze [[dye]]s.  Runge dropped spots of different inorganic chemicals onto circles of filter paper already impregnated with another chemical, and reactions between the different chemicals created unique color patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Runge placed drops of reactant solutions on blotting paper and then added a drop of a second reactant solution on top of the first drop.  The solutions would react as they spread through the blotting paper, often producing colored patterns.  His results were published in two books:
*  F. F. Runge, ''Farbenchemie.  Musterbilder für Freunde des Schönen und zum Gebrauch für Zeichner, Maler, Verzierer und Zeugdrucker, dargestellt durch chemische Wechselwirkung'' [Color chemistry.  Sample images for friends of beauty and for use by sketchers, painters, decorators, and printers, prepared by chemical interaction] (Berlin, (Germany):  (Self-published), 1850).
*  F. F. Runge, ''Der Bildungstrieb der Stoffe, veranschaulicht in selbstständig gewachsenen Bilder'' [The formative tendency of substances illustrated by autonomously developed images] (Oranienburg, (Germany):  (Self-published), 1855).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to historical analysis of L. S. Ettre, however, Runge's work had "nothing to do with chromatography" (and instead should be considered a precursor of chemical [[spot test]]s such as the [[Schiff test]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Ettre = Leslie Stephen Ettre (1922-2010), Hungarian-American chemist, author of several publications on the history of chromatography.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] and his student [[Friedrich Goppelsroeder]] published the first attempts to study the different rates at which different substances move through filter paper.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Schönbein (1861) [https://books.google.com/books?id=V3AxAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ueber einige durch die Haarröhrchenanziehung des Papiers hervorgebrachten Trennungswirkungen"] (On some separation effects produced by capillary attraction of paper), ''Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft zu Basel'',  '''3''' (2) : 249-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Goppelsröder (1861) [https://books.google.com/books?id=V3AxAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ueber ein Verfahren, die Farbstoffe in ihren Gemischen zu erkennen"] (On a method for detecting the colorings in mixtures of them), ''Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft zu Basel'', '''3''' (2) :  268-275.&lt;br&gt;
See also:  Friedrich Goppelsroeder, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mVM4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Capillaranalyse beruhend auf Capillaritäts- und Adsorptionserscheinungen'' …] [Capillary analysis based on phenomena of capillarity and adsorption … ] (Basel, Switzerland:  Emil Birkhäuser, 1901).&lt;/ref&gt;  Schönbein, who thought [[capillary action]] (rather than adsorption) was responsible for the movement, called the technique [[capillary analysis]], and Goppelsroeder spent much of his career using capillary analysis to test the movement rates of a wide variety of substances.  Unlike modern paper chromatography, capillary analysis used reservoirs of the substance being analyzed, creating overlapping zones of the solution components rather than separate points or bands.&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), pp. 411-412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, in his book ''Capillaranalyse … '' (1901), Goppelsroeder stated (p. 168) that he had been separating plant colorants since 1880, and that he had achieved complete separations of those colorants.  From p. 166:&lt;br&gt;
''"Bietet sich auch dem Auge bei Betrachtung der verschiedenen Pflanzenorgane eine wunderbare Mannigfaltigkeit der Farben und Farbenabstufungen dar, so bleibt ihm doch die wichtige Thatsache verborgen, dass meist nicht nur ein einziger Farbstoff, sondern mehrere nebeneinander in demselben Organe vorkommen.  Während das Auge nur eine Färbung erkennt und wir desshalb glauben, dass dieselbe einem bestimmten einzelnen Farbstoff angehöre, lässt uns die Capillaranalyse meist mehrere verschieden gefärbte Zonen auf den Capillarstreifen in bestimmer, sehr oft von farblosen Zonen unterbrochener Reihenfolge erkennen.  Das Chlorophyll oder Blattgrün z.B. findet sich nicht nur in den grünen, sonder auch in anders gefärbten Organen, beispielsweise verdeckt durch die rote Färbung des Zellsafts in den Blättern der Blutbuche neben dem roten Anthokyan, sowie neben roten Phycoerythrin in den Rotalgen, den Florideen.  Diese verschiedenen Farbstoffe lassen sich durch Capillaranalyse in den gemeinschaftlichen Auszügen, ohne irgend welche sonstige Trennungsmanipulationen nebeneinander nachweisen.  Sind sie capillarisch in Zonen getrennt, dann genügt deren spectroscopische und chemische Prüfung zur endgiltigen Feststellung ihrer Natur."''&lt;br&gt;
(If a wonderful variety of colors and color gradations presents itself to the eye when looking at the different plant organs, yet the important fact remains hidden to it:  that usually not only a single colorant but several occur side by side in the same organs. While the eye perceives only one color and we believe therefore that it belongs to a certain individual colorant, capillary analysis [i.e., paper chromatography] allows us to detect usually several differently colored zones on the capillary strips in certain sequences [that are] very often interrupted by colorless zones.  Chlorophyll or leaf green, for example, is found not only in the green, but also in differently colored organs; for example, obscured by the red color of the protoplasm in the leaves of the copper beech together with red anthocyanin, as well as together with red phycoerythrin in red algae, the ''Florideae''.  These various colorants can be detected by capillary analysis in extracts where they are present in combination, without any other concurrent separation treatments.  If they are separated into zones by capillarity, then their spectroscopic and chemical examination suffices for the conclusive ascertaining of their nature.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on capillary analysis continued, but without much technical development, well into the 20th century.  The first significant advances over Goppelsroeder's methods came with the work of [[Raphael E. Liesegang]]: in 1927, he placed filter strips in closed containers with atmospheres saturated by solvents, and in 1943 he began using discrete spots of sample adsorbed to filter paper, dipped in pure solvent to achieve separation.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Liesegang, R.E. (1943) "Capillaranalyse" (Capillary analysis), ''Zeitschrift für analytische Chemie'', '''126''' :  172-177 , 334-336.
*  Liesegang, R.E. (1943) "Kreuz-Kapillaranalyse" (Cross capillary analysis), ''Naturwissenschaften'', '''31''' (29) :  348.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method, essentially identical to modern paper chromatography, was published just before the independent&amp;mdash;and far more influential&amp;mdash;work of [[Archer Martin]] and his collaborators that inaugurated the widespread use of paper chromatography.&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the American chemist David Talbot Day (1859-1915), then serving with the U.S. Geological Survey, observed that crude petroleum generated bands of color as it seeped upwards through finely divided clay or limestone.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Day (1897) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IQkDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A suggestion as to the origin of Pennsylvania petroleum,"] ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', '''36''' (154) :  112-115.  From page 115:  " … by experimental work it may easily be demonstrated that if we saturate a limestone such as the Trenton limestone with the oils characteristic of that rock and exert slight pressure upon it, so that it may flow upward through finely divided clay, it is easy to change it in its color … "&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1900, he reported his findings at the First International Petroleum Congress in Paris, where they created a sensation.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Day's discovery, other researchers investigated the diffusion of petroleum through finely divided earths; viz, the German organic chemist [[Karl Engler]] (1842-1925) of the Technical University Karlsruhe and the American chemist Joseph Elliot Gilpin (1866-1924) of Johns Hopkins University.

==Tsvet and column chromatography==
[[File:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 7.jpg|right|thumb|75px|Thin layer chromatography is used to separate the colorful components of a plant extract]]
The first true chromatography is usually attributed to the Russian-Italian botanist [[Mikhail Tsvet]].  Tsvet applied his observations with filter paper extraction to the new methods of column [[fractionation]] that had been developed in the 1890s for separating the components of [[petroleum]]. He used a liquid-adsorption column containing [[calcium carbonate]] to separate yellow, orange, and green plant [[pigment]]s (what are known today as [[xanthophylls]], [[carotenes]], and [[chlorophyll]]s, respectively). The method was described on December 30, 1901 at the 11th Congress of Naturalists and Doctors (XI съезд естествоиспытателей и врачей) in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The first printed description was in 1903, in the Proceedings of the [[Warsaw]] Society of Naturalists, section of biology.  He first used the term ''chromatography'' in print in 1906 in his two papers about chlorophyll in the German botanical journal, ''Berichte der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft''. In 1907 he demonstrated his chromatograph for the German Botanical Society. Mikhail's surname "Цвет" means "color" in Russian, so there is the possibility that his naming the procedure chromatography (literally "color writing") was a way that he could make sure that he, a commoner in Tsarist Russia, could be immortalized.

In a 1903 lecture (published in 1905), Tsvet also described using filter paper to approximate the properties of living plant fibers in his experiments on plant pigments&amp;mdash;a precursor to [[paper chromatography]].  He found that he could extract some pigments (such as orange [[carotene]]s and yellow [[xanthophyll]]s) from leaves with [[non-polar solvent]]s, but others (such as [[chlorophyll]]) required [[polar solvent]]s.  He reasoned that chlorophyll was held to the plant tissue by [[adsorption]], and that stronger solvents were necessary to overcome the adsorption.  To test this, he applied dissolved pigments to filter paper, allowed the solvent to evaporate, then applied different solvents to see which could extract the pigments from the filter paper.  He found the same pattern as from leaf extractions: carotene could be extracted from filter paper using non-polar solvents, but chlorophyll required polar solvents.&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), pp. 412-413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsvet's work saw little use until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1952), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martin and Synge and partition chromatography==

Chromatography methods changed little after Tsvet's work until the explosion of mid-20th century research in new techniques, particularly thanks to the work of [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]].  By "the marrying of two techniques, that of chromatography and that of countercurrent solvent extraction",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| title = Archer J. P. Martin - Nobel Lecture - martin-lecture.pdf| accessdate = 2016-02-27| url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1952/martin-lecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and Synge developed [[partition chromatography]] to separate chemicals with only slight differences in [[partition coefficient]]s between two liquid solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 506–512| last = Ettre| first = C.| title = Milestones in Chromatography: The Birth of Partition Chromatography| journal = LCGC| accessdate = 2016-02-26| date = 2001| url = http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/pharma/2014/08/22/1598ed6f-5bbe-400b-bc08-ff07d2c59826/article-2090.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin, who had previously been working in vitamin chemistry (including attempts to purify [[vitamin E]]), began collaborating with Synge in 1938, brought his experience with equipment design to Synge's project of separating [[amino acids]].  After unsuccessful experiments with complex [[countercurrent distribution|countercurrent extraction]] machines and liquid-liquid chromatography methods where the liquids move in opposite directions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0264-6021| volume = 35| issue = 1-2| pages = 91–121| last1 = Martin| first1 = A J P| last2 = Synge| first2 = R L M| title = Separation of the higher monoamino-acids by counter-current liquid-liquid extraction: the amino-acid composition of wool| journal = Biochemical Journal| date = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin hit on the idea of using silica gel in columns to hold water stationary while an organic solvent flows through the column.  Martin and Synge demonstrated the potential of the methods by separating amino acids marked in the column by the addition of [[methyl red]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1952), pp. 362-366&lt;/ref&gt;  In a series of publications beginning in 1941, they described increasingly powerful methods of separating amino acids and other organic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1358–1368| last1 = Martin| first1 = A J P| last2 = Synge| first2 = R L M| title = A new form of chromatogram employing two liquid phases A theory of chromatography. 2. Application to the micro-determination of the higher monoamino-acids in proteins| journal = Biochemical Journal| date = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit of better and easier methods of identifying the amino acid constituents of peptides, Martin and Synge turned to other chromatography media as well.  A short abstract in 1943 followed by a detailed article in 1944 described the use of filter paper as the stationary phase for performing chromatography on amino acids: [[paper chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;Whelan (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1947, Martin, Synge and their collaborators had applied this method (along with [[Sanger's reagent|Fred Sanger's reagent]] for identifying [[N-terminal]] residues) to determine the pentapeptide sequence of [[Gramicidin S]].  These and related paper chromatography methods were also foundational to [[Fred Sanger]]'s effort to determine the [[amino acid sequence]] of [[insulin]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanger (1988), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refining the techniques==

Martin, in collaboration with [[Anthony T. James]], went on to develop [[gas chromatography]] (the principles of which Martin and Synge had laid out in their landmark 1941 paper) beginning in 1949.  In 1952, during his lecture for the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (shared with Synge, for their earlier chromatography work) Martin announced the successful separation of a wide variety of natural compounds by gas chromatography.  (Austrian chemist Fritz Prior had achieved limited success with gas chromatography, separating [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], in 1947 during his Ph.D. research.  The method of Martin and James, however, became the basis for subsequent developments in gas chromatography.)&lt;ref&gt;Lesney (1998).  Accessed July 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ease and efficiency of gas chromatography for separating organic chemicals spurred the rapid adoption of the method, as well as the rapid development of new detection methods for analyzing the output.  The [[thermal conductivity detector]], described in 1954 by N. H. Ray, was the foundation for several other methods: the [[flame ionization detector]] was described by J. Harley, W. Nel, and V. Pretorius in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Ettre, L.S. ''Chapters in the Evolution of Chromatography.'' [http://www.chromsource.com/books/Milestones-FID.pdf Chapter 17, The Invention, Development and Triumph of the Flame Ionization Detector], pp. 171-180.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Lovelock]] introduced the [[electron capture detector]] that year as well.  Others introduced [[mass spectrometer]]s to gas chromatography in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Touchstone (1993), p. 1650&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Martin and Synge also set the stage for [[high performance liquid chromatography]], suggesting that small sorbent particles and pressure could produce fast liquid chromatography techniques.  This became widely practical by the late 1960s (and the method was used to separate amino acids as early as 1960).&lt;ref&gt;Touchstone (1993), pp. 1655-1656&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thin layer chromatography==
The first developments in [[thin layer chromatography]] occurred in the 1940s, and techniques advanced rapidly in the 1950s after the introduction of relatively large plates and relatively stable materials for [[sorbent]] layers.&lt;ref&gt;Touchstone (1993), pp. 1651-1652&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==

In 1987 [[Pedro Cuatrecasas]] and [[Meir Wilchek]] were awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Medicine]] for the invention and development of [[affinity chromatography]] and its applications to biomedical sciences.

==Development==
The Falcon HTV-1 program, which preceded the Falcon HTV-2 program, was conducted in April, 2010. The mission ended within nine minutes from launch.&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; Both these missions are funded by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) to help develop [[hypersonic]] technologies and to demonstrate its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/x-41-htv-2.htm|title=Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle HTV-2|publisher=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the original plan, HTV-1 was to feature a hypersonic [[lift-to-drag ratio]] (L/D) of 2.5, increasing to 3.5-4 for the HTV-2 and 4-5 for the HTV-3. The actual ratio of HTV-2 was estimated to be 2.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/2015/09/hypersonic_boost-glide_weapons.html |website=scienceandglobalsecurity.org |title=Hypersonic Boost-Glide Weapons |date=September 2015 |author=James M. Acton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HTV-2 was to lead to the development of an HTV-3X vehicle, known as [[Blackswift]], which would have formed the basis for deployment around 2025 of a reusable Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle, an unmanned aircraft capable of taking off from a conventional runway with a 5,400&amp;nbsp;kg (12,000&amp;nbsp;lb) payload to strike targets 16,650&amp;nbsp;km away in under 2 hours. The HCV would have required an L/D of 6-7 at M10 and 130,000&amp;nbsp;ft (40,000m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/does-us-need-1bn-hypersonic-test-area-after-htv-2-failure-341672/ |title=Does US need $1bn hypersonic test area after HTV-2 failure? |website=www.flightglobal.com |date=10 May 2010 |author=Rob Coppinger |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307093817/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/does-us-need-1bn-hypersonic-test-area-after-htv-2-failure-341672/ |archive-date= 7 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Darpa HTV-2 illustr.jpg|thumb|right|100px|alt=DARPA's Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle-2|DARPA's Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle-2 is arrowhead-shaped.]]

Development of protection structures that are tough and lightweight, development of an aerodynamic shape that has a high lift to drag ratio, development of automatic navigation control systems etc. were some of the initial technical challenges that had been overcome in the final design.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity/&gt; The various departments involved in designing the vehicle included aerothermodynamics, materials science, hypersonic navigation, guidance and control systems, endo- and [[Exosphere|exo]]-atmospheric flight dynamics, telemetry and range safety analysis. The craft could cover 17,000 kilometres, the distance between London and Sydney, in 49 minutes.&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;

Built by Lockheed Martin Corp, the HTV-2 is made of carbon composite material; the durability of such material was needed to prevent important internal components from being destroyed because they are a few inches from its surface. The surface temperature of the HTV-2 was expected to reach 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit or more in flight; steel melts at 2500 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name="LATHome.collections.Aircraft"&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/20/business/la-fi-mo-darpa-hypersonic-missile-20120420&lt;/ref&gt;

Both flights reached Mach 20 ([[Hypersonic speed#Classification of Mach regimes|high-hypersonic speed]]) and lost telemetry at 9 minutes of a planned 30-minute mission.

==Future development==
DARPA does not plan to conduct a third flight test of the HTV-2.  The decision was made because substantial data was collected from the first two flights, and a third was not thought likely to provide any additional valuable data for the cost.  The first flight provided data in aerodynamics and flight performance, while the second provided information about structures and high temperatures.  Experience gained from the HTV-2 will be used to improve hypersonic flight.

Work on the HTV-2 will continue to Summer 2014 to capture technology lessons and improve design tools and methods for high-temperature composite aeroshells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_07_08_2013_p24-593534.xml&amp;p=1 Darpa Refocuses Hypersonics Research On Tactical Missions] - Aviationweek.com, 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=November 2014}}

A '''hypothetical list of [[biota (ecology)|biota]]''', or "hypothetical list" for short, is a list of [[taxa]] (of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungi]] etc.) which are not recorded from a given geographical area, but which ''may'' be found there. Such lists are sometimes included by authors of [[regional biota]], partly to demonstrate that the authors have considered and rejected the taxa in question rather than overlooked them, and partly to encourage researchers and others to seek out the taxa in question so that they can be added to the list of the area's biota in future revisions.

Taxa may be included for different reasons:
* They may be resident close to the region in question, and the region may have habitat which appears suitable
* They may be long-distance vagrants with a pattern of occurrence
* They may be poorly studied taxa, which the authors feel could be found in the region if appropriate search techniques are used
* There may be historical evidence of occurrence which the authors felt was not watertight enough to justify inclusion in a definitive list for the region

A 1973 checklist of [[fleas]] in Connecticut added species to its hypothetical list if they were documented in a bordering state and have a [[host (biology)|host]] found in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Miller et al., 1973"/&gt;{{rp|210}}

Ornithological works which have included hypothetical lists include the following:

* ''[[A field guide to the birds of Hawaii and the Tropical Pacific]]'' by Pratt, Bruner and Berrett
* ''[[Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide]]'' by Rasmussen and Anderton

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3195">'''Indium gallium phosphide''' ('''InGaP'''), also called gallium indium phosphide (GaInP), is a [[semiconductor]] composed of [[indium]], [[gallium]] and [[phosphorus]]. It is used in high-power and high-frequency electronics because of its superior electron velocity with respect to the more common semiconductors [[silicon]] and [[gallium arsenide]].

It is used mainly in [[HEMT]] and [[Heterojunction bipolar transistor|HBT]] structures, but also for the fabrication of high efficiency [[solar cells]] used for space applications and, in combination with [[aluminium]] ([[Aluminium gallium indium phosphide|AlGaInP]] alloy) to make high brightness [[LED]]s with orange-red, orange, yellow, and green colors. Some semiconductor devices such as [[EFluor Nanocrystal]] use InGaP as their core particle.

Indium gallium phosphide is a solid solution of [[indium phosphide]] and [[gallium phosphide]].

Ga&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;P is a solid solution of special importance, which is almost lattice matched to [[GaAs]]. This allows, in combination with (Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;, the growth of [[Lattice constant|lattice matched]] [[quantum well]]s for red emitting [[Laser diode|semiconductor lasers]], e.g. [[red]] [[Solid-state lighting|emitting]] (650[[1 E-9 m|nm]]) [[RCLED]]s or [[VCSEL]]s for [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] [[plastic]] [[optical fiber]]s.

Ga&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;P is used as the high energy junction on double and triple junction photovoltaic cells grown on [[GaAs]]. Recent years have shown GaInP/GaAs tandem solar cells with AM0 (sunlight incidence in space=1.35&amp;nbsp;kW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) efficiencies in excess of 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.uh.edu/MQW%20tech%202p.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510015749/http://www.cam.uh.edu/MQW%20tech%202p.php |archivedate=2009-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different composition of GaInP, lattice matched to the underlying [[GaInAs]], is utilized as the high energy junction GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple junction photovoltaic cells.

Growth of GaInP by [[epitaxy]] can be complicated by the tendency of GaInP to grow as an ordered material, rather than a truly random solid solution (i.e., a mixture). This changes the bandgap and the electronic and optical properties of the material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4469">The '''information search process''' ('''ISP''') is a six-stage process of [[information seeking behavior]] in [[library and information science]]. The ISP was first suggested by [[Carol Kuhlthau]] in 1991.

It describes the thoughts, feelings and actions of the searcher, and is often used to describe students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bawden|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Lyn|title=An introduction to information science|date=2012|publisher=Facet|location=London|isbn=978-1-85604-810-1|pages=196-197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==

===Stage 1: Initiation===
During the first stage, ''initiation'', the information seeker recognizes the need for new information to complete an assignment.&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kuhlthau, Carol |title=Seeking Meaning: a process approach to library and information services |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=1-59158-094-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they think more about the topic, they may discuss the topic with others and brainstorm the topic further.&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, Donna. "Kuhlthau's Information Search Process." School Library Media Activities Monthly, Vol. 19, no. 2, October 2002: p. 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; This stage of the information seeking process is filled with feelings of apprehension and uncertainty.

===Stage 2: Selection===
In the second stage, ''selection'', the individual begins to decide what topic will be investigated and how to proceed.&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"/&gt; Some information retrieval may occur at this point, resulting in multiple rounds of query reformulation.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, B. J., Booth, D. L., &amp; Spink, A. (2009). [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_patterns_query_reformulation.pdf Patterns of query modification during Web searching]. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. 60(3), 557-570. 60(7), 1358-1371.&lt;/ref&gt; The uncertainty associated with the first stage often fades with the selection of a topic, and is replaced with a sense of optimism.

===Stage 3: Exploration===
In the third stage, ''exploration'', information on the topic is gathered and a new personal knowledge is created.&lt;ref name="Isbell"&gt;Isbell, Dennis and Lisa Kammerlocher. "Implementing Kuhlthau: A New Model for Library and Reference Instruction." [[Reference Services Review]], Fall/Winter 1998: p. 33-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Students endeavor to locate new information and situate it within their previous understanding of the topic.&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"/&gt; In this stage, feelings of anxiety may return if the information seeker finds inconsistent or incompatible information.

===Stage 4: Formulation===
During the fourth stage, ''formulation'', the information seeker starts to evaluate the information  that has been gathered. At this point, a focused perspective begins to form and there is not as much confusion and uncertainty as in earlier stages.&lt;ref name="Isbell"/&gt; Formulation is considered to be the most important stage of the process.&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; The information seeker will here formulate a personalized construction of the topic from the general information gathered in the exploration phase.&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"/&gt;

===Stage 5: Collection===
During the fifth stage, ''collection'', the information seeker knows what is needed to support the focus. Now presented with a clearly focused, personalized topic, the information seeker will experience greater interest, increased confidence, and more successful searching.&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rubin, Richard E. |title=Foundations of Library and Information Science |publisher=Neal Schuman |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=1-55570-402-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage 6: Search closure===
In the sixth and final stage, ''search closure'', the individual has completed the information search. Now the information seeker will summarize and report on the information that was found through the process. The information seeker will experience a sense of relief and, depending on the fruits of their search, either satisfaction or disappointment.&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"/&gt;

[[Teletext]] was introduced in the analogue [[television]] in the 80's, leading to a limited interaction with  [[television]] sets to obtain information about things like the schedule and weather.  But nowadays this concept goes even far away and a new and improved way of interaction with the user has been developed. The early private broadcasters, as [[Canal+]], were the pioneers in adopting this new form and today are preceded by their digital formats.

As a consequence of the Analogue Switchoff the Project known as [[Digital Terrestrial Television]] ([[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]]) was developed creating a public digital format [[television]] with more features, in competition with private broadcasters. Among this features one can found interactive menus that, as in the case of the private broadcasting, give information to the user and let them adapt the product to their own needs. This user-television interaction is today known as [[interactive television]].

All of these can happen thanks to the Set-Top-Boxes or [[Set-Top-Box]] (STBs), the [[television]] decoders that households usually have at home, that see to receive and decode the digital signal to show it by the analogue [[television]] set. This device lets the users accede to the contents the [[digital television]] net offers. One of their many functions is running the interactive applications, being this the object of this article.

For interactivity, it is required that the STBs could be dynamically programmed and updated. For that, there are some different solutions in the market, among them, the definition of an intermediary [[software]] layer on which the applications, broadcast together with the audiovisual signals, run. This intermediary [[software]] layer is called [[Middleware]].

==Private Standards or private property==

===Media Highway===

It was defined by Canal Plus Technologies, which represents the widest range of solutions in the market so that the [[software]] in the STBs interprets and executes interactive applications, broadcast [[software]] from the server for the broadcasting of applications and data via satellite, cable and terrestrial nets, moreover runs interactive applications and their execution environment. Also, includes different profiles to better respond to the broadcasters needs.

These standard runs applications written in different programming languages as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[MHEG-5]] or [[HTML]] and supports the specifications [[DVB-MHP]], [[OpenCable Application Platform|OCAP]], [[DAVIC]] or [[ATSC]] adding, at the same time, other own and new specifications.

===Open TV Core===

The most important product from Open TV, a [[middleware]] for [[digital television]] (DTV) widely extended. The Open TV Core [[software]] technology contains a [[computer hardware|hardware]] abstraction layer (to let the [[computer hardware|hardware]] be independent), TV libraries, a selection of execution environments for the applications, and support for [[Personal Video Recorders]] (PVRs), to create a [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] environment for the decoders (STBs). The TV libraries include support for rich graphics (RG) and [[high-definition video|High Definition]] (HD), net communication from phone line up to broad band IP (via DSL, [[ethernet]] or fibre), management of the digital audio and video signals ([[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], as well as another standards and proprietary formats), and support to authentication and encryption by using CA/DRM systems.
Open TV Core supports a number of Applications environments execution(AEE) including the 'C' Virtual Machine, a [[HTML]] browser, an Adobe Flash presentation environment and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] Virtual Machine in compliance with the [[Multimedia Home Platform|MHP]] standard. The 'C' Virtual Machine is an execution environment that allows the [[API]]s of the Open TV software Developers Kit, that lets the content providers create, in O code, applications centred on TV by using the development tools from Open TV or another sellers.

==Open or Public Standards==

===MHEG===

As early as 1995 the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] ([[International Organisation for Standardisation]]), together with the Multimedia and Hypermedia Experts Group, published the MHEG standard. This gave a statement approach to the creation of multimedia applications that could work in every operative system in compliance with this standard. Conceptually, MHEG intended to do for multimedia applications the same as [[HTML]] did for documents at the proper time that is, to give a common exchange format that should be executed in every receiver. 

''MHEG-1'': this version included support for objects containing procedure codes, that could widens the basic model of MHEG-1 adding decision making functions, as it was not possible in other way.

''MHEG-3'': this version defined a standard virtual machine and a byte representation code that allows its portability through hardware platforms.

These versions were unsuccessful, since they were based on concepts very complicated and the industry was not ready for the characteristics they offer.  ''[[MHEG-5]]'', the simpler version of MHEG-1, was created in April 1997.

Many of the functions that were shaping it were equal but simultaneously there were many differences between the two versions.
MHEG-3 was overcome  by the success of [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and in 1998 they decided to create the sixth version, ''MHEG-6'', which was based on the fifth version adding a support for the use of [[Java (programming language)|Java]] to develop objects script, mixing the declarative force of MHEG with the procedure elements of [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. For doing this, they defined a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application programming interface ([[API]]) for MHEG so that the code [[Java (programming language)|Java]] could manipulate MHEG objects in its mother application.

Though the MHEG-6 was not extended, it was the base of the [[DAVIC]]'s ([[Digital Audio Video Council]]) standard.

===DAVIC===

This standard was created little later than the MHEG-6 in 1998. It was created adding a new series of [[API]]s [[Java (programming language)|Java]] to MHEG's sixth version. The [[API]]s of the above-mentioned standard were allowing the objects [[Java (programming language)|Java]] the access to some services of information, control of services of audio content and video and the managing of the management of the resources in the receiver. Though the creation of an application was not possible pure [[Java (programming language)|Java]] for the receiver [[DAVIC]], the [[API]]s [[Java (programming language)|Java]] already was capable of controlling more elements of the receiver of what was possible with other standards.

===DVB-MHP(The Multimedia Home Platform)===

This is defined by the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) to offer interactive services in the DTV. It is a 	limited version of the virtual machine of [[Java (programming language)|Java]], where a set of extra functionalities are added for the adjustment to the environment of the DTV. With the purpose of arranging the specification of this standard there are defined three profiles related to the capacities of the STBs:

:1. '''Enhanced Broadcast Profile:''' interactive applications are downloaded via broadcasting. It does not incorporate backward channel in the STB.

:2. '''Interactive Broadcast:''' incorporates bidirectional communications via backward IP channel towards the server, allowing the download of applications.

:3. '''Internet Access:''' STB processes extreme [[internet]] contents.

There exist two versions that cover the mentioned profiles:

*[[Multimedia Home Platform|MHP]] 1.0 that covers the first two profiles. This version is the one that the current receivers use and the majority implement the second profile. Many countries have adopted it to offer their DTV's interactive services, like Spain, Italy or Finland.
*[[Multimedia Home Platform|MHP]] 1.1 that covers the three profiles. Nowadays it could not be found in any commercial receivers compatible with that version though there are a few compatible protocols.

===OCAP===

The American company [[CableLabs]] collaborated with [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] for the creation of a new opened standard, which it led to the acceptance of the specification of the standard [[Multimedia Home Platform|MHP]] as base for this standard, the OCAP ([[OpenCable Application Platform]]), in January, 2002. With MHP in its center OCAP provides a common especificaión for the [[middleware]] layer for the systems of cable in the United States. Since in the United States DVB standards are not used, OCAP is based on those parts that are not DVB specific, replacing the rest of DVB specific ones such as DVB IF [[API]]. Originally, OCAP was based on the 1.0.0 version of the specification MHP.

Later, DVB presented the specification [[Globally Executable MHP]] (GEM) to facilitate the use of MHP's elements in other specifications. OCAP's recent versions use GEM instead of MHP as base, but they refer to some MHP's elements that are not included in the especificaión GEM.

===ACAP (Advanced Common Application Platform)===

This platform was created by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] ([[ATSC]]), as common base for all the systems of interactive TV in USA, for cable, terrestrial or satellite. It is also based on GEM and adds some OCAP's elements that are adapted for the USA market.

The '''International Meteor Organization''' ('''IMO''') was formally founded in 1988 from predecessor gatherings over many years. IMO has several hundred members and was created in response to an ever-growing need for international cooperation on amateur and professional [[meteor]] work. The collection of meteor observations by several methods from all around the world ensures the comprehensive study of [[meteor shower]]s and their relation to [[comet]]s and [[interplanetary medium|interplanetary dust]].

IMO publishes a bimonthly journal called WGN&lt;ref group=note&gt;WGN = "werkgroepnieuws" (Dutch language), in English as "workgroup news". WGN was initially a circular before it became a journal.&lt;/ref&gt; and holds an annual International Meteor Conference (IMC) in September.&lt;ref&gt;IMO website.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''intraarticular fracture''' is a [[bone fracture]] in which the break crosses into the surface of a [[joint]]. This always results in damage to the [[cartilage]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eatonhand.com/dis/dis265.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[extraarticular fracture]]s, intraarticular have a higher risk for developing long-term complications, such as [[posttraumatic osteoarthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKinley|first=Todd O.|last2=Borrelli|first2=Joseph|last3=D’Lima|first3=Darryl D.|last4=Furman|first4=Bridgette D.|last5=Giannoudis|first5=Peter V.|date=2017-03-25|year=|title=Basic Science of Intraarticular Fractures and Posttraumatic Osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma|volume=24|issue=9|pages=567–570|doi=10.1097/BOT.0b013e3181ed298d|issn=0890-5339|pmc=3662545|pmid=20736796|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment considerations include restoring joint surface congruity and maintaining joint alignment and stability.

UY Scuti is one of [[List of largest stars|the largest known star]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[List of largest stars|s]] by radius (maybe the largest known).]]

A [[star]] is a sphere that is mainly composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], held together by [[gravity]] and is able to produce light through [[nuclear fusion]]. Stars exhibit many diverse properties, resulting from different [[mass]]es, [[volume]]s, [[velocities]], stage in [[stellar evolution]] and even [[Distance|proximity]] to [[earth]]. Some of these properties are considered extreme and sometimes disproportionate by [[astronomer]]s.

'''Maurice Cole Tanquary''' (November 26, 1881 - October 25, 1944) was a professor of entomology, a member of the [[Crocker Land Expedition]]  and is considered to be a pioneer in modern [[beekeeping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entohistory.tamu.edu/hallofhonor/hallofhonor.html |title=Maurice C.

==Early life==
Tanquary was the son of Thomas J. and Florence A. Tanquaary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:S3HT-DC17-F9R?cc=1325221&amp;wc=9BQJ-T3R%3A1030552601%2C1030551302%2C1035796501 |title=United States Census, 1900|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised on a farm near [[Lawrenceville, Illinois]], where he attended public schools.  He then attended [[Vincennes University]] where he was a member of [[Sigma Pi|Tau Phi Delta]] society and was one of the authors of the society's first constitution and by-laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=Spring 1981|volume=69|number=1|magazine=The Emerald of Sigma Pi|title=First Constitution of Fraternity Uncovered in Memoribilia|pages=3-4|url=http://www.enivation.com/SigmaPi/archive/Emerald/1981/SP_EMERALD_VOL_69_NO_1_SPRING_1981.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated in 1903 and taught for four years in the public schools of [[Lawrence County, Illinois]].  He then enrolled at the [[University of Illinois]] where he received his AB degree in 1907, his MA in 1908, and PhD in 1912.  From 1908 to 1909 he served as a part-time assistant to the State [[Entomologist]] of [[Illinois]].  During the summer of 1910 he studied at [[Harvard University]] and during the summer of 1911 he was a field agent for the State Entomologist of [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tanquary | first=Maurice C. | title=Biological and Embryological Studies on Formidicae | publisher=University of Illinois | issue=v. 1 | year=1912 | url=https://archive.org/stream/biologicalembryo00tanq_0#page/n13/mode/2up | accessdate=June 28, 2017 | page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While at Illinois he was a founder of the Ionian Literary Society and a charter member of the [[Acacia (fraternity)|Acacia]] (Masonic) fraternity where he was the national treasurer from 1908-1909.&lt;ref name="Emerald1922"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=January 1922|volume=8|number=4|magazine=The Emerald of Sigma Pi|title=Sledging Through Greenland - An Alpha Alumnus in Crocker Land|pages=217–220|url=http://www.enivation.com/SigmaPi/archive/Emerald/1922/SP_EMERALD_VOL_8_NO_4_JAN_1922.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After earning his doctorate he became a professor of agriculture  at [[Kansas State Agricultural College]] in 1913 where he was given leave to join the Crocker Land Expedition as a zoologist later that year.&lt;ref name = Emerald1945&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=February 1945|volume=31|number=4|magazine=The Emerald of Sigma Pi|title=Adytum on High:  Maurice Cole Tanquary|pages=141-142|url=http://www.enivation.com/SigmaPi/archive/Emerald/1945/SP_EMERALD_VOL_31_NO_4_FEB_1945.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dr. M.C.

==Crocker Land Expedition==
As the zoologist for the expedition, Tanquary was not involved in the final push to find the island from the village of [[Etah, Greenland|Etah]] in northern [[Greenland]].  Instead, he and fellow Illinois alumnus [[Walter Elmer Ekblaw]] were stationed at a Danish trading post 120 miles to the south.  They became stranded there after Ekblaw was struck with snow blindess and almost ran out of food in 1914.  They were rescued just in time in August and returned to Etah.

In December 1914 Tanquary and [[Donald Baxter MacMillan]] set off by [[dogsled]] for southern Greenland in an attempt to send out word that Crocker Land did not exist and that they would need a rescue ship in 1915.  During the trip they became lost for ten days in temperatures as low as -50F. Running low on provisions, they had to eat several of their dogs. As luck would have it, they happened upon an Eskimo settlement. MacMillan decided to return to Etah and have Tanquary complete the journey with a Danish trader and an Eskimo guide. After making it to the mail station in southern Greenland, Tanquary made the 400 mile trip back to Etah.  Along the way, Tanquary removed his boots and pieces of raw, bleeding skin and flesh fell off his rotting toes. Despite the [[frostbite]], Tanquary managed to drive his dog team to Etah, where his big toes were amputated. Ekblaw described Tanquary’s dash back to Etah as “the grittiest exploit of the expedition.”

Tanquary's message for help was received and a rescue ship was sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/092248/fate-of-the-crocker-land-expedition|title=Fate of the Crocker Land Expedition|publisher=NaturalHistoryMag.com|date=June 2012|last=Freed|first=Stanley A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, the ship became entrapped in ice and Tanquary had to make another trip to the southern tip of the island.  The trip began on December 16, 1915 from Etah and ended on April 20, 1916.  He was able to catch a ride on a ship going to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] which he reached on May 20, 1916.  He promptly cabled New York asking for a second relief ship to be sent to the party and he made arrangements for his return to the U.S.. The second rescue ship, sent in the summer of 1916, also became stuck in the ice and the expedition was not rescued until 1917.&lt;ref name = Emerald1922/&gt;

Journals from Tanquary, Walter Ekblaw, Donald and Mirriam MacMillan are available online at the [https://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/index.shtml George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives] website.

Mitchell Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives (Bowdoin Library - George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives)|website=library.bowdoin.edu|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Tanquary  married Josephine Perry of [[Manhattan, KS]] on his return from the expedition.  They had a child named Jean who was born in April 1917.&lt;ref name = Emerald1922/&gt;

==Professional life==
He returned to [[Kansas State Agricultural College]] in 1916 as an assistant professor before becoming as associate professor in 1919. Later in 1919, he became the chief of entomology at the [[Texas Agricultural Experiment Station]] and was named Texas' state entomologist.&lt;ref name = Emerald1945/&gt;

In 1920 he made a trip to [[Mexico]] to study the [[pink bollworm]] which infested [[cotton]] crops.&lt;ref name = Emerald1922/&gt;

Tanquary was interested in apiculture and resigned in 1923 to enter professional beekeeping in [[North Dakota]]. He joined the [[University of Minnesota]] College of Agriculture as an entomologist in 1928 and remained there until 1944.  While in Minnesota he devoted much of his time to the study of [[bees]].  He was also known as a good teacher who could apply experimental ability to practical manner.&lt;ref name = Emerald1945/&gt;

Tanquary’s family donated his photographs, lantern slides and journals to [[Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum|The Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum]], [[Bowdoin College]], in 2006.

The '''mdx mouse''' is a popular model for studying [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] (DMD).

The mdx mouse has a point mutation in its DMD gene, changing the [[amino acid]] coding for a glutamine to STOP codon. This causes the muscle [[Cell (biology)|cells]] to [[Translation (biology)|produce]] a small, nonfunctional [[dystrophin]] protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Advance_research_strategies_animalmodels|title=Animal Models - Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy|website=www.parentprojectmd.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the mouse has a mild form of DMD where there is increased muscle damage and weakness.

'''Model for assessment of telemedicine (MAST)''' is a framework for assessment of the value of [[telemedicine]].

==Description==
[[Telemedicine]] services may have many different types of outcomes and can be studied in many ways. In order for those who develop new telemedicine services to produce the information that healthcare managers need for making decisions on investment in telemedicine, a model for assessment of telemedicine (MAST) was developed. This work was done in 2010 through stakeholder workshops and on the basis of a [[systematic literature review]].&lt;ref&gt;Kidholm K, Ekeland AG, Jensen LK, Rasmussen J, Pedersen CD, Bowes A, Flottorp SA, Bech M. A model for assessment of telemedicine applications: MAST. Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2012 Jan;28(1):44–51. {{PMID|22617736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the objective of an assessment of telemedicine applications is to describe effectiveness and contribution to quality of care and to produce a basis for decision making, then MAST defines the relevant assessment framework fulfilling this objective as a multidisciplinary process which summarizes and evaluates information about the medical, social, economic and ethical issues related to the use of telemedicine in a systematic, unbiased, robust manner.

This statement is based on the definition of [[Health_technology_assessment]] (HTA) in the [[EUnetHTA]] project. Key concepts are "multidisciplinary" and "systematic, unbiased and robust". The first concept implies that the assessments should include all important outcomes of the applications for patients, clinicians, healthcare institutions and society in general. The others imply that assessments should be based on scientific studies and methods, scientific criteria for quality of evidence and scientific standards for reporting of results, e.g. as described in [[EQUATOR Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equator-network.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps==
In practice the use of MAST includes three steps:

# Preceding assessment
# Multidisciplinary assessment
# Transferability  assessment
 
Firstly, the assessment must start with preceding considerations in order to determine whether it is relevant for an institution at a given point in time to carry out the assessment. This step involves mainly assessment of the maturity of the technology and the organization planning to use it. If the technology is not matured and have not been tested in practice, then pilot studies must be carried out to mature the technology before a multidisciplinary study is initiated.

Secondly, after the preceding considerations, the multidisciplinary assessment is carried out in order to describe and assess the different outcomes of the telemedicine application. This involves assessment of ouctomes within the following seven domains:

* Domain 1: Health problem and characteristics of the application
* Domain 2: Safety
* Domain 3: Clinical effectiveness
* Domain 4: Patient perspectives
* Domain 5: Economic aspects 
* Domain 6: Organizational aspects 
* Domain 7: Socio-cultural, ethical and legal aspects

Thirdly, in relation to the description of the outcomes, an assessment should also be made of the transferability of the results to other settings or countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dyrvig AK, Kidholm K, Gerke O, Vondeling H. Checklists for external validity: a systematic review. J Eval Clin Pract. 2014 Dec;20(6):857-64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

MAST is the most widely used framework for assessment of telemedicine in Europe. The model is used in large EU funded telemedicine project like Renewing Health,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewinghealth.eu/en/ Renewing Health]&lt;/ref&gt; United4Health,&lt;ref&gt;[http://united4health.eu/ United4Health]&lt;/ref&gt; Smartcare&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilotsmartcare.eu/home/ Smartcare]&lt;/ref&gt; and inCASA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incasa-project.eu/news.php inCASA]&lt;/ref&gt; These projects include more than 20.000 patients and more than 18 randomised controlled trials. A large number of individual telemedicine projects also use MAST e.g. Patient@home,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.en.patientathome.dk/ Patient@home]&lt;/ref&gt; Durand-Zaleski (2013)&lt;ref&gt;Durand-Zaleski I, Zarca K, Charrier N, Treluyer L, Calinaud C. Deploying and assessing telemedicine in the Paris region: progress report. International Journal of Integrated Care (IJIC) . Nov2013, Vol. 13, p1-2. 2p.&lt;/ref&gt; and Campos et al. (2013) &lt;ref&gt;Campos C, Caudevilla E, Alesanco A, Lasierra N, Martinez O, Fernandez J, Garcia J. Setting up a telemedicine service for remote real-time video-EEG consultation in La Rioja (Spain). International Journal of Medical Informatics. Volume 81, Issue 6, June 2012, Pages 404–414.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of publications of studies using MAST is still limited, but growing. The first clinical studies have been reported by Sorknæs et al. (2013),&lt;ref&gt;Sorknaes AD, Bech M, Madsen H, Titlestad IL, Hounsgaard L, Hansen-Nord M, Jest P, Olesen F, Lauridsen J, Østergaard B. The effect of real-time teleconsultations between hospital-based nurses and patients with severe COPD discharged after an exacerbation.J Telemed Telecare. 2013 Dec;19(8):466-74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torbjørnsen A, Jenum AK, Småstuen MC, Arsand E, Holmen H, Wahl AK, Ribu L. A Low-Intensity Mobile Health Intervention With and Without Health Counseling for Persons With Type 2 Diabetes, Part 1: Baseline and Short-Term Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial in the Norwegian Part of RENEWING HEALTH. JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2014 Dec 11;2(4):e52. doi: 10.2196/mhealth.3535.&lt;/ref&gt; Karhula et al. (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Tuula Karhula et al.: Telemonitoring and Mobile Phone-Based Health Coaching Among Finnish Diabetic and Heart Disease Patients: Randomized Controlled Trial. Journal of Medical Internet Research; 2015 Volume 17, Issue 6 e153.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rasmussen et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen BS, Froekjaer J, Bjerregaard MR, Lauritsen J, Hangaard J, Henriksen CW, Halekoh U, Yderstraede KB. A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Telemedical and Standard Outpatient Monitoring of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. Diabetes Care. 2015 Jun 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a study of the organizational outcomes of implementation of telemedicine was published by Rasmussen et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen BS, Jensen LK, Froekjaer J, Kidholm K, Kensing F, Yderstraede KB. A qualitative study of the key factors in implementing telemedical monitoring of diabetic foot ulcer patients. Int J Med Inform. 2015 May 29&lt;/ref&gt;

MAST has also been recommended as a usable structure for assessment of outcomes of telemedicine by the association of Danish Regions Telemedicine strategy, by the British Thoracic Society statement on telemedicine (2014) and within the field of wound care by Angel et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;Angel D, Bjerregaard J, O'Conner T, McGuinness W, Kröger K, Rasmussen BSR, Yderstraede KB. Chapter 3: The model for assessment of telemedicine (MAST) – evaluation of telemedical solutions. J Wound Care. 2015 May; 24 Suppl 5:S10-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between MAST and EUnetHTA Core model==

MAST is based on HTA and the EUnetHTA Core model, but whereas the core model includes 9 domains, MAST only includes 7 domains. This is done by combining the content of several domains into one. MAST has also a separate domain describing the impact of telemedicine on patient perception and thereby underlining the importance of the patients' view of this type of health care technology. In addition the three steps in MAST underline that the assessment of outcomes should be seen in the light of the maturity of the technology and the transferability of the results to other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14594">The '''new town movement''' refers to towns that were built after [[World War II]] and that have been purposefully planned, developed and built as a remedy to overcrowding and congestion in some instances, and to scattered ad hoc settlements in others.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for it was to decongest larger industrialized cities, rehousing people in freshly built, new and fully planned towns that were completely self-sufficient and provided for the community.

==Background and context: ‘The Urban Disease’==
In 1918, writing at a time when nineteenth century sanitary advances had revealed how badly off people in urban environments were and, owing to pioneers such as [[Patrick Geddes]], the relationship between social issues and town planning was slowly being realised, Frederick Osborn refers to urban problems collectively as the ‘urban disease’ &lt;ref name="Osborn"&gt;Osborn, F. 1942. ‘New Towns After the War’. Second Ed. J. M. Dent and Sons ltd, London. First Pub 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;
The urban disease, a by-product of the [[industrial revolution]], was brought on by a vicious cycle whereby industry chose to set up near population bases to ensure labour demands could be met which in turn attracted rural migrants seeking work to move into the city prompting further industry and so on. This resulted in greater pollution in the city, higher populations, and denser living conditions. Moreover, rural areas declining rapidly due to loss of population were left to decay.

Furthermore, there were no powers in place to stop prosperous families moving to open spaces or from industry growing in the centres. Fringe growth was vigorous and existing centres were left to deteriorate. Accordingly, those who moved to new fringe suburbs to escape the congestion were in fact “bolstering the very process that caused them to move away.” &lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspirations for Change ==
Although aspirations of dispersing great cities are as old as the industrial revolution itself, it was not until 1817 that the first model communities were proposed by social reformer [[Robert Owen]] to address overcrowded towns. Inspired by [[John Bellers]]’s 1695 proposal for a College of Industry, a colony for the poor enabling disadvantaged people to work and their children to be educated, Owen proposed small, self-contained communities of about twelve hundred people reliant on agriculture but with some other industry. However, his plans “foundered under the heavy weight of revolutionary ideas” &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, F. 1942. ‘New Towns After the War’. Second Ed. J. M. Dent and Sons ltd, London. First Pub 1918. Pp 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further model community ideas continued to arise but were each dismissed owing to the perception that they were unconvincing as business ventures.&lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt; Enter [[Ebenezer Howard]], creator of the [[Garden City Movement]], who successfully founded [[Letchworth]] Garden City (1903) and proved that new towns could be economically viable. This was affirmed by [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], co-founder of the London School of Economics, who referred to his investments in the garden city movement as “entirely satisfactory, both economically and morally.” &lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt;

== Garden Cities and New Towns ==

The New Town Movement was derived from the [[Garden City Movement]], founded by [[Ebenezer Howard]] in the late 1800s, as an alternative to the overcrowded, polluted, chaotic and miserable industrial cities that had appeared in Britain.  Towards the end of [[World War One]] a group developed – the ‘New Townsmen’ – whose members were Howard, F.J. Osborn, C.B. Purdom and W.G. Taylor. They began advocating the development of 100 new cities to be built by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

== F.J. Osborn ==

If Howard is the ‘father’ of Garden Cities, then Frederick J. Osborn is certainly his ‘son’ – predecessor and champion of the New Towns. Osborn was born in 1885 and spent the majority of his life arguing the case for New Towns. Like Howard, he had quite a modest education, having never attended a university. But what he lacked in formal education, he made up for with ambition and wise career choices. In his early 30s, after meeting Howard through his job at the Howard Cottage Society, he took to the campaign for Garden Cities, though they were now referred to as New Towns.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The initial campaigns for the establishment of New Towns failed. Although housing was built, it was often in the form of a ‘garden suburb’, or located on the edge of the existing cities – the antithesis of the Garden City idea.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasing lack of faith in the government to take up the flag for public housing and new towns, Howard suggested to Osborn that he was wasting his time lobbying government, and that he would be ‘as old as [[Methuselah]]’ waiting for action.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1996, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Beginnings of Reform==
In 1909 a greater understanding of the ‘urban disease’ saw Britain’s first town planning legislation created. Although technically opposed to [[wikt:fringe|fringe]] development, the [[Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1909]] did not prevent it. Instead, in light of recent success with the development of [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], the Act, realising that suburbs were easier to develop than towns, held the ethos that good suburbs were better than bad ones. Although planners of the day wanted new towns they were busy dealing with the demand for suburbs: “it is difficult for a technician to earn a living in an ivory tower” &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963. pp 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, new towns required government direction which was beyond the scope of municipal powers alone.

Towards the end of the First World War the Garden City principles were reasserted by the ‘New Townsmen’ (Howard, Osborn, Purdon, and Tayler), who, referring to the success of Letchworth, proposed 100 government-supported new towns to address post-war rebuilding. However, the need for post-war housing resulted in new suburbs being prioritised over towns for the next two decades with some four million high standard houses built in between the wars albeit in the wrong places &lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt; Conversely, some attempts were made at designing rebuilding efforts as satellite towns such as Manchester’s [[Wythenshawe]] and Liverpool’s [[Speke]] and Knowsley which also included provisions for industry. Nonetheless, these were still extensions of existing cities and not true New Towns.&lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt; Furthermore, three-quarters of all the new housing was built privately meaning a default bottom-line approach was adopted into the inter-war development efforts.

During the inter-war years Government committees studied the problem of urban concentration with the Committee on Unhealthy Areas, chaired by [[Neville Chamberlain]] (1919-1921), recommending the restriction of further industry in London and the relocation of some of the city’s existing industry to garden cities. Although nothing came of these studies they became the origin of Chamberlain’s urban decentralisation interests which led to his setting up of the Barlow Commission once Prime Minister. Further important advances included a 1935 Departmental Committee recommendation for the building of new towns in line with garden city principles and a 1936 Special Areas Report reiterating the idea that no new industry should be allowed in London which gained public and political interest &lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt;

== The Barlow Royal Commission ==
In 1938 Chamberlain, as the new Prime Minister, assigned a Royal Commission chaired by [[Sir Anderson Barlow]] into the urban concentration of population and industry. The resulting report raised the problem of large towns as a public issue for the first time and concluded that ‘planned decentralisation’ was favourable. However, owing to the outbreak of war in 1939 the Barlow Report, published in 1940, was initially ignored due to more immediate priorities although it eventually became a turning point for New Towns policy.&lt;ref&gt;Gibberd, F. 1980. ‘Harlow: the story of a new town’. Publications for Companies. Stevenage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage brought on by the [[Second World War]] provoked significant public interest in what post-war Britain would be like which was encouraged by the Government who facilitated talk about a ‘[[Better Britain]]’ to boost morale. Furthermore, the [[Ministry of Works and Building]] was commissioned to draft ideas. Ironically, the Barlow Report was quickly turned to as a best practice document.&lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt;

In 1942, following the Report’s recommendation, the Government chose to create a central planning authority in the form of the [[Ministry of Works and Planning]]. More importantly the Government also announced that the Report’s decentralisation and relocation of population and industry initiatives would be followed.

==Plans and Legislation ==
Post-war rebuilding initiatives saw new plans drafted for London which for the first time addressed the issue of decentralisation. Firstly, the [[County of London Plan]] 1943 recognised that displacement of population and employment was necessary if the city was to be rebuilt at a desirable density. Moreover, the [[Greater London Plan]] of 1944 went further by suggesting that over one million people would need to be displaced into a mixture of satellite suburbs, existing rural towns, and new towns.&lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt; 
	
In 1945 the New Towns Committee was formed to consider the “establishment, development, organisation, and administration” &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp 55&lt;/ref&gt; of new towns. Within eight months the committee had completed a highly comprehensive study into these issues resulting in positive recommendations for the construction of new towns. Accordingly, the [[New Towns Act 1946]] was passed which, coupled with the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]], created a revolutionary “machinery for positive town construction”.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp56.&lt;/ref&gt; These innovative Acts resulted in a total of 28 New Towns being constructed in Britain over the following half-century &lt;ref&gt;Hall, P and Ward, C. 1998. ‘Sociable Cities: the Legacy of Ebenezer Howard’. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester pp. 41-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Towns in Britain ==
{{Main|New towns in the United Kingdom}}
It was in 1946 that the hard work of the ‘New Townsmen’ finally paid off with the passing of the [[New Towns Act 1946]]. Swayed by the need for post-war reconstruction, more housing, and a call to halt any further expansion of London’s girth, authorities saw that there was no alternative to the New Town solution.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 27 [[New Towns]] were built after 1946. These were: [[Stevenage]], [[Crawley]], [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Harlow]], [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], [[Basildon]], [[Bracknell]] and [[Milton Keynes]] outside [[London]]; [[Newton Aycliffe]], [[Peterlee]] and [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]] in the [[North East England|North East]]; [[Skelmersdale]] and [[Runcorn]] in the [[North West England|North West]]; [[Corby]], [[Telford]] and [[Redditch]] in the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]]; [[Cwmbran]] and [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] in [[Wales]]; and in [[Scotland]], [[East Kilbride]], [[Glenrothes]], [[Cumbernauld]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]]. Towns that were expanded under the new towns act were [[Peterborough]], [[Northampton]], [[Warrington]], [[Ipswich]] and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]-[[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]]-[[Chorley]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== The New Towns Movement around the world ==

There were similar problems for New Towns advocates in other areas of the world. In Hong Kong, the [[new towns of Hong Kong|new towns]] were developed as an initiative from the British colonial government.  In other areas although they understood the concept and approved in large numbers, planners had trouble convincing their own governments or agencies of the merits of the proposal. In the United States, it was not until the 1960s that New Towns policies were put in place, although after World War Two grants had been extended for such things as [[slum clearance]], improved and increased housing, and road construction, and in the 1950s, to ‘comprehensive renewal projects’.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In the former USSR, more than 800 New Towns were founded after the 1917 Revolution, but their growth was not constrained by specific limits.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason it could be argued that these towns did not meet the criteria for New Towns since planned population and size limitations were an important part of the New Town idea. Other European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Sweden also had some successes with new towns, especially as part of post-war reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable new towns in the United States include [[Reston, Virginia|Reston, VA]]; [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia, MD]]; [[Jonathan, Minnesota|Jonathan, MN;]] [[Peachtree City, Georgia|Peachtree City, GA]]; the "new town in town" of [[Riverside Plaza]] in Minneapolis.

The '''Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics''', or '''Nordita''' ({{lang-da|Nordisk Institut for Teoretisk (Atom)fysik}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/46/032/46032026.pdf Around the Laboratories], IAEA.org.&lt;/ref&gt;), is an international organisation for research in [[theoretical physics]]. It was established in 1957 by [[Niels Bohr]] and the Swedish physicist [[Torsten Gustafson]]. Nordita was originally located at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] ([[Denmark]]), but moved to the [[AlbaNova]] University Centre in [[Stockholm]] ([[Sweden]]) on 1 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main research areas at Nordita are [[astrophysics]], hard and soft [[condensed matter physics]], and [[high-energy physics]].

== Research ==
 
Since Nordita's establishment in 1957 the original focus on research in atomic and nuclear physics has been broadened. 
Research carried out by Nordita's academic staff presently includes [[astrophysics]], [[biological physics]], hard [[condensed matter physics]] and [[materials physics]], soft [[condensed matter physics]], [[cosmology]], [[statistical physics]] and [[complex systems]], [[high-energy physics]], and [[gravitational physics]] and [[cosmology]]. The in-house research forms the backbone of Nordita activities and complements the more service oriented functions. By mission, Nordita has the task of facilitating interactions between physicists in the Nordic countries as well as with the international community; therefore the comparably small institute has a large number of visitors, conferences and scientific programs that last several weeks. 

Notable former or present researchers at Nordita include [[Alexander V. Balatsky]], [[Holger Bech Nielsen]], Axel Brandenburg, [[Gerald E. Brown]], [[Paolo Di Vecchia]], [[James Hamilton (physicist)|James Hamilton]], John Hertz, Alan Luther, [[Ben Roy Mottelson]], Christopher J. Pethick, [[Leon Rosenfeld]], Kim Sneppen, John Wettlaufer, and Konstantin Zarembo.

== Organization ==

[[File:Nordita_Main_Building_Stockholm.png|thumb|right|The Nordita East building in Stockholm]] Nordita is governed by a board consisting of one representative and one alternate member from each Nordic country, headed by a chair person. The board appoints a number of research committees which evaluate proposals and advice the board on scientific and educational matters. 

The Nordita board nominates a director who is appointed by the president of [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] and the vice-chancellor of [[Stockholm University]]. The director, currently [[Thors Hans Hansson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the institute and provides scientific leadership.

== Funding ==

Nordita is funded jointly by the [[Nordic countries]] via the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]], the [[Swedish Research Council]], and the host universities [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm University]] and [[Uppsala University]].

'''Operation Upshot–Knothole''' was a series of eleven nuclear test shots conducted in 1953 at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. It followed ''[[Operation Ivy]]'' and preceded ''[[Operation Castle]]''.

Over 21,000 soldiers took part in the ground exercise [[Desert Rock V]] in conjunction with the ''Grable'' shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtra.mil/documents/ntpr/factsheets/Upshot_Knothole.pdf Operation UPSHOT-KNOTHOLE Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218012525/http://www.dtra.mil/documents/ntpr/factsheets/Upshot_Knothole.pdf |date=February 18, 2013 }}, Defense Threat Reduction Agency&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grable'' was a 280mm shell fired from the "[[nuclear artillery|Atomic Cannon]]" and was viewed by a number of high-ranking military officials.

[[File:Operation Upshot test.ogv|thumb|left|Upshot–Knothole Grable test (film)]]
The test series was notable as containing the first time an atomic artillery shell was fired (shot ''Grable''), the first two shots (both [[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzles]]) by University of California Radiation Laboratory—Livermore (now [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]), and for testing out some of the thermonuclear components that would be used for the massive thermonuclear series of [[Operation Castle]]. One primary device ([[RACER IV|RACER]]) was tested in thermonuclear system mockup assemblies of  [[Mark 14 nuclear bomb|TX-14]], [[Mark 16 nuclear bomb|TX-16]], and [[Mark 17 nuclear bomb|TX-17]]/[[Mark 24 nuclear bomb|TX-24]], to examine and evaluate the behaviour of radiation cases and the compression of the secondary geometries by the primary's x-rays prior to full-scale testing during [[Operation Castle|Castle]].&lt;ref name="swordsoarIII"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=III |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|192}} Following RACER's dodgy performance, the COBRA primary was used in the emergency capability [[Mark 14 nuclear bomb|ALARM CLOCK]], [[Mark 16 nuclear bomb|JUGHEAD]], [[Mark 17 nuclear bomb|RUNT I]], [[Mark 24 nuclear bomb|RUNT II]] thermonuclear devices, as well as in the [[Castle Bravo|SHRIMP]] device.&lt;ref name="swordsoarIII"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=III |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|200}} RACER IV (as redesigned and proof-tested in the [[Upshot-Knothole Simon|Simon]] test) was employed as primary for the ZOMBIE&lt;ref name="swordsoarIII"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=III |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|200}}, RAMROD and [[Castle Koon|MORGENSTERN]]&lt;ref name="swordsoarIII"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=III |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|318}} devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2848">'''Philogène Auguste Joseph Duponchel''' (1774 – 10 January 1846) was a [[France|French]] soldier and [[entomologist]].

==Life and career==
Philogène Auguste Joseph Duponchel was born in 1774 in [[Valenciennes]], [[Nord (French department)|Nord]], and died on 10 January  1846 in [[Paris]]. After studies in [[Douai]], he joined the [[French Army]] when he was sixteen years old and took part in the campaigns of 1795 and 1796. Retiring from the army, he worked afterwards as a government administrator stationed in Paris. He was forced to retire again in 1816, aged 42 years, because of his opinions in favour of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. He then devoted himself to the study of [[insects]].

After twelve years of effort, Duponchel finished in 1838 ''L’Histoire naturelle des lépidoptères de France'', co-authored with [[Jean Baptiste Godart]]. This work consists of seventeen volumes (including twelve signed by Duponchel), 7600 coloured plates and 500 "boards" (which appear under the title ''Iconographie des Chenilles'' or ''Iconography of the Caterpillars''). The volumes were published between 1832 and 1842, and within its pages the authors describe more than four thousand [[species]] of [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]].

Duponchel was one of the founders of the [[Société Entomologique de France]] and was its first treasurer. He was a very close friend of [[Pierre François Marie Auguste Dejean]], [[Auguste Duméril]] and [[Pierre André Latreille]]. He married Marie-Joseph-Désirée Ravet (d. July 1847) and had two sons. His son [[Charles-Edmond Duponchel]] (b. 7 April 1804),&lt;ref&gt;Dion-Tenenbaum 1997, p. 75 note 86.&lt;/ref&gt; studied architecture and was an accountant first class at the ''Ministère de la Guerre'', and his son [[Charles-Edmond Duponchel (architect)|Auguste]] (d. October 1846) was chief medical officer of ''l'Ecole polytechnique''.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://correspondancefamiliale.ehess.fr/document.php?id=4481|title=Duponchel, Philogène Auguste Joseph (1774-1846) et son fils Auguste|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philogène Auguste is buried in the cemetery of [[Montparnasse]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2346">'''Print capitalism''' is a theory underlying the concept of a [[nation]], as a group that forms an [[imagined community]], that emerges with a common language and discourse that is generated from the use of the [[printing press]], proliferated by a [[capitalist]] marketplace. Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and media in the [[vernacular]] (instead of exclusive script languages, such as [[Latin]]) in order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged. Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around their "national print-languages."&lt;ref name="ic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Imagined communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism |last=Anderson |first=Benedict R.

==Terminology==
The term was coined by [[Benedict Anderson]], and explained in depth in his book ''[[Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism|Imagined Communities]]'' in 1983.

==Development of the Modern Nation-State==
The printing press is widely credited for modern nationalism and the birth of the [[nation-state]] as the primary actors in political legitimacy. Soon after the invention of the Gutenberg-style printing press in 1454, literature such as the [[Bible]] was printed in vernaculars. The publication of the [[95 Theses]] in 1517 sparked the [[reformation]], under which Europe went through 200 years of warfare that led to the gradual establishment of the nation-state as the powers that were dominant, over the previous dominance of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, Clay.

[[File:HelenHillListenTotheRoosterFeb06.jpg|thumb|We may appear to be listening when we are not]]
'''Pseudo-listening''' is a type of '''non-listening''' that consists of appearing attentive in conversation while actually ignoring or only partially listening to the other speaker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/pseudolisten&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of pseudo-listening is not to listen, but to cater to some other personal need of the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Messages: The Communication Skill Book|last = McKay|first = Matthew|publisher = New Harbinger Publications|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-57224-592-1|location = Oakland, Ca|pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word pseudo-listening is a compound word composed of the individual words [[Pseudo-|pseudo]] (a Greek root meaning "not real or genuine"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = pseudo {{!}} not real or genuine|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pseudo|website = www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[listening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of listening|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/listening?s=t|website = Dictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of pseudo-listening is trying to multitask by talking on the phone while watching television or completing work.&lt;ref name="Burch"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interpersonal Communication: Building Your Foundations for Success|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n9Txn-cKH80C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=pseudo+listening&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIy8qOtf21yAIVSD4-Ch1-NABD#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudo%2520listening&amp;f=false|publisher = Kendall Hunt|date = 2004-08-01|isbn = 9780757509544|first = Michelle|last = Burch|first2 = Michelle Burch|last2 = Coleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-listening is the most ineffective way to communicate because after the conversation one will not have retained much of the information that was said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Llangari|first1=Edwing|title=Pseudolistening|url=http://edwingllangari.efoliomn.com/pseudolistening|website=Edwing Llangari|publisher=myeflio|accessdate=10/9/2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible reasons ==

# Listening for ways someone can reject you.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter 9 Summary|url = http://faculty.mdc.edu/mroqueta/ch9summary.htm|website = Miami Dade College, Dr. Mildred Roqueta|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Forming your response to the speaker instead of focusing on what is being said.  
# Preoccupation, when there is too much on the mind of the listener, so that they cannot listen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The 1973 annual handbook for group facilitators|last = Pfeiffer|first = William|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|year = 1973|isbn = 9780787903800|location = San Diego|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Preexisting familiarity with the topic of conversation, which results in less effort to actively listen. 
# Only listening for information you want to hear, giving little attention to the rest. 
# Listening only for the flaws in their argument in order to gain an advantage over the speaker. 
# Social pressure to be courteous to those speaking. 
# Hope that they will believe you are listening and return the favor. 
# An effort to build others' views of you. 
# Desire not to hurt someone who is sharing experiences.

== In comparison to active listening ==

Individuals who are pseudo-listening may include minimal encouragers to compensate for their non-listening, such as nodding their heads, looking at the speaker, smiling at the appropriate times, and displaying other aspects of paying attention, so it may be difficult at times to distinguish between active listening and pseudo-listening. Similarly, broad answers or responses that are not relevant to the topic at hand also give away a pseudo-listener. These responses are known as '''tangential responses''' and often run alongside the topic being discussed, but ultimately have nothing to do with the main topic of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Julia|title=Interpersonal Communication|date=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-285-44583-0|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper listening is needed to internalize and comprehend material; without this developed skill, there is potential for either pseudo-listening or a total lack of listening. A person who is truly listening may display certain body language such as maintaining eye contact or positioning their body towards the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Communication and Interpersonal Relationships - Counseling and Health Services|url = http://drexel.edu/healthservices/resources/students/communication/|website = Counseling and Health Services|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real listening is done with the intent to understand a person's perspective, enjoy a person's company, learn new information, or provide assistance or comfort, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Intercultural communication: a teaching and learning framework {{!}} LLAS Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies|url = https://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/paper/1303|website = www.llas.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it affects communication ==

Pseudo-listening is most common in face-to-face communication, but it can also be expressed through phone calls, text messages and e-mails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Listen Like You Mean It|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jennifer-rosen/listen-like-you-mean-it_b_6136092.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective communication is dependent upon both the receiver and the sender to be fully aware of what is being said and heard. When one person projects their thoughts, and the receiver of the message is only pretending to listen, poor communication and possibly misunderstanding often occur. Babies spend their first few years listening to people around them in order to learn language (Childs, Acott-Smith, &amp; Curtis, 1999). According to Edwing Llangari people spend around half their lives listening to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://edwingllangari.efoliomn.com/pseudolistening|title = Edwing Llangari}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article from University of Colorado states that poor listening skills make good communication pretty much impossible to achieve. It says that, "no matter how much care one person or group takes to communicate their concerns, values, interests, or needs in a fair, clear, unthreatening way, if the listener is not willing to receive that information in that way, the communication will fail."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = I’m Sorry What Were You Saying? {{!}} A Look At Interpersonal Communication|url = http://blogs.longwood.edu/matthewmcpartland/2012/10/25/im-sorry-what-were-you-saying/|website = blogs.longwood.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== With couples ===

There are many negative effects on romantic relationships caused by pseudo-listening. These effects can range from making romantic partners feel upset, inhibiting the partner's ability to effectively solve problems, encouraging an unhealthy dependence on the listener, raising the partner's level of stress, making the relationship, as a whole, less stable, causing the romantic partner to be less satisfied with the relationship, and even causing negative effects on the romantic partner's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What are the consequences when you don't listen well?|url = http://www.youmeworks.com/consequences.html|website = www.youmeworks.com|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It’s important to recognize that there are two parts to any conversation, the person doing the talking and the person who is trying to actively listen.

=== With parents and children ===

Among families, teenagers engage in pseudo-listening the most. Teenagers may engage in pseudo-listening because they feel they have better things to do.They may also tune into distractions and act like they are listening. In doing so, it is evident that they listen only when they want to listen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ncur20.com/presentations/13/1388/paper.pdf|title = The Tricky Transition: Communication in the Mother and Adolescent-Daughter Relationship|last = Kraemer|first = Ashley A.|date = 2006|journal = UW-Whitewater Wisconsin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that as people get older, pseudo-listening skills increase. An experiment was done on first-grade and second grade children to see if they could repeat what the teacher had been saying. 90% of first graders and 80% of the second-graders could do so; but when the experiment was repeated with teenagers, only 44% of junior high students and 28% of senior high students could repeat their teachers’ remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baba|first1=Josephine|title=OVERCOMING CHALLENGES TO EFFECTIVE LISTENING-Faulty listening behavious|url=http://wecommunication.blogspot.com/2015/09/overcoming-challenges-to-effective.html|accessdate=Oct 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for parents to have good listening skills, because poor listening from parents can cause the child to be closed off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ncur20.com/presentations/13/1388/paper.pdf|title = The Tricky Transition: Communication in the Mother and Adolescent-Daughter Relationship|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In a classroom ===

[[File:Physical Sciences Classroom.jpg|thumb|Many students pseudolisten during class due to numerous distractions.]]
Recent studies reveal that students rarely encounter curriculum focused on learning and developing the skill of listening. It is possible for a student to go through every level of education without ever having a class teaching them how to listen effectively in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Who's Listening in the Classroom? A Research Paradigm.|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED407659|date = 1997-03-14|first = Charles H.|last = Swanson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often students fall victim to pseudo-listening because of all the distractions they have at their finger tips, such as phones, computers, social media, iPods, etc. Students will often pretend to be listening so that the professor of the class does not verbally chastise, or to avoid being perceived as rude. Effective listening from a teacher is a way of showing concern for their subordinates, which fosters cohesive bonds, commitment, and trust: this can help a class to pay attention and learn what is being taught.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Leaders===

Leadership often involves forming a commitment to the people one is leading, and a large part of this is related to active listening. Pseudo-listening undermines this commitment process and leads to ineffective leadership. Many people think they are listening to others all the time, and while they certainly may be hearing what these people are saying, they are engaging in pseudo-listening. Over time, pseudo-listening can not only weaken perceptions of one as  a leader, but can contribute to problems active listening could otherwise fix and lead to barriers against success in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/236257286?accountid=14472|title = The People Side of Leadership: An Overlooked Opportunity|last = Leheney|first = Mark|date = 2008|journal = Public Manager|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 37|issue = 2|pages = 15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the job, we may need to appear interested in what others say because of their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication Mosaics: An Introduction to the Field of Communication|last = Wood|first = Julia|publisher = Cengage Learning|year = 2010|isbn = 9781111786366|location = |pages = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features that contribute ==
Things such as an accent, height, weight, scars, and even something as small as body posture can all contribute to an audience falling victim to pseudo-listening. Being self-conscious about some of these personal flaws as a speaker may inhibit the listeners experience. This lack of self-confidence could lead to other distractions made by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Be Less Self-Conscious|url = http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/01/26/how-to-be-less-self-conscious/|website = Psych Central.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt; While these physical flaws may lead to disinterest in the reader it could also contribute to nervous actions that may also distract the reader. A few examples of these nervous actions may include but are not limited to clenching your hands, adjusting your hair or clothing, and pacing back and forth while speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 Public Speaking Habits To Avoid At All Costs|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/10-public-speaking-habits-to-avoid-2014-6|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions may lead to a disinterest in the context of a speech and an elevated interest in the person speaking or the environment surrounding them.

Environmental factors such as lighting, temperature, and furniture can affect the attention of the audience in relation to what the speaker has to say. Lighting that is too dark can make an audience tired and consequently disinterested in what the speaker has to say. Temperature and seating arrangements can distract an audience by causing them discomfort, shifting their focus to their own annoyance. Being too far from a speaker can also cause the audience to lose focus because of a sort of "[[Hawthorne effect]]. Physiological noise can also lead to distractions that take an audiences attention from the speaker. This noise may range from ailments and illness, all the way to emotions like arousal. Both sides of the spectrum can affect the audiences attention, for example, a speaker giving a speech while under the illness of a cold will have a stuffy nose or a recurring cough, which can take the audience's focus from the speaker to his cold. The audience can also be influenced by their own lives by shifting their focus on what they will eat for lunch, losing or finding a job, personal relationships, etc. These can all overshadow the messages and ideas that the speaker is trying to deliver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Listening|url = http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/a-primer-on-communication-studies/s05-listening.html|website = 2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facial features as distractions ===

[[File:Matt Wiman Pointy Mustache.jpg|thumb|Try listening to anything this guy has to say - you might find yourself pseudolistening]]
Because facial hair is a striking characteristic of one's face, people often notice and focus on an individual's facial hair. Because of this, listeners may fall victim to pseudolistening. Instead of making eye contact, listeners might focus on the speaker's mustache or beard instead of [[active listening|actively listening]]. Facial hair is distracting to both listeners and observers.This concept can also be applied to situations in which a person has something stuck in his teeth, has visible mucus in his nose, or has conspicuous piercings and tattoos on his face.

=== How to avoid it  ===
Effective listening is crucial to proper communication in everyday life. However, active listening is not a natural process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are You Really Listening?|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/02683949210018331|journal = Journal of Managerial Psychology|pages = 17–21|volume = 7|issue = 6|doi = 10.1108/02683949210018331|first = Marilyn M.|last = Helms|first2 = Paula J.|last2 = Haynes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, even people who consider themselves good listeners often only listen with 25% efficiency.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Effective Listening|url = http://www.wright.edu/~scott.williams/LeaderLetter/listening.htm|website = www.wright.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 9 Things Good Listeners Do Differently|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/habits-of-good-listeners_n_5668590.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active listening involves attentive body language, restating comments and emotions of the speaker, and repeating their ideas back in order to check comprehension accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Training Married Couples in Listening Skills: Effects on Behavior, Perceptual Accuracy and Marital Adjustment|jstor = 584144|journal = Family Relations|date = 1981-04-01|pages = 297–306|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/584144|first = Diana R.|last = Garland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to improve your listening skills. Begin by observing your conversations, and pay special notice to the times you begin to get distracted or ignore the other person and see how it affects your relationships. Once you understand your patterns in conversations, it's easier to change the negative aspects of your conversations. There are three main guidelines everyone should follow if they want to become effective listeners. The most important guideline is being mindful, that is, being disciplined and committed when trying to listen. The next guideline is adapting to listening appropriately because it is beneficial to be skilled in many listening behaviors and to know when each is important. The final guideline to becoming an effective listener is listening actively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interpersonal Communication: Everyday Encounters|last = Wood|first = Julia|publisher = Cenage Learning|year = |isbn = 978-1-305-63452-7|location = Boston, Massachusetts|pages = 182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To listen actively, keep eye contact with the speaker, nod when a message is understood, etc. Paraphrasing what was said in order to communicate to the speaker that you understood their message correctly will also improve listening skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://faculty.northseattle.edu/wholt/bus236/lessons/s05files/listen2.pdf|title = Active Listening: Hear What People are Really Saying|date = |accessdate = 10/7/2015|website = MindTools|publisher = MindTools|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A good tag phrase for paraphrasing is "What I'm hearing you say is...", followed by the question, "Is that right?" This combination of repeating back and asking for confirmation of accuracy frees the speaker to correct any previous ineffective communication.

=== Signs someone is not listening ===
One way to detect pseudolistening is eye fixation: in relaxed conversations, the eye tends to wander or look at other parts of your face. We also tend to smile at one another to reinforce that we agree with them and are listening. The pseudo-listener will do the same but will often smile for too long. During a conversation between two people, their bodies will face each other. A false listener, however, will not have engaged body language; instead, whether their feet face away or they sit next to rather than across from the other person, it is as if their body is trying to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 7 Signs Someone's Not Listening To You|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/signs-someone-is-not-listening-2014-6|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
* Ambushing: Waiting to trap the speaker in his/her own words or ideas; mostly used to support a belief or to prove something.
* Assimilation to Prior Messages: Believing new messages relate to past messages; forgetting that communication changes.
* Critical Listening: Not to be confused with defensive listening, critical listening is listening to analyze and understand the speaker's messages, written or spoken.&lt;ref name="Burch"/&gt; 
* Defensive Listening: A form of listening where the remarks by the speaker are taken personally, so the listener seeks a way to defend themselves against the perceived attack.&lt;ref name="Burch"/&gt;
* Filling in the Gaps: After hearing the beginning, assuming that the information given is the whole story.
* Insensitive Listening: Failing to notice hidden meanings or nonverbal cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poor Listening Habits|url = http://www.theexecutiveadvisory.com/toolkit/poor_listenting_habits.html|website = www.theexecutiveadvisory.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Insulated Listening: Avoiding certain topics.
* Selective Listening: Only paying attention to what one is interested in while ignoring and avoiding the rest of the information given.
* Stage-Hogging: Not really caring for what others have to say: only worried about yourself.

===False representations===

Auditory processing disorder is when a person "is perfectly aware of sounds" yet their brain abnormally deciphers the sounds. This could easily be confused with pseudo-listening because it effects a listeners' reading comprehension. The two differ because auditory processing disorder uncontrollable and unintentional, while pseudolistening is typically done purposely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">The '''rain-out model''' is a [[Scientific modelling|model]] of [[planetary science]] that describes the first stage of [[planetary differentiation]] and [[core (geology)|core]] formation. According to this model, a [[Planet|planetary body]] is assumed to be composed primarily of [[silicate mineral]]s and [[NiFe]] (i.e. a mixture of [[nickel]] and [[iron]]). If temperatures within this body reach about 1500&amp;nbsp;K, the minerals and the metals will melt. This will produce an [[emulsion]] in which globules of liquid NiFe are dispersed in a [[magma]] of liquid silicates, the two being [[immiscible]]. Because the NiFe globules are denser than the silicates, they will sink under the influence of gravity to the centre of the planetary body—in effect, the globules of metal will "rain out" from the emulsion to the centre, forming a core.

According to the rain-out model, core formation was a relatively rapid process, taking a few dozen millennia to reach completion. This occurred at the end of a lengthy process in which the planets were assembled from colliding [[planetary embryo]]s. Only the collisions of such large embryos could generate enough heat to melt entire bodies. Furthermore, it was only after all of the iron and nickel delivered by impacting bodies had arrived that core formation could proceed to completion.

However, this process of core formation was preceded by a long period of partial differentiation, in which some of the nickel and iron within the planetary embryos had begun to separate.

The rain-out model can be invoked to explain core formation in all the [[terrestrial planet]]s, given that these consist primarily of silicates, nickel and iron. It can also be adapted to account for core formation in smaller bodies composed of [[volatiles|ices]] and silicates. In such a case, it would be the denser silicates which would rain out to form a rocky core, while the volatile components would form an icy mantle.

A '''research proposal''' is a document [[wikt:proposal|proposing]] a [[research]] project, generally in the [[science]]s or [[academia]], and generally constitutes a request for [[funding of science|sponsorship]] of that research.&lt;ref name="bizdict"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research proposal|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/research-proposal.html|website=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals are evaluated on the cost and potential impact of the proposed research, and on the soundness of the proposed plan for carrying it out.&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Paul T.

* What [[research question]](s) will be addressed, and [[research design|how]] they will be addressed
* How much time and [[cost estimate|expense]] will be required for the research
* What [[literature review|prior research]] has been done on the topic
* How the results of the research will be evaluated
* How the research will benefit the sponsoring organization and other parties

==Types==
Research proposals may be ''solicited'', meaning that they are submitted in response to a request with specified requirements, such as a [[request for proposal]], or they may be ''unsolicited'', meaning they are submitted without prior request. Other types of proposals include "preproposals", where a [[letter of intent]] or brief [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] is submitted for review prior to submission of a full proposal; continuation proposals, which re-iterate an original proposal and its funding requirements in order to ensure continued funding; and renewal proposals, which seek continued sponsorship of a project which would otherwise be terminated.&lt;ref name="uiac"/&gt;

Academic research proposals are generally written as part of the initial requirements of writing a [[thesis]], [[Academic paper|research paper]], or dissertation. They generally follow the same format as a research paper, with an introduction, a [[literature review]], a discussion of research [[methodology]] and goals, and a conclusion. This basic structure may vary between projects and between fields, each of which may have its own requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1155">In [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]], a '''segregate''', or a '''segregate taxon''' is created when a [[taxon]] is split off from another taxon. This other taxon will be better known, usually bigger, and will continue to exist, even after the segregate taxon has been split off. A segregate will be either new or ephemeral: there is a tendency for taxonomists to disagree on segregates, and later workers often reunite a segregate with the 'mother' taxon. 

If a segregate is generally accepted as a 'good' taxon it ceases to be a segregate. Thus, this is a way of indicating change in the taxonomic status.  It should not be confused with, for example, the subdivision of a genus into [[subgenus|subgenera]].

:For example, the genus ''[[Alsobia]]'' is a ''segregate'' from the genus ''[[Episcia]]''; The genera ''[[Filipendula]]'' and ''[[Aruncus]]'' are segregates from the genus ''[[Spiraea]]''.

'''Spectral efficiency''', '''spectrum efficiency''' or '''bandwidth efficiency''' refers to the [[information rate]] that can be transmitted over a given [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in a specific communication system. It is a measure of how efficiently a limited frequency spectrum is utilized by the [[physical layer]] protocol, and sometimes by the [[media access control]] (the [[channel access]] protocol).&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Link spectral efficiency==
The '''link spectral efficiency''' of a digital communication system is measured in ''[[bit]]/[[second|s]]/[[hertz|Hz]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles of Digital Transmission: With Wireless Applications | author = Sergio Benedetto and Ezio Biglieri | isbn = 0-306-45753-9 | year = 1999 | publisher = Springer | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thfj9S8cbdoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA219&amp;dq=%22spectral+efficiency%22+(bit/s)/Hz&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=ZHSuR4XrIo6IswPtrIH-BQ&amp;sig=KvPGYnsRaQVXQ2AtXXPvPA2c5H8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or, less frequently but unambiguously, in ''(bit/s)/Hz''. It is the [[net bitrate]] (useful information rate excluding [[error-correcting code]]s) or [[maximum throughput]] divided by the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in hertz of a [[communication channel]] or a [[data link]]. Alternatively, the spectral efficiency may be measured in ''bit/symbol'', which is equivalent to ''bits per [[channel use]]'' (''bpcu''), implying that the net bit rate is divided by the [[symbol rate]] (modulation rate) or line code pulse rate.

Link spectral efficiency is typically used to analyse the efficiency of a [[digital modulation]] method or [[line code]], sometimes in combination with a [[forward error correction]] (FEC) code and other physical layer overhead. In the latter case, a "bit" refers to a user data bit; FEC overhead is always excluded.

The '''modulation efficiency''' in bit/s is the [[gross bitrate]] (including any error-correcting code) divided by the bandwidth. 

:'''Example 1''': A transmission technique using one [[kilohertz]] of bandwidth to transmit 1,000 bits per second has a modulation efficiency of 1 (bit/s)/Hz.

:'''Example 2''': A [[V.92]] modem for the telephone network can transfer 56,000&amp;nbsp;bit/s downstream and 48,000&amp;nbsp;bit/s upstream over an analog telephone network. Due to filtering in the telephone exchange, the frequency range is limited to between 300 hertz and 3,400 hertz, corresponding to a bandwidth of 3,400 − 300 = 3,100 hertz. The spectral efficiency or modulation efficiency is 56,000/3,100 = 18.1&amp;nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz downstream, and 48,000/3,100 = 15.5&amp;nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz upstream.

An upper bound for the attainable modulation efficiency is given by the [[Nyquist rate]] or [[Hartley's law]] as follows: For a signaling alphabet with ''M'' alternative symbols, each symbol represents ''N'' = log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''M'' bits. ''N'' is the modulation efficiency measured in ''bit/symbol'' or ''bpcu''. In the case of [[baseband transmission]] ([[line coding]] or [[pulse-amplitude modulation]]) with a baseband bandwidth (or upper cut-off frequency) ''B'', the [[symbol rate]] can not exceed 2''B'' symbols/s in view to avoid [[intersymbol interference]]. Thus, the spectral efficiency can not exceed 2''N'' (bit/s)/Hz in the baseband transmission case. In the passband transmission case, a signal with passband bandwidth ''W'' can be converted to an equivalent baseband signal (using [[undersampling]] or a [[superheterodyne receiver]]), with upper cut-off frequency ''W''/2. If double-sideband modulation schemes such as QAM, ASK, PSK or OFDM are used, this results in a maximum symbol rate of ''W'' symbols/s, and in that the modulation efficiency can not exceed ''N'' (bit/s)/Hz. If digital [[single-sideband modulation]] is used, the passband signal with bandwidth ''W'' corresponds to a baseband message signal with baseband bandwidth ''W'', resulting in a maximum symbol rate of 2''W'' and an attainable modulation efficiency of 2''N'' (bit/s)/Hz. 

:'''Example 3:''' A 16QAM modem has an alphabet size of ''M'' = 16 alternative symbols, with ''N'' = 4 bit/symbol or bpcu. Since QAM is a form of double sideband passband transmission, the spectral efficiency cannot exceed ''N'' = 4&amp;nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz.

:'''Example 4:''' The [[8VSB]] (8-level vestigial sideband) modulation scheme used in the [[ATSC digital television standard]] gives ''N''=3 bit/symbol or bpcu. Since it can be described as nearly single-side band, the modulation efficiency is close to 2''N'' = 6&amp;nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz. In practice, ATSC transfers a gross bit rate of 32&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s over a 6&amp;nbsp;MHz wide channel, resulting in a modulation efficiency of 32/6 = 5.3&amp;nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz.
 
:'''Example 5:''' The downlink of a V.92 modem uses a pulse-amplitude modulation with 128 signal levels, resulting in ''N'' = 7 bit/symbol. Since the transmitted signal before passband filtering can be considered as baseband transmission, the spectral efficiency cannot exceed 2''N'' = 14&amp;nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz over the full baseband channel (0 to 4&amp;nbsp;kHz). As seen above, a higher spectral efficiency is achieved if we consider the smaller passband bandwidth. 

If a [[forward error correction]] code is used, the spectral efficiency is reduced from the uncoded modulation efficiency figure.

:'''Example 6:''' If a forward error correction (FEC) code with [[code rate]] 1/2 is added, meaning that the encoder input bit rate is one half the encoder output rate, the spectral efficiency is 50% of the modulation efficiency. In exchange for this reduction in spectral efficiency, FEC usually reduces the [[bit-error rate]], and typically enables operation at a lower [[signal to noise ratio]] (SNR).

An upper bound for the spectral efficiency possible without [[bit error]]s in a channel with a certain SNR, if ideal error coding and modulation is assumed, is given by the [[Shannon-Hartley theorem]].

:'''Example 7:'''  If the SNR is 1, corresponding to 0 [[decibel]], the link spectral efficiency can not exceed 1&amp;nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz for error-free detection (assuming an ideal error-correcting code) according to Shannon-Hartley regardless of the modulation and coding.

Note that the [[goodput]] (the amount of application layer useful information) is normally lower than the [[maximum throughput]] used in the above calculations, because of packet retransmissions, higher protocol layer overhead, flow control, congestion avoidance, etc. On the other hand, a data compression scheme, such as the [[V.44]] or [[V.42bis]] compression used in telephone modems, may however give higher goodput if the transferred data is not already efficiently compressed.

The link spectral efficiency of a wireless telephony link may also be expressed as the maximum number of simultaneous calls over 1&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency spectrum in erlangs per megahertz, or ''[[Erlang unit|E]]/MHz''. This measure is also affected by the source coding (data compression) scheme. It may be applied to analog as well as digital transmission.

In wireless networks, the ''link spectral efficiency'' can be somewhat misleading, as larger values are not necessarily more efficient in their overall use of radio spectrum. In a wireless network, high link spectral efficiency may result in high sensitivity to co-channel interference (crosstalk), which affects the capacity. For example, in a [[cellular telephone]] network with frequency reuse, [[spread spectrum|spectrum spreading]] and [[forward error correction]] reduce the spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz but substantially lower the required signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to non-spread spectrum techniques. This can allow for much denser geographical frequency reuse that compensates for the lower link spectral efficiency, resulting in approximately the same capacity (the same number of simultaneous phone calls) over the same bandwidth, using the same number of base station transmitters. As discussed below, a more relevant measure for wireless networks would be ''system spectral efficiency'' in bit/s/Hz per unit area. However, in closed communication links such as telephone lines and cable TV networks, and in noise-limited wireless communication system where co-channel interference is not a factor, the largest link spectral efficiency that can be supported by the available SNR is generally used.

== System spectral efficiency or area spectral efficiency ==

In digital [[wireless network]]s, the ''system spectral efficiency'' or area spectral efficiency is typically measured in ''(bit/s)/Hz per unit area'', in ''(bit/s)/Hz per [[cell site|cell]]'', or in ''(bit/s)/Hz per site''. It is a measure of the quantity of users or services that can be simultaneously supported by a limited radio frequency bandwidth in a defined geographic area.&lt;ref name=Miao/&gt; It may for example be defined as the maximum aggregated [[throughput]] or [[goodput]], i.e. summed over all users in the system, divided by the channel bandwidth and by the covered area or number of base station sites. This measure is affected not only by the single user transmission technique, but also by [[multiple access]] schemes and [[radio resource management]] techniques utilized. It can be substantially improved by dynamic [[radio resource management]]. If it is defined as a measure of the maximum goodput, retransmissions due to co-channel interference and collisions are excluded. Higher-layer protocol overhead (above the [[media access control]] sublayer) is normally neglected.

:'''Example 8:''' In a cellular system based on [[frequency-division multiple access]] (FDMA) with a [[fixed channel allocation]] (FCA) cellplan using a [[frequency reuse factor]] of 1/4, each base station has access to 1/4 of the total available frequency spectrum. Thus, the maximum possible system spectral efficiency in ''(bit/s)/Hz per site'' is 1/4 of the link spectral efficiency. Each base station may be divided into 3 cells by means of 3 sector antennas, also known as a 4/12 reuse pattern. Then each cell has access to 1/12 of the available spectrum, and the system spectral efficiency in ''(bit/s)/Hz per cell'' or ''(bit/s)/Hz per sector'' is 1/12 of the link spectral efficiency.

The system spectral efficiency of a [[cellular network]] may also be expressed as the maximum number of simultaneous phone calls per area unit over 1&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency spectrum in ''[[Erlang unit|E]]/MHz per cell'', ''E/MHz per sector'', ''E/MHz per site'', or ''(E/MHz)/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This measure is also affected by the source coding (data compression) scheme. It may be used in analog cellular networks as well.

Low link spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz does not necessarily mean that an encoding scheme is inefficient from a system spectral efficiency point of view. As an example, consider [[CDMA|Code Division Multiplexed Access (CDMA)]] [[spread spectrum]], which is not a particularly spectral efficient encoding scheme when considering a single channel or single user. However, the fact that one can "layer" multiple channels on the same frequency band means that the system spectrum utilization for a multi-channel CDMA system can be very good.

:'''Example 9:''' In the [[W-CDMA]] 3G cellular system, every phone call is compressed to a maximum of 8,500 bit/s (the useful bitrate), and spread out over a 5&amp;nbsp;MHz wide frequency channel. This corresponds to a link throughput of only 8,500/5,000,000 = 0.0017&amp;nbsp;''(bit/s)/Hz''. Let us assume that 100 simultaneous (non-silent) calls are possible in the same cell. [[Spread spectrum]] makes it possible to have as low a frequency reuse factor as 1, if each base station is divided into 3 cells by means of 3 directional sector antennas. This corresponds to a system spectrum efficiency of over 1 × 100 × 0.0017 = 0.17&amp;nbsp;''(bit/s)/Hz per site'', and 0.17/3 = 0.06 ''(bit/s)/Hz per cell or sector''.

The spectral efficiency can be improved by [[radio resource management]] techniques such as efficient fixed or dynamic [[channel allocation]], [[power control]], [[link adaptation]] and [[diversity scheme]]s.

A combined [[fairness measure]] and system spectral efficiency measure is the [[fairly shared spectral efficiency]].

'''Stepan Petrovich Krasheninnikov''' ({{lang-ru|Степа́н Петро́вич Крашени́нников}}) ({{OldStyleDate|November 11|1711|October 31}} – {{OldStyleDate|March 8|1755|February 25}}) was a [[Russia]]n explorer of [[Siberia]], [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[geographer]] who gave the first full description of [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] in the early 18th century. He was elected to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1745. The [[Krasheninnikov (volcano)|Krasheninnikov Volcano]] on Kamchatka is named in his honour.

== Early life ==
Krasheninnikov was educated in the [[Slavic Greek Latin Academy]] of [[Moscow]] (1724–32), where [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]] was his class-mate. As part of [[Vitus Bering]]’s extensive preparations for the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]], 12 students from the [[Slavic Greek Latin Academy|academy]] were selected as potential student interns or assistants for the professors – Krasheninnikov being one of them. Thus, he furthered his education in [[St Petersburg]] before embarking upon the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]] (1731-42).&lt;ref name="Egerton (2008)"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Egerton | first = Frank N. | title = A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 27: Naturalists Explore Russia and the North Pacific During the 1700s | journal = Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–60 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1890/0012-9623(2008)89[39:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Second Kamchatka Expedition ==
Krasheninnikov was to study plants, animals and minerals, but in addition he developed a strong interest in [[Siberia]]n history and geography.&lt;ref name="Egerton (2008)"/&gt; During the early part of the expedition, he accompanied professor [[Johann Georg Gmelin|Gmelin]] on the travel through the [[Ural mountains|Urals]] and western [[Siberia]] to [[Yeniseysk]]. He made numerous observations of [[natural history]], [[ethnology]] and [[linguistics]], e.g. records of [[Evenki language|Evenki]] (tungus) and [[Buryat language|Buryat]] vocabulary. From [[Vitus Bering|Bering]]’s headquarters at [[Yakutsk]], the expedition professors [[Johann Georg Gmelin|Gmelin]] and [[Gerhard Friedrich Müller]] sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] to build house and make preliminary observations. Thus, he became the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the peninsula. He published his observations in 1755 ("Описание земли Камчатки";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Krasheninnikov | first = S.P. | title = Описание земли Камчатки, vol. 1 | publisher = Imperial Academy of Sciences | year = 1755 | location = St petersburg | url = http://www-gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/cgi-bin/digbib.cgi?PPN33096285X | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Krasheninnikov | first = S.P. | title = Описание земли Камчатки, vol. 2 | publisher = Imperial Academy of Sciences | year = 1755 | location = St petersburg | url = http://www-gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/cgi-bin/digbib.cgi?PPN330963163 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; English translation by [[James Grieve (Scottish translator)|James Grieve]] (1764) as ''History of Kamtschatka''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Krasheninnikov | first = S.P. | title = History of Kamtchatka, and the Kurilski Islands, with the countries adjacent.

However, he drew extensively on the manuscripts of the deceased [[Georg Wilhelm Steller]]. Apart from detailed accounts of the plants and animals of the region, there also were reports on the language and culture of the indigenous [[Itelmen]] and [[Koryaks|Koryak]] peoples, who he reportedly got along extremely well with.

== Later life ==
Krasheninnikov spent ten years on the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]]. On his return to [[St Petersburg]], he wrote and defended his [[doctorate degree|doctoral thesis]] on [[ichthyology]] in 1745. He was appointed adjunct at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]], and later head of the Academy’s [[Botanic Garden]] and [[professor]] of [[natural history]] at the [[Saint Petersburg State University#History|university]]. He was one of only 26 [[Russia]]ns to become [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy]] members in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Egerton (2008)"/&gt; In 1752, Krasheninnikov went on his last expedition to the tracts of [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Novgorod]] to investigate the [[flora]]. He died before being able to publish his observations, which instead were published by [[David de Gorter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = de Gorter | first = David | title = Flora Ingrica ex schedis Stephani Krascheninnikow confecta et propriis observationibus | publisher = Typis Academiae Scientiarum | year = 1761 | location = Petropoli | url = https://archive.org/details/floraingricaexsc00gort | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Wormald was awarded the [[Fuchs Medal]], which is awarded by the BAS for "outstanding devotion to the British Antarctic Survey's interests, beyond the call of normal duty, by men or women who are or were members of the Survey, or closely connected with its work."&lt;ref name="NGIS"/&gt; In 1978, Wormald received the [[Polar Medal]], which is awarded by the British government "for outstanding services as members of the British Antarctic Survey".&lt;ref&gt;''Second Supplement To The London Gazette of Monday, 13th November 1978'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wormald Ice Piedmont]], a peak on Adelaide Island, was subsequently named after him.&lt;ref name="australian"/&gt; &lt;ref name="NGIS"/&gt;
