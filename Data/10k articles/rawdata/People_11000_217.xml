      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5124">'''Al-ʿAbbās ibn Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn''' was the eldest son of the founder of the [[Tulunid dynasty]], [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], and heir-apparent until his failed attempt to usurp his father in 879. After a failed attempt to take over [[Ifriqiya]], he was imprisoned in Egypt and executed shortly after the succession of his brother, [[Khumarawayh]], in May 884.

==Biography==
Abbas was the eldest son of [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]],{{sfn|EI2|p=1}} the son of a [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave who had ruled [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]] since 868. By exploiting the dissensions in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] between Caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] and his brother [[al-Muwaffaq]], Ibn Tulun soon managed to establish his autonomy from the Abbasid government, and proceeded to expand his control over [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] as well.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=176–177}} Preoccupied with the conquest of Syria, Ibn Tulun appointed Abbas as his deputy in Egypt. Within a short time, however, his entourage persuaded him to try and seize power for himself. Forewarned by the [[vizier]] al-Wasiti, Ibn Tulun returned from Syria in April 879 and thwarted his son's ambitions. Taking the treasury with him, Abbas and his supporters—as well as an armed force numbering some 800 cavalry and 10,000 black African infantry—fled first to [[Alexandria]] and then to [[Barqa]]. Ibn Tulun tried to persuade him to return and even offered him a pardon, but Abbas refused.{{sfn|EI2|p=1}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=96}}

Instead, he resolved to take over [[Ifriqiya]] by invading it with his army, augmented by local contingents on the way, and deposing the local [[Aghlabid dynasty]]. To legitimize his move, Abbas claimed that he had received nomination as Ifriqiya's governor by al-Mu'tamid, but the Aghlabid emir [[Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya|Ibrahim II]] responded by sending a cavalry force to meet him.{{sfn|EI2|p=1}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=96}} Abbas defeated the local Aghlabid governor, Muhammad ibn Qurhub, sacked the town of [[Labda (town)|Labda]], and marched on [[Tripoli]]. The [[Ibadite]] leader and governor of Tripoli and [[Jabal Nafusa]], Ilyas ibn Mansur al-Nafusi, mobilized resistance to the invader. His 12,000–strong army defeated Abbas in winter 880/1.{{sfn|EI2|p=1}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=96–97}}

Abbas, with the remnants of his army, fled east and was defeated and captured outside Alexandria by troops loyal to his father. Brought as a prisoner to the Egyptian capital, [[Fustat]], he was publicly paraded seated on a mule, and was commanded to execute or mutilate the most prominent of his followers, who were held responsible for urging him to rebel, by gouging their eyes and cutting off their arms. Ibn Tulun reportedly had hoped that his son might refuse this command, and was dismayed when Abbas complied.{{sfn|EI2|p=1}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=97}} Weeping at Abbas's cruelty and untrustworthiness, Ibn Tulun ordered him flogged and imprisoned. His place in the succession was taken up by his younger brother [[Khumarawayh]] in 882.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=97}}{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}} When Ibn Tulun died in May 884, Khumarawayh, enjoying the backing of the Tulunid elites, succeeded him without trouble, and Abbas was executed.{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=104}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5447">'''Aleksandr Yakovelich Galpern''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Яковлевич Гальперн}}; 1879—28 June 1956), also known as '''Alexander Halpern''', was a Russian [[Menshevik]] politician and attorney, who played a significant part in the [[Russian Revolution]]. He was a member of the [[Grand Orient of the Peoples of Russia]] and sat in [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s [[Russian Provisional Government]]. Following the [[October Revolution]], he fled abroad to the [[United Kingdom]]. During the [[Second World War]], Halpern worked in British service as an [[MI6]] agent in the [[United States]], as part of [[British Security Co-ordination]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Halpern was born into a family of [[Russian Jews]] in [[St. Petersburg]]. His father, Yakov Markovich Halpern (1840-1914) was a prominent official of the [[Ministry of Justice of the Russian Empire]] and a lawyer. Halpern graduated from the Faculty of Law of [[St. Petersburg University]] and became an attorney at St. Petersburg. Politically, Halpern was aligned with the [[Menshevik]]-wing of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. He worked as a legal adviser to the British Embassy in St. Petersburg, working with a number of British and American firms.

===Menshevism and Masonry===
He joined an irregular [[freemasonic]] lodge; the [[Grand Orient of the Russian Peoples]]; upon the recommendation of [[Alexander Kerensky]] and [[Bruno Germanovič Lopatin-Bart]]. He sat as a member of the Supreme Council of the Grand Orient from 1912 to 1917 and was the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of the Grand Orient from 1916 to 1917.
In February 1917 he replaced [[Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov]] as manager of the affairs of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and held this post until the overthrow of the Provisional Government in October 1917 during the [[October Revolution]]. He was associated with the failed [[Junker mutiny|Committee for Salvation of Motherland and Revolution]]. Until the end of 1918, he lived covertly in [[Moscow]] and [[Petrograd]], before fleeing first to Paris and then to London.

===Exile and in British intelligence service===
[[File:Salomea Andronikova (1910).jpg|thumb|[[Salomea Andronikova]] married Alexander Halpern in 1925.]]
In 1928 he gave an interview about Freemasonry to [[Boris Nikolayevsky]], later published in the book ''"Russian Masons and Revolution."'' He married [[Salomea Andronikova]]; for a long time the couple lived separately, Halpern in [[London]], and his wife in Paris. The two reunited in the United Kingdom only in the 1940s.

During the [[Second World War]], Halpern lived in [[New York City]] in the [[United States]], working for British Intelligence ([[British Security Co-ordination]]). The project was set up in 1940 by the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) under the approval of [[Winston Churchill]]. The primary objective of the operation was to change the American public mood from one of isolationism to intervention in the war. While there he maintained contact with old Mensheviks such as [[Boris Nicolaevsky]], [[Irakli Tsereteli]], [[Raphael Abramovitch]] and others, who collaborated in ''The Socialist Herald''.

After the war he returned to England, where he lived with his wife in a house at 39 Chelsea Park Gardens in the affluent area of [[Chelsea, London]]. One of the rooms in the Halpern house was handed over to Anna Kallin (1896-1984), a mistress of [[Oskar Kokoschka]] who worked for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] as a producer. While in London, Halpern was well acquainted with personalities such as [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Moura Budberg]], [[Anthony Blunt]] and [[Zinovy Peshkov]]. Halpern was for a long time the chairman of the [[World ORT|ORT UK]]. He died in 1956.

'''Alton Coleman''' (November 6, 1955&amp;nbsp;– April 26, 2002) was an American spree killer, along with accomplice Debra Brown, who committed a crime spree across six states in the [[Midwest]] where 8 people were murdered between May and July 1984. Coleman, who received [[death sentences]] from three states, was [[executed]] by the state of [[Ohio]] in 2002. Brown was also sentenced to death in Indiana, but the death penalty was commuted to life imprisonment without possibility of parole in Illinois.

==Criminal Background==

===Alton Coleman===
Alton Coleman was born on November 6, 1955, in [[Waukegan, Illinois]]. Coleman's mother worked three jobs, and he lived with his 73-year-old grandmother in Waukegan. A [[middle-school]] drop-out, Coleman was well known to the [[Illinois]] [[law enforcement]] community, having been charged with [[sex crime]]s six times between 1973 and 1983. Two of the cases were dismissed, with Coleman pleading [[Guilty plea|guilty]] to lesser charges in two and was twice [[acquitted]]. Coleman was scheduled to go on trial in Illinois on charges stemming from the [[rape]] of a 14-year-old girl when he fled and began his killing spree.

Coleman was diagnosed with mixed [[personality disorder]] with [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[narcissistic]] and obsessive features, with additional diagnoses including [[epileptic spasms]], [[psychosis]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://federal-circuits.vlex.com/vid/alton-coleman-betty-mitchell-warden-36308103 Appeal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117082918/http://federal-circuits.vlex.com/vid/alton-coleman-betty-mitchell-warden-36308103 |date=2016-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debra Brown===
Debra Brown, one of 11 children, is borderline [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], suffered head [[Physical trauma|trauma]] as a child, and a psychiatrist diagnosed her with [[dependent personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Brown vs. State"&gt;{{cite web |title=BROWN vs. STATE {{!}} FindLaw's Supreme Court of Indiana case and opinions. |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/in-supreme-court/1074796.html |website=Findlaw |publisher=Thomson Reuters. |accessdate=24 September 2018 |date=17 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown was [[engaged]] to another man when she met Coleman in 1983, but left her family and moved in with him shortly afterwards. Although a willing participant in the assaults and murders, Brown had no history of violence, or any record of trouble with the law until she met Coleman.

==Murders==

===Wisconsin and Illinois===

Coleman and Brown committed their first crime when they killed nine-year-old Vernita Wheat from [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]. Coleman had befriended her mother, Juanita Wheat, and on May 29, 1984, Coleman abducted Vernita and took her to Waukegan.&lt;ref name="wilkinson2002" /&gt; Vernita's badly decomposed [[corpse]] was discovered on June 19, 1984 in an abandoned building four blocks from Coleman's grandmother's apartment.&lt;ref name="wilkinson2002" /&gt; It was determined she had been raped, and the cause of death was [[ligature strangulation]].

On May 31, 1984, Coleman befriended Robert Carpenter in Waukegan and spent the night at his home. The next day he borrowed Carpenter's car to go to the store and never returned.

===Indiana and Michigan===

In June 1984, Coleman and Brown were in [[Gary, Indiana]] and encountered two young girls there, nine-year-old Annie &lt;!-- Out of respect for her privacy, the author (User:Marklemagne) is unilaterally withholding Annie's surname. It is available to interested parties in the various court records. --&gt;&lt;!-- This is an admirable but futile effort. It's also in the news reports. --&gt; and her [[niece]], seven-year-old Tamika Turks.&lt;ref name="mccain2002" /&gt; Both Coleman and Brown had [[sexually assaulted]] Tamika and Annie (who survived), and on June 19, Tamika's partially decomposed body was discovered.&lt;ref name="trutv" /&gt; The day that the body of Tamika Turks was found, Donna Williams, a 25-year-old woman from Gary, disappeared.&lt;ref name="trutv" /&gt; On July 11, Williams's badly decomposed body was discovered in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] about half a mile from where her car was found. She had been raped and killed by ligature strangulation.&lt;ref name="trutv" /&gt;

On June 28, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Mr. and Mrs. Palmer-Jones of [[Dearborn Heights, Michigan]], whom they beat severely. Coleman ripped the telephone from their wall before stealing money and their car.

===Ohio===

On July 5, Coleman and Brown arrived in [[Toledo, Ohio]], where Coleman befriended Virginia Temple, the mother of several children. Temple had stopped communicating with her relatives, and concerned about the welfare of her children, they entered Temple's home and found the young children alone and frightened. Temple and her eldest child, 9-year-old Rachelle, had been strangled to death, and their bodies were discovered in a [[Basement#Crawl space|crawl space]].&lt;ref name="mp5"&gt;{{cite web | last = | title = Panel weighs arguments about killer's fate | work = Murderpedia  | publisher = Columbus Dispatch | date = 17 April 2002 | url = http://www.murderpedia.org/male.C/c1/coleman-alton.htm | accessdate = 4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same morning as the murders of Virginia Temple and her daughter, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Frank and Dorothy Duvendack in Toledo, where Coleman bound the couple with appliance and phone cords which had been cut, taking money and their car.&lt;ref name="trib870122"&gt;{{cite web | last = Enstad | first = Robert | title=Coleman's threat told by witness |work = Chicago Tribune | publisher = | date = 22 January 1987 | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-01-22/news/8701060498_1_crime-spree-alton-coleman-debra-brown | accessdate = 4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Mrs. Duvendack's watches was stolen, and later found under another victim. Later that same day, Coleman and Brown visited the [[Dayton, Ohio]] home of [[Reverend]] Millard Gay and his wife Kathryn. The two stayed with the Gays and accompanied them to a religious service on July 9, where the next day the Gays dropped off Coleman and Brown in downtown [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].

On July 12, Tonnie Storey, a 15-year-old girl who lived in the [[Over-the-Rhine]] neighborhood of Cincinnati disappeared, and eight days later her raped and murdered body was discovered.&lt;ref name="wilkinson2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mp1"&gt;{{cite web | last =Ludlow | first =Randy | title =Clock runs out on Alton Coleman | work =Cincinnati Post | publisher =| date = 26 April 2002 | url =http://www.murderpedia.org/male.C/c1/coleman-alton.htm | accessdate = 4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[bracelet]] that had been stolen from the Temples in Toledo was found under Storey's body. Coleman and Brown were later convicted of the rape and murder of Storey, and [[sentenced to death]] for it, but Brown's death sentence was commuted, and later, in a separate proceeding, Coleman's sentence of death was overturned.&lt;ref name="wilkinson2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trib020425"&gt;{{cite web | last = Mills | first = Steve | title = '84 killer on eve of execution | work = Chicago Tribune | publisher = | date = 25 April 2002 | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-04-25/news/0204250300_1_appeals-court-alton-coleman-death-sentence | accessdate = 4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, the [[FBI]] added Coleman to its [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted List]] as a "special addition". Coleman was just the tenth person since the initiation of the list in 1950 to merit inclusion in such a manner.

Coleman and Brown bicycled into [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]] on July 13 at about 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Less than three hours later, they drove away in a car belonging to Harry Walters, who was [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a [[Campervan|camper]] he had offered for sale. While Walters sat on the couch and discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden [[candlestick]] and, after admiring it, hit Walters on the back of the head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of [[bone]] against Mr. Walters' brain, and he remembered little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the [[basement]] steps, and her father still alive. Both had [[ligature strangulation|ligatures]] around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her head was covered with a bloody sheet. The [[coroner]] indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of [[locking pliers]], covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red [[Plymouth Reliant]], was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.

Two days later, the Walters's Plymouth Reliant was found abandoned in [[Kentucky]], where the couple had kidnapped Oline Carmical, Jr., a college professor from [[Williamsburg, Kentucky|Williamsburg]], and drove back to Dayton with Carmical locked in the trunk of his car.&lt;ref name="wilkinson2002" /&gt; On July 17, they abandoned this stolen vehicle in Dayton, Ohio, and Carmical, who was still locked in the trunk, was rescued by authorities. Coleman and Brown later received 20-year sentences for a [[Federal Kidnapping Act|Federal kidnapping charge]] for bringing Carmical across a state line.&lt;ref name="trib850420"&gt;{{cite web | last=Witt | first=Howard | title=Coleman Outbursts Delay Jury Seating | work = Chicago Tribune | publisher = | date = 20 April 1985 | url =http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-04-20/news/8501230481_1_coleman-trial-murder-trial-opening-arguments | accessdate = 4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman and Brown returned to the home of Reverend and Mrs. Gay in Dayton. Reverend Gay recognized Coleman, who at this time was the subject of a huge nationwide manhunt, and Coleman accosted Millard and Kathryn with guns. Reverend Gay asked Coleman, "Why you want to do us like that, like this?", and according to Gay, Coleman responded: "I'm not going to kill you, but we generally kill them where we go." Coleman and Brown took their car and headed back toward [[Evanston, Illinois]]. Along the way, they stole another car in [[Indianapolis]] and killed its owner, 75-year-old Eugene Scott.&lt;ref name="trutv"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gribben | first = Mark | title = Alton Coleman &amp; Debra Brown: Odyssey of Mayhem | work = Crime Library | publisher = truTV-Turner-Time Warner | date =  | url = http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/coleman/index_1.html | accessdate = 4 April 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513154946/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/coleman/index_1.html | archive-date = 2008-05-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 1984, Alton Coleman became the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1980s|388th fugitive listed by the FBI]] on its [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted list]].&lt;ref name="50th"&gt;{{cite book|author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |title=FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives Program: 50th Anniversary 1950-2000 |publisher=K&amp;D Limited, Inc. |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and conviction==
Three days later, on July 20, Coleman and Brown were arrested in Evanston, Illinois.&lt;ref name="crimeindetroit"&gt;{{cite web | last = Flanigan | first = Brian | author2 = Joe Swickard | title = Alton Coleman is Arrested | work = Detroit Free Press | publisher =  | date = 21 July 1984 | url = http://www.crimeindetroit.com/Documents/Alton%20Coleman%20is%20Arrested.pdf | accessdate = 4 April 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018170825/http://crimeindetroit.com/Documents/Alton%20Coleman%20is%20Arrested.pdf | archive-date = 2012-10-18 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Coleman and Brown walked westward across an intersection, they passed immediately in front of a man in a car stopped at the red light who was from Coleman's neighborhood in Waukegan. He recognized Coleman and drove north to a [[gas station]] and notified the police. A description of the two was broadcast to police. As officers entered the area, a detective saw Coleman and Brown sitting on portable bleachers in empty Mason Park, but noted they were wearing different T-shirts. As the detective reported this, two sergeants who were driving by the park heard this, turned, and saw Coleman and Brown. As they approached Coleman, the officers observed Brown walking away from Coleman toward the rear of the park. The detective joined the two sergeants and Coleman was approached for questioning; he had no identification and denied he was Alton Coleman. Meanwhile, two other officers stopped Brown as she tried to exit the park, searched her, and found a gun in her purse. The pair were taken into custody without incident and transported to the Evanston Police Department, where both were identified by their [[fingerprints]].
  
In the Evanston police station, Coleman was strip-searched and a [[steak knife]] was found between two pairs of sweat socks he was wearing. When taken into custody, they had a shopping bag full of varied T-shirts and caps. Officers learned that the pair stopped every three to four blocks as they walked and changed shirts and caps.&lt;ref&gt;Arresting officers, Scharm, Trigoura, Hynds, Walker, Grinnel&lt;/ref&gt; A week after they were arrested, more than 50 law enforcement officials from Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio met to plan their strategy for prosecuting Coleman and Brown, as the two had committed crimes within each state. Desiring the [[death penalty]] for Coleman and Brown, Michigan was quickly ruled out because it did not employ capital punishment. Eventually it was decided to give Ohio the first attempt at sentencing, with U.S. Attorney [[Dan K. Webb]] stating, "We are convinced that prosecution (in Ohio) can most quickly and most likely result in the swiftest imposition of the death penalty against Alton Coleman and Debra Brown".

The state of Ohio convicted Coleman and Brown, finding them guilty of the rape and murder of Tonnie Storey in Cincinnati and Marlene Walters in Norwood, but not for the murder of Virginia Temple and Rachelle Temple in Toledo. Coleman and Brown were both sentenced to death and the [[appeals]] process began. Coleman's case was sent to the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] several times between 1985 and 2002, but his numerous arguments that his conviction and death sentence were unconstitutional failed to sway the justices.

==Execution of Coleman==

On April 25, 2002, the [[Ohio Supreme Court]] rejected a claim by Coleman's [[defense attorney|attorney]]s that the state's plan to accommodate the large number of victims and survivors who wanted to view the [[execution]] would turn it into a "spectator sport". So many victims and survivors of Coleman's crimes were allowed to witness the execution that prison officials had to set up a closed-circuit viewing venue outside of the building. For his [[last meal]], Coleman ordered a well-done filet mignon smothered with mushrooms, fried chicken breasts, a salad with French dressing, sweet potato pie topped with whipped cream, French fries, collard greens, onion rings, cornbread, broccoli with melted cheese, biscuits and gravy, and [[Coca-Cola Cherry|Cherry Coke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Meals on Death Row (2002)|work=Dead Man Eating|url=http://www.deadmaneating.com/dme2002.html|accessdate=2007-11-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929003435/http://www.deadmaneating.com/dme2002.html|archivedate=2007-09-29|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, 2002, reciting [[Psalm 23]], Alton Coleman was executed by [[lethal injection]] in the death chamber at the [[Southern Ohio Correctional Facility]] in [[Lucasville, Ohio]]. Reginald Wilkinson, director of the [[Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction]], said Coleman had not directly expressed remorse for the killings, but that he had "admitted what he's done in his own convoluted way."&lt;ref name="mccain2002"&gt;{{cite web | last = McCain | first =Marie | title = Coleman dies for his crimes | work = Cincinnati Enquirer | publisher =Gannett | date =27 April 2002 | url =http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/04/27/loc_coleman_dies_for_his.html | accessdate = 4 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman had received two death sentences from Ohio, and one apiece from [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]]. At the time of his execution, he was the only condemned person in the United States to have death sentences in three states.&lt;ref name="wilkinson2002"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilkinson | first =Howard | title =Alton Coleman finally faces justice | work = Cincinnati Enquirer | publisher =Gannett | date =24 April 2002 | url =http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/04/24/loc_alton_coleman.html | accessdate = 4 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment of Brown==

Brown, who was originally sentenced to be executed in Ohio for her complicity in the crimes, had her death sentence commuted to life in prison by [[Governor of Ohio|Governor]] [[Richard Celeste]] in 1991. In commuting Brown's sentence, Governor Celeste cited her low [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] scores, ranging from 59 to 74, and her "master-slave" relationship with Coleman influencing her actions. Brown was one of eight Ohio [[death row]] inmates (including all four of the Ohio's female death row inmates) to have her sentence commuted by Celeste, a staunch opponent of capital punishment, a week before he left office. Despite her non-violent history before the spree, Brown was initially unrepentant for her acts. During the sentencing phase of her first Ohio trial, Brown sent a note to the judge which read in part: "I killed the bitch and I don't give a damn. I had fun out of it." She still has a [[death sentence]] for the murder of Tamika Turks which the two committed in Indiana. However, Brown is serving her sentence without possibility of parole at the [[Dayton Correctional Institution]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].

Brown finally showed remorse for her crimes when she apologized to the families of her and Coleman's victims in a video in 2005.

==Racial motive==
Some authorities believe that Coleman and Brown (who are both [[African-American]]) usually selected African-American victims because they knew they would blend in better in the black community and that their crimes lacked a [[racism|racial motive]]. However, on page 184 in ''The Anatomy of Motive'', [[John E. Douglas]], a retired FBI [[Profiler (criminology)|profiler]], mentions that Coleman, in the middle of a vicious sexual assault, "went into a practically incoherent tirade about how blacks were forcing him to rape and murder other blacks, as if that could somehow explain and justify his actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndouglasmindhunter.com/research/synopsis_anatomy.php |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208122813/http://www.johndouglasmindhunter.com/research/synopsis_anatomy.php |archivedate=December 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman and Brown left a racist slogan - 'I hate niggers. Death' - written in [[lipstick]] at the scene of the rape and murder of Tonnie Storey, one of their victims who was not African-American.&lt;ref name="mp3"&gt;{{cite web | last = Ludlow | first = Randy | title = Alton Coleman: His time to die | work = Murderpedia | publisher = Cincinnati Post | date = 23 April 2002 | url = http://www.murderpedia.org/male.C/c1/coleman-alton.htm | accessdate = 4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hrant Dink Plaket.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Hrant Dink]]
The prominent [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkish-Armenian]] journalist [[Hrant Dink]] was [[Assassination|assassinated]] in [[Istanbul]] on 19 January 2007. Dink was a newspaper editor who had written and spoken about the [[Armenian Genocide]], and was well known for his efforts for reconciliation between Turks and Armenians and his advocacy of [[Human rights|human]] and [[minority rights]] in Turkey. At the time of his death, he was on trial for violating [[Article 301 (Turkish Penal Code)|Article 301]] of the [[Turkish Penal Code]] and "denigrating Turkishness". His murder sparked both massive national protests in Turkey itself as well as widespread international outrage.

== Death threats ==
Dink had long endured threats by extreme [[Turkish nationalist]]s for his statements on Armenian identity and the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.cpj.org/news/2007/mideast/turkey19jan07na.html | title= Turkish-Armenian editor murdered in Istanbul | publisher = [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] | date=19 January 2007|accessdate=24 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070125033034/http://www.cpj.org/news/2007/mideast/turkey19jan07na.html| archivedate= 25 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fox070119"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,245047,00.html| title = Three arrested in Turkey for murder of outspoken journalist Hrant Dink| accessdate = 9 February 2007| date = 19 January 2007|work = [[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regularly received emails threatening his life, responding in one instance by comparing himself to a dove, "equally obsessed by what goes on on my left and right, front and back. My head is just as mobile and fast".&lt;ref name="bbc070120"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6283461.stm| title = Hrant Dink's final article| accessdate = 9 February 2007| date = 20 January 2007| work = [[BBC News]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070214045759/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6283461.stm| archivedate= 14 February 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He complained about the indifference of the Turkish government to this atmosphere of terror: "Do you ministers know the price of making someone as scared as a dove?"{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In his final ''Agos'' column on 10 January 2007, Dink noted that propaganda targeting him led many Turkish citizens to consider him an enemy of Turkey:
{{quote|"It is obvious that those wishing to alienate me and make me weak and defenseless reached their goal. Right now they have brought about a significant circle of people who are not low in number and who regard me as someone "insulting Turkish identity" due to dirty and false information."&lt;ref name="Agos070124"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.bianet.org/2006/11/01_eng/news90552.htm| title = A ‘dove's skittishness’ in my soul| accessdate = 24 February 2007| last = Dink| first = Hrant| date = 10 January 2007| work = [[Agos]]| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025830/http://www.bianet.org/2006/11/01_eng/news90552.htm#| archive-date = 27 September 2007| dead-url = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also complained of the indifference of Turkish authorities to his security:
{{quote|"My diary and the memory of my computer are full of messages from citizens of this circle full of rage and threats.  (Let me note that I regarded one among them posted from Bursa as an imminent threat and submitted it to Public Prosecutor’s office in Şişli but got no result.)"&lt;ref name="Agos070124"/&gt;}}

Despite his complaints, Dink never formally requested protection from the authorities because he did not want to lead a sheltered life. His lawyer, Erdal Doğan, confirmed this feeling of Dink.&lt;ref name="bbc070119"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6280687.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title= Turkish-Armenian writer shunned silence|first=Chris|last=Morris|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=24 February 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070122100039/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6280687.stm| archivedate= 22 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hurriyet5808478"&gt;{{cite news |title= Türkiye’yi vurdular |url= http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/5808478.asp |work= [[Hürriyet]] |date= 20 January 2007 |accessdate= 25 January 2007  | language=Turkish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070122052628/http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/5808478.asp| archivedate= 22 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week before his assassination, Dink wrote that he felt "nervous and afraid" owing to the intensity of the [[hate mail]] he had been receiving: "I see myself as frightened, the way a dove might be, but I know that the people in this country would never harm a dove."&lt;ref name="time070119"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1580657,00.html |title=An Assassination Shocks Istanbul |accessdate=19 January 2007 |work=[[TIME]] |last=Turgut |first=Pelin |date=19 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121113808/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1580657%2C00.html |archivedate=21 January 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHT070119"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/19/europe/EU-GEN-Turkey-Journalist-Killed-Arrests.php| title= Istanbul governor says 3 arrested in connection with murder of journalist Hrant Dink |accessdate=19 January 2007 |work= [[International Herald Tribune]]| date=19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture of the suspected shooter===
One day after the assassination, the police announced that the shooter had been identified in video footage collected through both the Istanbul MOBESE electronic surveillance network (4,000+ cameras throughout the city) and local security cameras. They later released photos to the public while urging every citizen to aid with the investigation. On the same evening, Istanbul Governor [[Muammer Güler]] addressed the press to state that special investigation committees were pursuing nearly two dozen leads and that the police were analyzing ten thousand phone calls made from the vicinity of the crime scene.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

News agencies reported on Saturday, 18:22 GMT, that the shooter had been identified as "Ogün Samast", a teenager born in 1990 and registered as residing in [[Trabzon]], the same city where, a year before Dink's assassination, the [[Roman Catholicism in Turkey|Catholic]] priest [[Andrea Santoro]] was shot dead by a 16-year-old native of the city, in front of the church of Santa Maria of Trabzon, which is a nationalist gathering center.&lt;ref name="BBCarrest"/&gt; In recent years, Trabzon has become an important recruiting place for ultra-nationalist movement.&lt;ref name="Libe"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/monde/229950.FR.php | title=Affaire Hrant Dink : un assassin dans la mouvance nationaliste | work=[[Libération]] | first=Marc | last=Semo| date=21 January 2007 | accessdate=22 January 2007  | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samast's father identified him from the publicly released photos and alerted the authorities.

==Funeral==
Dink's funeral service was held on 23 January 2007 in the Surp Asdvadzadzin Patriarchal Church in the [[Kumkapı]] neighborhood of Istanbul. Dink's funeral ceremony developed into a demonstration at which a hundred thousand citizens marched in protest of the killing.&lt;ref name="Funeral" &gt;{{cite news |url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=5829273 |title= Turkey embraces the memory of Hrant Dink; hundreds of thousands march |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=24 January 2007|work=[[Hürriyet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service was attended by members of the Turkish government and representatives from the Armenian diaspora, as well as religious leaders. Although Turkey had [[Armenian-Turkish relations|no official diplomatic relations with Armenia]] at that time, by invitation of the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Abdullah Gül]], the Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister [[Arman Kirakosian]] was present at the funeral.&lt;ref name="zaman070130"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=100902 |title= Mourners reconcile at Dink funeral |accessdate= 30 January 2007 |date=24 January 2007 |work=[[Today's Zaman]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070222002818/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=100902 |archivedate = 22 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Erdoğan]] was not present at the funeral, because he had to attend the scheduled inauguration of the Mount Bolu Tunnel.&lt;ref name="TP070122"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=159978 | work=Turkish Press | date=22 January 2007 | accessdate=24 February 2007 | title=Erdogan says suspect was caught with the gun he allegedly used in murder }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the church services, the hearse made a final tour for the thousands of marchers still gathered at Yenikapı, before proceeding to [[Balıklı, Istanbul|Balıklı]] Armenian Cemetery in Istanbul's [[Zeytinburnu]] neighborhood, where Dink's body was laid to rest. At the cemetery Rev. Krikor Agabaloglu (Pastor of the Armenian Evangelical Church of Gedikpaşa) and Rev. Rene Levonian (Armenian Evangelical World Council's representative) delivered short speeches in Turkish and in Armenian.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The funeral astonished and changed the thoughts of some diaspora Armenians about Turkey. For example, Isabelle Kortian, an important diaspora (French) Armenian who came to Turkey for the funeral  of Hrant Dink, wrote an article for a Turkish newspaper Zaman on 25 January 2007 saying "The Turks' embracing Dink made an effect of an earthquake on us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/yorum_ermeni-diasporasinin-onde-gelen-ismi-isabelle-kortian-turklerin-dinki-kucaklamasi-bizde-deprem-etkisi-yapti_492213.html | work=Zaman | date=25 January 2007 | title=Türklerin Dink'i kucaklaması bizde 'deprem etkisi' yaptı}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The Istanbul Criminology Department stated that from the empty shells, they were able to determine that the assassination weapon used 7.65 millimeter ammunition and had never been used in another crime.&lt;ref name="ntvmsnbc070121"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/news/397591.asp |title=Katil zanlısı yakalandı |work=[[NTV-MSNBC]] |date=21 January 2007 |accessdate=21 January 2007 | first=Ünsal | last=Ünlü  | language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmet Çokçınar, a prosecutor in the city of Samsun told the Anatolia news agency that Samast has confessed to killing Hrant Dink.&lt;ref name="cnnturk070120" /&gt; According to this preliminary news, Samast said the killing was a personal act and did not have any organizational agenda.&lt;ref name="haberturk070120"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haberturk.com/haber.asp?id=12770&amp;cat=110&amp;dt=2007/01/20 |title=Dink'in katil zanlısı Samsun'da yakalandı|work=HaberTürk|date=20 January 2007|accessdate=20 January 2007  | language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Samast's uncle Faik Samast has told private NTV television that he didn't think his nephew was capable of acting alone – "He didn't even know his way around Istanbul,"  "This kid was used."&lt;ref name="cnn070121"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Teen admits killing journalist |work=[[CNN]] |date=21 January 2007 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/01/21/turkey.dink/index.html |accessdate=24 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125023341/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/01/21/turkey.dink/index.html |archivedate=25 January 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samast said that he killed Dink for "insulting Turks", and that he doesn't regret it.&lt;ref name="reuters070121"&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenager shot editor for insulting Turks – report|work=[[Reuters]]|date=21 January 2007|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=B657279&amp;WTmodLoc=World-R5-Alertnet-4|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070501055203/http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=B657279&amp;WTmodLoc=World-R5-Alertnet-4|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 May 2007|accessdate=21 January 2007|first=Paul|last=de Bendern}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to media reports, Samast is a high school dropout and a possible drug addict.&lt;ref name="cnn070121"/&gt; Later news reports stated that Samast had had no idea of the significance of his act until watching TV coverage, and that he had ended his written confession with an expression of remorse.&lt;ref name="hurriyet-en-5830266"&gt;{{cite news |title= Trabzon circle of suspects widens; Ogun Samast says "I am sorry I killed him" |url= http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5830266.asp |work= [[Hürriyet]] |date=24 January 2007|accessdate= 24 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070128051023/http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5830266.asp| archivedate= 28 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three people were taken into custody regarding the murder on the day of the killing.&lt;ref name="IHT070119"/&gt; However, movements tied to the ultra-nationalist movement are currently suspected of carrying out the murder, in particular after the arrest of [[Yasin Hayal]], a militant who spent 11 months in prison for having taken part in the bombing of a McDonald's in Trabzon in 2004, and of [[Karadeniz Technical University]] student Erhan Tuncel, who was close to the Alperen organization, the [[neo-fascist]] youth organization associated with the ultra-nationalist and Islamist party [[Great Union Party]] (BBP), created by former members of the [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP).&lt;ref name="Libe"/&gt; Yasin Hayal confessed to telling Samast to kill Dink and supplying the murder weapon, while Erhan Tuncel has been charged as a main instigator of the killing, and allegedly directed both Samast and Hayal.&lt;ref name="Trabzonlegend"&gt;{{cite news |title= A "Trabzon Legend" gave the orders to kill Hrant Dink |url= http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5817478.asp?gid=74 |work= [[Hürriyet]] |date=22 January 2007|accessdate= 22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBP has denied any involvement in the assassination.&lt;ref name="hurriyet-en-5830266"/&gt; Hrant Dink was described as a "traitor" by the Turkish far right, and had received up to 2,600 death threats from ultra-nationalist circles.&lt;ref name="bbc070121" /&gt; According to rumors reported by Turkish newspapers in late January 2007, Erhan Tuncel was actually a police informer for the Trabzon Police. The rumors also suggested that he warned Trabzon police office before the murder, but that the warnings were ignored.&lt;ref name="hurriyet070129"&gt;{{cite news |first= Saygı |last=Öztürk |title= O, duruşma salonuna hiç girmedi |work= [[Hürriyet]] |url= http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=5856494 |date= 29 January 2007 |accessdate= 30 January 2007|language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations concerning the nationalist underground [[Ergenekon network]] have led to suspicions concerning Ergenekon's involvement in Dink's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=150919 Ergenekon indictment to be included in Malatya murders case], ''[[Today's Zaman]]'', 22 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Folder 441 of the [http://www.zaman.com.tr/import.do?ergenekon-delilleri Ergenekon indictment's annex] contains evidence that Dink's entire family was targeted. Staff colonel Ferhat Özsoy allegedly pressured chief master sergeant Murat Şahan into carrying out the assassination, offering him 300,000 Lira in reward. Şahan, who was undergoing psychiatric treatment as a result of being 70,000 Lira in debt, resisted and filed a complaint from a military hospital, where he was forced to undergo an examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeteport.com.tr/GUNCEL/NEWS/GP_257967|accessdate=13 September 2008|title=Astsubaya Dinkleri öldürmesi için 300 bin YTL teklif|department=Yargı / GÜNCEL|work=Gazeteport|date=2 August 2008|first=Sedef Senkal|last=Demir|language=Turkish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929004305/http://www.gazeteport.com.tr/GUNCEL/NEWS/GP_257967|archivedate=29 September 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns over a possible cover-up===
On 3 October 2007, the TV station [[NTV Turkey|NTV]] reported that the police file on Erhan Tuncel, a prime suspect in the murder case, had been destroyed on the grounds that the file was a "state secret" before the court had a chance to see the document.&lt;ref name="TZ-destroy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=123851 |title=Police destroy file on Dink murder suspect |accessdate= 7 October 2007 |date= 4 October 2007 |work=[[Today's Zaman]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006180313/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=123851 |archivedate = 6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawyer for the Dink family, Erdal Doğan, repeated the concern that much evidence was destroyed and lost that might reveal relationships between the suspects and members of the security forces, including a tape from a security camera outside a bank near the Agos offices where Dink was killed.&lt;ref name="TP-cover-up"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=196480 |title=Turkish police accused of cover-up in journalist's murder |accessdate= 7 October 2007 |date= 7 October 2007 |work= Turkish Press| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071002201354/http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=196480| archivedate= 2 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doğan said that the chief of police intelligence ({{lang-tr|Emniyet Genel Müdürlüğü İstihbarat Daire Başkanı}}), Ramazan Akyürek, ordered the expungement of a suspect's 48-page testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2008/08/18/haber,8D97117215674891AB647710C32B3BF7.html|accessdate=25 December 2008|title='Akyürek görevdeyken çözülmez'|date=18 August 2008|language=Turkish|first=Ecevit|last=Kilic|work=Sabah|quote=Hrant Dink cinayetinden terör örgütü yöneticisi olarak yargılanan bir sanığın basında gündeme gelmesinden dolayı üzüntülerini belirten, yine bu sanık ile ilgili tutulan 48 sayfalık raporun imha edilmesi için savcılara adeta talimat veren, yine bu davadaki sanıkları arkadaş grubu olarak niteleyen, bu grubun cinayeti Hrant Dink'in 'Türklüğü aşağıladığı' nedeniyle gerçekleştirdiği yönünde mahkemeye görüş ve rapor sunan Emniyet Genel Müdürlüğü İstihbarat Daire Başkanı Ramazan Akyürek var.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lawyers of the Dink family investigated the security camera records which were screening the street where the assassination took place, they identified four suspects speaking with their cellphones. Thereupon they requested the [[GSM]] call operation logs of the [[Şişli]] region Turkish Telecommunication Authorities around the time when the murder happened and the time where they identified the cell phone usage from the security cameras. Two major GSM providers reported that they do not have any GSM base station in that region, hence they cannot identify anything. The other major GSM operator in Turkey stated that there was no single call operation during the reported times. The lawyers stated that it is almost impossible that there cannot have been any calls during these hours or that the companies cannot have any base station, because Şişli is one of the most crowded regions in Istanbul at those times.&lt;ref name=radikal&gt;"GSM operatorleri" http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalDetayV3&amp;ArticleID=1058853&amp;Date=4 August 2011&amp;CategoryID=77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ntvgsm&gt;"Kapsama Alani Disinda"http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25238632/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the security camera recordings shows that there was gsm communication indeed during that times.

In 2013 a secret witness told prosecutors of [[JITEM]] and Gendarmerie involvement in Dink's murder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 19 March 2013, [http://todayszaman.com/news-310165-secret-witness-says-gendarmerie-was-with-dink-killer-at-every-step.html Secret witness says gendarmerie was with Dink killer at every step]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 13 February 2013, [http://todayszaman.com/news-306945-secret-witness-ready-to-tell-all-about-network-that-killed-dink.html Secret witness ready to tell all about network that killed Dink ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 15 February 2013, [http://todayszaman.com/news-307204-witness-provides-new-evidence-of-state-collusion-in-dink-murder.html Witness provides new evidence of state collusion in Dink murder]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2015, arrest warrants were issued for two police officers, making them the first public servants arrested in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hürriyet Daily News]], 12 January 2015, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/arrest-order-issued-for-two-policemen-in-dink-murder-case.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=76849&amp;NewsCatID=509l Arrest order issued for two policemen in Dink murder case]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Over one hundred thousand people marched in Dink's Funeral to protest against his assassination, holding placards that said "We are all Armenian" and "We are Hrant Dink" in both Turkish, Kurdish and Armenian.''(See funeral above.)'' Later, these placards were protested by the far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]]. The leader of MHP described the placards saying "We are all Armenian" as "a freak show organized by those who do not participate in martyr funerals". On the other hand, a party council member of the main-opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]], a member of [[Socialist International]], said "We became ashamed of being Turkish. I am Turkish and I protest the assassination. Maybe we should have carried the placards saying 'We are all Human' instead of 'We are all Armenians'. The placards that say "assassin [[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|301]]" are also wrong.

"In a sense, we are all responsible for his death," he said. "However, at the very forefront of this responsibility are those who still defend Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. Those who campaigned against him, those who portrayed this sibling of ours as an enemy of Turkey, those who painted him as a target, they are the most responsible in this.

====Subsequent actions====
* Hüseyin Yavuzdemir, governor of Trabzon and Reşat Altay, chief of police of Trabzon were removed from duty and a special investigation team was sent from Ankara to Trabzon to investigate the situation in the city.&lt;ref name="hurriyet27jan"&gt;{{cite news| last =Gürel| first =Soner| title =Fatura onlara| work =[[Hürriyet]]| date =27 January 2007| url =http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=5847305| language=Turkish | accessdate = 28 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ferryboat on the [[Gelibolu]]–[[Lapseki]] line was hijacked by Nihat Acar (36), who protested the slogan "We are all Armenian".

The hijacker, who worked at a convenience shop in Gelibolu, surrendered after holding the ferry captain hostage for 2 hours.&lt;ref name="hurriyet070128"&gt;{{cite news| last =Zelova| first =Doğan| title =Vapur Eylemcisi Adliye'de| work =[[Hürriyet]]| date =28 January 2007| url =http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/5851829.asp?m=1&amp;gid=112&amp;srid=3428&amp;oid=1| accessdate = 28 January 2007|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the 7th day after Hrant Dink's murder, a dance troupe organized a protest in front of Agos, where they asked passersby to lie in front of Agos in the same position as the murdered journalist, with a newspaper over their bodies.&lt;ref name="ciplakayaklar"&gt;{{cite web| title =Çıplak Ayaklar Kumpanyası | url =http://www.ciplakayaklar.com| accessdate = 28 January 2007| language=Turkish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070128145826/http://www.ciplakayaklar.com/| archivedate= 28 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 50 people took part, despite heavy rain. The organizers said that they were asking people to lie on the sidewalk for ten minutes and to die symbolically for a rebirth.
* Agos, whose normal circulation was about 6,000, was printed 30,000 copies, distributed nationally, and was getting ready for a re-print of its first issue since the murder of its editor-in-chief. A group of intellectuals and journalists took part in selling Agos on the streets of Istanbul.&lt;ref name="bia070126"&gt;{{cite news| last =Korkut| first =Tolga| title =Agos'un Yeni Sayısı Bütün Türkiye'de| work =BİA| date =26 January 2007| url =http://www.bianet.org/2007/01/26/90812.htm| language =Turkish| accessdate =28 January 2007| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070214072016/http://www.bianet.org/2007/01/26/90812.htm| archivedate =14 February 2007| deadurl =yes| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  On 1 February 2007, the private Turkish television channel ''TGRT'', which was bought by [[Rupert Murdoch]], broadcast video footage of the man accused of shooting Hrant Dink posing proudly behind a Turkish flag, flanked by police officers of both military and security police, allegedly filmed in the police bureau of Samsun where he was taken after his arrest. The video caused shock and consternation as commentators warned it was another sign of the growing power of Turkish ultranationalism, as the nation geared up for parliamentary and presidential elections later that year. Ismet Berkan, editor of the liberal newspaper ''[[Radikal]]'', said that the release of the video was akin to killing Dink a second time. It proved, he claimed, "that the murderer and his associates are not alone, that their supporters ... have penetrated all segments of the state." A police spokesperson said an investigation into the video footage and its leaking was underway.&lt;ref name="independent070203"&gt;{{cite news| title = Turkish police posed for picture with killer of Armenian journalist|first=Peter | last=Popham  | work=[[The Independent]]| date =3 February 2007| url =http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2211573.ece| accessdate = 3 February 2007| location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070205053221/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2211573.ece| archivedate= 5 February 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours of the existence of such footage had been circulating for days, but were officially denied. In an apparent act of retaliation to the broadcasting of the footage, the [[Turkish Armed Forces|Turkish General Staff]] canceled the accreditation of [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s TGRT, required for attending press events at the staff headquarters. The general director of TGRT, Murat Akgiray, and the director responsible for the broadcasting, Bahattin Apak, have resigned.&lt;ref name="haberturk070202"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haberturk.com/haber.asp?id=13938&amp;cat=140&amp;dt=2007/02/02 |title=TGRT istifa haberine yanıt verdi |accessdate=3 February 2007 |date=2 February 2007 |work=HaberTürk |language=Turkish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203231810/http://www.haberturk.com/haber.asp?id=13938&amp;cat=140&amp;dt=2007%2F02%2F02 |archivedate=3 February 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protesters marched with Turkish flags, portraits of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and carried placards reading, "We all are Mustafa Kemal. We all are Turks." Among the demonstrators were children wrapped in Turkish flags, chanting nationalistic slogans.&lt;ref name="haberler070204"/&gt;

==Trial==

The Dink murder trial opened in Istanbul on 2 July 2007.  18 people were charged at Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No 14 in connection with the journalist's assassination.&lt;ref name="BBC-trial"&gt;{{cite news | title = Dink Murder Trial Opens in Turkey| work = [[BBC News]]| date = 2 July 2007| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6259762.stm| accessdate = 2 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the main suspect, Ogün Samast, was younger than 18, the hearing was not public. Reportedly the defendants Yasin Hayal and Erhan Tuncel repeated their testimonies given to the security forces and prosecutor. The court decided to release the defendants Osman Altay, Irfan Özkan, Salih Hacisalihoglu and Veysel Toprak to be tried without remand and adjourned the hearing to 1 October.

The indictment demanded aggravated life imprisonment for Erhan Tuncel and Yasin Hayal for "inciting the killing of Hrant Dink". Since the alleged killer, Ogün Samast, who was younger than 18 at the time of the murder, was served a sentence between 18 and 24 years imprisonment. Yasin Hayal's brother was charged as an accessory to the crime and has to serve a sentence between 22.5 years and 35 years imprisonment. The other defendants were charged as "members or supporter of a terrorist organisation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tihv.org.tr/tihve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2124:3%20July%202007%20-%20DAILY%20HUMAN%20RIGHTS%20REPORT&amp;catid=50:july-2007&amp;Itemid=83 Daily report dated 3 July 2007] of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey (HRFT)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009 the 8th hearing was held. Seven of eight defendants under arrest attended the hearing. At the end three defendants were released and the hearing was adjourned to 20 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tihv.org.tr/tihve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2512:27-january-2009-daily-human-rights-report-&amp;catid=72:january-2009&amp;Itemid=83 See report of the HRFT of 27 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]], Dink's murder trial is "a critical test of the Turkish judiciary's independence."&lt;ref name="BBC-trial" /&gt;

==Verdict of courts==
On 25 July 2011, Ogün Samast was convicted of murder and being in illegal possession of a firearm by Istanbul's Heavy Juvenile Criminal Court. He was sentenced to 22 years and 10 months in prison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Turkey: Sentence in Editor’s Death| work = [[BBC News]]| date = 25 July 2011| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14282111| accessdate = 1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Hrant Dink murder: Turk Ogun Samast jailed| work = [[The New York Times]]| date = 25 July 2011| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/world/europe/26briefs-Turkey.html| accessdate = 1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was commuted from [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]] under Turkish juvenile law. After serving two thirds of it, Samast will be eligible for parole in 2021 or 2022.

On 16 January 2012, Istanbul's 14. Heavy Criminal Court reached a verdict with the remaining defendants. The court ruled there was no conspiracy behind the assassination, and stated that the assassination was an ordinary killing. [[Yasin Hayal]] was found guilty of [[murder]] and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Two other men were convicted of assisting him and they were each sentenced to 12 years and 6 months in prison. Erhan Tuncel was found not guilty of Dink's murder, but was found guilty of the McDonald's bombing in Trabzon. He was sentenced to 10 years and 6 months for the bombing, and was paroled due to the 5 1/2 years time served. The remaining suspects were all acquitted in the case.

===ECtHR proceedings===
In September 2010, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found that Turkish authorities violated Dink's right to life (Article 2 [[ECHR]]) by not acting to prevent the murder and by not punishing the police for inaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=873669&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR 14.09.2010. judgment on applications No. 2668/07, 6102/08, 30079/08, 7072/09 and 7124/09]{{fr icon}} and [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=873693&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:george-baker-bridget-doyly-carte.jpg|right|thumb|300px|With [[George Baker (baritone)|George Baker]] at a Gilbert and Sullivan Society celebration in 1964]]

'''Dame Bridget Cicely D'Oyly Carte''', [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (25 March 1908 – 2 May 1985), was the granddaughter of impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] and the only daughter of [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]].  She was head of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] from 1948 until 1982.

Though as a child she was not enthusiastic about [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], after her father's death in 1948, Bridget D'Oyly Carte inherited the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which performed and controlled the copyrights to the joint works of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], as well as all of her family's business interests.  She had begun to assist her father in managing the [[Savoy Hotel]] in 1933, also undertaking child welfare work.  

She hired [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager of the opera company in 1951 and moved to keep the [[Savoy opera]]s fresh, marketing them as a bridge between popular and classical music.  After the copyrights to the Gilbert and Sullivan works expired in 1961, she transferred the opera company to a charitable trust that she headed.  Mounting losses, and the refusal of the Arts Council to provide a grant, forced the closure of the company in 1982, although the company re-formed after Carte's death and mounted several productions up to 2003.

In 1972, Carte founded the D'Oyly Carte Charitable Trust to support charitable causes in the fields of the arts, medical welfare and the environment.  She was created a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]] in 1975.  With no children of her own or surviving siblings, she was the end of her family line.

==Life and career==
Bridget Cicely D'Oyly Carte was born at Suffolk Street, [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], London, and educated in England and abroad. Her father was [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], and her mother was the former Lady Dorothy Milner Gathorne-Hardy (1889–1977), the youngest daughter of the [[John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook|2nd Earl of Cranbrook]].&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;Obituary notice, ''[[The Times]]'', 3 May 1985, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather was [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], who founded the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Oyly "was a forename (not part of a double surname)". Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32311}}. The name comes from her grandfather's great grandmother, Elizabeth D'Oyly, who was a descendant of Peregrine D'Oyly of Overbury Hall in [[Layham]], Suffolk (c. 1625–1667).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Savoy Hotel, London.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Savoy Hotel]]]]
In 1926, when she was only 18, she married her first cousin, John David Gathorne-Hardy, the fourth [[Earl of Cranbrook]] (1900–1978),&lt;ref&gt;Both were grandchildren of [[John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook]].&lt;/ref&gt; an explorer and naturalist. As a result of her marriage, Carte was styled as Countess of Cranbrook, and her married name was Gathorne-Hardy.&lt;ref&gt;Lundy, Darryl, ed. [http://thepeerage.com/p3563.htm#i35621 "Bridget Cicely Carte"], ThePeerage.com, 28 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They soon separated and finally divorced in 1931; she relinquished her title and resumed her maiden name by [[deed poll]] in 1932, also dropping the name Cicely, which she disliked.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U163678 "D'Oyly Carte, Dame Bridget"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition @ ukwhoswho.com, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 30 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then resumed her education at [[Dartington Hall]] in Devon from 1931 to 1933, a school with a long musical tradition, taking courses in dance, teacher training, art and design.  There she met designer [[Peter Goffin]] who became a long-time friend.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Taylor, C. M. P. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31046 "Carte, Dame Bridget Cicely D'Oyly (1908–1985)"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (2004), Oxford University Press, accessed 20 June 2009. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accidental death of her only brother, Michael (1911–1932), made Carte the heir to her father's hotel and theatre interests.  As a child, however, she had been reluctant to assume the family legacy.  She later told ''The Gramophone'' magazine:  "At home, you know, we weren't allowed to ''hum'' Gilbert and Sullivan; in fact we were fined for it, because it annoyed my father. We were allowed to sing it properly, but my brother and I couldn't – in my family the fact that I wasn't Mozart at about three years old was thought of as rather disappointing. So I went through a phase when I was very anti-Gilbert and Sullivan; I became rather a highbrow, and my father thought I was a bit of a snake-in-the-grass because of it."&lt;ref&gt;"Wimbush, Roger. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/March%201975/33/838552 "Here and There"], ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'', March 1975, pp. 1630–33 (p. 33 in online version), accessed 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 to 1939, Carte was an assistant to her father at the [[Savoy Hotel]], taking responsibility for furnishing and interior decoration, for which she had training and aptitude.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; Upon the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], however, she undertook child welfare work and continued with it until her father's death in 1948.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The family home was [[Coleton Fishacre]], a house that her parents had built in [[Devon]] between [[Paignton]] and [[Kingswear]] in 1925.  The house is still known for its design features and garden with exotic tropical plants.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'', 25 October 2007, pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;  

After her parents' divorce in 1941, Bridget D'Oyly Carte took over the house, which her father, who lived in London, would visit for long weekends.  Shortly after her father's death, she sold Coleton Fishacre, and it is now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden "Coleton Fishacre"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217084145/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden# |date=17 December 2009 }}, National Trust, accessed 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 she bought [[Shrubs Wood]], Chalfont St Giles, [[Buckinghamshire]], designed by the architects [[Erich Mendelsohn]] and [[Serge Chermayeff]].  Here she pursued her love of gardening and gave summer parties for disadvantaged or disabled children.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; In 1953, Carte was a member of the committee overseeing the decorations for the Coronation Ball at the [[Savoy Hotel]] in honour of the coronation of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 November 1952, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing the family interests===
When her father died in 1948, she inherited all his interests including the Savoy Hotel group and [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|the family's opera company]], which presented the [[Savoy Operas]] from 1875 to 1982. She did not succeed Rupert D'Oyly Carte as chairman of the Savoy Hotel group, in which she retained a large shareholding, but she became an active director. She moved into a suite in the Savoy Hotel and resumed control of the furnishing and decoration departments. When the Savoy Group acquired them, she took interest in the soft-furnishing company, James Edwards, and was chairman of the royal florists, Edward Goodyear Ltd.  She became vice-chairman of the Group in 1971 and was its president at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

At first, Bridget D'Oyly Carte "did not feel qualified to sustain the responsibility" of running the opera company.&lt;ref name=Mander&gt;Mander and Mitchenson, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she was determined to prove herself.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Frederic. "The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company – How it Works" in ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Journal'', 8/14, May 1964, pp. 220–21&lt;/ref&gt; One of her early decisions proved especially unpopular and led to a wave of important defections from the company at the end of the [[Festival of Britain]] season in 1951, most importantly, [[Martyn Green]].  This was the 1949 hiring, as stage director, of [[Eleanor Evans]], Mrs. [[Darrell Fancourt]], known as "Snookie" in the company.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. v&lt;/ref&gt; Green wrote in 1952: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I ... told Miss Carte that I thought she was making a great psychological error.  During [[Anna Bethell]]'s regime (Mrs. [[Sydney Granville]]), there had been growing signs of discontent and suggestions of favouritism.... But to appoint not only a woman who had for fifteen years worked in the chorus alongside several who were now principals, but the wife of one of the main principals, seemed to me to be a psychological error of the first magnitude.  I felt that ... she would, rightly or wrongly, be accused of that very same favouritism.  My views made no impression on Miss Carte, but time was to prove that I was right....  Production is done to a plan that takes no consideration of the individual, his personality or his histrionic ability – a stereotyped plan that results in a clockwork performance devoid of spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Green, pp. 236–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The historian Tony Joseph wrote: "But Green was not the only member of the Company to leave....  [[Ella Halman]] left too.  So did [[Richard Watson (singer)|Richard Watson]] ... Margaret Mitchell ... [[Radley Flynn]] and no fewer than twenty-two other small part players and choristers.  It was the largest single exodus of performers in D'Oyly Carte history, and that was why the sense of sadness that hovered over the season was so marked....  August 1951 was the end of an era.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Cynthia Morey, who joined the Company just before the defections, wrote: "I have never found out precisely why this great exodus took place....  We were always under the impression that we should feel honoured to be in the employ of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company; it was patently obvious that the management held firmly to the policy that nobody is indispensable".&lt;ref&gt;Morey, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;  Morey noted that Evans had played several roles with the company and commented, "In 1927 she was apparently demoted to the chorus, and there she remained for [fifteen years]. ...  I should not have thought these qualifications sufficient for such an important post; to spend all those years as a chorister seems to signify a lack of ambition or achievement.  But I suppose a 'Director of Productions' in those days merely needed to know every move and every gesture, and exactly when they occurred, for no departure from the set production was ever permitted."&lt;ref&gt;Morey, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Walker (singer)|Richard Walker]], [[Kenneth Sandford]] and others also criticised Evans's temperament and methods.  She retired as stage director in 1953, the year that her husband died, but she was engaged to coach new D'Oyly Carte principals in their roles for some years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/E/EvansEleanor.htm "Eleanor Evans",] ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', 24 June 2002; accessed 26 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt, John. [http://pinafore.www3.50megs.com/k-sandford-fav.html "The Ones that I Like"], Interview with Sandford, at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, reproduced from ''The Savoyard'', Vol. XI, No. 2, September 1972&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carte made an important move to hire [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager in 1951, which position he continued to discharge until the company closed.  In running the D'Oyly Carte Opera company she took steps to keep the productions fresh, engaging designers to redesign the costumes and scenery.  Her old friend, Peter Goffin, who had previously redesigned ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' and ''[[Ruddigore]]'' for Rupert D'Oyly Carte, designed a unit set in 1957 to facilitate and reduce the cost of touring.  He also produced new settings and costumes for ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1957), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1958 – settings only, most of the celebrated [[Charles Ricketts]] costumes being retained), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1958), ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1959), ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1961), and ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1961).  ''[[Princess Ida]]'' was redesigned by James Wade in 1954.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt;

Carte claimed that the most important function of the operas, which in later years she advertised rather as musicals, was "to bridge the generation gap and link serious music to pop."&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 1 March 1981&lt;/ref&gt; She televised and had recordings and films made of some of the operas, engaged [[Malcolm Sargent|Sir Malcolm Sargent]] to conduct performances at the [[Festival of Britain]] season in 1951 at the operas' original London home, the [[Savoy Theatre]], and supported an increasing number of tours of the United States.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In 1960 the company's own touring orchestra was formed as a change from the ad hoc recruitment of players at each venue.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; In 1975 the company produced a centenary season at the Savoy Theatre, in 1977 it gave a royal [[Royal Command Performance]] at [[Windsor Castle]], and in 1979, for the first time, it toured Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
With the approaching end of the D'Oyly Carte monopoly on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] performances, when the copyright on Gilbert's words expired in 1961, Carte set up the charitable D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust to continue to present the operas.  She endowed the trust with the company's scenery, costumes, band parts, recording rights and other assets, together with a cash endowment of £30,000.  She formed Bridget D'Oyly Carte Ltd to manage the opera company, with herself as chairman and managing director.  Finally, mounting losses, and the refusal of the Arts Council to provide a grant, forced the closure of the company in 1982.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Even after it closed, however, the company's productions and style continued to influence the productions of other companies.&lt;ref name=bradley/&gt;

[[File:DOCplanter.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Planter in front of the [[Savoy Hotel]] in honour of Carte and her family]]
In 1972, she founded the D'Oyly Carte Charitable Trust – entirely separate from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company – supporting charitable causes in the fields of the arts, medical welfare and the environment. In 2001, the trust endowed the D'Oyly Carte Chair in Medicine and the Arts at [[King's College London]] with £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=129&amp;year=2001 "First UK Chair in Medicine and the Arts"], King's College, London, 29 March 2001, accessed 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 she was elected an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Society of Musicians]] of Great Britain, and in 1975 was created a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]].  

In the 1970s, Carte became the tenant of the semi-ruined [[Barscobe Castle]], [[Balmaclellan]], a small seventeenth-century fortified house in south-west Scotland, which she restored.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; Always shy, old-fashioned and formal, Carte appreciated simplicity and avoided parties and social events as much as possible.  For her ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' entry she listed her recreations as, "country living and gardening; reading, theatre and music."&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
A heavy smoker, Carte died of lung cancer in her country home in Shrubs Wood, [[Buckinghamshire]] in 1985, aged 77. Her remains were cremated. She left a fortune of £5,479,888.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; With no children of her own or surviving siblings, she was the end of her family line. The Savoy hotel group continued under the control of her trustees until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan. [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+%27up+for+sale%27+as+Saudi+owner%27s+billions+dwindle/article.do "Savoy 'up for sale' as Saudi owner's billions dwindle"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419060158/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+'up+for+sale'+as+Saudi+owner's+billions+dwindle/article.do# |date=19 April 2009 }}, 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's hotels remained among the most prestigious in London, with the ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'' calling the Savoy "London's most famous hotel" in 2009.&lt;ref name=billions/&gt;  

A legacy of £1 million from her private fortune enabled a new opera company, using the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company name, to begin operations in 1988.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; The company secured sponsorship from Sir [[Michael Bishop (businessman)|Michael Bishop]], who eventually became chairman of the Board of Trustees, and [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] British Midland Airways (of which Bishop is chairman).&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 53–69&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988 to 2003 the new company produced short seasons each year, mounting productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on tour and in London, as well as operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Franz Lehár]] and [[Johann Strauss II]]. The new company did not employ many of the members of the original company and did not follow its performing traditions, even staging some "concept" productions of the operas.

'''Brân the Blessed''' ({{lang-cy|'''Bendigeidfran'''}} or '''''Brân Fendigaidd''''', literally "Blessed Crow") is a [[Giants (Welsh folklore)|giant]] and king of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in [[Welsh mythology]]. He appears in several of the [[Welsh Triads]], but his most significant role is in the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|Second Branch]] of the [[Mabinogion|Mabinogi]], ''[[Branwen ferch Llŷr]]''. He is a son of [[Llŷr]]&lt;ref name="EoM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ECMF1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Monaghan |first=Patricia |title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore |year=2004 |publisher=Facts on File, Inc |pages=55 |isbn= 0-8160-4524-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Penarddun]], and the brother of [[Branwen|Brânwen]], [[Manawydan]], [[Nisien]] and [[Efnysien]]. The name "Brân" in Welsh is usually translated as [[crow]] or [[raven]].

==Role in the ''Mabinogion''==
The Irish king [[Matholwch]] sails to [[Harlech]] to speak with Bran the Blessed high king of the [[Prydain|Island of the Mighty]] and to ask for the hand of his sister [[Branwen]] in marriage, thus forging an alliance between the two islands. Bendigeidfran agrees to Matholwch's request, but the celebrations are cut short when [[Efnisien]], a half-brother to the children of [[Llŷr]], brutally mutilates Matholwch's horses, angry that his permission was not sought in regard to the marriage.&lt;ref name="EoM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotterell |first=Arthur |title=The Encyclopedia of Mythology |year=2006 |publisher=Anness Publishing Ltd |pages=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matholwch is deeply offended until Bran offers him compensation in the form of a magic [[Pair Dadeni|cauldron]] that can restore the dead to life. Pleased with the gift, Matholwch and Branwen sail back to Ireland to reign.

Once in Matholwch's kingdom, Branwen gives birth to a son, [[Gwern]], but Efnysien's insult continues to rankle among the Irish and, eventually, Branwen is mistreated, banished to the kitchen&lt;ref name="EoM"/&gt; and beaten every day.  She tames a starling and sends it across the [[Irish Sea]] with a message to her brother Bendigeidfran, who sails from Wales to Ireland to rescue her with his brother, [[Manawydan]] and a huge host of warriors, mustered from the 154 [[cantref]]s of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The Irish offer to make peace and build a house big enough to entertain Bendigeidfrân but hang a hundred bags inside, supposedly containing flour but actually containing armed warriors. Efnysien, suspecting treachery, reconnoiters the hall and kills the warriors by crushing their skulls. Later, at the feast, Efnysien, again feeling insulted, murders Gwern by burning him alive, and, as a result, a vicious battle breaks out. Seeing that the Irish are using the cauldron to revive their dead, he hides among the Irish corpses and is thrown into the cauldron by the unwitting enemy. He destroys the cauldron from within, sacrificing himself in the process.

Only seven men survive the conflict, among them [[Manawydan]], [[Taliesin]] and [[Pryderi|Pryderi fab Pwyll]], prince of [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]], Branwen having herself died of a [[broken heart]].&lt;ref name="ECMF2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Monaghan |first=Patricia |title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore |year=2004 |publisher=Facts on File, Inc |pages=56 |isbn= 0-8160-4524-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors are told by a mortally wounded Bran to cut off his head and to return it to Britain.&lt;ref name="ECMF2"/&gt; For seven years the seven survivors stay in [[Harlech]], where they are entertained by Bran's head, which continues to speak. They later move on to Gwales (often identified with [[Grassholm Island]] off Dyfed) where they live for eighty years without perceiving the passing of time. Eventually, Heilyn fab Gwyn opens the door of the hall facing Cornwall and the sorrow of what had befallen them returns. As instructed they take the now silent head to the Gwynfryn, the "White Hill" (thought to be the location where the [[Tower of London]] now stands), where they bury it facing [[France]] so as to ward off invasion. The imagery of the talking head is widely considered to derive from the ancient Celtic "[[Celts#Warfare and weapons|cult of the head]]"; the head was considered the home of the soul.&lt;ref name="EoM"/&gt;

==Other associations==
According to the [[Welsh Triads]], Brân's head was buried in London where the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] now stands. As long as it remained there, Britain would be safe from invasion. However, [[King Arthur]] dug up the head, declaring the country would be protected only by his great strength.&lt;ref&gt;Triad 37. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', pp. 94–102.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been attempts in modern times to link the still-current practice of keeping ravens at the Tower of London under the care of [[Yeomen Warder]] Ravenmaster with this story of Brân, whose name means crow (cigfran means Raven).

Several scholars have noted similarities between Brân the Blessed and the Arthurian character the [[Fisher King]], the keeper of the [[Holy Grail]]. The Fisher King first appears in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]'s 12th century French romance ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]''; he has been dealt a mortal wound in the leg (Brân's wound was in his foot) but stays alive in his [[Corbenic|mystical castle]] due to the effects of the Grail, waiting to be healed by [[Percival]]. A later author who took up the story, [[Robert de Boron]], describes the history of the Grail in ancient times, and says the first Fisher King was a man called "Bron". Additionally, the Welsh story ''[[Peredur son of Efrawg]]'', a version of the Percival story with several striking deviations, features the hero visiting a mysterious castle, but he does not find the Grail there, but rather a severed human head. Additionally, some works attribute to the Grail the power to restore the fallen, making it somewhat similar to Brân's cauldron. Others have identified Bendigeidfran with the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] hero [[The Voyage of Bran|Bran mac Febal]].&lt;ref name="Bromwich, Rachel p. 290"&gt;Bromwich, Rachel. ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John T. Koch]] proposes a number of parallels between the mythological Bendigeidfran and the historical Celtic chieftain [[Brennus (3rd century BC)|Brennus]], who [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|invaded the Balkans in the 3rd century BC]].&lt;ref&gt;[Bromwich, Rachel. ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to suggest an association between Brân and [[Brancaster]], a fort on the Norfolk coast, while Rachel Bromwich suggests that [[Castell Dinas Brân]] in Denbighshire is similarly related.&lt;ref name="Bromwich, Rachel p. 290"/&gt; [[Nikolai Tolstoy|Count Nikolai Tolstoy]] proposes that Brân's original function was that of a [[psychopomp]], guiding the souls of the dead to the [[Otherworld]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, Nikolai. ''The Oldest British Prose Literature: The Compilation of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi'', p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

Brân is praised in the poetry of 12th century bard [[Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr]], in which he is described as "a good commander of the host; in battle, in hostile territory, in the contest, in stress", while, in his elegy for [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], Prince of Wales, [[Bleddyn Fardd]] compares the overthrow of the prince to the deaths of [[Llywelyn Fawr]], [[King Arthur]] and Brân.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, Rachel. ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; A poem found in the [[Black Book of Carmarthen]] refers to Bendigeidfran's death in Ireland, claiming that [[Gwyn ap Nudd]] was present at the battle, either as a warrior or in his traditional role as a [[psychopomp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/bbc33.html ''The Dialogue of [[Gwyddno Garanhir]] and Gwyn ap Nudd'']
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The Welsh mythological texts of the ''Mabinogion'' were recorded between the 14th and 15th centuries in [[Middle Welsh]]. As a result, there are discrepancies regarding the spelling of names, because English translations maintain [[Middle Welsh]] orthography whereas [[Welsh language|Modern Welsh]] versions use Modern Welsh orthography. In Middle Welsh, there was some variation on the name Brân; other grammatical forms (following the rules of Welsh mutations) include ''Vran'' and ''Uran'' (''Fran'' in Modern Welsh orthography).

In the ''Mabinogion'', the character is referred to virtually exclusively as "Bendigeituran"; that is, with the epithet "Bendigeit" (blessed or praiseworthy) attached. The only exceptions are in the [[patronymic]] of his son [[Caradog ap Bran|Caradog ap Brân]] and a single reference to his gathering in Ireland as ''Gwledd Brân'', "The feast of Brân (or 'Crow')". This usage is followed in the Welsh Triads. Bendigeituran becomes "Bendigeidfrân" or "Brân Fendigeid" in Modern Welsh; Bendigeidfran is the form used in many Modern Welsh adaptations of the ''Mabinogion''.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Dafydd &amp; Rhiannon Ifans' ''Y Mabinogi''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, earlier references generally do not include the epithet, instead calling the character ''Brân fab Llŷr'' or simply ''Brân''.&lt;ref name="Bromwich"&gt;Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', pp. 290–292.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ifor Williams]] thought ''Bendigeit'' was a late addition, perhaps a replacement for a word that had become obsolete by the time the ''Mabinogi'' was recorded.&lt;ref name="Bromwich"/&gt; "Vran" appears in an old poem in the [[Book of Taliesin]],&lt;ref&gt;''Book of Taliesin'' XIV, [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/t14w.html "Kerd Veib am Llyr"]. From [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/llyfrtaliesin.html Llyfr Taliesin] at maryjones.us. Retrieved February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr]] and [[Llywarch ap Llywelyn|Prydydd y Moch]] mention ''Brân fab Llŷr'' several times in their poetry, under different spellings. However, [[Bleddyn Fardd]] refers to "Benigeitran" in his elegy for [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], demonstrating that the epithet "Bendigeit" had been attached to Brân since the late 13th century.&lt;ref name="Bromwich"/&gt;

In [[West Penwith]] the name Bran is associated with [[Caer Bran]] a [[ringfort|Cornish Round]] and the [[Men Scryfa]] which records a Brittonic RIALOBRANI CUNOVALI FILI ('royal raven' son of 'Famous Leader')  suggesting a local leader carried the name of the famous hero,  the son of a [[Cynfawl]].

The '''Buryats'''  ({{lang-bua|Буряад|Buryaad}}; {{lang-mn|Буриад, {{MongolUnicode|1=ᠪᠣᠷᠢᠶᠠᠳ}}, Buriad}}), numbering approximately 500,000, are the largest indigenous group in [[Siberia]], mainly concentrated in their homeland, the [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryat Republic]], a [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]]. They are the major northern subgroup of the [[Mongols]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th Edition. (1977). Vol. II, p. 396. {{ISBN|0-85229-315-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buryats share many customs with other Mongols, including [[nomad]]ic herding, and erecting [[Yurt|ger]]s for shelter. Today, the majority of Buryats live in and around [[Ulan-Ude]], the capital of the republic, although many live more traditionally in the countryside. They speak a central [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] called [[Buryat language|Buryat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90485 |title=Invalid id |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UNESCO]]'s 2010 edition of the [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]], the Buryat language is classified as [[List of endangered languages in Russia|severely endangered]].

It is most likely that the ancestors of modern Buryats are Bayyrku and [[Kurykans]] who were part of the tribal union of the [[Tiele people|Tiele]].The Tiele, in turn, came from the '''[[Dingling]]'''. The first information about '''Dingling''' appeared in the sources of IV-III centuries. BC. e.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Древняя и средневековая история Южной Сибири (в кратком изложении).

Meanwhile, their component, [[Barga Mongol|Barga]], appeared both west of Baikal and in northern [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]'s Barguzin valley. Linked also to the Bargas were the [[Tümed|Khori-Tumed]] along the Arig River in eastern [[Khövsgöl Province]] and the [[Angara River|Angara]].&lt;ref&gt;C.P.Atwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; A Tumad rebellion broke out in 1217, when Genghis Khan allowed his viceroy to seize 30 Tumad maidens. Genghis Khan's commander Dorbei the Fierce of the [[Dörbeds]] smashed them in response. The Buryats joined the Oirats challenging the imperial rule of the [[Khalkhas|Eastern Mongols]] during the [[Northern Yuan Dynasty|Northern Yuan]] period in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;D.

Historically, the territories around [[Lake Baikal]] belonged to [[Mongolia]], Buryats were subject to Tusheet Khan and Setsen Khan of [[Khalkha|Khalkha Mongolia]]. When the Russians expanded into [[Transbaikalia]] (eastern Siberia) in 1609, the [[Cossacks]] found only a small core of tribal groups speaking a Mongol dialect called Buryat and paying tribute to the [[Khalkha]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Pittsburgh. University Center for International Studies, Temple University-Russian history: Histoire russe, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were powerful enough to compel the [[Ket people|Ket]] and Samoyed peoples on the Kan and the [[Evenks]] on the lower Angara to pay tribute.

Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London. {{ISBN|0-297-77360-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to genuine Buryat-Mongol tribes (Bulagad, Khori, Ekhired, Khongoodor) that merged with the Buryats, the Buryats also assimilated other groups, including some [[Oirats]], the [[Khalkha]], Tungus ([[Evenks]]) and others. The Khori-Barga had migrated out of the Barguzin eastward to the lands between the Greater Khingan and the Argun. Around 1594 most of them fled back to the Aga and Nerchinsk in order to escape subjection by the [[Daurs]]. The territory and people were formally annexed to the Russian state by treaties in 1689 and 1727, when the territories on both the sides of [[Lake Baikal]] were separated from [[Mongolia]]. Consolidation of modern Buryat tribes and groups took place under the conditions of the [[Russia]]n state. From the middle of the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th century, the Buryat population increased from  77,000&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bur-culture.ru/index.php?id=news-detail&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=42&amp;cHash=effe903f9ae6737362277ed761d6c2ca Традиционная материальная культура бурятского этноса Предбайкалья.

Another estimate of the rapid growth in people referring to themselves as Buryat is based on the clan list names paying tribute in the form of a [[sable]]-skin tax. This indicates a population of about 77,000 in 1640 rising to 157,000 in 1823 and more than a million by 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Bowles, Gordon T. (1977). ''The People of Asia'', p. 279. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London. {{ISBN|0-297-77360-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical roots of the Buryat [[culture]] are related to the Mongolic peoples. After Buryatia was incorporated into Russia, it was exposed to two traditions&amp;nbsp;– [[Tibetan Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian]]. Buryats west of [[Lake Baikal]] and [[Olkhon]] (Irkut Buryats), are more "[[Russification|russified]]", and they soon abandoned nomadism for agriculture, whereas the eastern (Transbaikal) Buryats are closer to the Khalkha, may live in [[yurt]]s and are mostly Buddhists. In 1741, the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] branch of Buddhism was recognized as one of the official [[religion]]s in Russia, and the first Buryat [[datsan]] (Buddhist [[monastery]]) was built.

The second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century was a time of growth for the Buryat Buddhist church (48 datsans in Buryatia in 1914). Buddhism became an important factor in the cultural development of Buryatia. Because of their skills in horsemanship and mounted combat, many were enlisted into the [[Amur Cossacks]] host. During the [[Russian Civil War]] most of the Buryats sided with the [[White movement|White]] forces of [[Baron Ungern-Sternberg]] and [[Ataman Semenov]]. They formed a sizable portion of Ungern's forces and often received favorable treatment when compared with other ethnic groups in the Baron's army. After the Revolution, most of the [[lama]]s were loyal to Soviet power. In 1925, a battle against religion and clergy in Buryatia began. Datsans were gradually closed down and the activity of the clergy was curtailed. Consequently, in the late 1930s the Buddhist clergy ceased to exist and thousands of cultural treasures were destroyed. Attempts to revive the Buddhist cult started during [[World War II]], and it was officially re-established in 1946. A revival of Buddhism has taken place since the late 1980s as an important factor in the national consolidation.

In the 1930s, Buryat-Mongolia was one of the sites of Soviet studies aimed to disprove [[Nazism and race|Nazi race theories]]. Among other things, Soviet physicians studied the "endurance and fatigue levels" of Russian, Buryat-Mongol, and Russian-Buryat-Mongol workers to prove that all three groups were equally able.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{first=Francine|last=Hirsch|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2696979 |title=Race without the Practice of Racial Politics||date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the [[Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was formed and included Baikal province (Pribaykalskaya guberniya) with Russian population. The Buryats rebelled against the communist rule and [[collectivization]] of their herds in 1929. The rebellion was quickly crushed by the [[Red Army]] with loss of 35,000 Buryats.&lt;ref&gt;James Minahan-Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: S-Z, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; The Buryat refugees fled to [[Mongolia]] and resettled, however, only a few of them joined the Shambala rebellion there. In 1937, in an effort to disperse Buryats, Stalin's government separated a number of counties (''[[raion]]s'') from the [[Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] and formed [[Ust-Orda Buryat Autonomous Okrug]] and [[Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug]]; at the same time, some raions with Buryat populations were left out. Fearing Buryat nationalism, [[Joseph Stalin]] had more than 10,000 Buryats killed.&lt;ref&gt;James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas-An Ethnohistorical dictionary of the Russian and Soviet empires, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Stalinist repressions in Mongolia|Stalinist purge]] of Buryats spread into Mongolia, known as the incident of L'humbee. In 1958, the name "Mongol" was removed from the name of the republic (Buryat ASSR). BASSR declared its sovereignty in 1990 and adopted the name [[Republic of Buryatia]] in 1992. The constitution of the Republic was adopted by the People's Khural in 1994, and a bilateral treaty with the [[Russia]]n Federation was signed in 1995.

The Buryat national tradition is ecological by origin in that the religious and mythological ideas of the Buryat people have been based on a theology of nature. The environment has traditionally been deeply respected by Buryats due to the nomadic way of life and religious culture. The harsh climatic conditions of the region have in turn created a fragile balance between humans, society and the environment itself. This has led to a delicate approach to nature, oriented not towards its conquest but rather towards a harmonious interaction and equal partnership with it. A synthesis of [[Buddhism]] and traditional beliefs that formed a system of ecological traditions has thus constituted a major attribute of Buryat eco-culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unspecial.org/2013/01/buryatia-a-symbol-of-eurasia-in-the-heartland-of-baikal Esuna Dugarova.

[[File:Mongolia XVI.png|thumb|[[List of Mongol states|Mongol states]] in the 14th to 17th centuries.]]According to the Buryat creation myth, there were 11 Buryat tribes or clans. And according to the myth all 11 tribes are descendants of a man and a mysterious but beautiful creature that turns to swan during day and a woman during the night. After the two married, the man asked her to give him her wings so that she would not turn into swan anymore. However, it is said that after some time the woman asked for her wings back and flew away never to return. Today there are a number of different Buryat tribes, or clans.

'''Cliff Twemlow''' (14 October 1937 – 5 May 1993) was an English actor, [[nightclub]] [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], [[Horror fiction|horror]] paperback author and [[Production music|library music]] composer.

== Career ==
Twemlow was born in [[Hulme]], Manchester, the son of a [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]]. He became a nightclub bouncer, or "Tuxedo Warrior", in 1950s [[Morecambe]] before this occupation would take him to [[Scotland]] and back to Manchester. Hoping to diversify Twemlow worked as an extra on the television series [[Coronation Street]] and attempted to break into the music industry by composing library music under the pen name '''Peter Reno'''. The latter was a hugely successful venture, with Twemlow penning more than two thousand compositions within the space of a few years. Musically self-taught, Cliff composed music using what he referred to as the 'De Dum Da' Principle. "I had discovered that with the aid of a tape recorder, I could assemble or compose lyric and tune. My voice would simulate orchestral sounds, giving me an insight as to how it could be arranged. God, the noises were appalling. Um Te Ta, Deeple, Dum Rump Pa Pa! I was in hysterics listening to the playback." he later claimed in his autobiography. Most of his Peter Reno material was written for the company [[De Wolfe Music]] and used in television (''[[Public Eye (TV series)|Public Eye]]'', [[Rutland Weekend Television]], ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'',''Queenie's Castle'', ''[[The Sweeney]]''), films (''[[Zeta One]]'', ''[[Secrets of Sex]]'', ''[[A Touch of the Sun (1979 film)|A Touch of the Sun]]'', ''Deathdream'') and advertisements. One of his songs "Cause I'm a Man", written in 1967, later became famous when it was used in the film [[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]. A particularly lucrative composition was "Distant Hills", which was used as the end credit theme of the programme ''[[Crown Court (TV series)|Crown Court]]'' from 1972 to the shows end in 1984. "Distant Hills" would also prove to be Cliff's only brush with the charts when it was used as the B side to [[Eye Level]]- the theme from [[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]- a single that enjoyed four weeks at number one in 1973. The same year however Cliff would encounter legal problems due to a song of his – recorded by [[Salena Jones]] – bearing the name 'Live and Let Die'. Though released shortly before [[Paul McCartney]] recorded a song by the same name for the eponymous [[James Bond]] film, a court case was instigated by the publishers of the McCartney song and an injunction slammed on the Twemlow record. Twemlow's defence was that it was simply an innocent example of two songs bearing the same title, unfortunately a "James Bond" style pose on the picture sleeve threw doubt on this, and the court found in favour of McCartney's people. The Twemlow/Salena Jones record was subsequently withdrawn. Unfortunately such problems within the music industry, combined with bad business deals, legal hassles and a divorce from childhood sweetheart Georgina Curly meant Twemlow's music success was short lived and he was eventually declared bankrupt.
One of Twemlow's songs from this period "Once" from the album Restless Woman (1971), claims 
“Once I owned a mansion/ Money couldn't buy / People used to stop and say / There goes quite a guy/ Now I'm left with nothing/ And I have no place to go/ For when you're down/ Nobody wants to know".

In the mid-1970s Twemlow took a variety of odd jobs, including a delivery driver for Lomas and Baynes, a company that specialised in supplying equipment for offices, he also worked for a time as a ferryman on the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in [[Irlam]]. After undergoing an extreme fitness régime to get back into shape (Twemlow's exercise sessions – which included jogging with lead weights tied to his legs – were the stuff of local legend) Twemlow eventually returned to work as a nightclub bouncer, taking a £70 a week job, at [[Peter Stringfellow]]'s 'Millionaire' nightclub in Manchester's West Mosley Street – this was the real name of 'The Omega' club referred to in the book, 'The Tuxedo Warrior'. He was married to Judith, who worked as a secretary for a Manchester firm of solicitors and they lived in [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]] on the north side of the Manchester area.

In the early 1980s he wrote his autobiography ''The Tuxedo Warrior'', which documented his career in the music industry and as a bouncer. In the book's final chapter Twemlow is hospitalised after a fight in a nightclub leaves him with a fractured skull and his family ask him to retire or seek an alternative lifestyle. He refuses and returns to being a Tuxedo Warrior, the book closes with the statement "it is far better to be a resident on the brink of hell, than spend a lifetime in a relentless pursuit of a mythical heaven".

'''''Tuxedo Warrior''''' was turned into a film in 1982, however the film chooses to ignore all aspects of Cliff's life and instead merely uses him as a character in a fictional narrative. In the film Cliff ([[John Wyman]]) is an ex-bouncer from Manchester who has opened a bar in South Africa and becomes involved in diamond smuggling, as well as being torn between two women, an American free spirit ([[Holly Palance]]) and a British compulsive gambler ([[Carol Royle]]). Confusingly the real Twemlow appears in the film as supporting character 'Chaser'. The only other character in the film taken from the book, in real life Chaser, r.n. Barney Brogan, was an American bouncer who had a violent confrontation with Cliff in 1950s Morecambe. In the book he is described as "a big burly American, around 5' 11". Whose face had taken more second prizes than a blind tomcat in a bowling alley….. Chaser was big and evil.”

Encouraged by the success of the Tuxedo Warrior book Twemlow would go on to write two fiction books for the pulp horror market the Beast of Kane (1983) and The Pike (1982). The Beast of Kane, concerns the Gordon family, who adopt a stray elk-hound that turns out to be "Satan himself, fulfilling an ancient prophecy". Written in the late 1970s under the title The Dogs of Kane, the book was submitted as a possible film project for [[Hammer Film Productions]] but was rejected. Twemlow then tried to make a film of The Pike, starring [[Joan Collins]], but the budget could not be raised despite Collins' star power and Twemlow and Collins promoting the film on the BBC's Look North programme. During the promotion Joan appeared on a BBC TV Tomorrow's World special featuring the innovative and technically advanced mechanical Pike, made especially for the film. The Mechanical Pike apparently now resides as an exhibit of robotics in Japan.

In 1982–83 Twemlow acted in, wrote and composed the music score for the film "GBH", one of the earliest British films to be shot on videotape. Considered to be far more accurate in depicting Twemlow's life than the Tuxedo Warrior film, GBH features him as Steve Donovan aka "The Mancunian", a world weary nightclub bouncer hired to protect a club from a London gang. The film's well remembered video cover features a blood splattered Twemlow holding an axe with the tag line "more brutal than ''The Long Good Friday''".

The theme song of the film, written by Cliff was actually a ballad depiction of how Cliff was in real life, the lyrics "he walks tall with his head held high, before he backs down he would rather die, he's a mean machine, none tougher than, the man, man, man, man-cunian man!" were EXACTLY how Cliff lived his life. To those who REALLY knew him, rather than those who knew him vaguely or claimed to know him; his true friends who lived day by day, shoulder to shoulder with him through the 1980s and into the 1990s saw him live by his words and actually led by example, often daring to venture where others genuinely feared to tread. GBH led to Cliff Twemlow appearing in 12 more films shot as video features plus a plethora of film-shorts and [http://majorvision.com MajorVision] special interest films.

These included Target Eve Island (1983), which became known as Operation Urgent Fury, named after the American military operation to Grenada, co-produced with director David Kent-Watson in [[Grenada]] and [[Barbados]], The Ibiza Connection in 1994 with his close friends Steve Powell and [[Brian Sterling-Vete]], in 1985 Cliff worked closely with Brian in an attempt to produce the film called 'The Blind Side of God' with former Coronation Street star [[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]], the film was later produced in conjunction with David Kent-Watson but Peter Adamson did not appear in the finished DKW version.

Late in 1986 Cliff produced and starred in Moonstalker – AKA 'Predator' alongside Cordelia Roche and his old friend [[Brian Sterling-Vete|Brian]] in the role as 'Bager', the Psycho killer of the film. This film was shot by [[David Tattersall]] (Director of Photography – DOP) – David then went on to eventually become the DOP on The Green Mile, Con Air, Star Wars 1 and 2, The Young Indiana Jones and most recently The Day The Earth Stood Still.

Cliff took a short break in December 1985 and January 1986 when he was invited to join his friend [[Brian Sterling-Vete|Brian]] in Iceland, this is where Brian was co-producing a play, Trafford Tanzi with Jon Paul Baldwinsson of the Icelandic National Theatre. It was there that Cliff met Brian's old friend and 4 time World's Strongest Man, [Jon Pall Sigmarsson]. More information is on the web site www.bs-v.tv which is the official website of one Cliff's closest friends through the 1980s and into the 1990s, [[Brian Sterling-Vete]]; Cliff's other great friend Stuart Hurst should also be consulted as he also worked super-closely with Cliff right through to the very end.

When Cliff and Brian returned to the UK, Cliff set to producing The Eye of Satan (1987) with director David Kent-Watson, in which Cliff plays a mercenary with satanic powers alongside glamorous co-star Ginette Gray.

Cliff followed this with Tokyo Sunrise with Director Robert Foster in 1988.

In 1991 Cliff and David Kent-Watson produced GBH2 for television; filming took place in Manchester and on the island of Malta.

In the same year, Cliff and David produced a pilot for a hard-hitting television series 'Bad Weekend'.  The revolutionary concept was that each episode should be filmed in the space of one weekend, as was the pilot.

The following year Cliff and David took on their most ambitious film project, Firestar: First Contact, in which Cliff and the crew of the spaceship, Firestar, battle alien monsters.  The action was superbly staged by Cliff and Stuart Hurst.  The film starred Bond-film actors Charles Gray and
John Wyman.  Star of 'The Stud'films, Oliver Tobias, co-starred as the captain of the spaceship.

After working on Tokyo Sunrise with Robert Foster and [[Brian Sterling-Vete]], Cliff appeared in several special interest films produced by his friend [[Brian Sterling-Vete|Brian]] on the MajorVision label (now on DVD) these included 'The Power to Win, 'The Ultimate Self Defence' and 'Fitness Over Forty'

The pioneering feature films, some shot on super-low-budgets and mostly filmed in and around Manchester, continued until his premature death from a heart attack in 1993.  Cliff had shot scenes for a comedy-action boxing film with David Kent-Watson on the Greek island of Rhodes with actor Terrence Hardiman.  Sadly it was to be their last collaboration.

'''Sir Cyril Lodowic Burt''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (3 March 1883 – 10 October 1971) was an English [[educational psychology|educational psychologist]] and geneticist who made contributions also to statistics. He is known for his studies on the [[heritability of IQ]]. Shortly after he died, his studies of inheritance and intelligence were discredited after evidence emerged indicating he had [[scientific misconduct|falsified]] research data, inventing correlations in separated twins which did not exist.
==Childhood and education==
Burt was born on 3 March 1883, the first child of Cyril Cecil Barrow Burt (b. 1857), a medical practitioner, and his wife Martha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-8014-1244-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[London]] (some sources give his place of birth as [[Stratford on Avon]], probably because his entry in ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' gave his father's address as [[Snitterfield]], Stratford; in fact the Burt family moved to Snitterfield when he was ten).&lt;ref&gt;Hearnshaw, (1979), p2. {{ODNBweb|id=30880|title=Burt, Sir Cyril Lodowic|last=Mazumdar|first=Pauline H.}}.

| publisher = Routledge
| year=  1989
| location = London
| isbn =  978-0-415-01039-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The birth of Cyril Lodowic Burt was recorded in the General Register Office (now part of the Office for National Statistics) index of births in England and Wales for the June quarter of 1883:-''BURT, Cyril Lodowic St. Geo. H. Sq. 1a 486'' (The Registration district was St. Georges, Hanover Square, which included parts of Westminster)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burt's father initially kept a chemist shop to support his family while he studied medicine. On qualifying, he became the assistant house surgeon and obstetrical assistant at [[Westminster Hospital]], London.&lt;ref name="Hearnshaw, 1979, p2"&gt;Hearnshaw, (1979), p2&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Cyril Burt's education began in London at a [[Board school]] near [[St. James's Park]].&lt;ref name="Hearnshaw, 1979, p2"/&gt;

In 1890, the family briefly moved to Jersey then to [[Snitterfield]], [[Warwickshire]] in 1893, where Burt's father opened a rural practice.&lt;ref name="Hearnshaw, 1979, p2"/&gt; Early in Burt's life he showed a precocious nature, so much so that his father often took the young Burt with him on his medical rounds.&lt;ref&gt;Hearnshaw, (1979), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the elder Burt's more famous patients was [[Darwin Galton]], brother of [[Francis Galton]]. The visits the Burts made to the Galton estate not only allowed the young Burt to learn about the work of Francis Galton, but also allowed Burt to meet him on multiple occasions and to be strongly drawn to his ideas; especially his studies in statistics and individual differences, two defining characters of the [[London School of Psychology]] whose membership includes both Galton and Burt.

He attended King's (now known as [[Warwick School|Warwick]]) School, in the [[County town]], from 1892 to 1895, and later won a scholarship to [[Christ's Hospital]], then located in London, where he developed his interest in psychology.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
  | title = Burt, Sir Cyril Lodowic (1883–1971)
  | encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography
  | publisher = Oxford University Press
  | year=  2006
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1902, he studied at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], where he specialized in philosophy and psychology, the latter under [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]. McDougall, knowing Burt's interest in Galton's work, suggested that he focus his senior project on psychometrics, thus giving Burt his initial inquiry into the development and structure of mental tests, an interest that would last the rest of his life. Burt was one of a group of students who worked with McDougall, which included [[William Brown (psychologist)|William Brown]], [[John Flügel]], and [[May Smith (psychologist)| May Smith]], who all went on to have distinguished careers in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hearnshaw, (1979), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Burt graduated with second-class honours in 1906 which he supplemented by a teaching diploma.

In 1907, McDougall invited Burt to help with a nationwide survey of physical and mental characteristics of the British people, proposed by Francis Galton, in which he was to work on the standardization of psychological tests. This work brought Burt into contact with [[eugenics]], [[Charles Spearman]], and [[Karl Pearson]].

In the summer of 1908, Burt visited the [[University of Würzburg]], Germany, where he first met the psychologist [[Oswald Külpe]].&lt;ref&gt;Hearnshaw, (1979), p13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in educational psychology==
[[File:Picture of Dr. Cyril Burt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|"Mr. Cyril Burt, psychologist to the London County Council, measuring the speed of the thought of a child with a chronoscope to two-hundredths of a second."]]

In 1908, Burt took up the post of Lecturer in Psychology and Assistant Lecturer in Physiology at Liverpool University, where he was to work under the famed physiologist [[Sir Charles Sherrington]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; In 1909 Burt made use of [[Charles Spearman]]'s model of general intelligence to analyse his data on the performance of schoolchildren in a battery of tests. This first research project was to define Burt's life's work in quantitative [[intelligence testing]], [[eugenics]], and the [[inheritance of intelligence]]. One of the conclusions in his 1909 paper was that upper-class children in private preparatory schools did better in the tests than those in the ordinary elementary schools, and that the difference was innate.

In 1913, Burt took the part-time position of a [[school psychology|school psychologist]] for the [[London County Council]] (LCC), with the responsibility of picking out the "feeble-minded" children, in accordance with the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; He notably established that girls were equal to boys in general intelligence. The post also allowed him to work in Spearman's laboratory, and receive research assistants from the National Institute of Industrial Psychology, including [[Winifred Raphael]].

Burt was much involved in the initiation of child guidance in Great Britain and his 1925 publication ''The Young Delinquent'' led to opening of the London Child Guidance Clinic in [[Islington]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Hearnshaw (1979) p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 Burt was also appointed part-time professor of [[educational psychology]] at the [[London Day Training College]] (LDTC), and carried out much of his child guidance work on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Later career==
In 1931, Burt resigned his position at the LCC and the LDTC after he was appointed Professor and Chair of Psychology at [[University College, London]], taking over the position from Charles Spearman, thus ending his almost 20-year career as a school psychological practitioner. One of his students, Reuben Conrad, recalled that he once arrived at the university with a chimpanzee that he had borrowed from London Zoo, though Conrad could not recall what point Burt was trying to make.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bishop, July 2016 The Psychologist Vol.29 (pp.578-579) https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-29/july/quality-and-longevity&lt;/ref&gt; While at London, Burt influenced many students, including [[Raymond Cattell]] and [[Hans Eysenck]], and toward the end of his life, [[Arthur Jensen]] and [[Chris Brand]]. Burt was a consultant with the committees that developed the [[Eleven-plus exam|11-plus]] examinations. This issue, and the allegations of fraudulent scholarship against him, are discussed in various books and articles listed [[#Readings on the Burt Affair|below]], including ''Cyril Burt: Fraud or Framed'' and ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''.

Despite his lasting reputation as a statistical psychologist Cyril Burt was also involved in psychoanalysis. He was a member of the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust|Tavistock Clinic]] Council in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Dicks, ''50 years of the Tavistock Clinic''. Routledge 1970, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Pines, "The Development of the Psychodynamic Movement", in: ''150 Years of British Psychiatry, 1841–1991''.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Young Delinquent'',&lt;ref&gt;C. Burt, ''The Young Delinquent'', London: University of London Press, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; he expressed the view that "nearly every tragedy of crime is in its origin a drama of domestic life."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Adrian Wooldridge, ''Measuring the Mind: Education and Psychology in England, c. 1860 – c. 1990''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Burt was elected President of the [[British Psychological Society]]. In 1946, he became the first British psychologist to be [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his contributions to psychological testing and for making educational opportunities more widely available, according to an account by [[J. Philippe Rushton]].&lt;ref name="Rushton 1994"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/rushton-burt?embedded=yes&amp;cumulative_category_title=J.+Phillipe+Rushton&amp;cumulative_category_id=Rushton |title=Victim of Scientific Hoax – Cyril Burt and the Genetic IQ Controversy |accessdate=2005-10-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013222543/http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/rushton-burt?embedded=yes&amp;cumulative_category_title=J.+Phillipe+Rushton&amp;cumulative_category_id=Rushton |archivedate=13 October 2004 |df=dmy-all }} J. Philippe Rushton, ''Society'', March–April 1994, Vol. 31(3), p. 40(5).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2018}} Burt was a member of the [[Individual differences psychology|London School of Differential Psychology]], and of the [[British Eugenics Society]]. Because he had suggested on radio in 1946 the formation of an organization for people with high [[IQ]] scores, he was made honorary president of [[Mensa International|Mensa]] in 1960. He officially joined Mensa soon thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mensa – The Society for the Highly Intelligent |page=65 |author=Victor Serebriakoff |publisher=Stein and Day |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-8128-3091-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 68, Burt retired but continued writing articles and books. He died of cancer at age 88 in London on 10 October 1971.

=="The Burt Affair"==
Over the course of his career, Burt published numerous articles and books on a host of topics ranging from [[psychometrics]] through [[philosophy of science]] to [[parapsychology]]. It is his research in [[quantitative genetics|behaviour genetics]], most notably in studying the heritability of intelligence (as measured in IQ tests) using [[twin study|twin studies]] that have created the most controversy, frequently referred to as "the Burt Affair."&lt;ref&gt;

From the late 1970s, it was generally accepted that "he had fabricated some of the data, though some of his earlier work remained unaffected by this revelation."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedias" /&gt; This was due in large part to research by Oliver Gillie (1976) and [[Leon Kamin]] (1974).&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Kamin|Kamin, L.J.]] (1974).

The possibility of fabrication was first brought to the attention of the scientific community when Kamin noticed that Burt's correlation coefficients of [[Twin#Monozygotic twins|monozygotic]] and [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|dizygotic]] twins' IQ scores were the same to three decimal places, across articles – even when new data were twice added to the sample of twins. Leslie Hearnshaw, a close friend of Burt and his official biographer, concluded after examining the criticisms that most of Burt's data from after World War II were unreliable or fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Hearnshaw, L.S. (1979). ''Cyril Burt: Psychologist''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William H. Tucker]] argued in a 1997 article that: "A comparison of his twin sample with that from other well documented studies, however, leaves little doubt that he committed fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tucker | first1 = William H | year = 1997 | title = Re-reconsidering Burt: Beyond a Reasonable Doubt | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 145–162 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6696(199721)33:2&lt;145::aid-jhbs6&gt;3.3.co;2-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists [[Arthur Jensen]] and [[J.

Oxford: Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-4274-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rushton (1997) wrote that five different studies on twins reared apart by independent researchers corroborated Cyril Burt's findings and had given almost the same heritability estimate (average estimate 0.75 vs. 0.77 by Burt).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rushton | first1 = J.

Hunt]], it may never be found out whether Burt was intentionally fraudulent or merely careless. Noting that other studies on the heritability of IQ have produced results very similar to those of Burt's, Hunt argues that Burt did not harm science in the narrow sense of misleading scientists with false results, but that in the broader sense science in general and behaviour genetics in particular were profoundly harmed by the Burt Affair, leading to an unjustified general rejection of genetic studies of intelligence and a drying up of funding for such studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Earl (2011). ''Human Intelligence''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the London ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' claimed that two of Burt's supposed collaborators, Margaret Howard and J. Conway, were invented by Burt himself. They based this on the lack of independent articles published by them in scientific journals, and the fact that they allegedly only appeared in the historical record as reviewers of Burt's books in the ''Journal of Statistical Psychology'' when the journal was redacted by Burt. However, Miss Howard was also mentioned in the membership list of the British Psychological Society, Prof. John Cohen remembered her well during the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Ronald (1991). ''Science, Ideology &amp; the Media: The Cyril Burt Scandal''. New Brunswick, N J: Transaction Publishers, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; and Prof. Donald MacRae had personally received an article from her in 1949 and 1950. According to Ronald Fletcher there is also full documentary evidence of the existence of Miss Conway {{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Composer_Cyril_Scott.jpg|thumb|right|Cyril Scott]]
'''Cyril Meir Scott''' (27 September 1879 &amp;ndash; 31 December 1970) was an [[English people|English]] [[composer]], writer, and poet.
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: | image = CyrilScott.jpg --&gt;

==Biography==
Scott was born in [[Oxton, Merseyside|Oxton]], [[Cheshire]] to a shipper and [[scholar]] of Greek and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and Mary Scott (née Griffiths), an amateur pianist. He showed a talent for music from an early age and was sent to the [[Hoch Conservatory]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] to study piano in 1892 at age 12.  He studied with [[Iwan Knorr]] and belonged to the [[Frankfurt Group]], a circle of composers who studied at the Hoch Conservatory in the late 1890s. His first symphony was performed (through the good offices of his friend [[Stefan George]], the great German poet) when he was only twenty years old. He played his Piano Quartet with [[Fritz Kreisler]], Emil Kreuz, and Ludwig Lebell in St. James' Hall in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyrilscott.net/chamber-piano-strings/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 he met the pianist [[Evelyn Suart]], with whom he had a long artistic association. She championed his music, premiering many of his works, and introducing him to his publisher, Elkin, with whom he remained for the rest of his life. Evelyn Suart was also a Christian Scientist, and it was through her that Scott became interested in [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref name=poet&gt;[[Arthur Eaglefield Hull]]. [https://archive.org/stream/cyrilscottcompos00hulluoft/cyrilscottcompos00hulluoft_djvu.txt Cyril Scott, Composer, Poet and Philosopher] ("Library of Music and Musicians", London: K. Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1919).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=death&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2005/mar05/Cyril_Scott_composer_pianist.rtf Leslie De’Ath, Cyril Scott as Composer, Pianist and Author]&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott dedicated his Scherzo, Op. 25 to Evelyn Suart. (Her daughter [[Diana Gould (dancer)|Diana Gould]] was a noted ballerina and the second wife of [[Yehudi Menuhin]].)&lt;ref name=death/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyrilscott.net/Music/Pno_S.html Music: Cyril Scott] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222111722/http://www.cyrilscott.net/Music/Pno_S.html |date=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who heard Scott play the piano commented on the extraordinary vitality of his playing, above all his always well judged rubato, and subtleties of tone and pedalling. These can be appreciated from the reissue on a Dutton CD (Collected Piano Music, vol. 1) of his performance (in the 1930s) of eight of his own pieces on piano rolls.

Scott married [[Rose Laure Allatini]] in May 1921. They had two children: Vivien Mary Scott (born 1923) and Desmond Cyril Scott (born 1926). He separated from Rose following [[World War II]]. In 1943, he met Marjorie Hartston, a clairvoyante, who remained his companion until his death, and persuaded him to go on composing, despite the indifference of the musical world to his work. Undeterred, he continued to compose up until the last three weeks of his life, dying at the age of 91. By the time of his death he was remembered for only a few popular pieces (such as ''[[Lotus Land (Song)|Lotus Land]]'') that he had composed over sixty years before. His many books and pamphlets on occultism and alternative medicine always, however, found readers.

The first decade of the new millennium saw a revival of interest in his music, stimulated by a flood of recordings, discussed below.

==Music==
{{peacock|section|date=August 2015}}Scott was essentially a late romantic composer,{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} whose style was at the same time strongly influenced by impressionism. His harmony was notably exotic. If in his early works it was perhaps over-sweet ([[Alban Berg]] dismissed his music as 'mushy'), it became steadily more varied and more refined in his later years. Indeed, it is his late works (written between 1950 and his death) that are the most individual, with their ever-shifting harmonic colours and wayward inflections of phrase and mood, capturing perfectly the way the mind shifts, backwards and forwards, between reminiscence, regrets, and self-assertion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Scott wrote around four hundred works (though the number is deceptive, since more than half of these were short songs or piano pieces). These include two mature [[symphony|symphonies]], three [[opera]]s, three [[piano concerto]]s, concertos for [[violin]], [[cello]], [[oboe]] and [[harpsichord]], and three double concertos (of which the scores are now lost), several [[overture]]s, four oratorios (''Nativity Hymn'' (1913), ''Mystic Ode'' (1932), ''Ode to Great Men'' (1936), and ''Hymn of Unity'' (1947)), as well as a mass of chamber music (four mature quartets, five violin sonatas, three piano trios, and many others). Between 1903 and 1920 Scott wrote copiously for the piano. Most of these pieces were harmonically adventurous for their time and easy to play; they circulated widely in many countries of the world, in contrast to his more ambitious works, none of which received more than a handful of performances.

Scott was called the "Father of modern British music" by [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]], and was also appreciated by [[Claude Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel]], his close friend [[Percy Grainger]], [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. His experiments in free rhythm, generated by expanding musical motifs, above all in his First Piano Sonata of 1909, appear to have exerted an influence on Stravinsky's [[The Rite of Spring]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} . He used to be known as 'the English Debussy', though this reflected little knowledge of Scott and little understanding of Debussy.

Among the orchestral music, the First Piano Concerto (1913-4), ''Disaster at Sea'' (a tone poem on the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]'', composed in 1918-26, and published in a revised version with the title ''Neptune'' in 1935), the Violin Concerto (1928), and ''Neapolitan Rhapsody'' (published 1959). The shorter piano works suffer in the main from unimaginative form and texture{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}, though the five 'Poems' (1912) are an important exception;{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} more worthy of revival are the piano sonatas, especially the innovatory first (1909) and the intricate, wayward third (1956){{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The largest body of successful work is to be found in his chamber music, the Clarinet Quintet and Trio and the five violin sonatas being especially notable.

The years 2004-10 saw an extraordinary flood of recordings, including 4 CDs of his orchestral music (with the BBC Philharmonic under Martyn Brabbins), his complete piano music played by Leslie De'Ath on Dutton, and recordings of four of his violin sonatas by Clare Howick and Sophia Rahman. His Harpsichord Concerto received its premiere recording in 2011; the soloist was Michael Laus, who also conducted the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra for Cameo Classics. Live performances have been rarer, though the two mature symphonies (now numbered 3 and 4) received premieres in Manchester, the first in 2003 and the second in 2005.

The most recent recording is on Dutton Epoch, with [[Peter Donohoe (pianist)|Peter Donohoe]] and [[Raphael Wallfisch]] playing the early Piano Concerto and Cello Concerto respectively in reconstructions and completions by conductor [[Martin Yates]]. Yates also conducts the Overture ''Pelleas and Mellisanda'' on this recording with the BBC Concert Orchestra.

The ''Sonatina for Guitar'' (1927), commissioned by [[Andrés Segovia]], was thought lost and had acquired almost legendary status among guitar historians. Rediscovered in 2001, it was hailed by Angelo Gilardino, Director of the Segovia Museum as "one of the summits of the guitar’s repertoire of the 20th century".{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} ''Sonatina for Guitar'' has been recorded by Tilman Hoppstock on the Signum label and published by Bèrben Edizioni Musicali with one of Scott’s own paintings on the cover.

==Literature==
In addition to his work as a composer and performer, Scott wrote [[poetry]] and [[prose]]. He was fascinated by the [[occult]] and [[health foods]], and described his beliefs as a blend of [[science]], [[philosophy]], and [[religion]]. In a whole series of books and pamphlets, he urged the sick, even those with cancer, to trust to diet and alternative medicine and avoid trained medics and surgery.

Peluso's recent research has been featured on the Congress 2011 of Humanities and Social Sciences which is organized by the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences. An article on Peluso's research as a part of RYME discussed how the research group is bringing forth a new outlook on childhood education, the arts and the media.&lt;ref&gt;Congress 2011 News Article - RYME GROUP: MUSIC TO YOUTH’S EDUCATION SYSTEM’S EARS http://congress2011.ca/2011/06/ryme-group-music-to-youths-education-systems-ears/&lt;/ref&gt; This article also recapped Peluso's and her colleagues' presentations at the Congress, and quoted Peluso as saying that "Teachers facilitate the role of exploring these [technological and artistic] opportunities, learn from kids and offer youth empowerment. Everyone has knowledge of what the next person doesn’t."

She has been cited as stating that "''Digital mediums for communication, expression and multimodality engaging in one's own life, such as social media (e.g., Twitter) and interactive technology like iPads, enter the classroom in the pockets, bags and backpacks of many of the students and educators, yet only until recently have these digital media become a part of the educational environment. Curriculum designers and policy makers seem to be placing a focus on the role of technology within young people's lives''" &lt;ref&gt;iPads in the Classroom stenca10 September 9th, 2012 http://www.classpress.com/blogs/stenca10/592768&lt;/ref&gt;

====Workshops====
Peluso's research into social media has led to her giving workshops on how to use social networks to advance one's career after graduate school.&lt;ref&gt;Dean of Graduate Studies: Using Social Media to Advance your Graduate Career Workshop https://www.sfu.ca/dean-gradstudies/blog/events/DGSsocialmedia.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her background in the positive and negative aspects of online communication allowed her to demonstrate various ways to build social networks in a way that can assist in moving from the life of a grad student to a working professional.

====Graduate School and World of Warcraft Video Games====
Peluso's focus on how participatory cultures can foster artistic and musical learning are influenced by her involvement in social media and [video] gaming. Through her experiences in graduate school and her involvement in the [[MMORPG]] [[World of Warcraft]], she has developed parallels between the process of entering graduate school and the popular online role playing game. Her articles have been featured on the [[Simon Fraser University]] Dean of Graduate Studies website, where tips and tricks for graduate students are showcased.&lt;ref&gt;Dean of Graduate Studies: Graduate Student Tips and Tricks https://www.sfu.ca/dean-gradstudies/blog/tips/Warcraft-Gradstudies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===

====Books====
Peluso is a published author of the book "Motivation, Purpose and Persistence: Pursuing a Leadership Degree: A Study Of Graduate Students' Motivations To Pursue A Degree In Educational Psychology and Leadership Studies".&lt;ref&gt;Peluso, D. C. C. (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=n%3A53%2Cp_27%3ADeanna%20C.%20C.%20Peluso Motivation, Purpose and Persistence: Pursuing a Leadership Degree: A Study Of Graduate Students' Motivations To Pursue A Degree In Educational Psychology and Leadership Studies], Germany: [[VDM Verlag]], {{ISBN|978-3-639-21494-9}}. Amazon Books, U.S.A.. Retrieved on March 24th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The book is published by Dr. Müller Aktiengesellschaft &amp; Co. located in [[Saarbrücken]], [[Germany]], which specializes in publishing books in the research industry. The book is a documentation of a qualitative and quantitative study of the motivations, support systems and reasons for students to persist in their graduate studies in Education.&lt;ref&gt;Peluso, D. C. C. (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=iFk2QwAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9783639214949&amp;cd=1 Motivation, Purpose and Persistence: Pursuing a Leadership Degree] (in English), Germany: Dr. Müller Aktiengesellschaft &amp; Co. pp. 220. {{ISBN|3-639-21494-3}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved on March 25th 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The book looks at the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to commence and continue graduate studies, such as the external support systems of family or funding, the psychological barriers and the potential personal and financial benefits of completing a Masters or Doctoral degree in Education. Since a majority of the participants within the study in the book were educators, mainly teachers in the [[K–12 (education)|K-12 education system]], the study was important in its search to discover the motives of the educators to pursue their post-graduate education, and whether the educators were more interested in personal growth or in financial gain by job advancement due to their additional degree and experience.

====Scholarly Journals====
Peluso's publication record in various peer-reviewed journals and academic publications includes articles on music education and the online environment, participatory cultures and the use of educational technology for artistic learning. In her co-authored article in the Canadian Music Educator, Peluso puts forth a set of standards for scholarly blogging.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Peluso, &amp; DeLong (2011). Building a third place for online dialogue in music education. Canadian Music Educator, 52(4). [https://sfu.academia.edu/DeannaPeluso/Papers/542701/Building_a_third_place_for_online_dialogue_in_music_education._Canadian_Music_Educator_52_4_]&lt;/ref&gt;

Peluso's research on the use of iPads within educational applications was published in the July 2012 edition of the [[British Journal of Educational Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;The fast-paced iPad revolution: Can educators stay up to date and relevant about these ubiquitous devices? - British Journal of Educational Technology Volume 43, Issue 4 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2012.01310.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; She emphasized the fact that the young people of today are requiring a new system of education to accommodate the technological ways that they are learning and communicating. Peluso is quoted as stating: 
:''While young people are engrossed with technology and social media within their everyday lives, using it to communicate, express themselves and learn in novel ways, simply allowing them to use their iPads, or providing them with classroom sets of iPods, does not implicitly mean they will be learning educationally beneficial material. I put forward that due to the intricate and fast-evolving ways that young people engage with these technologies, it may be in order to have an educational curriculum that is developed in collaboration with the young people themselves, that allows them to play an active role in discussing how they are learning.''

Based on Peluso's publications in journals on educational technology, she has presented views on iOS technologies (e.g. iPads) and their role in young people's lives as being concurrent with the paradigms on participatory cultures as defined by [[Henry Jenkins]]. Further, Peluso is quoted in various venues in questioning how technology can be implemented in the classroom, in a way that is relevant and beneficial to the learners, rather than as a way to meet a curricular goal.

==Music==
Peluso has been involved in various musical and performance groups since 2000, though according to her website, due to health problems in late 2008 onward,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dccp.ca/blog/2010/01/researching-oahu-hawaii-olympic-2010vacations-with-a-kitchen-travel-budget/ A Muse's Guide - Deanna Peluso's Personal Website - Paragraph 3 - Retrieved on May 15th, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; she does not seem to be active in any particular musical group or organization.

===Compositions===
Peluso has been composing for over 20 years, but is best known for her performed works that occurred between 2000 and 2007 inclusive. Peluso has an eclectic collection of written compositions written during and after the years she studied music composition at [[Simon Fraser University]]. During her Music Composition degree, Peluso collaborated with dancers, filmmakers, actors and with other performing artists to fuel her experience in the field, in music education and to build upon her 14 years of studying and performing [[Classical period music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthehousefestival.com/index.php?articleID=6 Interdisciplinary Performance: In The House Performing Arts Festival 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Former professors, mentors and teachers included Martin Gotfrit, David McIntyre, and [[Owen Underhill]]. Peluso has composed music for not just sole instrumental performance, but has been involved in composing music for dance, theatre and various other performing art installations within the Vancouver area. It seems that her music, artworks and online presence typically are signed under the pseudonym or nickname — ''dccp''.&lt;ref&gt;Social Networking Reference https://twitter.com/dccp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
An office of the [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agency was established in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in Lamborn's district. The office opened in February 2009 and increased immigration enforcement agents in the area from two to ten. “The immediate need is to address those that have committed a crime and make sure they’re sent out of the country”, Lamborn said. However, this would not place in jeopardy employers who hire illegal immigrants in the first place or who pay these workers without any withholding tax or below the [[minimum wage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/immigration_32122___article.html/office_illegal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122184431/http://www.gazette.com/articles/immigration_32122___article.html/office_illegal.html |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Congressional Quarterly]]'' said that through the first August recess, Lamborn had voted by strict partisan lines the most of any member in the U.S. House and more than any other Republican.&lt;ref name=CQ&gt;{{cite news|last=Giroux|first=Greg|title=CQPolitics.com Candidate Watch|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|date=2007-08-10|url=http://fe30.news.sp1.yahoo.com/s/cq/20070811/pl_cq_politics/cqpoliticscomcandidatewatch}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, The ''[[National Journal]]'' named Lamborn the most conservative member of the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/lamborn-94813-ranked-political.html|title=POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Lamborn ranked most conservative in Congress|publisher=Gazette.com|date=2010-02-26|accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamborn is one of the House Republicans leading the effort against public funding for the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] and NPR ([[National Public Radio]]). "I have been seeking to push [[Big Bird]] out of the nest for over a year, based on the simple fact that we can no longer afford to spend taxpayer dollars on nonessential government programs. It's time for Big Bird to earn his wings and learn to fly on his own."

On August 24, 2007, Jonathan Bartha, who works for Focus on the Family (headquartered in Colorado Springs), and his wife Anna wrote a letter to the editor in a community newspaper expressing concerns about Lamborn's opposition to more restrictions on dog fighting. They were also concerned he had taken several campaign contributions from the gaming industry. A few days later, Lamborn allegedly left two voice mails threatening "consequences" if they didn't renounce their "blatantly false" letter. He also said that he would be "forced to take other steps" if the matter wasn't resolved "on a Scriptural level." The Barthas were shocked by the messages, and Anna Bartha called Lamborn's behavior "not anything we would ever anticipate an elected official would pursue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lamborn message has couple in dismay|url=http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_6782060|publisher=Denver Post|accessdate=August 4, 2011|first=Erin|last=Emery|date=September 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2017, the Veterans Administration awarded a $31.8 Million contract to G&amp;C Fab-Con, LLC, to begin construction on the Pikes Peak National Cemetery in Colorado Springs.

In 2008 Lamborn signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2008/07/lamborn.pdf |format=PDF |title=Americans for Prosperity : News Release : Americans for Prosperity Applauds U.S. House of Representative Doug Lamborn |website=Americansforprosperity |accessdate=2016-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219061216/http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax/ |archivedate=2015-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;"Tar Baby" Remark
On July 29, 2011, Lamborn appeared on a Denver radio program to discuss the debt crisis and the failure of Democrats and Republicans to reach a compromise on the problem. Lamborn stated "Now, I don't even want to have to be associated with [President Obama]. It's like touching a tar baby and you get it, you're stuck, and you're a part of the problem now and you can't get away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doug Lamborn Tar Baby|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URAAfREIRGA|work=youtube.com|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[tar baby]] is sometimes considered to be a racial slur used towards [[African-Americans]]. Former Colorado House Speaker Terrance Carroll, an African-American, replied, “Looking beyond the fact that Congressman Lamborn's entire comment is nonsensical, his use of the term 'tar baby' is unfortunate because [of] the historical connotation of that term when used in conjunction with African Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOP Rep.

On August 1, 2011, Lamborn apologized for his use of the slur, "When I said 'tar baby', I was talking economic quagmire that our country is finding ourselves in because of poor economic policy from the White House.

;National security
Lamborn supported President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. He stated that “By taking steps to temporarily stop refugee admittance from nations that are hotbeds of terrorist activity, the President is taking prudent action to ensure that his national security and law enforcement teams have the strategies and systems in place that they will need to protect and defend America.”&lt;ref name="Blake1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump’s travel ban; here’s where the rest stand|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban/|website=Denver Post|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamborn was among GOP members of the House who did not support Speaker [[Paul Ryan]]'s March 2017 effort to repeal and replace the [[Affordable Care Act]].

===Legislation===
Lamborn supported [[Bill to deny visas to some United Nations ambassadors (S. 2195; 113th Congress)|Senate bill 2195]], a bill that would allow the [[President of the United States]] to deny [[Visa (document)|visas]] to any ambassador to the [[United Nations]] who has been found to have been engaged in [[espionage]] activities or a [[terrorism|terrorist]] activity against the United States or its allies and may pose a threat to U.S. national security interests.&lt;ref name=2195sum&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2195 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2195|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ellie Campbell''' is a pseudonym for sisters, Pam Burks and Lorraine Campbell, who have co-authored and published five novels together, Lorraine Campbell living in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado and Pam Burks in [[Reigate]], Surrey.  They collaborate by email, [[Skype]] and telephone.  Both sisters were born in Scotland and lived much of their early lives in Edinburgh, Bognor Regis and London.  They wrote short stories independently for many years before deciding to become a writing team.  They write women's fiction, mostly set in Britain, featuring humor and romance but their contemporary flawed characters and dramatic situations often revolve around heroines who are slightly older than the average chick lit novel, sometimes married with children or divorced single mothers and with a mystery or even a murder element. They are usually classified as chick lit, satire or mystery categories.

Their first book, [http://amzn.com/B00BJH2D2G ''How to Survive Your Sisters''] was originally published by [[Random House]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/authors/ellie-campbell]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, followed by a second, [http://amzn.com/B00BJH2FRE ''When Good Friends go Bad''] in 2009.  In 2014 the sisters reverted the UK rights and republished both books independently with Across the Pond Press through Amazon.  Both novels are also published in Italian and German by [http://amzn.com/8804597364 Mondadori] in Italy, [http://amzn.com/3442371074|Blanvelet] in Germany and also translated in [http://amzn.com/B004HC52Z0 Serbia].

With their third novel, [http://amzn.com/B00BJH29QQ "Looking For La La"], - a funny chicklit mystery - Ellie Campbell decided to join the growing ranks of indie authors selling in ebook format as well as paperback through [[Amazon.com|Amazon's]] KDP program.  Looking For La La was followed by a sequel -[http://amzn.com/B00I5NMUCU "To Catch A Creeper: a Crouch End Confidential Mystery"] and in April 2015, they published their fifth book with, [http://amzn.com/B00VV28TKY "Million Dollar Question".]  Their books frequently appear high in the Amazon bestseller charts in the USA, UK and Australia.

In 2014, [http://www.audible.com/pd/Romance/How-To-Survive-Your-Sisters-Audiobook/B00OBP82HS How To Survive Your Sisters] and [http://www.audible.com/pd/Mysteries-Thrillers/Looking-for-La-La-Audiobook/B00OBZKGHM Looking For La La] were also produced as audiobooks with Audible.com, narrated by [http://elizabethklettaudio.com Elizabeth Klett] and [http://www.steviezimmerman.com Stevie Zimmerman] respectively.

They are a regular presence on social media with [https://www.facebook.com/EllieCampbellbooks Facebook] and [https://twitter.com/ecampbellbooks Twitter]

Ngeze, one of the few prominent [[Hutu]] members of UPRONA ([[Union for National Progress]]) at the time, was [[interior minister]] in the government of [[Pierre Buyoya]], who was defeated by Ndadaye in elections held on 1 June 1993.

Following widespread condemnation of the coup, the Committee of Public Salvation was dissolved on 27 October. [[Sylvie Kinigi]], [[Heads of Government of Burundi|prime minister]] in the Ndadaye government, took over as acting president.

== Early life ==
Gordon Muortat Mayen was born in 1922 at Karagok village 10 miles South East of [[Rumbek]]. His father was a local chief of Patiop Clan of the Agar [[Dinka]]. Muortat was educated at Akot elementary from 1936-1942. He then attended Loka Nugent Junior Secondary School in [[Western Equatoria]] from 1942-1945. In 1951 he was among the first Southern Sudanese to graduate from Sudan Police College and was commissioned to police inspector where he rose through the ranks to become Chief Inspector of Police.&lt;ref name="The Case for Independence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lokosang|first=L. B.|title=South Sudan: The Case for Independence and Learning from Mistakes|year=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==

[[File:Gordon Muortat.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Gordon Muortat in police uniform]]
In 1957, Muortat was denied a transfer to the Southern Sudan, so he resigned his position and joined the Sudan Civil Administration. He was appointed assistant district commissioner and served in many places in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el-Ghazal]] and [[Greater Upper Nile (region)|Upper Nile]] provinces. In 1965, under the transitional government of Prime Minister [[Sirr Al-Khatim Al-Khalifa]], Muortat was appointed to be Minister of Works and Mineral Resources in his cabinet. However, when Prime Minister [[Muhammad Ahmad Mahjub]] came to office, Muortat was dismissed.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary"/&gt;

In 1964, Gordon Muortat became one of the founders of the Southern Front (SF), a political party that would represent the rights of the people of Southern Sudan. He headed the Southern Front delegation in the Round Table Conference between the South and North in 1965 and is remembered for demanding that the South be given the right to self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anders Breidlid |author2=Avelino Androga Said |author3=Astrid Kristine Breidlid |title=A Concise History of South Sudan|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held this view due to the fact that Southern Sudanese were not involved in the politics which led to the so-called independence of the Sudan from the colonial power in 1956. He therefore argued that South Sudanese must be given the right to determine their political future in a referendum, to be carried out in the South which should be supervised and monitored internationally.&lt;ref name="Arop 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arop|first=Arop-Madut|title=Sudan's Painful Road To Peace|year=2006|publisher=BookSurge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O. Collins 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=O. Collins|first=Robert|title=A History of Modern Sudan|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was also shared by other members of the Southern Front, namely Clement Mboro, Bona Malwal and Hilary Paul Logali.  The great massacres of [[Juba]], [[Wau, South Sudan|Wau]] and all over the South that were carried out by the Sudanese army in July 1965 convinced Gordon Muortat that the Northern Arab rulers were not interested in the peaceful resolution of the 'South Sudan Question'. Thus in August 1965 at the meeting of the Southern Front executive committee, he proposed that the party should be dissolved and that the entire committee should move into exile with the objective of merging with the [[Anyanya]] political and military wings.&lt;ref name="The Case for Independence"/&gt;

== Rebel leader ==

===Anyanya One===
[[File:NpgGordon.png|thumb|President of NPG Gordon Muortat at the declaration and raising of the flag of the Nile State (Republic), 1969]]
Muortat joined the [[Anyanya]] 1 insurgency, fighting in the [[First Sudanese Civil War]] to liberate the territories of Southern Sudan in 1967 and was appointed foreign minister in the Southern Sudan Provisional Government (SSPG) under [[Aggrey Jaden]]. After the collapse of the SSPG due to internal political wrangling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Sudan News Agency|last=Wel|first=PaanLuel|url=http://www.southsudannewsagency.com/news/articles/the-martyrs-day-who-are-the-south-sudaneses-national-heroes-and-heroines}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second Anya-Nya One government, the Nile Provisional Government (NPG) was formed. Gordon Muortat Mayen was elected unanimously as president, with his army fighting a fully fledged war against the north, advocating for the complete independence of the South. During this time, Southern Sudan was renamed the Nile Republic with its citizens being referred to as Nileans. The name Southern Sudan was rejected by Muortat and his government due to the name being just a reference to a geographic zone which has little relevance to the people of the Southern Sudan. It is also a name which was used by colonial powers to inadequately describe the Nilotic and Nilo-Hamitic tribes living on the upper region of the river Nile, first by the Egyptians, and later by the British. Dr. [[John Garang de Mabior]], future leader of the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]], was among one of the batches of Muortat's soldiers sent to Israel for military training under the NPG.&lt;ref name="Arop 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sudan Tribune Gordon Muortat Memorial|last=Mayom|first=Manyang|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article32043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NPG was dissolved in 1970, after the failure to restore Israeli arms shipments to their forces. The weapons were instead being diverted to [[Joseph Lagu]] who formed the Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM) in January 1971 after staging a successful coup d'état against Muortat and his rebel government. At the time, Andrew Makur Thou, commander of the Anyanya forces under the NPG was willing to continue to fight under Muortat's leadership and quell the coup attempt, however Gordon Muortat declined. In a 1999 interview, Muortat, talking on the dissolution of the NPG stated, "I went to the bush in order to fight for the liberation of the South Sudan. And since Lagu had managed to secure arms for the liberation of our people, I did not see any reason to continue with a parallel struggle. So I decided to stand down. Because it is my belief that South Sudan cannot be liberated from the Arabs unless all of the Africans in the South unite and fight as one people, for one goal, the independence of South Sudan".&lt;ref name="Arop 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O. Collins 2008"/&gt; He encouaged all loyal forces to join Lagu and continue the fight against the Arab dominated government in the North. While Muortat was leader of the Southern movement, he declined offers of ceasefire with Khartoum as he was not willing to accept the terms [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] was offering; local autonomy for the region of Southern Sudan. He was only willing to enter peace talks if the succession of Southern Sudan was on the agenda. Shortly after [[Joseph Lagu]] had taken over power as the leader of the movement, the SSLM under Lagu, entered peace negotiations with Khartoum to form the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] which accepted regional autonomy for the South.

In 1971, Gordon Muortat was elected president of the African National Front, which was one of the southern factions that were against the Addis Ababa negotiations and did not actively participate in them, however they sent a clear message to negotiators on how proceedings could move. This included; that talks ought to be held between North and Southern true Representatives i.e. those mandated and not opportunists acting on complicity with the Arabs and their agents. Talks ought to take place without any pre-condition like the Arabs imposition of Local Autonomy. The talks ought to take place under the auspices of impartial organisations like the [[UN]] or the [[OAU]]. The Arabs must know that what they are now committing in Addis Ababa will never help in defeating the Southern Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anders Breidlid|title=A Concise History of South Sudan|year=2010|publisher=African Books Collective}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite this, the Addis Ababa peace agreement was signed in 1972. Gordon Muortat did not agree with the contents and terms of the agreement, calling it a sell out and fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message, tribute and biography of Late Hon. Gordon Muortat|last=James Omunson|first=Lukano|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/SouthSudanKob/F68O2BdLV0M/ij1OQbaHQQoJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the Southern people were not given the chance to self-determination and a return to civil war will be needed in order for South Sudanese to achieve their true unalienable rights. He continued the protest against the agreement and remained in exile moving to the UK.

===Anyanya Patriotic Front===
During the period of peace after the 1972 agreement, the former Ayna-nya rebels were absorbed into the Sudanese army, however many were discontented, and some chose to return to the bush in 1975 and headed to Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gatkuoth Gatluak|title=South Agency, Tribute to Vincent Kuany|first=Lul|url=http://www.southsudannewsagency.com/opinion/articles/vincent-kuany-latjor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Gordon Muortat along with the other Southern Sudanese politicians in exile, formed the Anyanya Patriotic Front, a liberation movement with the same aims as SSPG, NPG and the first Anyanya; to liberate the South as a separate country from the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of San Diego article on Sudan|url=http://www.sandiego.edu/esl/cultures/sudanese/sudanese_bk.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muortat was elected as the President of the movement, other notable high-profile southern politicians that formed the APF were Elia Duang Arop; the movement's Secretary General and former minister in the NPG, Francis Mayar Akoon, Agolong Chol and many others who had disapproved of the Addis Ababa Agreement. The Ethiopian government agreed to station the mutineers, which formed the military wing of the APF, in a camp called Bilpam, which later became the first full-fledged [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] battalion in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Muortat and his group went on organising his 10,000 strong, majority Nuer troops in Bilpam, amongst the troops were the Late Vincent Kuany Latjor, [[Pagan Amum]] and [[Deng Alor]]. Later on the Late Samuel Gai Tut also joined the rebellion. A [[BBC]] reporter mistakenly labelled the Anya-nya Patriotic Front as [[Anyanya two]], knowing that the movement was the continuation of the first Anya-nya one movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Agency, Tribute to Vincent Kuany|url=http://www.southsudannewsagency.com/opinion/articles/vincent-kuany-latjor}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Muortat denounced the splinter group that went on to fight with the SPLA that also became known as [[Anyanya II]] because they deviated from the original ideals of the APF. The new movement, the APF was confronted with many difficulties, launched as a genuine separatist movement to liberate the South Sudan and establish an independent African State, Muortat and the politicians heading it were not ready to entertain any ambiguous directives from their hosts and get dragged into the Communist demagoguery. As a result, the Ethiopian government dismissed them in refusing to provide financial and logistical support. The lack of financial and logistical support, as it was not forthcoming from anywhere, eventually led to their dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arop|first=Arop Madut|title=Sudan's Painful Road To Peace|year=2006|publisher=BookSurge|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Muortat however, was able to secure weaponry from Col. [[Muammar Ghaddafi]] due to Libya's fractured relations with the Khartoum government. The arms were pledged for the movement in Southern Sudan and were then released by Muortat to the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]], who later took up arms against Khartoum.

As Muortat had predicted the Addis-Ababa agreement did not live long. Resource infringements and marginalisation of the South by the North led to increased unrest in the South. In 1983 President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] declared all Sudan an Islamic state under Shari'a law, including the non-Islamic majority southern region, forcing southerners once again to take to the bush for the second struggle for the liberation of the Sudan, this time under Late Dr. [[John Garang]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon Muortat's leadership and resolve were the driving force that continued armed liberation revival in Southern Sudan. Also inspiring many other South Sudanese politicians and students' organizations involved in the liberation struggle, notably the SOSSA and NAM.&lt;ref name="Kuyok, Kuyok Abol 2015"&gt;Kuyok, Kuyok Abol (2015). South Sudan: The Notable Firsts. London: AuthorHouse{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his lengthy period of exile in Europe, Gordon Muortat remained an influential figure in South Sudanese politics. As a revered figure, his residence in London served as the ''Mecca'' for many South Sudanese political leaders of various political stripes and viewpoints in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1994 Gordon Muortat was appointed as Personal Advisor to the SPLM/SPLA Chairman Dr. John Garang de Mabior and a member of the National Liberation Council.&lt;ref name="The Case for Independence"/&gt; He participated in the Machakos peace talks in Kenya in 2004 with the government of Sudan. At the talks he insistently warned the SPLM delegates to learn from the experience of the Addis Ababa Agreement in 1972.&lt;ref name="Kuyok, Kuyok Abol 2015"/&gt;

== Later life and death ==

[[File:Gordon Muortat Funeral.jpg|thumb|right|President Kiir at funeral of Hon. Gordon Muortat]]From 2006 and onwards, Muortat became an MP in the South Sudan Legislative Council representing his constituency in [[Rumbek]]. In his inaugural speech to the SSLA he reiterated his concerns about the length of the CPA and on tribalism. On 12 April 2008, Muortat died from natural causes while on a recess from parliament-having achieved so much in his life. He was very proud of the [[SPLA/M]] achievements especially that the road to the realisation of the Southerner's freedom was within sight.&lt;ref name="The Case for Independence"/&gt; Gordon Muortat was given a state funeral and was laid to rest at Rumbek Freedom Square, attended by thousands of citizens who had come to pay their last respects to a man who was remembered by many as a freedom fighter and defender of the rights of the people of [[South Sudan]]. Notable speakers at the occasion were President [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]], [[Abel Alier]]; former Vice President of the Republic of Sudan and President of the defunct High Executive Council for Southern Sudan, Isaiah Kulang Mabor, Madam [[Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior]], Mr. Andrew Makur Thou, Mr. Bona Malual, Mr. [[Clement Wani Konga]] and Mr. [[Daniel Awet Akot]], then governor of Lakes State. In his address to the mourning citizens of the South Sudanese town of Rumbek, the President of the Republic of South Sudan, Gen. Salva Kiir Mayardit, reminded the people of the selfless leader, who spent all his life struggling for the cause of the people of South Sudan. "It is now up to us, the present generation to transform Hon. Gordon's dreams into a reality, after achieving the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] where the right to Self Determination for the people of South Sudan is enshrined," stated the President. President Kiir declared 3 days of state mourning and all the flags in [[Lakes State]] fly at half mast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veteran politician Gordon Muortat, laid to rest in Rumbek|first=GOSS|url=http://www.goss-brussels.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2999:veteran_politician_gordon_mourtat_mayen_maborjok_laid_to_rest_in_rumbek&amp;catid=34:news&amp;Itemid=70|publisher=GOSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Muortat is widely praised by South Sudanese from all tribes due to his impartialness, his strong stance against tribalism and his vision of seeing Southerners united as equals. He is also greatly respected for his constant and consistent stance against the Khartoum regimes and his lack of compromise regardless of what he was offered by the Sudanese governments. Especially during the period after the Addis Ababa Agreement where he was under self-imposed exile due to his refusal to participate in the Southern Sudanese autonomous government under Nimeiri which he saw as unjust and a sell-out. He encouraged the idea of a continued struggle while many other Southern leaders and politicians embraced the peace and saw the military struggle as over. His stance gave hope to many Southerners who were becoming increasingly disillusioned by the Addis Ababa Agreement and the government. During this time was he expelled from many African countries by their government's such as Zaire and Uganda, due to their unwillingness to be seen as nations that are hosting such a high-profile rebel against the Khartoum government. Muortat was finally granted asylum by the UK after these expulsions.

He is survived by his wife Sarah Piath Ahoc, 10 children and 27 grandchildren.
In his memory, the Gordon Muortat Mayen Foundation has been set up, which seeks to help the people of South Sudan through various schemes and projects.

'''Gunther Gebel-Williams''' (September 12, 1934 - July 19, 2001) was an [[animal training|animal trainer]] for [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey]] [[Circus]] from 1968-1990.

==Early life==
Gebel was born in [[Schweidnitz]], [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]] (now [[Świdnica]], Poland). As a child he and his mother emigrated to Germany [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|when Silesia was ceded to Poland]] after World War II. His father was still missing in the [[Soviet Union]] when he and his mother started working for Circus Williams in Germany in 1947. When the owner suddenly died, his widow asked the then 18-year-old Gebel to train and take over which began his career as an animal trainer. He then took on the additional surname Williams.

==Career==
Gebel came to prominence during the early days of television when the circus was still a popular form of entertainment. His appearances on television shows like ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', in addition to his work with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, accelerated his renown as a tamer primarily of elephants and tigers. He had a son, Mark, and a daughter, Tina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reinmuth|first=Gary|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-11-20/features/9511200197_1_gebel-williams-son-mark-oliver-gebel-animal-trainer-gunther-gebel-williams|title=A Tough Act To Follow: Gebel-williams Turns The Family Business Over To His Son|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 20, 1995|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mother is Sigrid Gebel.&lt;ref name="NYTsevero"&gt;{{cite news|last=Severo|first=Richard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/20/arts/gunther-gebel-williams-circus-animal-trainer-dies-at-66.html|title=Gunther Gebel-Williams, Circus Animal Trainer, Dies at 66|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 20, 2001|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring from the ring, he took a management position as Vice President of Animal Care for the circus.

'''Gustavo Arribas''' is the Director-General of the [[Federal Intelligence Agency]] of [[Argentina]]. He was appointed to the position in December 2015.

==Career==
Prior to heading the Federal Intelligence Agency, Arribas was an agent and broker for professional [[soccer]] players.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kittleson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Kittleson|title=The Country of Football: Soccer and the Making of Modern Brazil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvMPAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=12 June 2014|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95825-8|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustáv Husák''' ({{IPA-sk|ˈɡustaːʊ̯ ˈɦusaːk|lang}}; 10 January 1913 &amp;ndash; 18 November 1991) was a Slovak politician, [[List of Presidents of Czechoslovakia|president of Czechoslovakia]] and a long-term Secretary General of the [[Communist]] Party  of Czechoslovakia (1969–1987). His rule is known as the period of the so-called "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]" after the [[Prague Spring]].

==Early life==
Gustáv Husák was born as a son of an unemployed worker in [[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Pozsonyhidegkút]], [[Pozsony County]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now part of [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]] as [[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Dúbravka]]). He joined the Communist Youth Union at the age of sixteen while studying at the grammar school in Bratislava. In 1933, when he started his studies at the Law Faculty of the [[Comenius University]] in Bratislava, he joined the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ) which was banned from 1938 to 1945. During [[World War II]] he was periodically jailed by the [[Jozef Tiso]] government for illegal Communist activities, and he was one of the leaders of the 1944 [[Slovak National Uprising]] against [[Nazi Germany]] and Tiso. Husák was a member of the Presidium of the [[Slovak National Council (1943-1960)|Slovak National Council]] from 1 September to 5 September 1944.

After the war, he began a career as a government official in Slovakia and party functionary in Czechoslovakia. From 1946 to 1950, he was the head of the devolved administration of Slovakia, and as such he strongly contributed to the liquidation of the anti-communist Christian democratic [[Democratic Party of Slovakia]].  That party had taken 62% in the 1946 elections in Slovakia (whereas in the Czech part of the republic, the clear winner were the Communists), thus complicating the Communist ambitions for a swift taking of power. Husák's loyalty to the central organs of the Czechoslovak Communist party as well as his considerable talent for body politics and a ruthless approach to political opponents contributed largely to the crushing of the Democratic dissent in Slovakia and subjugating the popular opinion in the country to the prevailing political currents.

In 1950, he fell victim to a [[Stalinist]] purge of the party leadership, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, spending the years from 1954 to 1960 in the [[Leopoldov Prison]]. A convinced Communist, he always  viewed his imprisonment as a gross misunderstanding, which he periodically stressed in several letters of appeal addressed to the party leadership. It is generally acknowledged that the then party leader and president [[Antonín Novotný]] repeatedly declined to pardon Husák, assuring his comrades that "you do not know what he is capable of if he comes to power".

As part of the [[De-Stalinization]] period in [[Czechoslovakia]], Husák's conviction was overturned and his party membership restored in 1963. By 1967 he had become a critic of Novotný and the KSČ's [[Neo-Stalinism|neo-Stalinist]] leadership.  In April 1968, during the [[Prague Spring]] under new party leader and fellow Slovak [[Alexander Dubček]], Husák became a vice-premier of Czechoslovakia, responsible for overseeing reforms in Slovakia.

==Leader of Czechoslovakia==
As the [[Soviet Union]] grew increasingly alarmed by Dubček's liberal reforms in 1968 ([[Prague Spring]]), Husák, originally Dubček's ally and a moderate supporter of the reform programme, began calling for caution. After the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in August and he participated in the Czechoslovak-Soviet negotiations between the kidnapped Dubček and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Moscow, he suddenly became a leader of those party members calling for the reversal of Dubček's reforms. An account for his [[pragmatism]] was given in one of his official speeches in [[Slovakia]] after the 1968 events, during which he ventured a rhetorical question, asking where his opponents (supporters of opposition against the Soviet Union) want to find those "friends" of Czechoslovakia (countries in Europe) that would come to support the country (against Soviet troops). 

Supported by Moscow, he was appointed leader of the [[Communist Party of Slovakia (1939)|Communist Party of Slovakia]] in as early as August 1968, and he succeeded Dubček as first secretary (title changed to general secretary in 1971) of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] in April 1969. He reversed Dubček's reforms and purged the party of its liberal members in 1969–1971. In 1975, Husák was elected [[President of Czechoslovakia]]. During the two decades of Husák's leadership, Czechoslovakia became one of Moscow's most loyal allies. 

In the first years following the invasion, Husák managed to appease the outraged civil population by providing a relatively satisfactory living standard and avoiding any overt reprisals like was the case in the 1950s. His regime was not a complete return to the heavy-handed Stalinism that prevailed during the first 20 years of Communist rule in the country. At the same time, the [[human right in Czechoslovakia|people's rights]] were somewhat more restricted than was the case in [[János Kádár]]'s [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Indeed, on the cultural level the level of repression approached that seen in [[Erich Honecker]]'s [[East Germany]] and even [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]. Under the cover of everyday stability, there was a permanent campaign of repression by the [[secret police]] ([[StB]]) targeted at the outspoken dissidents represented later by [[Charter 77]] as well as hundreds of unknown individuals who happened to be targets of the StB's pre-emptive strikes. The repression intensified over the years as Husák grew more conservative.

Starting in the early 1970s, Husák allowed those who had been purged in the aftermath of Prague Spring to rejoin the party. However, they were required to publicly distance themselves from the "errors" they had committed.

The latter part of Husák's tenure saw a struggle within the Politburo over whether to adopt [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]-style reforms. While the hardliners, led by [[Vasil Bilak]], opposed any restructuring, moderates led by [[Prime Minister]] [[Lubomir Strougal]] strongly favoured reform. Husák himself stayed neutral until April 1987, when he announced a somewhat half-hearted reform program scheduled to start in 1991.

Later that year, however, Husák yielded his post as general secretary to [[Miloš Jakeš]] in response to a desire for younger leaders (Jakeš and [[Ladislav Adamec]]) to share in power.

On November 24, 1989, the entire Presidum of the Communist Party, including Husák, resigned. The party officially abandoned power four days later. Husák remained as president until 10 December, when he was forced to swear in the country's first non-Communist government in over 40 years.  He resigned just hours after presiding over the formal end of the regime he had largely created. In a desperate attempt to rehabilitate its image ahead of [[Czechoslovakian parliamentary election, 1990|the first free elections in 44 years]], the Communist Party expelled him in February 1990. He died, almost forgotten, on 18 November 1991, at the age of 78.

There is still some question about Husák's moral responsibility for the last two decades of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. After its collapse, Husák kept saying that he was just trying to diminish the aftermath of the Soviet invasion and had to constantly resist pressure from hard line party Stalinists such as Bilak, [[Alois Indra]] and the like. It is true that in the early 1970s, he personally pushed for an early withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Czechoslovak territory, which did not happen until 1991; this may be ascribed to his pragmatic attempts to ease the situation and to give an impression that things were leaning toward "normality". 

However, there are many irrefutable facts convicting him of a great deal of personal contribution to the regime's nature. As the General Secretary of the Party, he was well able and willing to control the repressive state apparatus. There are many documented cases of appeals from politically persecuted persons, but almost none of them was given Husák's attention. As the overall decay of Czechoslovak society was becoming more and more obvious in the 1980s, Husák became a politically impotent puppet of events. 

Gustáv Husák was awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] on 9 January 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1562 Biography] at the website on Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

Husák confessed to a Catholic priest before his death, having previously been an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/issues/june-10th-2016/when-christianity-becomes-a-crime/ catholicherald.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; On his deathbed in 1991,  Husák received the sacrament of reconciliation from a Catholic archbishop, [[Ján Sokol (bishop)|Ján Sokol]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://journeyonline.com.au/features/former-soviet-boss-gorbachev-denies-conversion-to-christianity/ journeyonline.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1991/11/19/ex-czech-leader-gustav-husak-dies/8007aa69-b210-475d-9653-5d16d5bc8550/ washingtonpost.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Chapter 7.2.1 in the book Michal Macháček: Gustáv Husák, Vyšehrad, 2017&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ivysehrad.cz/kniha/gustav-husak/&lt;/ref&gt;, the whole story of confession is a pure nonsense and the product of catholic propaganda.

'''Hans Holzer''' (26 January 1920 &amp;ndash; 26 April 2009)&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news|title=Hans Holzer, Ghost Hunter, Dies at 89|first=William|last=Grimes|date=April 29, 2009|accessdate=April 30, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/30/books/30holzer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[Parapsychology|paranormal researcher]] and author. He wrote more than 120 books on supernatural and occult subjects for the popular market as well as several plays, musicals, films, and documentaries, and hosted a television show, ''Ghost Hunter'' (not to be confused with ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'').

==Life and career==
Holzer was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of Martha (Stransky) and Leo Holzer, a businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=L25ycEzuXxIC&amp;pg=PA942&amp;lpg=PA942&amp;dq=Martha+Stransky+Leo+Holzer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lmxvl-McD9&amp;sig=e8dB6fn2j-2xylExsXceTv20064&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_kL7D4fXaAhVK04MKHRDxBTAQ6AEIJDAH]&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in the supernatural was sparked at a young age by stories told to him by his uncle Henry. He went on to study archaeology and ancient history at the [[University of Vienna]] but seeing that war was imminent, his family decided it was unsafe to stay in Austria and left the country for [[New York City]] in 1938. He studied Japanese at [[Columbia University]] and, after studying comparative religion and parapsychology, claimed to have obtained a [[Ph.D.]] at a school called the London College of Applied Science. He went on to teach parapsychology at the [[New York Institute of Technology]]. Holzer wrote more than 120 books on ghosts and the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/jun/18/obituary-hans-holzer Hans Holzer Obituary in The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

His extensive involvement in researching the supernatural included investigating [[The Amityville Horror]] and some of the most prominent haunted locations around the world.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He also worked with well-known trance [[Mediumship|mediums]] such as [[Ethel Johnson-Meyers]], [[Sybil Leek]], and [[Marisa Anderson]]. Holzer has been credited with creating the term "The Other Side" (already in use, however, in nineteenth-century spiritualism) or in full "The Other Side of Life".  He is also sometimes credited with having coined the term [[ghost hunting|ghost hunter]], which was the title of his first book on the paranormal published in 1963. However, an earlier book by [[Harry Price]] published in 1936 was titled ''Confessions of a Ghost Hunter''.

In 1970, Holzer published a study of spirit photography called ''Psychic Photography: Threshold of a New Science?''. The book included photographs taken by the spirit photographer [[John Myers (medium)|John Myers]].

Holzer believed in [[Afterlife|life after death]] and the existence of [[ghost]]s, spirits, and "stay behinds". Ghosts were, according to him, imprints left in the environment which could be "picked up" by sensitive people. Spirits were intelligent beings who could interact with the living, while "stay behinds" were those who found themselves earth-bound after death. He also believed in [[reincarnation]] and the existence of "[[Subtle body|levels of consciousness]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/5258945/Hans-Holzer.html Hans Holzer Obituary in The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

Holzer was a proponent of [[psychic archaeology]], which has been widely criticized as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;McKusick, Marshall. (1984). ''Psychic Archaeology from Atlantis to Oz''. ''[[Archaeology (journal)|Archaeology]]''. Vol. 37, No. 5. pp. 48-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holzer was mentioned in Nathan Fielder's television show, ''[[Nathan for You]]''. A Psychic in the show claimed his mother was deemed the 'Queen of the Psychics' by Holzer himself.

Holzer and his wife Countess Catherine Geneviève [[Buxhoeveden family|Buxhoeveden]], a sixth-generation descendent of Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]], had two daughters. The marriage was eventually dissolved.&lt;ref name=guardobit/&gt;

==The Amityville Horror==

Holzer's most famous investigation was into [[The Amityville Horror]] case. In January 1977, Holzer and spiritual [[Mediumship|medium]] Ethel Meyers entered [[The Amityville Horror|112 Ocean Avenue]] in [[Amityville]], New York. Meyers claimed that the house had been built over an ancient Native American burial ground and the angry spirit of a [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]] Indian Chief - "Rolling Thunder" - had [[Spirit possession|possessed]] the previous occupant, [[Ronald Defeo Jr.]], driving him to murder his family. Photographs taken at the scene revealed curious anomalies such as the halos which appeared in the supposed images of bullet marks made in the original 1974 murders. Holzer's claim that the house was built on Indian sacred land was, however, denied by the local Amityville Historical Society and it was pointed out that it was the [[Montaukett]] Indians, and not the Shinnecocks, who had been the original settlers in the area. However, Indian burial sites have been found all over Long Island, including Amityville, so no one has been able to confirm or deny the burial of an Indian chief on or near the 108 Ocean Avenue property. Holzer went on to write several books about the subject, both fiction and non-fiction.

==Reception==

Holzer's endorsement of psychics in [[ghost hunting]] was criticized in an article for the ''Journal for the [[Society for Psychical Research]]'' which "cast considerable doubt on the objectivity and reliability of his work as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Arthur; Berger, Joyce. (1991). ''The Encyclopedia of Parapsychology and Psychical Research''. New York: Paragon House. p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written that Holzer did not provide verification for some of his claims and he credulously accepted [[Spirit photography|spirit photographs]], anecdotal reports, and other doubtful evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe. (2000). [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/haunted_inns_tales_of_spectral_guest/ "Haunted Inns: Tales of Spectral Guest"]. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. Retrieved 14 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickell also wrote that the mediums Holzer endorsed Ethel Meyers and [[Sybil Leek]] offered "unsubstantiated, even unverifiable claims, or information that can be gleaned from research sources or from knowledgeable persons by “[[cold reading]]” (an artful method of fishing for information)."&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe.

Fellow ghost hunter [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]] wrote an obituary for Holzer in ''[[The Guardian]]'', in which he disputed Holzer's claim (made in his 1979 book ''[[Murder in Amityville]]'') that the house on Ocean Avenue in Amityville was built on the site of a [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]] burial ground.&lt;ref name=guardobit&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/jun/18/obituary-hans-holzer|title=Hans Holzer|last=Underwood|first=Peter|date=2009-06-17|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holzer's daughter, Alexandra Holzer, wrote a 2008 book titled ''Growing Up Haunted'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schifferbooks.com/growing-up-haunted-a-ghostly-memoir-3546.html|title=Growing Up Haunted: A Ghostly Memoir - $14.95 : Schiffer Publishing|website=www.schifferbooks.com|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on her life with her father and his paranormal quest.

They may also perform nontraditional religious or [[humanism|Humanist]] ceremonies in a variety of settings including on a beach, in a park, by the ocean, in the mountains, on a ski slope, at a banquet hall or at an event center. [[Interfaith]] Officiants are trained in world religions and inter-spirituality, and can assist people in identifying their own spiritual beliefs through a process of spiritual self-discovery.  

Interfaith Officiants come from many different faith backgrounds and have different philosophies and personal theologies, yet are well-versed in a multitude of religious traditions.  They share a commitment to serving individuals, couples and families in a very personal and respectful way, building ceremonies around the wishes, preferences, beliefs and practices of the clients they serve.  Like hospital chaplains, Interfaith Officiants generally do not proselytize on behalf of any one faith tradition, but respect and honor them all. 

A number of Interfaith Seminaries and religious institutions train Interfaith Officiants, which are also sometimes called Interfaith Ministers or Interfaith [[Officiant|Celebrants]].  Interfaith Officiants differ from [[Chaplains]] in that they usually work independently and serve the public at large, as opposed to Chaplains, who are employed by the [[military]], hospitals, or other institutions.

In 2010 The Council of Interfaith Communities of the United States was created, which is an umbrella for interfaith-interspiritual ministers who are going beyond celebrant status to engage and organize their couples in a lifetime community ministry to support interfaith families.  The services of the minister include all of the life celebrations found in traditional faith organizations.  The CIC-USA includes most of the first interfaith seminaries in the world including: The New Seminary (New York), One Spirit Interfaith Seminary (New York), Chaplaincy Institute for Arts and Interfaith Ministry (Berkeley, CA), Chaplaincy Institute of Maine (Maine), the American Institute for Holistic Theology (Alabama), and the Interfaith Academy for Interfaith Studies (Texas and Mexico), and the All-Paths Divinity School (Los Angeles, CA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8708">[[File:Johann Paul Kremer 1947.tiff|thumb|right|Kremer at the [[Auschwitz Trial]] in Kraków, 1947]]
'''Johann Paul Kremer''' (26 December 1883 – 8 January 1965) was a professor of anatomy and human genetics at [[Münster University]] who joined the [[Wehrmacht]] on May 20, 1941. He served in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] as a physician during [[World War II]], from 30 August 1942 to 18 November 1942.

A member of the [[NSDAP]], he was involved in [[Nazi human experimentation]] on the prisoners of Auschwitz-Birkenau. He was [[sentenced to death]] in the [[Auschwitz Trial]], but this sentence was later commuted to one of [[life imprisonment]]. He was released in 1958.

Kremer received notoriety for his diary, which recounted mundane day to day activities interspersed with entries of his witnessing murder and depravity through gassings and ''special actions''.

{{quote|September 5, 1942 : In the morning attended a special action from the women's concentration camp (Muslims); the most dreadful of horrors. [[Heinz Thilo|Obersturmführer Thilo]] (troop doctor) was right when he said to me that this is the anus mundi. In the evening towards 8:00 attended another special action from Holland [sic]. Because of the special rations they get a fifth of a liter of schnapps, 5 cigarettes, 100 g salami and bread, the men all clamor to take part in such actions. Today and tomorrow (Sunday) work.&lt;ref name="The Good Old Days"&gt;Klee, Ernst, W. Dressen, V. Riess, eds. "The Good Old Days": The Holocaust as Seen by its Perpetrators and Bystanders. New York: The Free Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Life prior to Auschwitz==
Kremer was born in [[Stellberg]]. He was a doctor of medicine as well as philosophy he also studied natural science and mathematics. He studied in [[Heidelberg]], [[Strassburg]] as well as [[Berlin]]; he received his medical degree in 1919 and his philosophy degree in 1914. He was the "assistant surgeon at the surgical clinic of the University, Charité, the ward of internal diseases of the Municipal Hospital Berlin-Neukölln, the surgical clinic of the University of Cologne and prosector in the Institutes of Anatomy in Bonn and Münster. He became Dozent of anatomy in 1929 and was promoted there in 1936 to be professor in commission. At the same time he was commissioned to lecture on the science of human hereditariness [now known as the field of human genetics]."&lt;ref name="KL Auschwitz seen by the SS"&gt;Bezwińska, Jadwiga and Czech, Danuta. ''KL Auschwitz seen by the SS''. New York: Howard Fertig Inc., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He also did some writing, he mentions two articles that he wrote in the diary he kept, the first being "Inherited or Acquired? A Noteworthy Contribution to the Problem of Hereditariness of Traumatic Deformations" and the second titled "New Elements of Cell and Tissues Investigations".&lt;ref name="KL Auschwitz seen by the SS"/&gt;

==Medical experiments==
The main priority of SS doctors at concentration camps throughout Nazi-occupied Europe was not to provide basic medical services to prisoners, but rather to give the appearance of competent medical care. Following the full-scale implementation of the [[Final Solution]], much of their time was occupied with concentration camp exterminations, sorting/selection of the newly-arrived (primarily Jewish) prisoners (e.g. for work, experimentation, or immediate extermination), direct observation of executions and gassings, experimentation, and the fabrication of causes of deaths on prisoner death certificates.&lt;ref name="Medicine in Auschwitz"&gt;Strzelecka, Irena. "Medicine in Auschwitz: Selection, executions, and experiments" Państwowe Muzeum Auschwitz-Birkenau w Oświęcimiu. Accessed November 14, 2012. www.en.auschwitz.org&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments conducted by SS doctors were done for three main reasons: 1) to research methods to improve the health and survivability of soldiers; 2) to lay the groundwork for post-war scientific research; and 3) to carry out the dictates of the racial policies of the Nazi Party. Some experiments were also done at the behest of pharmaceutical companies and medical institutes, for the doctors' own research interests, and to benefit the doctors' personal careers.&lt;ref name="Medicine in Auschwitz"/&gt;

Kremer was particularly interested in the effects of starvation on the human body, especially on the liver, and because Kremer was responsible for examining the prisoners that sought admission to the camp infirmary, he was able to personally select the prisoners that he believed would make good test subjects for his experiments. He often performed autopsies in order to extract samples from the liver, spleen and pancreas. On several occasions in his diary, he mentions the [[Nazi human experimentation|extraction of organs and tissues]] (which he called "living-fresh material") from living victims, such as on October 15, 1942, when he writes, "Living-fresh material of liver, spleen and pancreas taken from an abnormal individual."&lt;ref name="KL Auschwitz seen by the SS"/&gt; Kremer's diary contains descriptions of at least five more similar instances. At his hearing on July 30, 1947, Kremer stated that "I observed the prisoners in this group [to be liquidated] carefully and whenever one of them particularly interested me because of his advanced stage of starvation, I ordered the medical orderly to reserve him and to inform me when this patient would be killed by injection."&lt;ref name="The Good Old Days"/&gt;

==Special actions==
All SS doctors were required to be present at what were called "special actions", which was when the mass gassings took place. The most common victims were children, the elderly, mothers with young children and any others considered unfit to work. During his trial, Kremer described how a gassing was conducted and what his role as doctor was. The gassings were conducted in cabins located on the outskirts of the camp; the victims were transported by railway, and after they arrived, prisoners "were first driven to barracks where the victims undressed and then went naked to the gas chambers. Very often no incidents occurred, as the SS men kept people quiet, maintaining that they were to bathe and be deloused. After driving all of them into the gas chamber the door was closed and an SS man in a gas mask threw the contents of a [[Zyklon B|Cyclon]] tin through an opening in the side wall."&lt;ref name="KL Auschwitz seen by the SS"/&gt; Kremer's role was to sit in a van along with a medical orderly ready to treat any officers that might succumb to the gas.

==Executions and beatings==
Throughout Kremer's diary there are multiple occasions where he mentions being in attendance at various executions and beatings. At least four instances can be found where he mentions executions either by gun, [[phenol]] injection, or an unspecified method.&lt;ref name="KL Auschwitz seen by the SS"/&gt; He mentions briefly no fewer than three instances where he oversaw the punishment of prisoners. The physicians were required to examine the victim before the punishment and to remain during the administration of punishment; in practice however, physicians rarely, if ever, examined victims and did not openly object to the punishments.&lt;ref name="KL Auschwitz seen by the SS"/&gt;

==Testimony and indictment==
Johann Kremer was tried in the Auschwitz trials at the sitting of the Supreme Court National Tribune in Kraków throughout November and December 1947. Based on the contents of his diary and his own confessions, Kremer participated in fourteen gassings as well as multiple public executions and special actions, also known as gassings.&lt;ref name="KL Auschwitz seen by the SS"/&gt; During his testimony, he described the process by which he selected his victims, the process of gaining the necessary information for his research, and he states that "after I had been given this information a medical orderly would come and kill the patient with an injection in the heart area. To my knowledge all these patients were killed with phenol injections. The patient died immediately after being given such an injection. I myself never administered fatal injections."&lt;ref name="The Good Old Days"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1676">'''Junior Rotter''' was a British comic strip, created by [[Trevor Metcalfe]] in 1980. The series were originally published in the magazine ''[[Whizzer and Chips]]'', and from 1990 on in ''[[Buster (comic)|Buster]]'' when the two magazines merged.

==Concept==

Junior Rotter was a spoof of [[J.R. Ewing]], the [[breakout character]] from the TV soap opera ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bustercomic.co.uk/trevormetcalfe.html&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, Sue Helen, is a parody of Sue Ellen, from that same series. Except for their names it had nothing else to do with this soap opera. Junior Rotter and Sue Helen were sibling rivals. Rotter was a bad boy, while Sue was a decent, charming and helpful person whom he tried to trick, always failing in the end. Their rivalry often extended into an all-out conflict. The final issue of ''Buster'' included a page showing the ultimate fates of the characters; Junior Rotter was shown as becoming the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

==Similar characters==

A similar character, also loosely based on the character from ''Dallas'', named Jay R Hood appeared in rival publisher [[DC Thomson]]'s ''[[Nutty]]'' coincidentally. This strip also featured a character named Sue Helen who acts as Jay R's most common victim.

'''Katanda Territory''' is one of five territories which, along with the city of Mbuji-Mayi, constitute the current Congolese province of [[Kasai-Oriental]]. [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)]] is made up of 192 territories and 20 cities which are [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|grouped in 26 provinces]] including [[Kinshasa|Kinshasa, the capital city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_d%C3%A9mocratique_du_Congo#Article_2|title=Constitution de la République démocratique du Congo - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org|language=fr|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katanda Territory is sectioned into four sectors: Baluba-Lubilanji, Mutwayi, Nsangu, and Tshitolo.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caid.cd/index.php/donnees-par-province-administrative/province-de-kasai-oriental/territoire-de-katanda/?secteur=fiche|title=Cellule d'Analyses des Indicateurs de Développement|website=www.caid.cd|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory is also endowed with three towns (Katanda, Tshala and Tshitenge). Katanda Town is the headquarters of both Katanda Territory and Baluba-Lubilanji Sector as well; this town is located on the top of the hill in the Bena Nshimba Grouping. Tshala town, in the Bakwa Ndaba Grouping, is also famous because of its power station on the [[Tshala River]] that supplies power to Mbuji-Mayi city and its neighborhoods. So, Tshitenge Town which is well known for its diamond businesses is in the Bena Nshimba Grouping.

== Meaning ==
''Katanda'' simply means ''small hangar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cefopdh.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PLD_KATANDA.pdf|title=PLAN LOCAL DE DEVELOPPEMENT DU TERRITOIRE DE KATANDA|last=Broederlijk|first=Broederlijk|date=2017-04-22|website=www.cefopdh.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It once happened that somewhere on the hill, there was a single mother who used to sell her goods in her small hangar. With time, this small hangar became a meeting place for youth from everywhere and some travelers as well.  So, when the Belgian settlers arrived to implant the Colo-Cotton (the colonial cotton industry), they asked autochthons for the name of that place and they all replied "Katanda", by reference to that single woman's small hangar. Katanda then became the name of the state post of settlers installed in 1924, comprising only a part of the Bena Nshimba Grouping which is located on the hill of the town of Katanda.

== Origin ==
The territory of Katanda originated from a colonial native constituency. During the pre-colonial period, this territory was ignored. On 1962, under the Provincial Governor Joseph Ngalula Mpanda-Njila, Katanda became a borough, which was made up of the actual territory of Katanda, including Bena Kalambayi Chiefdom and Bena Nomba Grouping. At that time, this borough was partitioned into rural communes. Katanda Territory was created on 1978, by Ordinance Law n 78/18 of 18 January 1978. Further, in 1982, Katanda Territory was divided into four sectors and one town (Katanda Town).

== Location ==
Katanda is located 60&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Mbuji-Mayi]], the capital of East Kasai Province, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Katanda Territory is bounded to the north by [[Lusambo Territory]] (currently the town of the new province of Sankuru); to the northwest by [[Lupatapata Territory]]; to the south by [[Ngandajika Territory]] (Lomami); to the east by [[Kabinda Territory]] (Lomami); and to the west by both [[Tshilenge Territory]] and [[Mbuji Mayi]] city. Katanda lies approximately between 23 °42' 5" and 24 ° East longitudes, then 6° 17' 5" and 6 ° 25'3" South latitude.

== Administrative subdivisions ==
''Katanda territory is subdivided into four sectors. The four sectors of the territory are subdivided into groupings as follows:''

== Climate ==
''Köppen-Geiger climate classification system'' classifies the climate of Katanda as tropical wet and dry (Aw). Two natural seasons alternate with the rainy season running from mid-August to mid-May, while the dry one runs from mid-May to mid-August. The rainfall is 1200 to 1400&amp;nbsp;mm. The temperature varies between 22&amp;nbsp;°C and 27&amp;nbsp;°C depending on the season, but sometimes it reaches 34&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Vegetation ==
The vegetation is dominated by [[imperata]] and [[panicum]] (the wooded savannah or clear forest). Its relief is rugged of valleys and hills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ground ==
The soil of Katanda Territory is sandy and [[Ground–structure interaction|clayey]]. Its relief is rugged of the valleys and hills. The vegetation is dominated by imperata and panicum (the wooded savannah or clear forest). Its relief is rugged of valleys and hills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Hydrography ==
The territory is crossed by several rivers including lakes such Malengu, Lubombo, Nyinda, Kapongo, Kasampi and Lukelenge. But, the main and most important remains the river Lubilanji lulua Tshilemba, in short Lubilanji. This river crosses the territory to the west (through the sectors of Nsangu and Tshitolo) to the south (through the sector of Baluba-Lubilanji). Lubilanji River receives water from several streams such as Bufua, Kalenganyi, Kasulu, Mulunguyi River in the south in the sector of Baluba-Lubilanji; as well Kalenga, Mulamba and Mutuayi River in the east in the sector of Mutuayi.

== Predators ==
Formerly hidden in the depths of Lubilanji River, the crocodiles and hippopotamuses of Katandese rivers reappear, frequenting the banks, and terrorizing innocent people on their paths. Several people have been killed by ambuscades. Survivors keep testifying their tragedies and warning people to prevent any potential assault. Women refrain approaching the shores. The Province promised to assist the Territory by leading these carnivores back to their home rivers. Meanwhile, swimming is still prohibited and fishermen are converted to farmers.

'''Particularities and richness of the territory'''

Katanda is also one of those Congolese territories that holds a large part of the Congolese reserve of diamonds; the territory is mentioned among the largest producers of peanuts, palm oil, corn and cassava in the country.

== Economy ==
Katanda is a mining land inhabited by a traditionally mining population. So, despite the rarity of precious and semi-precious stones, the fall of raw materials on the international market, as well as other collateral repercussions of the financial crisis, diamond mining by individual contractors is still prevalent in the Katanda, whereas the economy is now oriented to subsistence activities such agriculture with local farmers who are using simple tools. The massive conversion of this mining people into farmers has significantly raised the provincial rank in the National agricultural production indicators. They could have done better but the infrastructure makes recurrent problems. The territorial activities is based on:

·     Agriculture (45%)

·     Retail trade (30%)

·     Artisanal mining (diamond) (15%)

·     Livestock (7%)

·     Fishing (3%)

=== Cultural activities ===
The abundant harvest from these familial activities raises the economy of Katanda on the top list of the list of several national productions; such as corn &amp; cassava.  Some of these productions are consumed, some are stored for replanting (bartering is prohibited), and some other are sold.

 ''The overproduction due to the increase in the quantity of workforce requires the improvement of some infrastructures such agricultural access roads arises.''

=== Agriculture ===
Each household has at least one field where it practices agriculture.  Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture intensively practiced in Katanda. This type is practiced to satisfying family or local needs alone, with a little left over for transport elsewhere. The territorial agricultural production started decreasing just when women and elderlies avoided maintaining and watering as scheduled their cornfields, fields of cassava, fields of wheat fearing hippopotamus and crocodiles' assaults offshore.

=== Hunting ===
Mostly men hunt while women either take care of children or their cattle.

==== Katanda Bone Harpoon Point ====
In 1988 Allison Brooks and John Yellin discovered a bone harpoon point in Katanda, Democratic Republic of Congo.

"Humans in Central Africa used some of the earliest barbed points, like this harpoon point, to spear huge prehistoric catfish weighing as much as 68 kg (150 lb)–enough to feed 80 people for two days. Later, humans used harpoons to hunt large, fast marine mammals" (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point&lt;/nowiki&gt;, accessed 0510-2010)

== Culture ==

=== Language(s) ===
[[French language|French]] is the official language, but the main spoken is Tshiluba
{| class="wikitable"

Being the unique official language of the country, French tends to take precedence over the four national languages as well as all dialects. However, only those who went to school are fluent in French, while the illiterates speak their specific broken French. Useful in professional fields, territorial branches, public administration, and somewhat in hospitals and police, French remains the principal working tool for students, teachers, authorities and so on in Katanda Territory.

Tshiluba remains the most spoken language throughout the territory of Katanda (spoken at 80%) because it is first and foremost the mother language in Katanda for natives, before also becoming one of the national languages. Since ancestries, autochthones spoke only Tshiluba Language. The influence of colonization and the effects of globalization have competitively lowered nowadays the predominance of Tshiluba Language to 80% speakers in various territorial fields.

The settlers brought French during the colonial period which is still useful for schooling. Catholic Church backed them up by introducing the alphabetization for adults and seniors in French.

In the '70s, Unitary system let Katanda people to get married with partners from different provinces; this allowed some household to speak other dialects according to their partner's understanding.

In the '80s, the wave of deportation from Katanga brought Swahili in all five territories of the East Kasai. Those deported once back home, they spread Swahili throughout the territory. So, with an estimated rate of 8% of Swahili-speakers, Swahili Language became the second national language most spoken at Katanda.

In the '90s, Democracy reinforced English in school which is still useful for teachers and students in school and various other circumstances. Even dominated by Tshiluba and somewhat Swahili, French remains the unique official language in Katanda and the entire country as well.

The Lingala which is so far spoken at 2% is positioned as the third national language of the territory. Both military and police are the first to introduce Lingala in this territory during various conflicts among groupings. After restoring the public order, military may further leave, whereas police will stay. Police were deployed throughout the entire territory for national purpose. They all speak only in Lingala with anyone on their way. Katanda people learned Lingala involuntarily just for to communicate with them. Secondly, the federal development agents working synergistically with the local authorities of public administration. They mostly came from the Capital Kinshasa where they speak fluently French &amp; Lingala. Thirdly both, Tetela and Songe languages are audible on the Route National 2 as well as in some isolated conversations at the market. The constituency of Katanda is so far multilingual.

===Cinema===
Sax and Zadis (Kazadi), are the only modern movie theaters in the territory. They generally show popular recent [[Hollywood]] productions as well as NC-17 films. However, they also show movies about Congolese and African recent history like ''[[Mister Bob]],'' ''[[Sniper: Reloaded]],'' ''[[SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines]],'' and ''[[Tears of the Sun]].'' Before films, they both showed Congolese and international music videos, and US wrestling. Zadis primarily addresses the young adults of Lubumbashi. Children are exposed to huge NC-17 posters, but seldom get in.

Zadis in particular also screens great football matches, and local singers' concerts and Christian meetings are regularly held here. All over the city, especially in crowded neighborhoods, are spread small rooms in which children are exposed to violent movies from morning to night.

Nigeria's [[Nollywood]] films are also, as in many other parts of the DRC and Africa, popular among the residents. These films are often sold on VCD and DVD platforms.

===Music===
Folklore music dominates in the territory. The popular music from Kinshasa can also be heard around.

===Okapi Radio's cultural participation===
Okapi Radio's Katanda presenters participate each Saturday evening in ''"métissage,"'' the cultural program of the radio. The whole country is informed of the cultural activities in the city.

== Media ==

===National channel (RTNC/Katanga)===
RTNC (Congolese National Radio and Television) has a provincial station located in Lubumbashi district at Mbuji-Mayi.

===Independent channels===
Radio Kasongo Munganga, the first independent radio station in the territory, started broadcasting in 2013; since then several radio stations were constructed.

== Sports ==
Katanda is home to [[association football|football]] clubs such as [[TP Kasongo]] whose Chairman is the actual National Deputy of Katanda Territory, [[Kasongo Munganga|Professor Kasongo Munganga]].

== Celebrity ==
# [[Kasongo Munganga|Professor Kasongo Munganga]] (Chairman of TP Kasongo &amp; Current National Deputy)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5012">'''Llŷr''' ({{lang-cy|Llŷr Llediaith}} ({{IPA-cy|ˈɬɨːr ˈɬɛdjaiθ}}); ''Lleddiaith'' meaning "half-speech"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromwich|1961}}, triads #8 and #52&lt;/ref&gt; or "half-language"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a figure in [[Welsh mythology]], probably originally a deity, probably derived from Irish [[Lir|Ler]] ("the Sea"), father of ''[[Manannán mac Lir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}, "Llŷr is often assumed to be borrowed from the Irish Lir, the patronym of the sea-god Manannán&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other than his progeny and odd tidbits, his identity remains obscure.

Llŷr appears as the father of [[Brân the Blessed|Brân]], [[Branwen|Brânwen]] and [[Manawydan]] by [[Penarddun]] in the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Branwen, Daughter of Llyr|''Branwen, Daughter of Llyr'']], the Second Branch of the ''[[Mabinogion|Mabinogi]]''.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Jones|1949}}, New Revised ed. 1993, p. 21, "Bendigeidfran son of Llŷr was crowned king.. His two brothers on the mother's side (Nisien and Efnisien) were sons of Euroswydd by his mother Penarddun."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Welsh Triads]] states that Llŷr was imprisoned by [[Euroswydd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromwich|1961}}, triad #52&lt;/ref&gt; and presumbably, Penarddun consequently married Euroswydd,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mountain|1998}} Celt. Enc. vol. 4, p. 930, "Penarddun then married Euroswydd and bore his children Nissyen and Evnissyen"&lt;/ref&gt; giving birth by Euroswydd to her two younger sons, [[Nisien]] and [[Efnisien]], as stated in the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Branwen, Daughter of Llyr|Second Branch]].&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[King Lear]]'' is based on material taken secondhand (through [[Holinshed]]) from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s mythical king [[Leir of Britain|King Leir]], who has often been connected, but is likely unrelated, to Llŷr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}, "Many trace Shakespear's.. Lear to Llŷr, but the route is tortuous; Shakespeare drew from Holinshed's Chronicles (1577)", etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

(*) Unbordered names are figures not in Llŷr's line of descent, though perhaps members of the extended family.&lt;br&gt; 
(*) This stemma is subject to further elaboration. If the Beli above is to be equated with [[Beli Mawr]] then [[Caswallawn]] stands as Penarddun's sibling. But Bromwich observes that Penarddun should be emended to being the sister of Beli, which would bring consistency with statement elsewhere that Caswallawn and Bran are cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromwich|1961}}, endnotes, p.284- on "Bran Vendigeit m.

'''Marie of the Incarnation, [[Discalced Carmelite Order|O.C.D.]]''', also as '''Madame Acarie''' (1 February 1566 &amp;ndash; 18 April 1618), was the foundress of the nuns of the [[Discalced Carmelite Order]] in France, who later became a [[lay brother|lay sister]] of the Order. She has been called the "mother of Carmel in France".&lt;ref name=byzantine&gt;[http://www.byzantinediscalcedcarmelites.com/page20.html "Bl. Marie of the Incarnation", Discalced Carmelite Nuns of the Byzantine Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
"Le belle Acarie" ("the beautiful Acarie"), as she was known in Paris,&lt;ref name=byzantine/&gt; was born '''Barbara Avrillot''' in [[Paris]]. Her family belonged to the higher bourgeois society in Paris. Her father, Nicholas Avrillot, was Accountant General in the Chamber of Paris, and chancellor of [[Marguerite de Valois|Marguerite of Navarre]], first wife of [[Henry IV of France]]; while her mother, Marie Lhuillier was a descendant of [[Etienne Marcel]], the famous prévôt des marchands (chief municipal magistrate). She was placed with the [[Poor Clares]] of the [[Abbey of Longchamp]], where she had a maternal aunt,  for her education, and acquired there a vocation for the cloister. In 1584, through obedience she married Pierre Acarie, viscount of Villemor, a wealthy young man of high standing, who was a fervent Catholic, to whom she bore seven children.&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt; Pierre Acarie  disapproved of Barbe's reading romance novels  and with clerical advice removed the books and substituted books of a  more pious and spiritual bent.&lt;ref name=byzantine/&gt;

Pierre Acarie was one of the staunchest members of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], which, after the death of [[Henry III of France]], opposed the succession of the [[Huguenot]] prince, [[Henry of Navarre]], to the French throne. He was one of the sixteen who organized the resistance in Paris and partly responsible for the subsequent famine which resulted from the siege of Paris (1590).&lt;ref name=anglo&gt;[http://www.ocd.ie/index.php/carmelite-saints/181.html " Bl Mary of the Incarnation", Discalced Carmelite Friars, Anglo-Irish and Scottish Region]&lt;/ref&gt; Mary was so wise in her almsgiving that during a famine the wealthy persons who desired to help the poor caused their alms to pass through her hands, and she was widely respected.&lt;ref name=guerin/&gt; After the dissolution of the League, brought about by the abjuration of Henry IV, Acarie was exiled from Paris and his wife had to remain behind to contend with creditors and businessmen for her children's fortune, which had been compromised by her husband's want of foresight and prudence. She defended her husband in court, drafting memoirs, writing letters and furnishing proofs of his innocence. He was acquitted and enabled to return to the city after three years.&lt;ref name=guerin&gt;[https://archive.is/20130620212247/http://aeternus.stblogs.com/?p=103  Guerin, Msgr. Paul. ''Les Petits Bollandistes: Vies des Saints'', (Bloud et Barral: Paris, 1882), Vol. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition she was afflicted with physical sufferings, the consequences of a fall from her horse, and a very severe course of treatment left her an invalid for the rest of her life.

At the beginning of the 17th century, Acarie was widely known for her virtue, her [[supernatural]] gifts, and especially her charity towards the poor and the sick in the hospitals.   To her residence came all the distinguished and devout people of the day in Paris, among them Madame de Meignelay, née de Gondi, a model of Christian widows, Madame Jourdain and Madame de Bréauté, all future Carmelites, the [[Chancellor]] de Merillac, [[Père Coton]], the Jesuit, as well as St. [[Vincent de Paul]] and St. [[Francis de Sales]], who for six months was Acarie's [[spiritual director]].

She is reputed to have had the gift of healing, the gift of prophecy, of predicting certain events in the future, of reading hearts and of discerning spirits. At the age of twenty-seven, she received the stigmata, the grace of physical conformity to the Suffering Christ. She is the first Frenchwoman the authenticity of whose stigmata (although invisible) have been attested by eminent persons.&lt;ref name=anglo/&gt;

In 1601 she was introduced to the Life of St Teresa of Avila and was greatly moved by her life.
A few days later St. Teresa, appeared to her and informed her that God wished to make use of her to found Carmelite convents in France. The [[Vision (spirituality)|apparitions]] continuing, Acarie took counsel and began the work. A meeting in which [[Pierre de Bérulle]], future founder of the [[Oratory of Jesus]], Francis de Sales, the Abbé de Brétigny, and the Marillac's took part, decided on the foundation of the "Reformed Carmel in France", 27 July 1602. St Frances the Sales was the one who wrote to the pope to obtain authorization and Pope Clement VIII granted the Bull of institution on 23 November 1603. The following year some Spanish Carmelites were received into the Carmel of Rue St. Jacques, which became celebrated. Mme de Longueville, Anne de Gonzague, Mlle de la Vallieres, withdrew to it; there also [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] and [[Fénelon]] were to preach. The Carmel spread rapidly and profoundly influenced French society of the day. Barbara Acarie also cooperated in the new foundations of Pontoise (1605), Dijon (1605) and Amiens (1606).&lt;ref name=john/&gt; In 1618, the year of Mme Acarie's death, it numbered fourteen houses.&lt;ref name=anglo/&gt;

Mme Acarie also shared in two foundations of the day, that of the Oratory and that of the [[Ursulines]].&lt;ref name=fournet&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09667b.htm Fournet, Pierre Auguste. "Bl. Marie de l'Incarnation." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 11 Jun. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 1611 she, with St. Vincent de Paul, assisted at the Mass of the installation of the Oratory of France. Among the many [[postulant]]s whom Mme Acarie received for the Carmel, there were some who had no vocation, and she conceived the idea of getting them to undertake the education of young girls, and broached her plan to her holy cousin, Mme. de Sainte-Beuve. To establish the new Order, they brought Ursulines to Paris and adopted their rule and name.

When her husband died in 1613, his widow settled her affairs and begged leave to enter the Carmel, asking as a favour to be received as a lay sister in the poorest community. In 1614 she withdrew to the monastery of [[Amiens]], taking the name of Marie of the Incarnation.&lt;ref name=brothers&gt;[http://www.ocarm.org/en/content/liturgy/bl-mary-incarnation-ocd-reigious-m "Blessed Mary of the Incarnation OCD", Order of the Brothers of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel]&lt;/ref&gt; Her three daughters had preceded her into the cloister, and one of them, [[Margaret of the Blessed Sacrament]], was sub-[[prioress]] at Amiens. She made her solemn profession on April 8, 1615, in the course of a prolonged sickness. In 1616, for reasons of health, she was sent to the Carmelite convent at [[Pontoise]], where she died at the age of fifty-two.&lt;ref name=john/&gt;

==Veneration==
She was beatified by Pope Pius VI in 1791; her mortal remains are in the chapel of the Carmelites of Pontoise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmel.asso.fr/Pontoise.html "Pontoise", Le Carmel en France]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patrimoine-histoire.fr/Patrimoine/Pontoise/Pontoise-Carmel.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Her feast is celebrated on 18 April.

==Legacy==
She is primarily noted for the introduction of the reform of St. Teresa of Jesus into France, so much so that she merits the title of "mother and foundress of the (Discalced) Carmel in France".&lt;ref name=john&gt;[http://carmelnet.org/biographies/MaryIncarnation.pdf John of Jesus Mary.

'''Misha Kokaia''' (Georgian: მიშა კოკაია) (born 1954) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] politician and Doctor of Mathematics who was last seen on  27 September 1993.

==Disappearance==
The last time Kokaia was seen was 27 September 1993, when the city of [[Sukhumi]] fell to the Russian-supported separatist forces. Some say that he was killed in Sukhumi along with [[Zhiuli Shartava]], [[Guram Gabiskiria]] and others by Abkhaz separatist rebels during the ethnic cleaning of Georgians in Abkhazia on the same date.

'''Nicole Nichols''' is a fictional character played by [[Natasha Lyonne]] on the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''. She is a recurring character in season one and a main character from season two onwards. Lyonne received an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series|Emmy nomination]] in 2014 for the role.

==Casting and background==
Natasha Lyonne had intended to audition for the part of [[Lorna Morello]] but, according to Lyonne, "they wouldn’t let me [audition for Morello], because they already liked me for Nicky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/06/23/orange-is-the-new-black-interviews|title=27 things we learned at the ''Orange Is the New Black'' press day|last=Busis|first=Hillary|date=June 23, 2014|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yael Stone]], who had auditioned for the role of Nichols, was cast as Morello.

Lyonne feels that she can relate closely to Nichols's storyline as she has had experience of drug addiction. She says, "believe me, there's no shortage of things for me to draw on when it comes to Nicky's backstory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/article/natasha-lyonne-orange-is-the-new-black-interview-emmy-nomination-season-3-spoilers|title=''OITNB''′s Natasha Lyonne Talks Emmys Jitters and Season 3 Spoilers: 'So Much Bloodshed'|last=Rayford Rubenstein|first=Janine|date=July 31, 2014|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scar that is visible on Nichols's chest during the series is a real scar from Lyonne's heart surgery in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/surprising-facts-about-orange-is-the-new-black#.hcPGoAM41|title=23 Surprising Facts About ''Orange Is The New Black''|last=Yapalater|first=Lauren|date=July 30, 2013|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orange Is the New Black'' is Lyonne's first time as a series regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/natasha-lyonne/|title=Natasha Lyonne, Locked Up|last=Brown|first=Emma|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
Nichols and Big Boo, attempt to sell their stash of heroin and they cooperate with correctional officer Joel Luschek, who finds a buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/06/orange-is-the-new-black-review-mothers-daybed-bugs.html|title=''Orange Is the New Black'' Review: “Mother’s Day”/“Bed Bugs and Beyond”|date=June 14, 2015|last=Amatangelo|first=Amy|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols then says that it has been stolen but, in reality, she has hidden it for her own use. Other inmates Leanne Taylor (played by [[Emma Myles]]) and Angie Rice (played by [[Julie Lake]]) find the heroin and start taking it. Luschek discovers this and confiscates the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/recap/orange-is-the-new-black-season-3-episode-3|title=Empathy Is a Boner Killer|date=June 11, 2015|last=Dornbush|first=Jonathon|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When assistant warden [[List_of_Orange_Is_the_New_Black_characters#Joseph_Salvatore_.22Joe.22_Caputo|Joe Caputo]] (played by [[Nick Sandow]]) discovers the heroin, Luschek blames Nichols and Nichols is sent to a maximum security prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/06/orange-is-the-new-black-review-empathy-is-a-boner.html|title=''Orange Is the New Black'' Review: “Empathy is a Boner Killer”/“Finger in the Dyke”|date=June 15, 2015|last=Amatangelo|first=Amy|work=Paste|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is Nichols's last appearance in the third season.&lt;ref name="Allen1"/&gt;

===Season 4===
In the midst of season four, Nichols can be seen in an episode as a maximum security inmate, along with Sophia Burset and Stella Carlin. Luschek repents of his actions against Nichols, and asks new inmate Judy King to use her connections to get Nichols out of maximum security. She returns to minimum security where she is welcomed with a big party. Her drug problem persists, however.

===Season 5===
During a prison riot, Nichols decides to take over the pharmacy with Lorna Morello. Later, while Soso is depressed and asking Nichols for drugs, Nichols confess that she has hopelessly fallen in love with "an incredible, insane, beautiful woman" who would never love her back. Morello overhears everything but does not comment. In a later episode, Nichols and Morello restart their sexual relationship, but Morello ends it a few hours after, saying that during their intercourse she realized she was pregnant. Nichols does not believe her and is heartbroken. Vause finds her crying in the shower. While Red is becoming paranoid because of the correctional officer (CO) Piscatella, Nichols decides to take care of her but is eventually abducted by the CO. She is kept in a room tied up with the rest of her prison "family". After they are able to escape, Nichols goes back to the pharmacy to see Morello and realizes that she is actually pregnant. She then calls Morello's husband to convince him to stay with her because "some people would give anything to be loved like that". While the police begins to raid the prison, she asks Morello to surrender and tell them that she is pregnant. Nichols then returns to Frieda's bunker and they all wait for the police to enter.

==Critical commentary==
Sarah Karlan of ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' praised the character's "impossibly quick wit" and "perfectly deadpan delivery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/for-anyone-slowly-falling-for-nicky-nichols-on-orange-is-the#.phv3A92vq|title=For Anyone Slowly Falling For Nicky Nichols On ''Orange Is The New Black''|last=Karlan|first=Sarah|date=June 12, 2014|work=BuzzFeed|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebekah Allen of ''[[SheWired]]'' said Lyonne is "wonderful" in the role, and called Nichols one of the best characters on the series.&lt;ref name="Allen1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shewired.com/television/2015/07/29/natasha-lyonne-opens-about-dreadful-nicky-nichols-development-orange-new-black|title=Natasha Lyonne Opens Up About that Dreadful Nicky Nichols Development in ''OITNB'' Season 3|last=Allen|first=Rebekah|date=July 29, 2015|work=[[SheWired]]|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MTV]]'s Crystal Bell called Nichols a "fan-favorite" and "our beloved smart mouth" and expressed disappointment at the character's departure in the third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2186915/orange-is-the-new-black-nicky/|title=Did ''Orange Is The New Black'' Really Say Goodbye To This Fan-Favorite Character For Good?|last=Bell|first=Crystal|date=June 15, 2015|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyonne received an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series|Emmy nomination]] for her role as Nichols. She lost out to fellow ''Orange Is the New Black'' actress [[Uzo Aduba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/25/showbiz/primetime-emmy-awards-winners-2014/|title=Primetime Emmy Awards 2014: The winners list|date=August 26, 2014|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ghannouchi was born outside [[El Hamma]], in the [[Gabès Governorate|governorate of Gabès]] in southern Tunisia. His village had no electricity or paved roads. His father was a poor farmer with children including Rached. His family worked in the fields every day, and had meat to eat only a few times a year.&lt;ref name=worth-2016-203-4&gt;{{cite book |last1=Worth |first1=Robert F. |title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS |date=2016 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |pages=203–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016 |ref=RFWRfO2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ground season had ended, the family wove baskets from palm leaves to supplement its income. Rached was able to attend a local branch of the traditional Arabic-language Zaytouna school thanks to financial help from an older brother.&lt;ref name=worth-2016-203-4 /&gt;

He received his certificate of attainment degree, equivalent to the [[Baccalauréat]], in 1962 from the [[University of Ez-Zitouna]] (Zaytouna). He entered the school of [[agriculture]] at [[Cairo University]] in 1964 but, following the expulsion of Tunisians from [[Egypt]], he left for [[Syria]]. He studied [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Damascus]], graduating in 1968.  Ghannouchi also spent some time in his 20s traveling and working in Europe as a grape picker and dish washer.&lt;ref name=worth-2016-207-8 /&gt;

==Islamic Tendency Movement==
In April 1981 Ghannouchi founded the Islamic Tendency Movement ({{lang-ar|حركة الاتجاه الإسلامي}} ''{{transl|ar|Ḥarakat al-Ittijāh al-Islāmī}}''). The Movement described itself as specifically rooted in [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] [[Islamism]], and called for a "reconstruction of economic life on a more equitable basis, the end of single-party politics and the acceptance of political pluralism and democracy."&lt;ref name="Kechichian-16-9-2011"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kechichian |first1=Joseph A. |title=A genuine Islamist democrat |url=http://gulfnews.com/culture/people/a-genuine-islamist-democrat-1.865958 |accessdate=18 October 2016 |agency=Gulf News |date=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of July, Ghannouchi and his followers were arrested, sentenced to eleven years in prison in [[Bizerte]], and were tortured. Both the religious and secular community, including numerous secular political organizations, rallied in his support.&lt;ref name="Linda G. Jones 1988"&gt;Linda G. Jones, "Portrait of Rashid Al-Ghannoushi" ''Middle East Report'', No. 153 (July–August 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
While in prison he translated a number of works and wrote on topics such as democracy, women's rights, and Palestine. He also wrote his most noted work, ''Al‐Hurriyat al‐'Ammah'' (Public Liberties).&lt;ref name="OSO-question"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rachid Ghannouchi: A Democrat Within Islamism.

He was released in 1984, but returned to prison in 1987 with a life sentence, then was again released in 1988. He moved to the [[United Kingdom]] as a political exile, where he lived for 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/middleeast/article3200426.ece|title=The exile close to winning first Arab Spring election {{!}} The Times|work=The Times|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feldman /&gt;

Ghannouchi continued to criticise [[Politics of Tunisia|Tunisian politics]] and the regime of President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]].&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite news |title=More Officials Quit in Tunisia Amid Protests |first1=David D. |last1=Kirkpatrick |first2=Kareem |last2=Fahim |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/world/africa/19tunis.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=More%20officials%20quit%20in%20tunisia&amp;st=cse |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunisian Revolution and after==

Following [[2010–2011 Tunisian uprising|popular unrest]] in which Ben Ali was ousted, Ghannouchi returned to Tunisia on 30 January 2011, after spending twenty two years exiled in [[London]],&lt;ref name="Asharq Al-Awsat"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aawsat.com/details.asp?section=4&amp;issueno=11751&amp;article=606016&amp;feature= |script-title=ar:راشد الغنوشي زعيم حركة النهضة يعود إلى تونس اليوم بعد 20 عاما في المنفى |publisher=[[Asharq Al-Awsat]] |date=30 January 2011 |language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with thousands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rached Ghannouchi de retour à Tunis après 20 ans d'exil : un accueil exceptionnel |url=http://www.leaders.com.tn/article/3880-rached-ghannouchi-de-retour-a-tunis-apres-20-ans-d-exil-un-accueil-exceptionnel |accessdate=30 January 2011 |newspaper=Leaders |date=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of people welcoming him.

His party won  37.04% of the vote (more than the next four biggest vote-getting parties combined)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerges |first=Fawaz |title=The Many Voices of Political Islam |journal=The Majalla |date=June 2012 |volume=1573 |pages=14–18 |url=http://www.majalla.com/eng/print-edition-pdf/al-majalla-issue-1573.pdf |accessdate=4 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730045231/http://www.majalla.com/eng/print-edition-pdf/al-majalla-issue-1573.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2011 [[Tunisian Constituent Assembly election, 2011|Tunisian Constituent Assembly election]].
Ghannouchi did not take a government position. Ennahdha's secretary-general [[Hamadi Jebali]] became [[Prime Minister of Tunisia|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Houda |last=Mzioudet |title=Ennahdha's Jebali Appointed as Tunisian Prime Minister |newspaper=Tunisia Live |date=14 December 2011 |url=http://www.tunisia-live.net/2011/12/14/ennahdas-jebali-appointed-as-tunisian-prime-minister/ |accessdate=21 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117044127/http://www.tunisia-live.net/2011/12/14/ennahdas-jebali-appointed-as-tunisian-prime-minister/ |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ennahda formed a government which led Tunisia through the challenging and tumultuous aftermath of the [[Tunisian revolution|Jasmine revolution]]. The government during this period was characterized by greater transparency, lack of corruption, and consensus-building. In March 2012, Ennahda declared it would not support making sharia the main source of legislation in the new constitution, maintaining the secular nature of the state. Ennahda's stance on the issue was criticized by hardline Islamists, who wanted strict sharia, but was welcomed by secular parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tunisia's constitution will not be based on Sharia: Islamist party|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/27/203529.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government was criticized for mediocre economic performance, not stimulating the tourism industry, and poor relations with Tunisia's biggest trading partner France. In particular it was criticized for tolerating efforts at aggressive Islamisation by radical Islamists who were demanding Sharia law and denouncing gender inequality and restrictions on polygamy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islamism: What it Means for the Middle East and the World |last1=Osman |first1=Tarek |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2016 |accessdate=16 October 2016 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vKZ5CwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=islamism+tarek+osman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC5OWDiOLPAhXKdj4KHXsMBp0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=burgeoning%20&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom were responsible for the September 2012 ransacking and burning of the American embassy and school following the online publication of the trailer for a controversial anti-Islamic film, and the assassination of two leftist politicians [[Chokri Belaid]] (in February 2013) and [[Mohamed Brahmi]] (in July 2013). During this [[2013–14 Tunisian political crisis]] enraged secularists demanded the government step down or even a Sisi-style coup, while Ennahda militants defiantly opposed early elections, even booing Ghannouchi's calls for sacrifice for national unity.&lt;ref name=worth-199-204&gt;{{cite book |last1=Worth |first1=Robert F. |title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS |date=2016 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |pages=199–204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016 |ref=RFWRfO2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless Ghanouchi worked with secularist leader [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] to forge a compromise and on October 5 signed a "road map" whereby Ennahda would step down for a caretaker government after the new constitution was agreed upon and until new elections were held.&lt;ref name=worth-2016-206&gt;{{cite book |last1=Worth |first1=Robert F. |title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS |date=2016 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016 |ref=RFWRfO2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both leaders were heavily criticized by their party rank and file and Ghannouchi received agreement from the Ennahda shura council only by threatening to resign.&lt;ref name=worth-2016-205-207&gt;{{cite book |last1=Worth |first1=Robert F. |title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS |date=2016 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |pages=205, 207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016 |ref=RFWRfO2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, after the new Tunisian Constitution was approved, Ennahdha peacefully quit government and handed power to a technocratic government led by [[Mehdi Jomaa]]. Ennahda placed second in the [[Tunisian parliamentary election, 2014|October 2014 parliamentary election]] with 27.79% of the popular vote and formed a coalition government with the larger secularist party [[Nidaa Tounes]] despite rank-and-file opposition.&lt;ref name=worth-2016-218 /&gt; Ennahda did not put forth a presidential candidate for the November 2014 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/07/us-tunisia-election-ennahda-idUSKBN0H20LJ20140907 |title=Tunisia's main Islamist party to stay out of presidential election |publisher=Reuters |date=8 September 2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanouchi "hinted broadly" that he personally supported Beji Caid Essebsi&lt;ref name=worth-2016-219&gt;{{cite book |last1=Worth |first1=Robert F. |title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS |date=2016 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |pages=219 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016 |ref=RFWRfO2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who won with over 55% of the vote).

Ghannouchi argued for these accommodating measures against more purist party members on the grounds that the country was still too fragile, and the economy too much in need of reform, for Ennahda to be in opposition.&lt;ref name=worth-2016-218&gt;{{cite book |last1=Worth |first1=Robert F. |title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS |date=2016 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |pages=218 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016 |ref=RFWRfO2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ghannouchi also gave his support to a crackdown on jihadi indoctrination at radical mosques (over 60 civilians, mostly tourists, were [[List of terrorist incidents in Tunisia|killed]] in 2015 by jihadis, devastating Tunisia's tourist industry). Despite his Islamist background, he had always been "reviled" by jihadis, according to Robert Worth, and now appeared near "the top" of the jihadi "wanted list".&lt;ref name=worth-2016-220&gt;{{cite book |last1=Worth |first1=Robert F. |title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS |date=2016 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |pages=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016 |ref=RFWRfO2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Independent apology in 2012===
On 9 October 2012, [[The Independent]] published an apology on their website for suggesting, in a previous article, that the party Ghannouchi leads, Ennahdha (An Nahda) has been offered foreign funds. The apology stated: "we wish to make it clear that Mr Ghannouchi and his party have not accepted any donation from a foreign state in breach of Tunisian party funding laws.

===The Economist apology in 2011===
On 22 October 2011, [[The Economist]] published an apology on their website for previously publishing an article in which they attributed false statements to Ghannouchi. The article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2011/10/15/now-is-the-time|title=Now is the time|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Ghannouchi "opposes the country's liberal code of individual rights, the Code of Personal Status, and its prohibition of polygamy".  The article, also, claimed that Ghannouchi "has threatened to hang a prominent Tunisian feminist, Raja bin Salama, in Basij Square in Tunis, because she has called for the country's new laws to be based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights". The apology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2011/10/22/an-apology-to-rachid-ghannouchi|title=An apology to Rachid Ghannouchi|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "we accept that neither of these statements is true: Mr Ghannouchi has expressly said that he accepts the Code of Personal Status; and he never threatened to hang Ms bin Salama. We apologise to him unreservedly."

==Views and background==
Ghannouchi's willingness to compromise with secularists in Tunisia and his country's unique success in maintaining a democratic system following the Arab Spring has been credited by at least one observer ([[Robert F. Worth|Robert Worth]]) to his background. Unlike many Islamists, Ghannouchi "lived abroad for decades, reading widely in three languages", including Western thinkers [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He admired the courage of leftists who protested in the streets against the dictatorship, were arrested and tortured in prison, and became willing to work with them.&lt;ref name=worth-2016-207-8&gt;{{cite book |last1=Worth |first1=Robert F. |title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS |date=2016 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |pages=207–8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016 |ref=RFWRfO2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching the [[Islamic Salvation Front#General strike and arrests of leadership|initial victory of the Algerian Islamists]]—while exiled in London—collapse into the slaughter, mayhem and defeat of the [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]], left a deep impact.&lt;ref name=worth-2016-209&gt;{{cite book |last1=Worth |first1=Robert F. |title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS |date=2016 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |pages=209 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016 |ref=RFWRfO2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Azzam S.

In 2002, an unsympathetic Western source ([[Martin Kramer]]) described him as differing "from other Islamists" in his insistence "that Islam accepts multi-party democracy."&lt;ref name="Kramer-review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kramer |first1=Martin |title=Rachid Ghannouchi: A Democrat within Islamism |url=http://www.meforum.org/1492/rachid-ghannouchi-a-democrat-within-islamism |accessdate=18 October 2016 |volume=1 |issue=4 |journal=Middle East Quarterly |date=Fall 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rodney Glen King''' (April 2, 1965 – June 17, 2012) was an American taxi driver and victim of [[police brutality]] by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. On March 3, 1991, King was violently beaten by LAPD officers during his arrest for fleeing and evading on [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|California State Route 210]]. A civilian, George Holliday, filmed the incident from his nearby balcony and sent the footage to local news station [[KTLA]]. The footage clearly showed King being beaten repeatedly, and the incident was covered by news media around the world.

The four officers were tried on charges of use of excessive force; three were acquitted, the jury failed to reach a verdict on one charge for the fourth. Within hours of the acquittals, the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]] started, sparked by outrage among African Americans over the verdicts and longstanding social issues. The rioting lasted six days, during which 63 people were killed and 2,373 were injured; it ended only after the [[California Army National Guard]], the [[United States Army]], and the [[United States Marine Corps]] provided reinforcements to re-establish control.

The federal government prosecuted a separate civil rights case, obtaining grand jury indictments for violations by the four officers of King's civil rights. Their trial in a federal district court ended on April 16, 1993, with two of the officers being found guilty and sentenced to prison. The other two were acquitted of the charges. The city of Los Angeles awarded King $3.8 million in damages, in a separate suit. He struggled to start a business, but was not successful. He was found dead in his swimming pool two months after publishing his memoir.

==Early life==
King was born in [[Sacramento, California]] in 1965, the son of Ronald and Odessa King. He and his four siblings grew up in [[Altadena, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rodney King, L.A. police beating victim, dies|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/06/17/MN9T1P3FSA.DTL|accessdate=June 25, 2018|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=June 18, 2012|first=Washington|last=Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indy"&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: An icon, anxious and shy: Rodney King – As he awaits a new trial of the police who beat him, Rodney King has become a hero, a demon, and a gold mine. |author=Phil Reeves |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/profile-an-icon-anxious-and-shy-rodney-king--as-he-awaits-a-new-trial-of-the-police-who-beat-him-rodney-king-has-become-a-hero-a-demon-and-a-gold-mine-phil-reeves-reports-1474406.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=February 21, 1993 |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; King attended John Muir High School and often talked about being inspired by his social science teacher, Robert E.

On November 3, 1989, King robbed a store in [[Monterey Park, California]]. He threatened the Korean store owner with an iron bar, and hit him with a wooden pole. King stole two hundred [[United States dollar|dollars]] in cash during the robbery. He was caught, convicted, and sentenced to two years imprisonment. He was released on December 27, 1990, after serving one year in prison.&lt;ref name="Indy"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
While still a teenager, King fathered a daughter with his girlfriend Carmen Simpson. He later married Danetta Lyles (cousin to rapper [[Mack 10]]) and fathered a daughter. King and Lyles were eventually divorced. He later married and fathered a daughter with Crystal Waters. This marriage also ended in divorce.&lt;ref name="Tel o"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rodney King|url=http://www.buddytv.com/info/rodney-king-info.aspx|publisher=BuddyTV.com|accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1991 police incident in Los Angeles==
Early in the morning of March 3, 1991, King, with his friends Bryant Allen and Freddie Helms, were driving a 1987 [[Hyundai Excel]]/[[Mitsubishi Precis]] west on the [[Foothill Freeway]] (Interstate 210) in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. The three had spent the night watching basketball and drinking at a friend's house in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="jurist.law.pitt.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Linder, Douglas |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/trials24.htm |title=The Rodney King Beating Trials |publisher=[[JURIST]] |date=December 2001 |accessdate=December 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203041211/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/trials24.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., officers Tim and Melanie Singer, husband and wife members of the [[California Highway Patrol]], noticed King's car speeding on the freeway.

LAPD officers are taught to approach a suspect without his/her gun drawn, as there is a risk that any suspect may gain control of it if an officer gets too close.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon. ''Official Negligence'': p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Koon ordered the four other LAPD officers at the scene—Briseno, Powell, Solano, and Wind—to subdue and handcuff King using a technique called a "swarm." This involves multiple officers grabbing a suspect with empty hands, in order to quickly overcome potential resistance. As four officers attempted to restrain King, King resisted by standing to remove Officers Powell and Briseno from his back. The officers later testified that they believed King was under the influence of [[phencyclidine]] (PCP),&lt;ref&gt;Cannon.

===Holliday video===
[[Image:R King beating.png|thumb|Screenshot of King being beaten by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers]]  King was twice tasered by Koon. This marks the approximate start of the period that George Holliday videotaped. In the tape, King is seen on the ground. He rises and rushes toward Powell—as argued in court, either to attack Powell or to flee—and King and Powell collided in the rush.&lt;ref name="report 91, p6"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928173735/http://www.parc.info/client_files/Special%20Reports/1%20-%20Chistopher%20Commision.pdf Chapter 1: The Rodney King Beating]". ''Report of the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department'': p. 6. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Taser wire can be seen on King's body. Officer Powell strikes King with his [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]], and King is knocked to the ground. Powell strikes King several more times with his baton. Briseno moves in, attempting to stop Powell from striking again, and Powell stands back. Koon reportedly said, "That's enough." King rises again, to his knees; Powell and Wind are seen hitting King with their batons.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

}}
Koon acknowledged ordering the continued use of batons, directing Powell and Wind to strike King with "power strokes." According to Koon, Powell and Wind used "bursts of power strokes, then backed off." The officers beat King, who was already subdued. In the videotape, King continues to try to stand again. Koon orders the officers to "hit his joints, hit the wrists, hit his elbows, hit his knees, hit his ankles." Officers Wind, Briseno, and Powell attempted numerous baton strikes on King, resulting in some misses but with 33 blows hitting King, plus six kicks. The officers again "swarm" King, but this time a total of eight officers are involved in the swarm. King is placed in handcuffs and cordcuffs, restraining his arms and legs. King is dragged on his abdomen to the side of the road to await the arrival of emergency medical rescue.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Holliday shot a videotape of the incident on his camcorder from his apartment near the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Osborne Street in [[Lake View Terrace]]. Two days later, Holliday called LAPD headquarters at Parker Center to let the police department know that he had a videotape of the incident, but he could not find anyone who was interested in seeing the video. He went to [[KTLA]] television with his videotape. The station cut ten seconds of the video, before the image was in focus, that showed an extremely blurry shot of King charging at the officers. Later members of the jury said that this cut footage was essential to their decision to acquit the officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How citizen journalism has changed since George Holliday's Rodney King video |author=Steve Myers |url=http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/121687/how-citizen-journalism-has-changed-since-george-hollidays-rodney-king-video/ |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821042730/http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/121687/how-citizen-journalism-has-changed-since-george-hollidays-rodney-king-video/ |archivedate=August 21, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The footage as a whole became an instant media sensation.

=== Aftermath ===
King was taken to Pacifica Hospital after his arrest, where he was found to have suffered a fractured [[zygomatic arch|facial bone]], a broken right ankle, and multiple bruises and lacerations.&lt;ref name="Cannon. p. 205"&gt;Cannon. ''Official Negligence'': p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; In a negligence claim filed with the city, King alleged he had suffered "11 skull fractures, permanent brain damage, broken [bones and teeth], kidney failure [and] emotional and physical trauma".&lt;ref name="report 91, p8"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928173735/http://www.parc.info/client_files/Special%20Reports/1%20-%20Chistopher%20Commision.pdf Chapter 1: The Rodney King Beating]".

District Attorney Ira Reiner believed there was insufficient evidence for prosecution.&lt;ref name="Cannon. p. 205"/&gt; His successor [[Gil Garcetti]] thought that by December 1992, too much time had passed to charge King with evading arrest; he also noted that the statute of limitations on drunk driving had passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charges Against King Belatedly Dropped |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-23/local/me-2180_1_rodney-king-incident |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=December 23, 1992 |accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 1992, the seventh day of [[Deliberation|jury deliberations]], the jury acquitted all four officers of assault and acquitted three of the four of using excessive force.

Riots" on October 4, 2006 10&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], approximately 27 minutes into the hour (including commercial breaks).&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, the prosecution suggested that the jurors may have acquitted the officers because of becoming desensitized to the violence of the beating, as the defense played the videotape repeatedly in slow motion, breaking it down until its emotional impact was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, L. (2002). ''Official Negligence : How Rodney King and the Riots Changed Los Angeles and the LAPD''. Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-8133-3725-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the Simi Valley courthouse where the acquittals were delivered, county sheriff's deputies protected Stacey Koon from angry protesters on the way to his car. Movie director [[John Singleton]], who was in the crowd at the courthouse, predicted, "By having this verdict, what these people done, they lit the fuse to a bomb."&lt;ref&gt;CNN Documentary ''Race + Rage: The Beating of Rodney King'', aired originally on March 5, 2011; approximately 14 minutes into the hour (not including commercial breaks).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christopher Commission ===
Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] created the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department, also known as the [[Christopher Commission]], in April 1991. Led by attorney [[Warren Christopher]], it was created to conduct "a full and fair examination of the structure and operation of the LAPD," including its recruitment and training practices, internal disciplinary system, and citizen complaint system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Shielded from Justice: Los Angeles: The Christopher Commission Report|url = https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/police/uspo73.htm|website = www.hrw.org|accessdate = June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Los Angeles riots and the aftermath==
{{Main|1992 Los Angeles riots}}
Though few people at first considered race an important factor in the case, including Rodney King's attorney, Steven Lerman, the Holliday videotape was at the time stirring deep resentment among African Americans in Los Angeles, as well as other major cities in the United States, where they had often complained of police abuse against their communities. The officers' jury consisted of Ventura County residents: ten [[White American|white]], one [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]], one [[Asian American|Asian]]. Lead prosecutor Terry White was [[African American]]. On April 29, 1992, the jury acquitted three of the officers but [[hung jury|could not agree]] on one of the charges against Powell.&lt;ref name="jurist.law.pitt.edu" /&gt;

[[Mayor of Los Angeles|Los Angeles Mayor]] [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] said, "The jury's verdict will not blind us to what we saw on that videotape. The men who beat Rodney King do not deserve to wear the uniform of the LAPD."&lt;ref&gt;Mydans, Seth (April 30, 1992). The videotape was largely thought to have helped inflame the riot.

Bush]] said, "Viewed from outside the trial, it was hard to understand how the verdict could possibly square with the video. Those civil rights leaders with whom I met were stunned. And so was I and so was Barbara and so were my kids."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=John|title=Media Matters: Race and Gender in U.S. Politics (paperback)|page=188|publisher=Univ Of Minnesota Press; Revised edition |quote=Bush on LA, extracts from his speech to the nation|date=March 1, 1996| isbn=9780816624638|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours of the acquittals, the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] began, lasting six days. African-Americans were outraged by the verdicts and began rioting in the streets along with the Latino communities. By the time law enforcement, the [[California Army National Guard]], the [[United States Army]], and the [[United States Marine Corps]] restored order, the riots had resulted in 63 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. Smaller riots occurred in other U.S. cities such as [[San Francisco]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] in neighboring [[Nevada]], [[Seattle]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], and as far east as [[Atlanta]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[New York City]]. A minor riot erupted on [[Yonge Street]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada as a result of the acquittals.

During the riots, on May 1, 1992,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; King made a television appearance in which he said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I just want to say – you know – can we all get along? Can we, can we get along? Can we stop making it horrible for the older people and the kids? And... I mean we've got enough smog in Los Angeles let alone to deal with setting these fires and things&amp;nbsp;... it's just not right – it's not right. And it's not going to change anything. We'll get our justice; they've won the battle, but they haven't won the war. We'll get our day in court and that's all we want. And, just, uh, I love – I'm neutral, I love every – I love people of color. I'm not like they're making me out to be. We've got to quit – we've got to quit; I mean after-all, I could understand the first – upset for the first two hours after the verdict, but to go on, to keep going on like this and to see the security guard shot on the ground – it's just not right; it's just not right, because those people will never go home to their families again. And uh, I mean please, we can, we can get along here. We all can get along – we just gotta, we gotta. I mean, we're all stuck here for a while, let's, you know let's try to work it out, let's try to beat it, you know, let's try to work it out.

The widely quoted line has been often paraphrased as, "Can we all ''just'' get along?" or "''Can't'' we all just get along?"

==Federal trial of officers==
After the acquittals and the riots, the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) sought indictments of the police officers for violations of King's civil rights. On May 7, federal prosecutors began presenting evidence to the federal grand jury in Los Angeles. On August 4, the grand jury returned indictments against the three officers for "willfully and intentionally using unreasonable force" and against Sergeant Koon for "willfully permitting and failing to take action to stop the unlawful assault" on King. Based on these indictments, a trial of the four officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California began on February 25, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Linder|first=Doug|title=The Trials of Los Angeles Police Officers' in Connection with the Beating of Rodney King|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/lapdaccount.html|publisher=law2.umkc.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2014|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal trial focused more on the incident.{{clarify|reason=Meaning?|date=September 2018}} On March 9 of the 1993 trial, King took the witness stand and described to the jury the events as he remembered them.&lt;ref name=March9&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/us/rodney-king-testifies-on-beating-i-was-just-trying-to-stay-alive.html | title=Rodney King Testifies on Beating: 'I Was Just Trying to Stay Alive' | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 10, 2003 | last=Mydans | first=Seth | accessdate=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury found Officer [[Laurence Powell]] and Sergeant [[Stacey Koon]] guilty, and they were subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison. Timothy Wind and Theodore Briseno were acquitted of all charges.&lt;ref name="jurist.law.pitt.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1664.ZS.html#FN1 ''Koon v. United States'' (94–1664), 518 U.S. 81 (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the three-hour sentencing hearing U.S. District Judge John Davies, accepted much of the defense version of the beating. He strongly criticized King, who he said provoked the officers' initial actions.  Davies said that only the final six or so baton blows by Powell were unlawful. The first 55 seconds of the videotaped portion of the incident, during which the vast majority of the blows were delivered, was within the law because the officers were attempting to subdue a suspect who was resisting efforts to take him into custody.&lt;ref name="LAT19930805"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-koon-powell-get-two-and-half-years-in-prison-19930805-story.html |title=Koon, Powell get two and half years in prison |last=Newton |first=Jim |date=August 5, 1993 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies found that King's provocative behavior began with his "remarkable consumption of alcoholic beverage" and continued through a high-speed chase, refusal to submit to police orders, and an aggressive charge toward Powell. Davies made several findings in support of the officers' version of events.&lt;ref name="LAT19930805"/&gt; He concluded that Officer Powell never intentionally struck King in the head, and "Powell's baton blow that broke King's leg was not illegal because King was still resisting and rolling around on the ground, and breaking bones in resistant suspects is permissible under police policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.policeone.com/less-lethal/articles/3419781-Rodney-King-20-years-later/ |title=Rodney King, 20 years later |last=Meyer |first=Greg |date=March 10, 2011 |website=PoliceOne |language=en |access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitigation cited by the judge in determining the length of the prison sentence included the suffering the officers had undergone because of the extensive publicity their case had received, high legal bills that were still unpaid, the impending loss of their careers as police officers, their higher risks of abuse while in prison, and their undergoing two trials. The judge acknowledged that the two trials did not legally constitute double jeopardy, but nonetheless raised "the specter of unfairness".&lt;ref name="LAT19930805"/&gt;

These mitigations were critical to the validity of the sentences imposed, because federal sentencing guidelines called for much longer prison terms in the range of 70 to 87 months. The low sentences were controversial, and were appealed by the prosecution. In a 1994 ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected all the grounds cited by Judge Davies and extended the terms. The case was appealed by the defense to the U.S. Supreme Court. Both Koon and Powell were released from prison while they appealed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, having served their original 30-month sentences with time off for good behavior. On June 14, 1996, the high court reversed the lower court in a ruling, unanimous in its most important aspects, which gave a strong endorsement to judicial discretion, even under sentencing guidelines intended to produce uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = THE SUPREME COURT: SENTENCING;Court Upholds Sentence in King Case|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/us/the-supreme-court-sentencing-court-upholds-sentence-in-king-case.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = June 14, 1996|access-date = October 5, 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Linda|last = Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was subject to further arrests and convictions for driving violations after the 1991 incident, as he struggled with alcohol and drug addiction.

The BBC quoted King commenting on his legacy. "Some people feel like I'm some kind of hero. Others hate me. They say I deserved it.

'''Runa Sandvik''' is a computer security expert, known as a proponent of strong encryption.&lt;ref name=Nytimes2018-07-24/&gt;  She was hired as ''[[The New York Times]]'' senior director of information security in March 2016.  She is a proponent of a smartphone messaging application known as "[[Signal (app)|Signal]]".

==Personal life==

She acquired her first computer when she was fifteen years old.&lt;ref name=Nytimes2018-07-24/&gt;

She studied [[computer science]] at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=JournalistenRunaSandvikNYT/&gt;

In 2014 Sandvik married [[Michael Auger]], and the pair made their home in [[Washington DC]].&lt;ref name=AftenPostenRifle/&gt;

==Tor anonymity network==

Sandvik was an early developer of the [[Tor anonymity network]], a cooperative facility that helps individuals obfuscate the [[internet protocol]] they are using to access the [[internet]].&lt;ref name=corporatelearninghubRunaSandvik/&gt;

==Freedom of the Press Foundation==

Sandvik is a technical advisor to the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]].&lt;ref name=corporatelearninghubRunaSandvik/&gt;

==Black Hat Europe==

She serves on the review board of [[Black Hat Europe]].&lt;ref name=corporatelearninghubRunaSandvik/&gt;

==Interviewed Edward Snowden==

Sandvik interviewed [[Edward Snowden]] in May 2014.&lt;ref name=JournalistenRunaSandvikNYT/&gt;

==Freedom of Information Access requests==
[[File:33 DHS photos of Runa Sandvik.jpeg|thumb|33 [[US Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] photos, acquired through FOIA]]

In February 2015 Sandvik documented her efforts to retrieve information about herself through [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] reqests.&lt;ref name=Medium2015-02-26/&gt;.

==Demonstrated how smart rifles with remote access can be remotely hacked==
[[File:Precision Guided Firearm.jpg|thumb|250px|Sandvik and Auger demonstrated that the aiming computer of theTrackingPoint XS1 [[precision guided firearm]] was vulnerable to third party hacking.]]
Sandvik, and her husband, Auger, demonstrated  how smart rifles with remote access can be remotely hacked.&lt;ref name=Motherboard2017-03-27/&gt;  The $13,000 [[TrackingPoint]] [[sniper rifle]] is equipped with an embedded linux computer.&lt;ref name=Wired2017-07-29/&gt;  According to ''[[Wired magazine]]'', when used according to its specifications, the aiming computer can enable a novice to hit remote targets that would otherwise require a skilled marksman.  However the manufacturers designed the aiming computer with [[WiFi]] capabilities, so the shooter could upload video of their shots.  Sandvik and Auger found they could initiate a [[Unix shell command line interpreter]], and use it to alter parameters the aiming computer relies on, so that it will always miss its targets.  They found that a knowledgeable hacker could use the shell to acquire [[root access]].  Acquiring root access allowed an interloper to erase all the aiming computer's software -- ''"[[Brick (electronics)|bricking]]"'' the aiming computer.

==Initiatives at the New York Times==

Sandvik led efforts to make ''The New York Times'' a [[Tor Onion]] service, allowing ''Times'' employees and readers to access the newspaper's site in ways that impede intrusive government monitoring.&lt;ref name=Nytimes2017-10-27/&gt;

'''Savukku''' ({{lang-en|[[Whip]]}}) is an [[Anonymous blogging|anonymous]], [[non-profit]], [[whistle blowing]] website. The website has been called the Tamil's [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref name=Ibnlive/&gt; The site publishes articles in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[English language|English]]. It is known for leaking sensational [[2G spectrum case]] taped conversation and publishing articles on corrupt government employees, politicians, judges, journalists and socio-political affairs. It is believed to be run by Savukku Shankar alias Achimuthu Shankar, a former lower division clerk in the [[Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (Tamil Nadu)|Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-corruption]]. On 28 February 2014, the website was blocked on Madras High Court orders after a [[Writ#Indian law|writ]] for defamation was filed by a [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]] employee, Mahalakshmi. In a different matter, Shankar was charged under Sections 66, 70 and 72 of the Information Technology Act, alleged to have leaked the conversation between former Chief Secretary to Government and former Director of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption. He was acquitted on 24 February 2017.

==Overview==
The website publishes articles anonymously, they say, about corrupt government employees, politicians, judges and journalists. It was started in September 2010. It does not give any information about the owner(s) or the publisher(s) of posts on website, but is said to have run by Achimuthu Shankar, a former lower division clerk in the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-corruption.&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; In 2008, Shankar allegedly leaked the transcript of a taped conversation between S. K. Upadhyay, then director of DVAC, and L. K. Tripathi, then chief secretary of the state to the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'' English daily newspaper. He was found guilty and arrested and was subjected to the third-degree torture and was forced to swear against some officers. After being released on bail, he started collecting information through [[Right to information act]], and later made a blog post to make public the information he has gathered. It allegedly led to the second arrest of Shankar, but on charges of ''road rage''. Thereafter he converted his blog into a website called, ''Savukku'' to expose corruption.

The first blog post was published anonymously on the website in September 2010 and it presently has around 960 posts since then including the [[2G spectrum case|2G]] taped conversation.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Achimuthu Sankar: A loose canon or a homegrown Assange?|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/achimuthu-sankar-a-loose-canon-or-a-homegrown-assange-114020700282_1.html|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IndiaToday1/&gt;

In 2010-2011, when [[Aam Aadmi Party]] leader and senior advocate [[Prashant Bhushan]] released the tapes of alleged conversation between [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] [[Rajya Sabha]] member [[Kanimozhi]] and the then [[Tamil Nadu]] police chief of intelligence, Jaffar Sait, it was said to have made public by the website three days earlier.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IndiaToday1 /&gt;

On 1 February 2014, the website had publicly posted four tapes&lt;ref name=Ibnlive /&gt; exposing the conversation between Kanimozhi and former additional director general of police Jaffer Sait and between Jaffer Sait and Sharad Kumar Reddy, a former director of [[Kalaignar TV]] owned by [[Karunanidhi]].&lt;ref name=IndiaToday&gt;{{cite web|author1=R Ramasubramanian|title=Is Kanimozhi's illness connected to second set of 2G tapes?|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kanimozhis-illness-connected-to-second-set-of-2g-tapes/1/341445.html|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authenticity of the taped conversation has not yet been challenged by either Kanimozhi or Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party.&lt;ref name=IndiaToday2/&gt;

==Block==
Mahalakshmi, an advocate and Sun TV newsreader had lodged a defamation case against the website for writing about her personal life, that she claimed have degraded her reputation. She later filed a writ petition in the [[Madras High Court]] citing inactivity of the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blogger Held for Woman Harassment |url=http://m.newindianexpress.com/chennai/259225|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2014, the Madras High Court ordered the Joint Secretary, Cyber Law Division of Union Department of Information Technology to block the website within ten days and called other affected individuals to lodge separate police cases, on hearing the writ petition filed by Mahalakshmi.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=HC directs cyber law division to block Savukku website|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-directs-cyber-law-division-to-block-savukku-website/article5737265.ece|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|title=Ban 'vituperative' Tamil website Savukku, orders Madras high court|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Ban-vituperative-Tamil-website-Savukku-orders-Madras-high-court/articleshow/31184839.cms|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HC orders immediate ban of Tamil website|url=http://www.sify.com/news/hc-orders-immediate-ban-of-tamil-website-news-national-odbaaebjiiisi.html|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court said that,

On 2 March 2014, following the court orders to block the website, many proxies were created to evade the block.&lt;ref name=IndiaToday1&gt;{{cite web|title=Proxies pop up after HC shuts down Savukku website|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/proxies-pop-up-after-hc-shuts-down-savukku-website/1/346416.html|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website continued to host mirrors of the site ''Savukku'', this time naming the Judge of the Madras High Court who is hearing the case.&lt;ref name=toi1&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Proxies-pop-up-after-Madras-high-court-orders-blocking-of-Savukku-website/articleshow/31258248.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achimuthu Shankar==
Achimuthu Shankar is a former lower division clerk in the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-corruption, which he joined in 1991. In 2008, he allegedly made public sensational information which included taped conversation between S. K. Upadhyay, then Director of Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-corruption, and L. K. Tripathi, then Chief Secretary, through the [[Deccan Chronicle]] English daily newspaper.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt; Following the leak of sensitive information in public, the then Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government of the Tamil Nadu state appointed a commission headed by Judge P. Shanmugam to probe the leak. Shankar was found guilty by the commission of inquiry. However, Shankar denied the allegations and said, ''charges were false and he was contesting them in courts''. He also said that, he was made to face the [[Third degree (interrogation)|third degree torture]] and was forced to bear witness against some officials. He was later released on bail.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;

In mid-2010, He published a blog post of information collected through the [[Right to information act]] and he was arrested on the charges of road rage next day. He said, "''The next day I was arrested on some false charges of road rage. I was expecting them to [arrest me]. They did not disappoint''".&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ibnlive&gt;{{cite web|title=Court blocks Tamil 'Assange' Shankar's website savukku.net|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/court-blocks-tamil-assange-shankars-website-savukkunet/454867-62-128.html|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later upgraded his blog into a website after receiving encouragement by readers.&lt;ref name=Ibnlive/&gt; In 2011, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government lost the polls to form the government. Shankar opined, even though the new government, many stuffs related to social welfare still do not reach to public.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt; He said, 

{{quote|Even within media there is a lot of corruption. Who is going to write about it? I will.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;}}

Shankar is an admirer of [[V. Prabhakaran]], chief of [[LTTE]]. The website had a picture of V. Prabhakaran on one side and a picture of a cowboy with a whip on the other side of the header.&lt;ref name=Ibnlive/&gt; He continued to publish articles along with contesting the suspension of him from Department of Vigilance and Anti-corruption. He is called the Tamil's [[Julian Assange]].&lt;ref name=rediff&gt;{{cite web|title='Savukku' Shankar: Is he India's Julian Assange?|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/savukku-shankar-is-he-indias-julian-assange/20140210.htm|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;

The website was the first to release the 2G tapes ahead of Prasant Bushan.   An audio of conversation between, Kalaignar TV MD, Sharad Kumar and former TN Intelligence Chief Jaffer Sait IPS &lt;ref&gt;url=https://soundcloud.com/savukku/jaffer-sait-and-sharad-kumar&lt;/ref&gt;

The website was the first to expose the arithmetical errors in the judgment of Justice CR Kumarasamy, acquitting Selvi Jayalalitha, CM of Tamil Nadu in the month of May 2015 &lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.savukkuonline.com/11643/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests==
On 31 January 2014, A [[Puducherry]]-based web designer Murugaiyan was arrested by the [[Internet police#India|Cyber Crime Police]] of [[Chennai]] for designing the website.&lt;ref name=toi1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blog designer arrested for defamation|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Blog-designer-arrested-for-defamation/articleshow/29677568.cms|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 21 days of imprisonment, Murugaiyan was released on bail by the Madras High Court.&lt;ref name=IndiaToday/&gt;

On 24 July 2014, Following the Madras High Court orders, Central Crime Branch arrested Pothi Kalimuthu on charge of hosting the website. He allegedly did own the website domain located in France and maintained a server located in Singapore for the website. The CCB officers had to make a request to the France Telecom through the [[Department of Telecommunications]] to reveal the address of the owner of the website domain.&lt;ref name="newindianexpress.com"&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/Techie-in-Trouble-for-Aiding-Blogger-over-Savukku/2014/07/25/article2347486.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conversation, Achimuthu Shankar said to [[Indian Express]] English daily newspaper that, he met Kalimuthu online. Kalimuthu offered his help with making of new website after the original website was blocked on court orders and refused to take money for hosting the website.&lt;ref name="newindianexpress.com"/&gt;

==Protest==
Professor A. Marx, a human rights activist said that, one may not necessarily agree with the contents posted by the website but the blocking the website is unacceptable. The affected individuals are free to take legal action separately.&lt;ref name=IndiaToday2&gt;{{cite web|title=Activists and lawyers fume over Madras High court order to shut down savukku.net|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/madras-high-court-order-to-shut-down-tamil-website-savukku.net-creates-furore-among-rights-activists/1/346708.html|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P. Sundarajan, a lawyer opined that, ''this is most unfortunate'', and the particular Judge should refrain himself from hearing the case because he was also written about by the website and ''this order is nothing but a mockery of justice''.&lt;ref name=IndiaToday2/&gt;

''Citizens for Freedom of Expression'', an organisation comprising senior advocates and activists said that they will prosecute in the case on behalf of the website and said that, ''the court order is a serious threat to freedom of expression''.&lt;ref name=IndiaToday2/&gt;

A former BBC Tamil employee T.N. Gopalan filed a [[Public interest litigation|PIL]] in the Madras High Court, requesting the court to resist government from blocking the website except in the case described in the ''Information Technology Rules, 2009''. Gopalan said that, he was not expecting the block on website which has discovered several scams and investigates and publishes information in public welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madras High Court sends notice to Centre on blocking website|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140314/nation-current-affairs/article/madras-high-court-sends-notice-centre-blocking-website|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HC issues notice to Centre on PIL against blocking website|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/tamil-nadu/hc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pil-against-blocking-website_917879.html|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Anbazhgan, president of ''Chennai Union of Journalists'' said that the union believes that the complaint filed by Mahalakhsmi is not accurate and is related to the ownership of 2G tapes by Shankar and a representative from the union has met the chief minister [[J. Jayalalitha]], to provide relief to Shankar.&lt;ref name=BS/&gt;

== Acquittal ==
Savukku Shankar was acquitted by the XVII Additional Sessions Court Chennai on 24 February 2017. Shankar was charged under Sections 66, 70 and 72 of the Information Technology Act and was alleged to have leaked the conversation between former Chief Secretary to Government and former Director of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/250217/phone-tapping-case-savukku-shankar-acquitted.html|title=Phone tapping case: Savukku Shankar acquitted|date=2017-02-25|newspaper=www.deccanchronicle.com/|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3990">A '''spokestoon''' is an established [[cartoon character]] who is hired to endorse a product. It should not be equated with a cartoon character invented specifically to give identity to a product, such as the [[Michelin Man]], Speedy [[Alka-Seltzer]] or the [[Pillsbury Doughboy]]. For these and more, see [[List of advertising characters]].

When the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]], well-known celebrities already highly placed in American popular culture, such as [[Donald Duck]] and [[Bugs Bunny]], joined the war effort, donating their highly visible images   for patriotic and informative cartoons. [[Bambi]], loaned by [[Walt Disney]] for one year (1943) to the [[US Forest Service]],  was the precursor of the purposely-created [[Smokey Bear|Smokey]].

Toons have also lent their celebrity to individual events, such as [[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]] for [[Earth Day]] in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2011/04/we-have-met-enemy-and-he-is-us.html This Day in Quotes 04-2011&lt;/ref&gt; or [[The Smurfs]] to [[UNICEF]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/10/08/wsmurf08.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2005/10/08/ixhome.html |title=Latest News, Breaking News and Current News from the UK and World |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, many high-profile celebrity [[cartoon character|toon]]s have turned their skills to corporate product placement.  Though [[fast food]] franchises have used gimmicks to tie-in temporarily with current releases of [[animation|animated feature]]s since the 1950s, a few toons have become more permanently associated with a product or service offered by [[corporate culture]] and may be considered genuine spokestoons.

Early recorded usages of "spokestoon", in newspaper articles of October 1995 related to the Disney Corporation's use of characters from ''[[The Lion King]]'' to promote good nutrition in children,&lt;ref&gt;[[Washington Post]]'' news story, "Disney School Lunch `Spokestoons' Leave Lawmaker With Sour Taste,"  October 9, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; were preceded by a March 25, 1995 feature in the Portland, Maine ''Press Herald'', noting "Buster Brown, the comic strip character who became the "spokestoon" for the children's shoe line."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/Search.aspx?q=spokestoon Highbeam.com: "Spokestoon"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among these spokestoons and the products they are identified with:

*[[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis the Menace]] for [[Dairy Queen]] until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dairyqueen.com/us-en/Company/FAQ/ Dairy Queen: FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tomás Terry.jpg|thumbnail|Marble statue of Tomás Terry in the lobby of the Terry theatre, [[Cienfuegos]], [[Cuba]]; sculptor [[Tommaso Solari]]]]

'''Tomás Terry y Adán''' (24 February 1808 in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] – 5 July 1886 in [[Paris]], [[France]])&lt;ref name="thomas140"&gt;Thomas, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Cuba]]n [[business magnate]].

==Family origins==
Of [[Irish people|Irish]] paternal descent, Terry was born in Caracas to [[Spain|Spanish]]-born José Antonio Terry y Mendoza, who had settled in Venezuela from [[Cádiz]], and wife Tomasa Adán y España. Following the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], the Terrys had fled their hometown of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] for [[Catholic]] countries such as Spain, [[France]] and the states of the [[Italian peninsula]]. The Spanish branch, established in Cádiz and [[El Puerto de Santa María]], became involved in trade with the [[Spanish West Indies|Indies]] and [[Sherry]] production quite successfully, as in less than a decade from their arrival many of its members were knighted in the [[Order of Santiago]] and Guillermo Terry was granted the title of Marquis of la Cañada by King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], on 8 September 1729.

==Life==
[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 92 - Terry y Dorticos 08.jpg|thumb|[[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]].]]
Terry initially became involved in the [[slave trade]] in Cuba, making his first $10,000 by buying sick slaves, nursing them back to health, and then reselling them healthy for a large profit.&lt;ref name="thomas137"&gt;Thomas, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He bought the ''Caracas'' [[sugar mill]] for $23,000, and upgraded it to be the first in Cuba to use [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="thomas137" /&gt; He went on to make a fortune through involvement in all aspects of the economy, from the sugar trade and slave trade to banking and imports, becoming the dominant businessman in [[Cienfuegos]] and earning the nickname the "Cuban [[Croesus]]".&lt;ref name="thomas140" /&gt; His fortune grew to be among the largest in the world, with a net worth of about $725,000 in 1851, $3,090,00 in 1860, $7,890,000 in 1870, $13,760,000 in 1880, and over $25,000,000 at his death in 1886, which occurred in Paris, where he was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] (division 92).&lt;ref name="thomas140" /&gt;

==Descendants==

While the surname [[Trump (surname)|Trump]] is found throughout Germany,&lt;!--originated in Bavaria?--&gt; it is recorded as the name of this family in Kallstadt since the 17th century, where many family members were [[winegrower]]s. Family members also still live in the family's ancestral region in [[southwestern Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ancestry-forefathers-kallstadt/|title=Donald Trump, Germany’s disfavored son|date=September 23, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several family members moved to and formed [[cadet branch]]es in the [[United States]] in the 19th century, among them Charlotte Louisa Trump's son Johann Heinrich Heinz, the father of [[Henry J. Heinz]], the founder of the [[Heinz]] company. A prominent branch of the family is the [[family of Donald Trump|line]] descended from [[Frederick Trump|Friedrich (Frederick) Trump]] (1869–1918) and his wife [[Elizabeth Christ Trump|Elisabeth]] (née Christ; 1880–1966), both natives of Kallstadt.

The German-American Trump family have been prominent in the fields of [[real estate]], [[entertainment]], and [[politics]]. Its most famous member is [[Donald Trump]], the [[List of Presidents of the United States|45th]] [[President of the United States]].

==History==
{{further|Trump (surname)}}
[[File:Kallstadt Hauptstrasse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kallstadt]], [[Germany]], the Trump family's ancestral home.]]
''[[Trump (surname)|Trump]]'' is a [[German surname]] derived from either the word for "[[:wikt:drum|drum]]" or for "[[:wikt:trumpet|trumpet]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bahlow: Deutsches Namenslexikon (1982). MHG ''trumpe, trumbe, trume'' could mean either "trumpet" or "drum". Lexer, '' Mittelhochdeutsches Handwörterbuch'' (1872–1878) records variants in ''d-'' (''drumme, drume, drumpe'') under the meaning "drum"&lt;/ref&gt; The name is on record in [[Kallstadt]] from the 17th century.&lt;ref name=gedbas /&gt;

[[Gwenda Blair]] suggests the family may be descended from an itinerant lawyer, Hanns Drumpf, who settled in Kallstadt in 1608 and whose descendants changed their name from Drumpf to Trump during the [[Thirty Years' War]] of [[17th century|the 1600s]].&lt;ref name="BlairBook"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJifCgAAQBAJ|title=The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate|date=2015|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=26–27|last1=Blair|first1=Gwenda|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Drumpf: A Funny Label, but Is It Fair|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/us/politics/donald-drumpf-a-funny-label-but-is-it-fair.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Victor, Daniel|date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/09/09/why-donald-trump-better-than-donald-drumpf/7ltKCyRasCa5TY2l1Tr4HP/story.html | title = Why Donald Trump trumps Donald Drumpf | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | accessdate = March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not in accordance with data provided by German genealogists.&lt;ref name=gedbas&gt;Verein für Computergenealogie: [https://gedbas.genealogy.net/person/ancestors/1178251533 Vorfahren von Friederich "Fritz" Trump]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803131244/https://gedbas.genealogy.net/person/ancestors/1178251533 |date=August 3, 2017 }}{{reliable source|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Kate Connolly, visiting Kallstadt, found several variations in spelling of the surname in the village archives (including Drumb, Tromb, Tromp, Trum, Trumpff, Dromb) but her article does not note "Drumpf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kallstadt, Germany: on the trail of 'the Donald' in the Trump ancestral home|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/29/kallstadt-germany-on-the-trail-of-the-donald-in-the-trump-ancestral-home|author=Kate Connolly|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no indications that other spellings of the name, including Trumpf, could be related to the Trumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/media-frenzy-over-donald-trumps-german-hometown-leaves-locals-unhappy/a-36339020|title=Media frenzy over Donald Trump's German hometown leaves locals unhappy|last=|first=|work=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Trump's American family branch {{anchor|Fortune}}===
{{Donald Trump series}}
[[Frederick Trump|Friedrich Trump]] was one of six children of a winegrower and a second cousin of [[Henry J. Heinz]], the founder of [[Heinz]]. Friedrich learned the profession of hairdresser. In 1885, at the age of 16, Friedrich emigrated from Kallstadt to the United States. As he did not yet serve the mandatory military duty of two years in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], this emigration was illegal. He [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] his name to ''Frederick'' in 1892 when he became a U.S. citizen.&lt;ref name=dad&gt;{{cite news |last=Blair |first=Gwenda |date=August 24, 2015 |title=The Man Who Made Trump Who He Is |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/the-man-who-made-trump-who-he-is-121647 |newspaper=[[Politico]] |access-date=July 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Alaska Gold Rush]], he amassed a fortune by opening restaurants and hotels for [[Prospecting#The gold rushes|gold seekers]] on their way to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swp.de/ulm/nachrichten/vermischtes/trumps-grossvater-war-ein-gluecksritter-aus-der-pfalz-13596007.html|title=Trump's Großvater war ein Glücksritter aus der Pfalz|website=Südwestpresse|date=9 August 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting home, Frederick fell in love with [[Elizabeth Christ Trump|Elisabeth Christ]] (1880–1966) and married her in 1902. She was also a native of Kallstadt, and born as the daughter of Philipp and Marie Christ. Philipp Christ was descended from Johannes Christ (1626–1688/9) of [[Flörsheim]], [[Hesse]].&lt;ref name=GEDBAS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gedbas.genealogy.net/person/ancestors/1178251526|title=GEDBAS: Vorfahren von Frederick Christ TRUMP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick and Mary were the parents of Elizabeth Trump (1904–1961), real estate developer [[Fred Trump]] (1905–1999) and physicist [[John G. Trump]] (1907–1985). Frederick sold his business and settled with Elizabeth in [[New York City]]. The family attempted to return to Bavaria, but this was not allowed because of the illegal emigration years earlier. Trump tried unsuccessfully to avoid the deportation by writing to [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/letter-donald-trumps-grandfather-wrote-pleading-to-stay-in-germany-surfaces-1479746306|title=Letter Donald Trump’s Grandfather Wrote Pleading to Stay in Germany Surfaces|website=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 21, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 1905 they boarded the ''[[SS Pennsylvania (1896)|Pennsylvania]]''.

President Donald Trump has married thrice, to [[Ivana Trump|Ivana Zelníčková]], [[Marla Maples]] and [[Melania Trump|Melania Knauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/09/who-is-melania-trump |title=The Model American |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |date=May 9, 2016 |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Trump has five children of which four are adult children from two previous marriages: [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald Jr.]], [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]], and [[Eric Trump]] with [[Ivana Trump]], and [[Tiffany Trump]] with [[Marla Maples]]. Trump has one son with Melania Trump, Barron, born on March 20, 2006. He is the first pre-teen son to live in the [[White House]] since [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]] arrived as an infant in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article113805053.html |title=Barron Trump: First young presidential son in the White House since 1963 |newspaper=[[Miami Herald]] |date=November 9, 2016 |first=Luisa |last=Yanez |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of his children with Ivana Trump were Executive Vice Presidents at [[The Trump Organization]] until Trump was elected President. Tiffany Trump is a recent college graduate of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], her father's [[alma mater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37924617 |title=US election: Trump children&amp;nbsp;– who is the new first family? |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=November 9, 2016 |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious affiliations==
The original Trump family in [[Germany]] are [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] members&lt;ref&gt;The small town of Kallstadt has only one religious building, the Central Lutheran church. See [[Kallstadt]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trumps: Three Generations That Built an Empire|date=2000|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743210799|pages=28–9|author1=[[Gwenda Blair]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Evangelical Church of the Palatinate]], although that region [[Electoral Palatinate|has been]] overwhelmingly [[Calvinist]]&lt;ref&gt;Note that local Calvinists are also members of the [[Evangelical Church of the Palatinate]], because it is a [[United church]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/ekd-evangelical-church-of-the-palatinate|title=EKD&amp;nbsp;— Evangelical Church of the Palatinate*&amp;nbsp;— World Council of Churches|website=www.oikoumene.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; since [[Frederick III, Elector Palatine]] introduced the Reformed faith in the mid 16th century.&lt;ref name="Blair28"&gt;Blair 2001, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the family's American branch, beginning with Mary Anne McLeod, tend to be [[Presbyterians]], [[Reformed Church in America|Dutch Reformed]] or adherents of other [[Calvinism|Reformed denominations]]. Donald Trump's parents belonged to the [[Reformed Church in America]], although he was [[Confirmation|confirmed]] at one of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] congregations himself.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Gwenda (2001). T''he Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate'' (1st ed.). Simon &amp; Schuster. pp. 28–29, 453; {{ISBN|9780743210799}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This matter of membership, like in case of many [[American Protestants]], does not play a big role since he attends services of both denominations and other ones that are part of the [[Reformed tradition]], and sometimes even some that subscribe to other Protestant branches (like the [[Episcopal Church (USA)]], an [[Anglican]] denomination).

In 2016, Donald Trump visited [[Bethesda-by-the-Sea]], an Episcopal Church, for a Christmas service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ijr.com/2016/12/763547-church-of-bethesda-by-the-sea-had-a-strong-reaction-to-donald-trumps-attendance-at-their-christmas-service/ |title=When the Trump Family Arrives to Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea The Crowd Rises For A Standing Ovation |newspaper=Independent Journal Review |date=December 2016 |access-date=March 17, 2017 |first=Jenni |last=Fink }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willie Phua''' (born 20 February 1928) is a Singaporean news cameramen who is known for his news and feature work covering poignant moments in Asian history over more than three decades. He is the subject of an Australian book published in 2010 called ''Capturing Asia'', by former foreign correspondent Bob Wurth. During his years working on risky assignments, Phua captured many images of wars and uprisings, economic 'miracles' and social upheavals, and the rise and fall of dictators.

Phua's camerawork was seen in Australia through the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], but his most important assignments were also shown around the world, sometimes on the [[BBC]]. He was one of the few TV cameramen to capture the "[[Tank Man]]" briefly holding back Chinese tanks near Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Wurth, Bob, ''Capturing Asia, An ABC cameraman's journey through momentous events and turbulent history'', ABC Books (HarperCollins) Sydney, 436 pp; Archives, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

In 1933 Phua came from [[Hainan]] island to Singapore with his mother, Phua Tan Tee, to join his father Phua Gee Wah, at the age of five to find a better life on the British isle. Hainan at that time was wracked by insurgency and the island swept by damaging typhoons.

Phua has clear recollections as a youth of the Japanese invasion of Singapore and the subsequent occupation of the island in 1942. On the morning of 8 December 1941, a bomb whistled down and crashed into a well near the servants' quarters in the League of Nations compound off River Valley Road where Phua lived. Japan's war had come to Singapore. To the dismay of his mother, Phua, aged 12, ran into the compound and picked up a piece of still warm metal, a fragment from one of the first Japanese bombs to fall on Singapore: "I was a little bit frightened but also excited. This was something exciting for a boy of my age. It was the first bombing attack on Singapore. We didn’t know the Japanese were coming here until these bombs fell."

Phua still remembers during the invasion of Singapore, watching the retreat of the British and Australians through the streets and of a young, bewildered Allied soldier sitting in the gutter, weeping. During the invasion, Phua's neighbourhood was shelled by Japanese artillery. He survived by crouching in a stinking storm drain in Killinery Road with his mother. One shell landed nearby killing a neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;'Capturing Asia', pp 1–3 &amp; 14–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Japanese occupation, the youth traded in cigarettes and was chased by Japanese soldiers when plying his trade: "I passed a Japanese soldier with his rifle over his shoulder. In the usual way, I asked if he had any tobacco. He looked at me and suddenly lifted his hand and took a big swing at my face. I ducked to avoid it. As I was turning around to run I saw him take the rifle from his shoulder. I ran for my life. I was terrified." Young Phua escaped and changed his trading habits. His mother made curry puffs and Phua sold them to Australian prisoners-of-war being marched through the streets.

Phua's mother obtained work as a cook in the kitchen of Japanese brothels in Cairnhill Road and the young Phua became her messenger. He recalls the sadness of some of the so-called "comfort women", the Koreans forced into prostitution  by the Japanese: "I did errands for the girls and would also buy things for the Japanese soldiers. The girls always seemed to want food. When the women had a Japanese client, especially if they had found a captain or a higher rank, they would say ‘I’m hungry’ and ask the soldiers to buy noodles for them." &lt;ref&gt;'Capturing Asia', pp 31–34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==

After the war Phua became a salesman at Singapore's Amateur Photo Shop, before becoming a freelance cameraman in the early 1960s with Singapore's RTV and BCINA (British Commonwealth International News Agency) which later became Visnews (now [[Reuters]] Television) and [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC).&lt;ref name = "willie1"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=McBeth |title= Through a lens, humbly | publisher= ''Straits Times'' |date = 1 March 2008|location= Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major assignments==
On the first day he signed up as a freelance cameraman for Radio Television Singapore (RTS) in 1963, [[Bukit Ho Swee fire|a large fire broke out at the Bukit Ho Swee]] squatter settlement in Singapore. Quickly on the scene, he captured the population fleeing the flames and his film was shown on RTS within a few hours. Four people were killed, 85 injured and 16,000 shanty houses were destroyed.

Phua went on to cover violent race riots in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and clashes in Borneo as Indonesia's President Sukarno pressed his [[Konfrontasi]], or Confrontation policy, with the newly established Malaysia.

In 1971 he filmed Pakistani Army killings during the birth of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|new state of Bangladesh]], then East Pakistan. Phua's then correspondent on the assignment, Australian Don Hook, remembers: "From the roof of the Inter-Continental Hotel in Dacca, Phua shot graphic film of horrific events in the street below. Soldiers had deliberately set fire to a newspaper building.  As newspaper staff ran from the blazing building there were bursts of automatic fire followed by screams and calls for help." Hook and Phua, along with other media people, were rounded up and forced to fly out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Don Hook &amp; Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 120–132&lt;/ref&gt;

Phua had seven lengthy assignments to cover the Vietnam war during 1971 and 1972. Once working with ABC correspondent Athol Meyer he was shelled at an American base in the central highlands. He was almost killed in the war in April 1972 when the South Vietnamese patrol boat he was aboard came under machine gun and rocket fire on the Saigon River. The patrol boat’s gunner was the first to be hit by Viet Cong fire and lost a leg. Then Phua's sound recordist was severely wounded in the leg.&lt;ref&gt;Visnews manager Juliette Suong &amp; Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 156–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phua covered the major riots in Manila which followed the assassination of opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno Aquino]] at Manila International Airport in August 1983. While filming the shooting of demonstrators by soldiers at Mendiola Bridge near the presidential palace that year, he was hit by a hail of rocks, but his injuries were not major.&lt;ref&gt;Scan Magazine, ABC, November 1983; Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 265–270; ABC Archives, film, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phua was known to many Asian leaders over the years. Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] would welcome him in New Delhi with the words: "Ah, my good Chinese friend." Says Phua: "Frankly, I think she was a nice person." Philippines foreign minister [[Carlos Romulo]] would single him out in a press pack and take him aside for a chat. ABC correspondent Peter Munckton recalled the Philippines' first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] doing the same.

The last time he saw Indira Gandhi, he filmed her prone on her death bed after being assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984.

Phua covered the funeral rites for Gandhi and the subsequent genocide against the Sikhs in New Delhi and elsewhere in India following the assassination. Rioting, burning of buildings and general lawlessness spread throughout New Delhi. The chief of Network Australia, the ABC's overseas TV service, Bruce Dover, was then a correspondent working alongside Phua: "There was a mob hauling the Sikhs from their homes and breaking their legs so that they couldn’t run away, then pouring oil over them to burn them alive. They were mostly Sikh men but also Sikh boys." Phua filmed the mayhem: "I remember seeing bodies everywhere. It was so gruesome. I only wanted to shoot a little bit—a few wide shots because you couldn’t show the close-ups and then I just wanted to get out of there...The odd policeman just stood around, doing nothing."

The ABC’s long-time New Delhi driver, Joseph Madan, who still works for the ABC in New Delhi, says Phua saved his life. Phua was surrounded by angry mobs on several occasions and repeatedly put his life at risk. He filmed truck loads of the bodies of Sikhs, including children, who had been burned to death in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;Former ABC correspondent Peter Munckton, head Network Australia Bruce Dover &amp; Joseph Madan in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 272–281. Also, ABC Archives, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many memorable images he captured were those of a lone bag-carrying demonstrator known as [[Tank Man]] confronting People's Liberation Army (PLA) tanks during Beijing's [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square uprising]] in 1989. The ABC's bureau chief in Asia at the time, [[Tony Eastley]], says he believes there were two television cameramen who captured the iconic television images of the 'tank man'; Phua and an American cameraman. CNN cameraman Jonathon Schaer told Phua's biographer that he also shot the famous tank scene from a balcony in the same hotel as Phua.

Phua as he filmed could not help acknowledge the bravery of the man holding up the tanks: Outside on the balcony I can see all the tanks coming up and this one single student standing in front of it. I think he is thinking, ‘Run me down if you can!’ And the first tank stopped exactly in front of him and there was some talking going on. And the next thing, he is climbing on top of the tank and he is speaking with the driver. Later on he climbed down and he’s still standing in front of the tank." &lt;ref&gt;Eastley &amp; Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 325–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phua felt his life had been blessed, as he had many close calls to death in his photojournalist career, according to friend and colleague, [[John McBeth]], writing in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper. Like one time a [[Vietcong]] ambush came upon him while filming a German documentary aboard a [[South Vietnam]]ese patrol boat in the Mekong Delta in 1971.&lt;ref name = "willie1"/&gt;

For everything else, McBeth said, Phua's formula for success in getting the right scoop lay in the planning on how to seize the best vantage point. For instance, he recalled, Phua spent much of his time getting access to a block of flats to get a good elevated shot of the prison to cover the news of the hanging of two Australian traffickers in Kuala Lumpur in 1986, for ABC. He also attributed calm and reasoning wit to getting things to work his way, especially towards handling brushes with authorities.

==Retirement from television==

Phua had worked as a cameraman throughout Asia for well over three decades when he was pressured into retirement by a back that could no longer carry heavy camera equipment. He realised the need to retire when climbing Japan's [[Mount Fuji]] in 1993 on an assignment with ABC Tokyo correspondent Philip Williams and sound recordist Jone Chang, as Williams recalls: "As you get higher, it gets harder ... we were going with Willie and a couple of others and we were all carrying gear. There were ten stations to go through. Willie finally said, ‘You’ll have to go on without me.' It was in fact the end of the road for him, I think, symbolically and in a very real sense. He left the ABC and the industry very shortly after that."

Phua was later invited to join the board of a Malaysian finance and entertainment company, DKH-George Town Holdings group, chaired by Tunku Abdullah.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Williams and Willie Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 363–365, 370–371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

In November 1996, Phua received the Honorary Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] for his services. The citation for Phua's award read:‘Mr Phua’s camera work has been responsible for Australians seeing all aspects of life in Asia, thus stimulating Australian interest in the region.’ The award was presented by New South Wales Governor [[Gordon Samuels]]. In 1993, Phua officially retired from his news-hunting days.&lt;ref&gt;John McBeth, Straits Times, Singapore, 1 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a foreword to Phua's biography in 2010, the managing director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, [[Mark Scott (businessman)|Mark Scott]], said Phua was long regarded as one of the finest news cameramen in Asia: "From 1963 on, so much of what Australians learnt and understood about Asia came to them through the lens of an unseen yet unforgettable Chinese-born cameraman called Willie Phua." &lt;ref&gt;Mark Scott foreword in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
* ''He taught us civility, diplomacy, a touch of humility and to accept that other people had to retain face.' In other words, the essentials for covering the region.''—Peter Munckton, ABC correspondent who covered the Vietnam War news.
* ''Here you had a gifted cinematographer with a keen eye for news, steeped in the history of his working environment and all its sensitivities, willingly moulding and protecting a string of young, ambitious Australians on their foreign assignments.''—Paul Lockyer, ABC correspondent.

'''Yan Huang Zisun''' ({{zh|c=炎黃子孫|l='''Descendants of Yan and Huang'''}}) is a term that represents the Chinese people and refers to an ethnocultural identity based on a common ancestry associated with a mythological origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yeo |first1=K.K. |title=Musing with Confucius and Paul: Toward a Chinese Christian theology |date=2008 |publisher=Cascade Books |isbn=9781556354885| page=407 | quote=Zhonghua (Chinese) or huaren (Chinese people) can be inclusive terms that refer to a common ancestry, traceable according to legend to the Yellow Emperor. Sometimes the Chinese are called the Yan-Huang zisun—descendants of the legendary Emperor Yan (a.k.a. Shen Nong, god of husbandry and first pharmacist) and Emperor Huang (whose burial place is in Huangling). [...] The legend of Emperors Yan-Huang can provide only an "imagined" identity for those who wish their genealogy to be traced to the royal gene of the emperors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yuan |first1=Haiwang |title=The magic lotus lantern and other tales from the Han Chinese |date=2006 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591582946 |page=10 | quote=The Chinese believe that they all came from the common ancestors Sanhuang Wudi [...] referring to themselves as Yanhuang zisun (descendants of Yandi and Huangdi).)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted that the term specifically refers to the [[Han Chinese|Han ethnic group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liang |first1=Yongjia |editor1-last=Zhao |editor1-first=Litao |title=China's social development and policy: Into the next stage? |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415642835 |page=195 |chapter=Developmentalism, secularism, nationalism and essentialism: current situation and challenges of the ethnic issue in China |quote=One problem with current Chinese nationalism is the discursive confusion with the terms Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese Nation), Yanhuang Zisun [...] However, a closer examination indicates that only the first justifies such a definition, while the other three can only be designated as the Han as most of the ethnic minorities do not share the legendary ancestors of the Yellow Emperor or the dragon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This term is connected to [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]] (炎帝) and [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] (黃帝), in which both figures are considered the legendary ancestors of the [[Huaxia]] people who themselves are ancestral to the Han people.&lt;ref name=wie02&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wienen |first1=Ingmar |title=Developing international business in the context of culture and ethics in transformation: The example of China |date=2002 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=9780820459851 |page=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
To this day, the Chinese still refer to themselves with this term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Law|first=Eugene|title=Intercontinental's best of China|year=2004|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-5085-0429-2|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUb_BQNkXdQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The derivation of the term is mentioned as ''Yan Huang Shizhou'' (炎黃世胄) in the [[National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China]].

[[Ma Ying-jeou]], President of the [[Republic of China]], has used this term to refer to all Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ko|first=Shu-ling|title=‘1992 consensus’ is basis of ties: Ma|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/10/29/2003487182|accessdate=25 October 2011|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=Oct 29, 2010|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ybyrai (Ibrahim) Altynsarin''' ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]: ''Ыбырай Алтынсарин''; [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Ибрай Алтынсарин'', 1841–1889) was a major figure in pre-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] history. He was the most prominent Kazakh educator of the late 19th century, during the period of [[Russia]]n colonization of and cultural influence in [[Kazakhstan]]. 

Altynsarin was born in the Araqaraghai region of [[Torghai]] [[oblast]] (now [[Kostanay Province]]), and in his early career was an inspector of Torghai schools. 

He is best known for introducing a [[Cyrillic]] alphabet for the [[Kazakh language]], and was a proponent of teaching in the Western style. However, he opposed the teaching of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] doctrines to non-Russian Kazakhs, but at the same time urged resistance to [[Tatar]] language and culture, in favor of Russian and Western influences. As an educator, he opened numerous Kazakh-Russian boarding schools, technical schools and schools for girls. 

Altynsarin is also credited with authoring the first Kazakh grammar book, the first Kazakh-Russian newspaper, and with translation of a large number of textbooks and reference works. He was honored by the [[Imperial Russian]] government with numerous awards, including the title ''statski sovetnik'' ([[State Counsellor (Russia)|State Counsellor]]).

A number of Kazakh institutions, including the Kazakh Academy of Education, Arkalyk State Pedagogical Institute and some streets, schools, and academic awards, are named after Altynsarin. There is an Altynsarin museum in [[Kostanay]].

'''Zivia Lubetkin''' ({{lang-pl|Cywia Lubetkin}} {{IPA-pl|ˈt͡sɨvja luˈbɛtkʲin|IPA}}, {{lang-he-n|צביה לובטקין}}, [[nom de guerre]]: '''Celina'''; 1914–1976) was one of the leaders of the [[Jewish resistance under Nazi rule|Jewish underground]] in Nazi-occupied [[Warsaw]] and the only woman on the High Command of the resistance group [[Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa]] (ŻOB). She survived the Holocaust in German-occupied Poland and immigrated to [[Mandate Palestine]] in 1946, at the age of 32.

== Biography ==

=== Pre-World War II ===
Zivia Lubetkin was born in Poland in Byteń near [[Slonim|Słonim]] (now in [[Belarus]]). She joined the [[Labor Zionist|Labor Zionist Movement]] at an early age. During her school years, Lubetkin was educated in Hebrew by private tutors. In her late teens she joined the [[Zionist youth movement]] [[Dror]], and in 1938 became a member of its Executive Council.
After [[Nazi Germany]] and later the [[Soviet Union]] invaded Poland in September 1939 she made a perilous journey from the Soviet occupied part of the country to [[Warsaw]] to join the underground there.&lt;ref name="jwa.org-Kna'ani"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/lubetkin-zivia | title=Zivia Lubetkin (1914–1978) | publisher=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia | work=Jewish Women's Archive | date=March 1, 2009 | accessdate=June 11, 2013 | author=Tikva Fatal-Kna'ani}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1939, she attended the twenty first [[Zionist Congress]] as a delegate of the Erez Israel Labor bloc.

=== World War II ===
In 1942, Lubetkin helped found the [[left-wing]] Zionist [[Anti-Fascist Bloc]]. This would be the first resistance organization in the Warsaw Ghetto to confront the German forces in combat. She also, as one of the founders of the ŻOB, served on the Warsaw Jewish community's political council, the Jewish National Committee (Żydowska Komitet Narodowy; ŻKN), and also served on the Coordinating Committee, an umbrella organization comprising the ŻKN and the non-Zionist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|General Jewish Labour Bund]] (Bund), that sponsored the ŻOB. During her years of underground activities, the name ''"Cywia"'' became the code word for Poland in letters sent by various resistance groups both within and outside of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. She was one of the leaders of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and one of only 34 fighters to survive the war. After leading her group of surviving fighters through the sewers of Warsaw with the aid of [[Simcha Rotem|Simcha'' "Kazik"'' Rotem]] in the final days of the ghetto uprising (on May 10, 1943), she continued her resistance activities in the rest of Warsaw outside the ghetto. She took part in the Polish [[Warsaw Uprising]] in 1944, fought in the units of the [[Armia Ludowa]].&lt;ref name="jwa.org-Kna'ani" /&gt; Though the Jewish forces would be devastated by the Germans, Lubetkin and several other survivors would survive by taking refuge in a hospital that was willing to hide them. On March 1st 1945, She attempted to immigrate to Palestine with partisan leader [[Abba Kovner]]. This move would be unsuccessful as the only available route was blocked, causing Lubetkin to return to Warsaw.

=== Postwar life ===
Following the [[Second World War]], Lubetkin was active in the [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivors community in Europe]], and helped organize the ''[[Bricha]]'', an organization staffed by operatives who helped Eastern and Central European Jews cross borders en route to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] by [[Ha'apala|illegal immigration channels]]. She herself immigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1946. She married [[Yitzhak Zuckerman]], the ŻOB commander, and they, along with other surviving ghetto fighters and [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] founded [[Kibbutz]] [[Lohamei HaGeta'ot]] and the [[Ghetto Fighters' House]] museum located on its grounds. In 1961, she testified at the trial of captured Nazi [[war criminal]] [[Adolf Eichmann]].&lt;ref name="jwa.org-Kna'ani" /&gt;

Her two children, Shimon (b. 1947) and Yael (b. 1949), were born in Kibbutz Lohamei HaGetta’ot, where she lived for the remainder of her life and died in [1976?]. Her granddaughter, [[Roni Zuckerman]], became the [[Israeli Air Force]]'s first female fighter pilot in 2001.&lt;ref name="jwa.org-Kna'ani" /&gt;
