The '''anti-deprivation rule''' (also known as '''fraud upon the bankruptcy law''') is a principle applied by the courts in [[common law]] jurisdictions (other than the [[United States]]){{efn|which has its own statutory rules barring ''[[ipso facto]]'' clauses in the event of bankruptcy}} in which, according to [[George Mellish|Mellish LJ]] in ''[[Re Jeavons, ex parte Mackay]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1873) LR 8 Ch App 643&lt;/ref&gt; "a person cannot make it a part of his [[contract]] that, in the event of [[bankruptcy]], he is then to get some additional advantage which prevents the property being distributed under the bankruptcy laws." [[William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley|Wood VC]] had earlier observed{{efn|relying on {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Higinbotham v Holme|link=|reporter=ER|year=1812|num=249|volume=34|firstpage=451|parallelcite=19 Ves Jun 88|date=6 May 1812|courtname=|juris=}}}} that "the law is too clearly settled to admit of a shadow of doubt that no person possessed of property can reserve that property to himself until he shall become bankrupt, and then provide that, in the event of his becoming bankrupt, it shall pass to another and not to his creditors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Whitmore v Mason|link=|reporter=ER|year=1861|num=960|volume=70|firstpage=1031|pinpoint=|parallelcite=2 J&amp;H 204|date=18 November 1861|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==General scheme==
It arises from the general principle (known as the "rule against repugnancy" in [[property law]]) that a grantor may not derogate from his own grant by giving an absolute interest in an asset and then providing for it to be clawed back otherwise than for fair value in stated eventualities, including (but not limited to) bankruptcy and winding up.{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=218}} This is considered to consist of several branches:

{{Tree list}}
* {{Tree list/final branch}} General principle
** Anti-deprivation rule
*** "Contracting out" rule{{sfn|Worthington|2010|p=32}}
*** {{Tree list/final branch}} "Insolvency-triggered deprivation" rule{{sfn|Worthington|2010|p=33}}
** {{Tree list/final branch}} ''[[Pari passu]]'' rule{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=218}}
{{Tree list/end}}

''[[Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc]]'' observed that the general principle consists of two subrules {{emdash}} the anti-deprivation rule and the ''[[pari passu]]'' rule, which are addressed to different mischiefs&lt;ref name=Belmont&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Belmont Park Investments PTY Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd &amp; Anor|link=Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd|court=UKSC|year=2011|num=38|parallelcite= [2012] 1 AC 383|pinpoint=par. 1|date=27 July 2011|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{emdash}} and held that, in borderline cases, a commercially sensible transaction entered into in good faith should not be held to infringe the first rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Belmont Park'', par. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the two rules was expanded upon later by [[Andrew Longmore|Longmore LJ]] in ''[[Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc]]'':&lt;ref name=Lomas&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc]] |court=EWCA |year=2012 |num=419 |date={{date|2012-04-03}}|courtname=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|
96. The relationship between the anti-deprivation principle and the ''pari passu'' rule is both dependant and autonomous. The former is concerned with contractual arrangements which have the effect of depriving the bankrupt estate of property which would otherwise have formed part of it. The ''pari passu'' rule governs the distribution of assets within the estate following the event of bankruptcy. It therefore invalidates arrangements under which a creditor receives more than his proper share of the available assets or where ... debts due to the company on liquidation were to be dealt with other than in accordance with the statutory regime.&lt;ref&gt;''Lomas'', at para 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 2012, the Chancery Division, in assessing the [[Administration (British football)#Football creditors rule|football creditors rule]], held that it was valid and did not violate either the anti-deprivation rule or the ''pari passu'' rule. In his judgment, [[David Richards (judge)|Richards J]], relying on ''Belmont Park'', declared:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Pari passu rule on insolvency clarified and limited|url = http://www.linklaters.com/pdfs/mkt/london/Football_creditor_rule.pdf|publisher = [[Linklaters]]|date = 29 May 2012}}, discussing {{cite BAILII|litigants=  HM Revenue and Customs v The Football League Ltd &amp; Anor|link=|court=EWHC|division=Ch|year=2012|num=1372|parallelcite=|para=73{{endash}}104|date=25 May 2012|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* the anti-deprivation rule applies from the commencement of [[Administration (law)|administration]]
:* the ''pari passu'' principle comes into play only if the purpose of the insolvency procedure is to effect a distribution
:* if a transaction has the effect of depriving a company of an asset in order to distribute it among some only of the creditors otherwise eligible to participate in a distribution, it offends both principles
:* if the deprivation occurs on the company going into administration, only the anti-deprivation principle will be engaged

===Aspects of the rule===

With respect to the anti-deprivation rule, [[Nicholas Patten|Patten LJ]] has observed that "the individual bankrupt or insolvent company may not contract at any time, either before or after the making of the bankruptcy or winding-up order, for its property subsisting at that date to be disposed of or dealt with otherwise than in accordance with the statute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd &amp; Anor|link=|court=EWHC|division=Ch|year=2009|num=1912|parallelcite= [2010] Ch 347 |pinpoint=par. 113|date=28 July 2009|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that this rule can therefore be subdivided into two branches: the "insolvency-triggered deprivation" rule looks to disposals, and the "contracting out" rule to dealings.{{sfn|Worthington|2011|p=27}} These subrules target two distinct strategies that a debtor might pursue:{{sfn|Worthington|2011|p=27}}

#it could favour a nominated  party on insolvency could either provide for a specific insolvency-triggered deprivation of its assets in favour of that party (being assets that would otherwise be available for distribution on the debtor’s insolvency), or
#it could agree to more attractive contractual set-offs or netting arrangements, thus avoiding the distribution rules that would otherwise apply to the debtor’s property.

All these anti-avoidance rules are, however, subject to the very large exception that creditors remain able to jump up the priority queue, through the creation of a [[security interest]].

===Scope of application===
Certain types of arrangements are not considered to offend the rule:

:* limited and determinable interests and licences{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=220}}
:* preemption provisions in [[articles of association]]{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=223}}
:* provision for termination on winding up of interest annexed to membership status{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=223}}

Other types are normally considered to offend:

:* provision for divestment of ownership of an asset on winding up{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=225}}
:* vesting clauses in building contracts (which vest the builder's materials in the building's owner upon the builder's liquidation){{sfn|Goode|2011|p=226}}
:* sale with provision for retransfer on winding up (where the seller did not reserve title until payment){{sfn|Goode|2011|p=226}}
:* increase in a company's contractual obligation on winding up{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=226}}

==Contracting out==
This case arises infrequently, but it did so notably in ''[[British Eagle International Air Lines Ltd v Compaigne Nationale Air France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1975] 1 WLR 758&lt;/ref&gt; Several principles arise from it:{{sfn|Worthington|2010|pp=32{{endash}}33}}

#It is irrelevant that the parties did not intend to achieve an insolvency advantage, or that the arrangement is long-standing, or has always represented the relationship between the parties, or is a static arrangement involving no insolvency trigger which changes the arrangement between the parties. 
#It is crucial that the company is in insolvency proceedings, and that it has assets that need to be dealt with under those proceedings. What is then important is the effect of the impugned arrangement on the treatment of the insolvent’s assets on its insolvency.
#If the impugned arrangement does not determine the distribution of the insolvent’s assets, but defines the very asset which is the subject of the insolvency proceedings, then the transaction is generally safe.

In ''Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc''&lt;ref name=Lomas /&gt; it was argued that certain provisions in standard form [[ISDA Master Agreement]] might offend against the rule; specifically that if an Event of Default (as defined) suspended the right of the Defaulting Party to receive payment indefinitely, then that would mean that if the Non-Defaulting Party went into [[liquidation]], the operating effect of the provision was to deprive the company's creditors of assets as a consequence of it going into liquidation.  However the Court of Appeal considered the principles outlined in ''Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd'',&lt;ref name=Belmont /&gt; and held that "If this is the touchstone then it is difficult to see how Section 2(a)(iii) of the Master Agreement can be said to offend against the anti-deprivation principle. ... There is no suggestion that it was formulated in order to avoid the effect of any insolvency law or to give the non-defaulting party a greater or disproportionate return as a creditor of the bankrupt estate."&lt;ref&gt;''Lomas'', at paragraph 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insolvency deprivation==
This subrule has been described by [[Henry Cotton (judge)|Cotton LJ]] as holding that "there cannot be a valid contract that a man's property shall remain his until his bankruptcy, and on the happening of that event shall go over to someone else, and be taken away from his creditors."&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Jay, In re Harrison'' (1880) 14 Ch D 19, at 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered to be a true anti-deprivation rule,{{sfn|Worthington|2010|p=33}} and several issues arise from it:{{sfn|Worthington|2010|pp=33{{endash}}35}}

#It is legitimate for courts to intervene on the grounds of public policy, even in areas primarily governed by statute.
#If the arrangement breaches the insolvency-deprivation rule, then it is void.
#the party’s insolvency must trigger the deprivation. The rule does not catch arrangements which prevent property ever reaching the insolvent’s hands{{efn|Such as with effective [[retention of title]] agreements, [[Quistclose trust]]s, or [[purchase money security interest]]s.}} Equally, deprivations caused by some other event – any other event – are not touched by this rule{{efn|In particular, deprivations caused by pre-insolvency disposal of assets, or by deprivation or forfeiture clauses that are not triggered by the party’s own insolvency, are all untouched by the insolvency-deprivation rule, as in ''Newitt'' (deprivation triggered by default)&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Newitt, re Garrud'' (1880) 16 Ch D 522&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Detmold'' (deprivation triggered by alienation).&lt;ref&gt;''In re Detmold'' (1889) 40 Ch D 585&lt;/ref&gt;}}
#The rule only concerns arrangements entered into by the insolvent.
#It is irrelevant that the asset being deprived was acquired by way of gift rather than for valuable consideration.
#As in the "contracting out" cases, it is irrelevant that the provision was "always a term of the contract", rather than a post-acquisition initiative that effected a deprivation triggered by insolvency. 

The Canadian courts have extended this further, declaring that termination clauses that are triggered where non-payment of obligations is indirectly caused by the debtor’s insolvency should be deemed to have been caused by the insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Beware Contractual Provisions triggered (even indirectly) by a Party’s Insolvency|author = Anthony Alexander|url = http://www.canadianappeals.com/2013/03/06/the-second-opinion-beware-contractual-provisions-triggered-by-a-partys-insolvency/|date = 2013-06-06|publisher = [[McCarthy Tétrault]]|accessdate = 2013-11-04}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Aircell Communications Inc. v.

The '''Australian Competition and Consumer Commission''' ('''ACCC''')  is an independent authority of the [[Australian government]]. It was established in 1995 with the amalgamation of the [[Australian Trade Practices Commission]] (TPC) and the Prices Surveillance Authority to administer the ''[[Trade Practices Act 1974]]'' (TPA) (Cth) (renamed the [[Competition and Consumer Act 2010]] on 1 January 2011). Its mandate is to protect consumer rights, business rights and obligations, perform industry regulation and price monitoring and prevent illegal anti-competitive behaviour.

==Historical Origins==
The ACCC's deeper origins are found in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act of [[Garfield Barwick|Sir Garfield Barwick]], Attorney-General in the Liberal Government of [[Robert Menzies|Sir Robert Menzies]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Hocking, Jenny, Lionel Murphy -a Political Biography, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2000 {{ISBN|0 521 79485 4}}. p.204&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents derided Barwick’s Trade Practices Act 1965 as “ineffectual”.

&lt;blockquote&gt; (The Act) did not declare any practices illegal ipso facto, but only did so after detailed investigation by the Trade Practices Commissioner. There were so many restrictive practices reported to the Commissioner, and the investigations were so prolonged, that one cynic remarked that at the then current rate of progress, it would take a hundred years to examine them all!&lt;ref name="Wheelwrigh_1994_p1-22"&gt;Wheelwright E.L., The Political Economy of Lionel Murphy, Venturini V.G (editor), in Five Voices for Lionel, Federation Press, Annandale NSW, 1994, {{ISBN|1-86287-149-3}}. pp 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though acknowledged as an abject failure, nevertheless Barwick’s Act had established in Australian Law “the principle of legislative coverage of trade practices”. The area badly needed reform. Attorney-General in the Whitlam Labor Government [[Lionel Murphy]] solicited the advice and help of the eminent economist and business commentator, [[Edward Lawrence Wheelwright|Professor Ted Wheelwright]]. In April 1973 Wheelwright produced a report for Murphy which became the blueprint of the coming legislation. He recommended, inter alia, that the Act be clearly focused on protecting the consumer.&lt;ref name="Wheelwrigh_1994_p1-22"/&gt;

Lionel Murphy is acknowledged as completely changing the previous approach regarding trade practices in Australia. His Trade Practices Bill, which was passed on August 6, 1974, for the first time in Australian Federal  law, introduced offences concerning monopolisation, exclusive dealing, price discrimination, resale price maintenance, restraints of trade by agreement, anti-competitive mergers, misleading advertising, coercive sales conduct, pyramid selling and the sale of unsolicited goods.&lt;ref name="Hocking, Jenny, op.cit. p.205"&gt;Hocking, Jenny, op.cit. p.205&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though, concomitantly, the Act introduced substantial penalties, Murphy’s initiative, surprisingly, received very little opposition in the Parliament or the business community.&lt;ref name="Hocking, Jenny, op.cit. p.205"/&gt;

== Roles ==
The ACCC administers the Competition and Consumer Act, and has standing to take action in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] to enforce its provision. The Competition and Consumer Act is a broad range of provisions, such as provisions on anti-competitive conduct, the [[Australian Consumer Law]] and regulation of telecommunications and energy industries. The ACCC, under the Act, also regulates certain industries by providing access to national infrastructure. The ACCC also has an educative role and seeks to educate both consumers and businesses as to their rights and responsibilities under the act.

The [[Australian Energy Regulator]] is a constituent but separate part of the ACCC and is responsible for economic energy regulation. It shares staff and premises with the ACCC, but has a separate board, although at least one board member must also be a Commissioner at the ACCC.

== Restrictive trade practices ==
In most cases the spirit of the act, and thus the actions of the ACCC, favours neither consumer nor supplier, but strives to achieve a competitive market without artificial restrictions. For example, [[refusal to deal]] – a producer refusing to supply a potential retailer or customer with a product – is not itself illegal unless the action would have an anti-competitive effect on the market as a whole.

== Penalties ==
The ACCC is committed in bringing court actions against companies that breach the Competition and Consumer Act. Penalties for non-compliance of the CCA can be quite severe.

Companies that do not comply with the restrictive trade practices provisions of CCA may be fined by the Federal Court. There are three ways the maximum fine can be calculated. The maximum possible fine is the larger of A$10,000,000; or three times the value of the illegal benefit; or (if the value of the benefit cannot be ascertained) 10% of turnover for the preceding 12 months. Individuals may be fined up to $500,000 and since  2009 certain offences  under the Competition and Consumer Act (such as price fixing or participation in a cartel) have been criminalised with executives who engage in conduct which contravenes the relevant provisions liable for a custodial sentence of up to 10 years in prison (44ZZRF and 44ZZRG of the CCA).

Companies that do not comply with the consumer protection provisions of CCA may be fined by the Federal Court, up to $1.1 M for companies and $220,000 for individuals.

The ACCC also has power to accept, on its on behalf, court enforceable undertakings under s87B of the Competition and Consumer Act. Such undertakings may include a wide range of remedies to the conduct.

A range of other remedies can be ordered by the court. For example, companies are frequently forced to publish retractions of false advertising claims in national newspapers and at their places of business. Companies found in breach of the CCA are usually bound to implement a compliance program to ensure future compliance with the Act.

== Consumer confidence ==
The ACCC is regarded by some Australian business people as necessary but often ineffective, echoing the critics of American [[Anti-trust#Criticism|anti-trust]] laws, while Australian consumers generally hold the ACCC in high regard.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Whilst it is acknowledged that the ACCC is required to help safeguard consumer rights, there has been occasional criticism of the organisation as being "all-talk-no-action". This criticism is most likely due to the inherent difficulty in obtaining sufficient evidence to prove breaches of the restrictive trade practices provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act.

Recently the ACCC has exercised its authority in a number of retail areas, including fining retailer [[Target (Australia)|Target]] for false advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/778652|title=Target Australia Pty Ltd|date=14 June 2006|publisher=ACCC|accessdate=13 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621235920/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/778652|archivedate=21 June 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Woolworths Limited|Woolworths]] (including some [[Safeway (Australia)|Safeway]] branded supermarkets in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]) for anti-competitive liquor deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/773813/fromItemId/2332|title=Woolworths penalised $7 million for anticompetitive liquor deals|date=22 December 2006|publisher=ACCC|accessdate=13 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621235940/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/773813/fromItemId/2332|archivedate=21 June 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the ACCC published findings of its inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for groceries in Australia. The report found that the Australian supermarket sector is "[[effective competition|workably competitive]]", but price competition is limited by barriers to entry and a lack of incentive for the two major players, [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths Limited|Woolworths]], to compete on price. The report also noted that Coles and Woolworths engage in deliberate strategies designed to ensure they maintain exclusive access to prime sites such as shopping centres to prevent centre managers leasing space to competing supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml?itemId=838251|title=Report of the ACCC inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for standard groceries|date=5 August 2008|publisher=ACCC|accessdate=13 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621235956/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml?itemId=838251|archivedate=21 June 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009 the ACCC reached agreement with Coles and Woolworths to phase out restrictive lease agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ausfoodnews.com.au/2009/09/18/woolworths-and-coles-agree-to-get-rid-of-restrictive-leases.html|title=Woolworths and Coles agree to get rid of restrictive leases|date=18 September 2009|publisher=Australian Food News|accessdate=13 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727163835/http://www.ausfoodnews.com.au/2009/09/18/woolworths-and-coles-agree-to-get-rid-of-restrictive-leases.html|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACCC has enforced the law against producers of quack devices with medical claims like [[Power Balance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Power Balance bracelets exposed as a sham|author=Georgina Robinson|date=23 December 2010|work=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/fitness/power-balance-bracelets-exposed-as-a-sham-20101223-195u7.html|accessdate=13 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730085519/http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/fitness/power-balance-bracelets-exposed-as-a-sham-20101223-195u7.html|archivedate=30 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won a case on 24 March 2016 against [[Valve Corporation]] for failing to provide refunds for faulty products, and making representations that domestic consumer guarantees did not apply to purchases using the Steam client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/online-games-giant-valve-found-to-have-breached-australian-consumer-law-20160329-gnt2wd.html|title=Online games giant Valve found to have breached Australian consumer law|first=Georgia|last=Wilkins|date=29 March 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205183925/http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/online-games-giant-valve-found-to-have-breached-australian-consumer-law-20160329-gnt2wd.html|archivedate=5 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/596867/accc-chalks-up-court-win-against-valve-software-guarantee-case/|title=ACCC chalks up court win against Valve Software|author=|date=|website=computerworld.com.au|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223020623/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/596867/accc-chalks-up-court-win-against-valve-software-guarantee-case/|archivedate=23 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|196|2016|litigants=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Valve Corporation (No 3) |courtname=auto |date=24 March 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brewers' Distributor Ltd.''' or '''BDL''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] company that distributes [[beer]] throughout the four [[Western Canada|western provinces]] and three [[Territories of Canada|northern territories]].  It is a private [[joint venture]] company owned by [[InBev]] (parent company of [[Labatt Breweries]]) and [[Molson-Coors]] (parent company of [[Molson Breweries]] following the Molson-[[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] [[merger]]).

==History==
The company was established in 1995 when Pacific Brewers Distributor in [[British Columbia]], Alberta Brewers Agents, Saskatchewan Brewers Association and Associated Beer Distributors in [[Manitoba]] (all of which were owned, or largely, owned by the two present shareholders) were consolidated into a single operation. BDL operates nine distribution centres and four [[cross dock]] facilities in [[Alberta]], British Columbia, Manitoba and [[Saskatchewan]].  The head office is located in [[Calgary]].

==Difference between Brewers Retail Inc.==
There are a few key differences between BDL and [[Brewers Retail Inc.]] which operates under largely the same ownership in the neighboring [[Canadian province|province]] of [[Ontario]].  First, BDL does not retail beer to consumers, it is only in the warehousing and distribution business.  Second, although BDL distributes the vast majority of beer sold in Western Canada, it has not been granted [[monopoly|monopolistic]] privileges by any provincial government.  Other domestic breweries are free to distribute their own beer if they wish – some non-shareholders (such as the [[Big Rock Brewery|Big Rock]] and [[Sleeman Breweries]]) have their own distribution chains although others voluntarily use BDL.  Third, BDL has been permitted to distribute some brands of [[imported beer]] since 2001 except in Alberta where the [[Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission]] had already contracted out its entire distribution operation to a private company and {{As of|2006|lc=on}} continues to grant [[Connect Logistics Inc.]] the exclusive right to distribute imported beer to Alberta's privately owned establishments and stores.  BRI stocks imported beer in its [[The Beer Store]] locations but this beer is purchased through the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]].

==Clarification==
BDL does not distribute [[wine]] or [[distilled spirits]] in any province.  These are distributed in Alberta by the AGLC through its private contractor, and in the other western provinces and territories by their [[Alcoholic beverages in Canada|respective government-owned liquor corporations]].

The '''Bus Safety Act 2009''' (also BSA) is a law enacted by the Parliament of the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]], [[Australia]] and is the prime [[statute]] regulating the [[safety]] of [[bus]] operations in Victoria. The Act was developed as part of the [[Transport Legislation Review]] conducted by the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] between 2004 and 2010 and is aimed at preventing deaths and injuries arising from bus operations in Victoria and establishes a modern "best practice" [[regulatory]] framework to assist in maintaining and improving the Victorian bus industry's good safety record. 

The Act continued regulatory control over the operation of large buses and introduced safety standards for the small or [[mini-bus]] sector which comprises 40% of the Victorian bus fleet.  Controls over large and small buses comprise permissions such as accreditation and registration. In addition, the Act introduced broad based "safety duties" for bus operators and all others who have a significant role in providing both commercial and non-commercial bus services. The Act also extended the range of enforcement powers and sanctions available to the safety regulator - the [[Director, Transport Safety]] operating as Transport Safety Victoria - and operates to encourage greater safety awareness across all types of bus operations.

The Act was the State's first dedicated [[statute]] on the subject and replaced provisions in the ''Public Transport Competition Act 1995'', which was renamed ''[[Buses in Melbourne#Bus Services Act|Bus Services Act 1995]]''. The ''Bus Safety Act'' forms part of the [[transport]] [[policy]] and [[legislation]] framework in Victoria set by the ''[[Transport Integration Act 2010]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]] - see paragraph (c) in the definition of "transport legislation" in section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and its provisions are subject to the overarching transport system vision, transport system objectives and decision making principles set out in that Act. The ''Bus Safety Act'' was passed in late March 2009 and commenced on 31 December 2010.

The responsible [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for the Act is the Minister for Public Transport, currently [[Jacinta Allan]].

== Outline ==
The stated purpose of the Bus Safety Act Act is "...to provide for the safe operation of bus services in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The objects of the Act center on the safety of bus operations, management of safety risks, continuous improvement in bus [[safety]] management, public confidence in the safety of bus transport, appropriate stakeholder involvement and the existence of a safety culture among bus service providers.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 4(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also contains a number of overarching policy principles relating to shared responsibility for safety, accountability for managing safety risks, [[enforcement]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]], consistency and [[Stakeholder engagement|stakeholder involvement]].&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ventura Bus at Chadstone.jpg|thumb|[[Ventura Bus Lines]] bus parked at the [[Chadstone Shopping Centre]] bus terminus]].
The Act establishes a regulatory scheme with the following key elements -
*  a number of performance-based '''safety duties''' which apply to the broad range of parties who can affect bus [[safety]] outcomes&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, Part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* an '''accreditation scheme''' concentrating on key commercial bus industry operators and operators of local bus services&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, Part 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* a '''registration scheme''' for operators of small buses ([[Mini-buses|mini buses]]) and large non commercial buses
* a broad range of '''[[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]] and [[wikt:penalty|penalties]]'''&lt;ref&gt;The Bus Safety Act 2009 amended the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]] in respect of these matters.  See Part 7 of that Act.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Cost-benefit analysis|cost benefit]]''' protections against excessive action by the regulator which affect industry participants&lt;ref&gt;As with the Rail Safety Act 2006 before it, cost benefit protections are positioned as a key balancing element in the Bus Safety Act scheme and a guard against a "feral" regulator or a "gold plated" safety approach to [[safety]] requirements.  The protection is contained in the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]] - see section 175.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''alcohol and drug management controls''' on bus safety workers through a requirement for operators to develop and implement an alcohol and drug management policy&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, Part 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* provision for the making of '''codes of practice''' to provide guidance on compliance to regulated rail industry parties.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The case for a new regulatory scheme ==
The Bus Safety Act was developed as a response to growing bus operations and the emergence of a greater safety risks and in recognition of the deficiencies of the previous regulatory scheme.

Before the BSA, bus safety in Victoria was regulated by an operator [[accreditation]] scheme in the former Public Transport Competition Act 1995&lt;ref&gt;Parts of this Act still exist but the title of the Act was changed from 1 July 2001 to the Bus Services Act 1995.  The change was made by the [[Transport Integration Act 2010]].  The Bus Services Act is essentially an Act to regulate contract arrangements for commercial bus services in Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt; and by miscellaneous prescriptive offences in the Transport (Passenger Vehicles) Regulations 2005. Compared with best practice regimes, the previous scheme was outmoded and inadequate.

Some of the problems with the previous regime were -

* it focused almost solely on the bus operator and ignored the safety role of other key industry participants who can affect safety outcomes.  In essence, the scheme ignored the bus safety [[chain of responsibility]]
* bus [[accreditation]] tends to focus on the ability to operate rather than on safety outcomes more generally
* conditions of accreditation and the passenger vehicles regulations tend to be prescriptive rather than performance-based, and do not result in the general safety awareness and proactive risk management required to develop a safety culture
* the regulator had limited sanctions available when safety breaches occurred and was often forced to choose between sanctions that were either too strong or too weak
* the scheme did not apply to all 'buses'.  The previous legislative definition of 'bus' was a passenger vehicle with more than 12 seating positions, including the driver.  This missed [[Mini-buses|mini buses]] and was inconsistent, not only with the requirements in most [[Australian]] jurisdictions, but also with the relevant Australian Design Rules which regulated vehicle construction in [[Australia]].

== Parts ==
[[File:Dyson's Bus Services (0909 AO) Volgren 'CR222L' bodied Mercedes Benz O405NH at Upfield railway station.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Dyson's Bus Services|Dysons]] [[Volgren]] bodied. [[Mercedes-Benz]] O405NH route bus at [[Upfield railway station]]]]
The Act is divided into nine parts:

# Preliminary
# Principles of Bus Safety
# Bus Safety Duties
# Accreditation and Registration
# Alcohol and Drug Management Policy
# Review of Decisions
# Codes of Practice
# General
# Amendments to Other Acts and Repeal of Part

== Coverage ==
The Bus Safety Act regulates the [[safety]] [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] of most bus transport in Victoria including buses operated both commercially and non commercially.  A major change made by the Act was the extension of coverage to small buses.

The former Public Transport Competition Act regime focused exclusively on large buses.  The BSA extended the definition of 'bus' in line with the Australian Design Rules, which define a bus as a passenger vehicle with 10 or more seating positions including the driver. The definition refers to buses 'as built'.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, definition of "bus" in section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if a vehicle is built as a bus, subsequent modifications, including reducing the number of seats, will not alter its status under the scheme.

Accordingly, a bus built with 10 seats remains a bus even if some of those seats are removed.  This ensures that safety regulation is not avoided by making alterations to the vehicle.  Some flexibility is provided by allowing for vehicles and services to be opted in or out of the definition.

For example, a vehicle that would otherwise be a bus, but is licensed as a taxi, is excluded so that the operator is not subject to double regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duties ==

=== Chain of responsibility ===
In order to foster more proactive risk management in the bus industry, Part 3 of the BSA imposes performance-based duties of care on all industry participants who are in a position to influence the safety of the operation - what is called the '[[chain of responsibility]]'.

Safety duties apply to all bus services, both commercial and non-commercial, and to all buses regardless of seating capacity.  The primary duty holder under the Bus Safety Act is the operator of the bus service, as the person who has effective responsibility and control over the whole operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety duties are also imposed on a range of other people including -

* '''bus safety workers''' including drivers, schedulers who set bus [[Public transport timetable|timetable]]s, and [[mechanics]] and testers who repair or assess vehicle safety&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''procurers''' - that is, people who procure the bus service, known as the customer in the commercial charter sector&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''people with responsibility for bus stops''' including people who design, build or maintain the stop and who decide on its location.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a response to research showing that the most serious hazard associated with bus travel occurs when passengers, especially children, are crossing the road after alighting from the bus. The location and layout of a [[bus stop]] is therefore a factor in the level of risk.

All of these persons can clearly affect bus safety.  They are required to ensure that, in carrying out their activities, they eliminate risks to health and safety if 'practicable' - or work to reduce those risks 'so far as is reasonably practicable'.

This familiar practicability formula is borrowed from Victoria's [[Rail Safety Act]] (and the subsequent national model Rail Safety Bill) and the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004.

=== Safety culture ===
Duties of this kind are a key aspect of modern safety regulation and tend to create a shared safety awareness, a proactive approach to safety management and adaptability to new circumstances - in other words, a [[safety culture]].

The framework of safety duties in the Act seeks to give practical effect to the so-called "[[chain of responsibility]]" concept in the bus [[safety]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;The [[chain of responsibility]] concept emanated from the heavy vehicle sector in [[Australia]].  The concept has since spread in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the rail safety, [[bus]] safety, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] safety, taxi and accident [[towing]] sectors.&lt;/ref&gt;  It seeks to identify the parties who are in a sufficient position of control over risks, in this case to [[safety]], and to allocate responsibility by [[law]] accordingly.

Penalties for a breach of safety duties are potentially high,&lt;ref&gt;See Division 2 of Part 3 of the Bus Safety Act 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; with maximum penalties reflecting those that can be imposed on duty holders in the rail sector and in the OH and S Act. Penalties vary among [[natural person]] and [[Corporation|body corporate]] offenders.

The general approach taken in the Act - to encourage a safety culture by imposing safety duties and risk management obligations on persons in a [[chain of responsibility]] - is strongly supported by the report on transport safety regulation released in October 2008 by the NSW Efficient Transportation Marketplace Working Group. The report effectively endorsed Victoria's and the nation's rail safety regime directions and suggested that a similar approach, particularly focusing on performance-based duties, be taken with all road transport.

=== Nature of duties ===
The typical formulation of a safety duty specifies that persons covered by Part 3 of the Act must satisfy in this category is that they must "so far as is reasonably practicable, ensure the safety of the bus service".&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009 - see, for example, section 15(1) which specifies the duty of bus operator.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formulation of the duty can, however, vary according to the party covered.  For example, a bus safety worker is required to take "...reasonable measures to ensure the safety of persons who may be affected by the acts or omissions of the bus safety worker."&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 17(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Permissioning ==
Part 4 of the Bus Safety Act contains provision for two permissioning schemes - an [[accreditation]] scheme and a [[Vehicle registration|registration]] scheme.  These schemes apply according to whether the operator runs a commercial service for profit or a local bus service or a not for profit service such as those typically offered by clubs and associations.

The BSA seeks to strike a balance between the need to ensure that non commercial bus services are operated safely without requiring onerous requirements and therefore threatening the viability of  community services, such as buses provided by local councils, clubs or community organisations.

This led to the requirement in the Act for the most risky bus services - commercial services and local services - to be subject to accreditation requires while less risky not for profit services were subject to a lesser registration obligation.

=== Accreditation ===
The key party responsible for the direct operation of commercial bus services in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the bus operator, is not permitted to operate under the Act unless granted [[accreditation]] under the BSA by the regulator.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009 - see section 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[accreditation]] is to attest that a person who operates a commercial bus service or a local bus service has demonstrated the competence and capacity to manage the risks to [[safety]] associated with their bus operations.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matters applicants are required to demonstrate under the scheme are that they have, "...and will continue to have, the competence and capacity to operate a commercial bus service or local bus service safely."&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 26(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Matters relevant to satisfying that test include whether the applicant has completed an approved [[training]] course and any other matters prescribed by [[regulations]] or declared by the Safety Director.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 26(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reduced reliance on accreditation ====
In addition to safety duties, the requirement to be accredited was continued by the BSA for operators of commercial services which use medium to large buses, as well as local councils which use medium to large buses to provide a local service that is available to the general public.

The accreditation scheme under previous legislation was streamlined and strengthened by the Bus Safety Act to focus more clearly on safety.  It no longer focuses on business competence, and reduced the regulatory burden by relieving accredited operators of the need to obtain periodic renewal of their accreditation.

New probity standards were also introduced by the BSA, with the inclusion of disqualification offences - essentially past criminal convictions which, depending on their seriousness, may disqualify an applicant from obtaining accreditation&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, Part 4.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby excluding the person from operating a bus.

Additional effort required in demonstrating safety competence to the regulator, and the additional regulator vigilance involved in accreditation, are reasonably required for commercial and local services that include medium to large buses - those services that are the most visible are spending the most time on the road, carrying the largest number of passengers and usually serving the general public.

These services intrinsically have a higher safety risk.  Therefore, it was important that the new accreditation scheme promotes and maintains public confidence in these services.

Significantly, the BSA makes it clear that the concept of 'commercial' includes so-called 'courtesy services' - that is, where the passenger is carried free because they have paid for a service to which the transport is ancillary - with hotel shuttles the most familiar example.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, section 3, definition of "commercial bus service".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Registration ===

The Bus Safety Act does not require [[accreditation]] for operators of non-commercial bus services, or services that rely exclusively on minibuses - buses with 10-12 seats.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, Part 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  These services are, however, subject to the same range of safety duties as applies to other bus services.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, Part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also required by the Act to be registered with the [[Director, Transport Safety|safety regulator]], enabling the regulator to take proactive compliance steps or responsive action as necessary. In addition, the specific guidance contained in codes of practice can enhance compliance by operators of these services.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Safety Act 2009, Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compliance ==
The BSA enables the safety director to apply to the bus sector the wide array of enforcement powers and [[wikt:sanction|sanction]]s, consistent with modern safety schemes.

These provisions give the [[Director, Transport Safety|safety director]] regulatory tools including improvement notices (which require a duty holder to remedy a safety breach) and, in more critical circumstances, prohibition notices (which enable the safety director to prohibit the duty holder from carrying out an unsafe activity until the situation is remedied).

In each case, failure to comply with the notice is an offence.  The [[Rail Safety Act]] and Road Safety Act 1986 give courts a wide range of sentencing options after a finding of guilt is made in relation to a safety offence. These, too, were made available by the BSA in relation to bus safety offences.

The [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]]-related provisions to support the Bus Safety Act were not included in that Act.  Instead, they were included in the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]], Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the holistic restructuring of Victorian transport legislation driven by the [[Transport Legislation Review]].

The compliance support scheme centres on provisions which enable the appointment of authorised officers, the conferral of coercive powers and the availability of a range of administrative and court-based sanctions.

The key elements are -
* appointment of transport safety officers
* powers relating to entry to [[railway]] premises, [[inspection]], securing sites, [[use of force]] and [[seizure]] of things
* powers to [[Search and seizure|search]], enter and require production of documents and information and to require name and address details
* [[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]] and [[wikt:penalty|penalties]] such as improvement notices, prohibition notices and infringement notices
* powers to initiate [[Prosecutor|prosecutions]], receive safety undertakings and impose commercial benefits penalty orders, supervisory intervention orders, exclusion orders and adverse publicity orders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]], Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsible regulator ==
The [[Director, Transport Safety]], who operates as Transport Safety Victoria, is the responsible [[regulatory agency|regulator]] for the application and enforcement of the Act, and the regulation of [[safety]] performance of the bus sector in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The office was created by the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 171.&lt;/ref&gt; It commenced on 1 July 2010 and subsumed the former office of the [[Director, Public Transport Safety]] within a broader [[transport]] safety office. The Director is part of  the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]], but is functionally independent of the Department and responsible Ministers,&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 194.&lt;/ref&gt; except in limited circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 191 (the Minister may compel the Director to investigate a particular matter) and 193(2).&lt;/ref&gt; The Director reports to the relevant Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
{{Main|Transport Legislation Review}}

=== Regulatory scheme ===
The development of the proposal for the Bus Safety Act was managed by the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] in Victoria as part of its broader [[Transport Legislation Review]] project.

The Department released a discussion paper - ''Improving Bus Safety in Victoria'' - outlining the broad policy framework for a bus [[safety]] regulation scheme [[legislation]] in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;The paper was released in May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper outlined a series of concerns about the former bus [[safety]] [[regulation]] framework in Victoria including concerns about [[safety]] trends and outcomes&lt;ref&gt;''Improving Bus Safety in Victoria'', Department of Infrastructure, May 2008, Parts B.&lt;/ref&gt; and comparisons with schemes in overseas jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;''Improving Bus Safety in Victoria'', Department of Infrastructure, May 2008, Parts C, D and E.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comments on the discussion paper were requested from [[industry]] parties and other interested stakeholders.  37 comments were received on the paper.  Comments received from [[industry]], [[government]] and other stakeholders resulted in the refinement of the proposal and changes to its design.

Ultimately, the proposals for a new bus [[safety]] [[regulation]] scheme was presented to the [[Victorian Parliament]] as proposed [[legislation]] in early December 2008.

== Parliamentary approval ==

=== Introduction ===
The Bus Safety Act was introduced into the [[lower house]] of the [[Victorian Parliament]], the [[Legislative Assembly]], as the Bus Safety Bill, on 2 December 2008.  The responsible [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for the Bill proposal was the then Minister for Public Transport, the Hon [[Lynne Kosky]] MP.

The Minister moved the [[second reading]] of the Bus Safety Bill on 4 December 2008 and set the context for the Bill in her speech in support as follows -

::"This Bill provides a new 'best practice' safety regulation regime for Victoria's growing bus industry. It is a major step in the modernisation of transport safety regulation that began with the [[Rail Safety Act|Rail Safety Act 2006]] and will be completed with the forthcoming review of marine safety regulation. It is also a critical component of the government's wider program of transport legislation reform, which represents the most extensive overhaul of Victoria's transport legislation in 25 years.

::Foreshadowed earlier this year in the Premier's ''Annual Statement of Government Intentions'', the introduction of this Bill is timely, as it coincides with the largest expansion of the bus network in decades and significant patronage growth on both metropolitan and regional buses.

::The Bill is by no means a response to failure in the safety performance of Victoria's bus sector - the industry in fact compares well with Australian and international trends. But serious incidents, while rare, do occur. Members might recall the dreadful 1989 Kempsey bus crash when two full tourist coaches, each travelling at 100 km/h, collided head-on near Kempsey, New South Wales, claiming 35 lives and injuring 41 others. Closer to home, in July this year, 17 people were injured in a collision between a bus and a truck in Traralgon.

::We must do all we can to avoid these sorts of tragedies and this Bill aims to ensure that the bus industry's good safety record in this state is maintained and improved into the future."&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, [[Legislative Assembly]], 4 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate ===
[[File:Victoria Parliament House Melbourne.jpg|thumb|The Bill which became the Bus Safety Act was considered by the [[Victorian Parliament]] between early December 2008 and late March 2009.]]

The Bus Safety Bill was supported by opposition members and was the subject of minimal negative comment during its passage.  The then Opposition shadow Transport Minister and the Minister for Public Transport, [[Terry Mulder]] MP, commented that -

::"I know the Bill focuses very much on safety, but certainly the experience that I have had over the years working with businesses - putting in place accredited systems and business management systems - is that really at the end of the day you should make money. A business should function a hell of a lot better if it has an accreditation scheme in place.

::As to this issue dealing with safety, it may well be that a company's buses are maintained at a higher level and that it does not then suffer the risk of breakdown, maintenance failures and a loss of reputation because of the failure of its equipment.

::I believe accreditation has a great place in a lot of businesses and a lot of operations, providing it does one of two things: one, today you look at the safety regime, because a safety regime is very important; and two, you have to make sure you get a financial benefit out of it, because when you get a business that is being screwed or under enormous financial pressure, it tends to start to drift away from putting money into areas where it should, such as safety.

::What I would say to Bus Association Victoria members is, firstly, embrace the issue of safety, and secondly, make sure your accreditation schemes provide you with the opportunity to enhance your business, improve your bottom line and become a better operation as a result of it.

::As I say, the opposition will not oppose the Bill before the House. I have raised a couple of concerns that we have in relation to the Bill and trust that the Minister will pick those up."&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The then Parliamentary Secretary for Public Transport, [[Rob Hudson|Rob Hudson MP]], observed that -

::"This Bill is really all about improving the safety of bus operations in Victoria.

::I think we need to recognise that there is already a high level of bus safety and bus safety standards that apply to buses in Victoria, and this Bill enhances those and takes them to a new level.

::Buses are playing an increasingly important role in our public transport system. For the 2008 calendar year there were nearly 98 million passengers on our buses, which is an increase of 12.9 per cent. They are experiencing the highest growth in patronage since 1949-50. We have a huge increase in bus use at the moment. With the increasing role that buses are playing in the transport network, it is important for us to ensure that we have included all buses that are out there providing commercial bus services.

::The problem with the current regime is that it is prescriptive, it is limited in its scope and it is unclear. It focuses only on the operator of the bus service.

::This legislation extends that to all the players in the bus sector. The part of the industry that has been regulated to date, the part that has been accredited really in many respects, is going to face a reduced regulatory burden as a result of this Bill because those companies will not be required, as they are now, to renew their accreditation every three years. Instead what they will find is their accreditation will be ongoing and will be subject to audit.

::The real impact of the Bill is going to be felt mainly in the case of minibuses, which are currently completely unregulated - they are, typically, buses with 10 to 12 seats.

::There are about 5500 of those buses out there, and they are going to be brought within the scope of bus safety regulation for the first time. That represents about 40 per cent of all the buses that are out there in the bus sector, so I think that is where this Bill is going to have the biggest impact, bringing those buses into the bus safety regime. They are going to do that principally, depending on whether they are a commercial bus or not, through the registration scheme."&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reply, the Minister indicated that -

::"The Bill provides a new best practice safety regulation regime for Victoria's growing bus industry. ...

::The introduction of this Bill is very timely because it coincides with the largest expansion of the bus network in decades and significant patronage growth on both metropolitan and regional buses.

::In short, this Bill will do for the bus sector what the groundbreaking [[Rail Safety Act]] did for the rail sector - it will maintain Victoria's position as the national leader in transport policy and legislative reform."&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 12 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister also took the opportunity in summing up debate to thank a number of Departmental officials for their policy and stakeholder work on the Bill including Ian Shepherd and Hilary de Vries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Bus Safety Bill, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 12 March 2009, page 742.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Passage, assent and commencement ===

==== Legislative Council debate ====
[[File:McKenzie's Tourist Services 6413AO.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A McKenzie's Tourist Services [[MAN Truck &amp; Bus|MAN]] 18.280, [[Custom Coaches]] CB60 EvoII]]
The Bus Safety Bill was passed by the [[Legislative Assembly]] on 12 March 2009.  The Bill was introduced into the [[Legislative Council]] on the same day and second reading was moved immediately.  Debate took place in the [[Legislative Council|upper house]] in late March 2009.

The lead speaker in the upper house debate, [[David Koch (Australian politician)|David Koch]] MLC, observed that -

::"This is not a large Bill, but it is a common-sense Bill that obviously will see greater safety afforded to our public users, especially smaller volunteer groups, church groups, our elderly, our young and what have you.

::This is a transport opportunity we should be supporting.  We acknowledge a possible shortcoming in relation to accreditation; that is a concern of ours, and I am sure that as time goes on it will be picked up.

::In many ways the Bill mirrors the [[Rail Safety Act]]. It is important to have stand-alone Bills in our transport industry, especially given the accidents that occur. We want to have powers to investigate those on an individual basis, not only on a total transport sector basis.

::It is important we have the opportunity to recognise and investigate accidents on the grounds of the individual transport mode, be it rail, bus, tramway or whatever. This Bill opens up that opportunity in terms of buses and those who choose to use buses as a mode of transport.

::In closing, like Bus Association Victoria we think accreditation across the board may protect users to a greater extent in terms of driver competency, although I am not saying for a second that our volunteer drivers are not competent bus drivers. But further thought should be given at a later date to offering the opportunity for volunteer drivers to become accredited so all parts of the bus industry travel forward as one.  I do not think there is one volunteer driver who would not qualify for accreditation, and it is possible that many would wish to be involved in that process.

::In closing, we will be supporting the Bill; we will not be opposing the Bill. As I said, this is a good common-sense Bill, and I hope the house supports it as presented.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, [[Legislative Council]], 31 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead speaker for the Greens, [[Colleen Hartland|Colleen Hartland MLC]], commented that -

::"As has already been stated, the Bus Safety Bill is a sensible and long-overdue piece of legislation. The Bill promotes safety and introduces reasonable and achievable practices and procedures into the bus industry.

::It contains a wide range of new provisions, overhauls the accreditation system and addresses problems in the existing system. All those things are good."&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, [[Legislative Council]], 31 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bus Safety Bill was passed by the Legislative Council on 31 March 2009.

==== Assent and commencement ====
The Bus Safety Bill received the [[Royal Assent]] on 7 April 2009 to become the Bus Safety Act 2009.&lt;ref&gt;See www.legislation.vic.gov.au, Parliamentary Documents, archive for 2009 Bills of the [[Victorian Parliament]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act was ultimately permitted to commence on its default commencement date of 31 December 2010.

The Bus Safety Regulations 2010 which were required to support the operation of the Act also operated from the same date thereby formally commencing Victoria's new bus safety regulation scheme.

== Changes to the Act ==
The Act has been subject to some significant changes since it was passed in 2009.  In particular,  the Bus Safety Act, like other Victorian transport statutes, was brought under the portfolio scheme in the [[Transport Integration Act]] and the high level policy and institutional framework set out in that statute.

== Recent bus safety issues ==
Recent activity by the independent transport safety regulator, [[Director, Transport Safety|Transport Safety Victoria]], using the provisions of the Bus Safety Act and the Bus Safety Regulations 2010 has raised serious concerns about the safety of the Victorian bus fleet. Changes made by the legislation has required mandatory reporting of the results of annual bus safety inspections since February 2011. The current figures show that over a quarter of the State's buses are unsafe. Over the five-month period to July 2011, 28% of 13 plus seat buses failed their annual bus safety inspection.&lt;ref&gt;"Disappointing annual bus safety inspection result", Bus Safety News, Issue 21, Summer 2011, Transport Safety Victoria. {{cite web |url=http://www.transportsafety.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/49668/Bus-Safety-News-Issue-21.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419040102/http://www.transportsafety.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/49668/Bus-Safety-News-Issue-21.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-19 |df= }}  Retrieved 13 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The head of Transport Safety Victoria, Alan Osborne, described the results as "unsettling" and called for everyone involved to shoulder their fair share of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;"''Quarter of buses unsafe''", Herald Sun, 12 January 2012, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, safety inspections by Transport Safety Victoria at two [[Transdev Melbourne]] bus depots found 33 defective buses. Twelve of the buses were in such poor conditions they were removed from service for urgent repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/off-the-buses-transdev-buses-pulled-off-the-road-after-failing-safety-blitz-20170919-gykwod.html|title=Off the buses: Transdev buses pulled off the road after failing safety blitz|last=Carey|first=Adam|date=2017-09-20|work=The Age|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campaign finance web final.png|thumb|An infographic explaining [[Campaign finance in the United States|American system of campaign finance]], by the [[Sunlight Foundation]]]]
'''Campaign finance''' refers to all funds raised to promote [[candidate]]s, [[Political party|political parties]], or policy [[initiative]]s and [[Referendum|referenda]]. Political parties, charitable organizations, and [[political action committee]]s (in the United States) are vehicles used in aggregating funds to keep campaigns alive. "[[Political finance]]" is also popular terminology, and is used internationally for its comprehensiveness. Campaign finance deals with "the costs of democracy", a term coined by [[G. Alexander Heard]] for his famous analysis of campaign finance in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Heard, Alexander, ''The Costs of Democracy'', Chapel Hill NC: University of North Caroline Press, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political campaign]]s have many expenditures, such as the cost of travel of candidates and staff, [[political consulting]], and the direct costs of communicating with voters via media outlets. Campaign spending depends on the region. For instance, in the United States, [[television advertising]] time must be purchased by campaigns, whereas in other countries, it is provided for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication|last=Holtz-Bacha|first=Christina|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2008|isbn=1412917999|location=|page=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The need to raise money to maintain expensive political campaigns diminishes ties to a representative democracy because of the influence large contributors have over politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=16962acc-b30e-4991-81af-6489a9a8188a@sessionmgr107&amp;hid=114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=91615955&amp;db=bth|title=SOFT MONEY AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM: Start Your Search!|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes and effects of campaign finance rules are studied in political science, [[economics]], and [[public policy]], among other disciplines.

==Private financing==
Some countries rely heavily on private donors to finance political campaigns.  In these countries, fundraising is often a significant activity for the campaign staff and the candidate, especially in larger and more prominent campaigns.  For example, one survey in the United States found that 23% of candidates for [[U.S. state|statewide]] office surveyed say that they spent more than half of their scheduled time raising money. Over half of all candidates surveyed spent at least 1/4 of their time on fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_2_22/ai_74410584|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040916073623/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_2_22/ai_74410584|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-09-16|title=Begging for Bucks|accessdate=2007-03-12|work=Campaigns and Elections}} &lt;/ref&gt; One study finds that political donations gives donors significantly greater access to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Campaign Contributions Facilitate Access to Congressional Officials: A Randomized Field Experiment|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12180/abstract|journal = American Journal of Political Science|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 1540-5907|pages = 545–558|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12180|language = en|first = Joshua L.|last = Kalla|first2 = David E.|last2 = Broockman|volume=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactics used can include [[direct mail]] solicitation, attempts to encourage supporters to contribute via the [[Internet]], direct solicitation from the candidate, and events specifically for the purpose of fundraising, or other activities.

Most countries that rely on private donations to fund campaigns require extensive disclosure of contributions, frequently including information such as the name, employer and address of donors.  This is intended to allow for policing of undue donor influence by other campaigns or by [[good government]] groups, while preserving most benefits of private financing, including the right to make donations and to spend money for political speech, saving government the expense of funding campaigns, and keeping government from funding partisan speech that some citizens may find odious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/09/AR2005120901716.html|title='Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Hypocrisy|first=George F.|last=Will|date=11 December 2005|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of private financing systems believe that, in addition to avoiding government limitations on speech, private financing fosters civic involvement, ensures that a diversity of views are heard, and prevents government from tilting the scales to favor those in power or with political influence.

These kinds of donations can come from private individuals, as well as groups such as [[trade union]]s and for-profit [[corporation]]s.

However, critics of this system claim that it leads to votes being "bought" and producing large gaps between different parties in the money they have to campaign against.

==Public financing==
{{main article|Party subsidies}}
Other countries choose to use government funding to run campaigns. Funding campaigns from the government budget is widespread in [[South America]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smilov, Daniel  |author2=Jurij Toplak|title=Political Finance and Corruption in Eastern Europe|publisher=Ashgate Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7546-7046-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms for this can be quite varied, ranging from direct subsidy of [[political party|political parties]] to government matching funds for certain types of private donations (often small donations) to exemption from fees of government services (e.g., postage) and many other systems as well. Supporters of government financing generally believe that the system decreases corruption; in addition, many proponents believe that government financing promotes other values, such as civic participation or greater faith in the political process. Not all government subsidies take the form of money; some systems require campaign materials (often air time on television) to be provided at very low rates to the candidates. Critics sometimes complain of the expense of the government financing systems. Conservative and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] critics of the system argue that government should not subsidize political speech.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Other critics argue that government financing, with its emphasis on equalizing money resources, merely exaggerates differences in non-monetary resources.

In many countries, such as Germany and the United States, campaigns can be funded by a combination of private and public money.

In some electoral systems, candidates who win an election or secure a minimum number of ballots are allowed to apply for a rebate to the government. The candidate submits an audited report of the campaign expenses and the government issues a rebate to the candidate, subject to some caps such as the number of votes cast for the candidate or a blanket cap.

Their study also affirmed the perspective laid down by the Council of Europe, when discussing the concept of effective regulation of campaign financing: "[We are] convinced that raising public awareness on the issues of prevention and fight against corruption in the field of funding of political parties is essential to the good functioning of democratic institutions."&lt;ref name = ohman/&gt;

The '''Capitularies of Charles the Bald''' represent a series of acts implemented by [[Charles the Bald|King Charles]] to decide and promulgate laws governing public affairs.  [[Capitulary|Capitularies]] were used extensively by the Merovingian and Carolingian rulers (see the [[Carolingian_Empire#Capitularies|Capitularies of Charlemagne]]) to provide guidance to counts and their subordinate officers in the far-flung reaches of the empire.

[[Hincmar]], as chief advisor to Charles, was particularly adept at coordinating and disseminating the capitularies, soliciting maximum input from all sources.  While numerous capitularies were issued by Charles, two important ones stand out:
* [[Capitulary of Servais]] of 854, dispatching ''[[Missus dominicus|Missi]]'' to protect and secure the realm
* [[Capitulary of Quierzy]] of 877, providing guidance for protecting the realm during Charles’ absence.

A complete list of capitularies was provided by [[Jacques Sirmond]] in his 1623 history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10222">'''Case law''' is a set of past rulings by tribunals that meet their respective jurisdictions' rules to be cited as [[precedent]].  These interpretations are distinguished from [[statutory law]], which are the statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies, and [[regulatory law]], which are regulations established by executive agencies based on statutes.   The term "case law" is applied to any set of previous rulings by an adjudicatory tribunal that guides future rulings; for example, patent office case law.

In [[common law#Disambiguate_civil_law|common law]] countries the term is used for [[Judgment (law)|judicial decisions]] of selected [[appellate court]]s, [[court]]s of [[first instance]], agency tribunals, and other bodies discharging adjudicatory functions.  In [[common law]] countries, "case law" is a near-exact synonym for "[[common law#Disambiguate_statute|common law]]".&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage | last = Garner | first= Bryan A. | year = 2001 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = New York | edition = 2nd, revised | ref = harv|p=177|quote = In modern usage, ''common law'' is contrasted with a number of other terms.

==In common law systems==
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Criminal cases]]
In the [[common law]] tradition, courts decide the law applicable to a case by interpreting statutes and applying [[precedent]]s which record how and why prior [[Legal case|cases]] have been decided.  Unlike most civil law systems, common law systems follow the doctrine of [[stare decisis]], by which most courts are bound by their own previous decisions in similar cases, and all lower courts should make decisions consistent with previous decisions of higher courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Apple|first1=James G.|title=A Primer on the Civil-Law System|url=https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2012/CivilLaw.pdf|website=fjc.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in England, the [[High Court]] and the [[Court of Appeal]] are each bound by their own previous decisions, but the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] is able to deviate from its earlier decisions, although in practice it rarely does so.

Generally speaking, higher courts do not have direct oversight over the lower [[court of record|courts of record]], in that they cannot reach out on their own initiative (''sua sponte'') at any time to overrule judgments of the lower courts.  Normally, the burden rests with litigants to appeal rulings (including those in clear violation of established case law) to the higher courts. If a judge acts against precedent and the case is not [[appeal]]ed, the decision will stand.

A lower court may not rule against a binding precedent, even if it feels that it is unjust; it may only express the hope that a higher court or the legislature will reform the rule in question. If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, it may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or that it should be ''distinguished'' by some material difference between the facts of the cases. If that judgment goes to appeal, the appellate court will have the opportunity to review both the precedent and the case under appeal, perhaps overruling the previous case law by setting a new precedent of higher authority. This may happen several times as the case works its way through successive appeals. [[Lord Denning]], first of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court of Justice]], later of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], provided a famous example of this evolutionary process in his development of the concept of [[estoppel]] starting in the ''High Trees'' case: ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v. High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] K.B. 130.

==How case law is made==
{{rewrite section|date=December 2016}}
The different roles of case law in civil and common law traditions create differences in the way that courts render decisions. Common law courts generally explain in detail the legal rationale behind their decisions, with citations of both legislation and previous relevant judgments, and often an exegesis of the wider legal principles. The necessary analysis (called ''[[ratio decidendi]]''), then constitutes a [[precedent]] binding on other courts; further analyses not strictly necessary to the determination of the current case are called ''[[obiter dicta]]'', which constitute [[persuasive authority]] but are not technically binding. By contrast, decisions in civil law jurisdictions are generally very short, referring only to [[statute]]s. The reason for this difference is that these civil law jurisdictions adhere to a tradition that the reader should be able to deduce the logic from the decision and the statutes, so that, in some cases, it is somewhat difficult to apply previous decisions to the facts presented in future cases. 

Some [[legal pluralism|pluralist]] systems, such as [[Scots law]] in [[Scotland]] and so-called civil law jurisdictions in [[Quebec]] and [[Louisiana]], do not precisely fit into the dual "common-civil" law system classifications. Such systems may have been heavily influenced by the [[Anglo-America]]n common law tradition; however, their substantive law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition.  Because of their position between the two main systems of law, these types of legal systems are sometimes referred to as "mixed" systems of law.

Law [[professor]]s in common law traditions play a much smaller role in developing case law than professors in civil law traditions.  Because court decisions in civil law traditions are brief and not amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called [[doctrine]] and may be published in treatises or in journals such as ''[[Recueil Dalloz]]'' in France.  Historically, common law courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, at the turn of the twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as [[Edward Coke|Coke]] and [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as [[persuasive authority]]; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic's restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in precedent. Thus common law systems are adopting one of the approaches long common in civil law jurisdictions.

Judges may refer to various types of [[persuasive authority]] to reach a decision in a case. Widely cited non-binding sources include legal [[encyclopedia]]s such as ''[[Corpus Juris Secundum]]'' and ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'',  or the published work of the [[Law Commission]] or the [[American Law Institute]]. Some bodies are given statutory powers to issue Guidance with persuasive authority or similar statutory effect, such as the [[Highway Code]].

In federal or multi-jurisdictional law systems there may exist conflicts between the various lower appellate courts. Sometimes these differences may not be resolved and it may be necessary to distinguish how the law is applied in one [[district]], province, division or [[appellate court|appellate department]]. Usually only an appeal accepted by the [[court of last resort]] will resolve such differences and, for many reasons, such appeals are often not granted.

Any court may seek to distinguish its present case from that of a binding precedent, in order to reach a different conclusion. The validity of such a distinction may or may not be accepted on appeal. An appellate court may also propound an entirely new and different analysis from that of junior courts, and may or may not be bound by its own previous decisions, or in any case may distinguish them on the facts.

Where there are several members of a court, there may be one or more judgments given; only the ratio decidendi of the majority can constitute a binding precedent, but all may be cited as persuasive, or their reasoning may be adopted in argument. Quite apart from the rules of precedent, the weight actually given to any reported judgment may depend on the reputation of both the reporter and the judges.

==Nordic nations==
The legal systems of the [[Nordic countries]] are sometimes included among the civil law systems, but as a separate branch, and sometimes counted as separate from the civil law tradition. In [[Sweden]], for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the Continental civil law systems. The two highest courts, the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] (''Högsta domstolen'') and the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''Regeringsrätten''), have the right to set precedent which is in practice (however not formally) binding on all future application of the law. Courts of appeal, both general courts (''hovrätter'') and administrative courts (''kammarrätter'') may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions may be overturned by higher courts.

'''Citizenship of the [[European Union]]''' (EU) is afforded to qualifying citizens of European Union [[Member state of the European Union|member states]]. It was given to the citizens of member states by the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]], at the same time as the European Community was gaining its own legal identity. The treaty established a direct legal relationship between that new legal identity and its citizens by establishing a directly elected European Parliament and the ability for citizens to bring cases directly to the ECJ, and has been in force since 1993. European Union citizenship is additional to national citizenship.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/citizen/|title=EU citizenship - European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU citizenship affords rights, freedoms and legal protections to all of its citizens.

EU citizens are also free to trade and transport goods, services and capital through EU borders, as in a national market, with no restrictions on capital movements or fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanpolicy.org/en/european-policies/single-market.html|title=The Four Freedoms|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens also have the right to vote in and run as a candidate in local elections in the country where they live, [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] and [[European Citizens' Initiative]].

Citizenship of the EU also confers the right to consular protection by embassies of other EU member states when a person's country of citizenship is not represented by an embassy or consulate in the country in which they require protection.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt; EU citizens also have the right to address the European Parliament, European Ombudsman, and EU agencies directly in their own language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:C:2012:326:FULL&amp;from=EN CONSOLIDATED VERSIONS OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION AND THE TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION]&lt;/ref&gt; provided the issue raised is within that institution's competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ue.wyklady.org/wyklad/815_uprawnienia-wynikajace-z-obywatelstwa-ue.html|title=Uprawnienia wynikające z obywatelstwa UE|website=ue.wyklady.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
EU citizenship was first introduced by the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and was extended by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Denmark |title=The Danish Opt-Outs |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/AboutDenmark/GovernmentPolitics/DenmarkAndTheEU/TheDanishOptouts/ |format= |doi= |accessdate=24 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014021403/http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/AboutDenmark/GovernmentPolitics/DenmarkAndTheEU/TheDanishOptouts |archivedate=14 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, the [[European Communities]] treaties provided guarantees for the free movement of economically active persons, but not, generally, for others. The 1951 [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=823 Article 69].&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] established a right to free movement for workers in these industries and the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=3800 Title 3].&lt;/ref&gt; provided for the free movement of workers and services.

However, the treaty provisions were interpreted by the [[European Court of Justice]] not as having a narrow economic purpose, but rather a wider social and economic purpose.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craig, P. |author2=de Búrca, G. |year = 2003|title = EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials|edition = 3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|location = Oxford, New York|isbn = 0-19-925608-X|pages = 706–711}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Levin'',&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61981J0053:EN:NOT Case 53/81] ''D.M. Levin v Staatssecretaris van Justitie''.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court found that the "freedom to take up employment was important, not just as a means towards the creation of a single market for the benefit of the member state economies, but as a right for the worker to raise her or his standard of living".&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt; Under the [[ECJ]] caselaw, the rights of free movement of workers applies regardless of the worker's purpose in taking up employment abroad,&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt; to both part-time and full-time work,&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt; and whether or not the worker required additional financial assistance from the member state into which he moves.&lt;ref name="Kempf"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61985J0139:EN:NOT Case 139/85] ''R.

In the case of ''Martinez Sala'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0085:EN:NOT Case C-85/96] ''María Martínez Sala v Freistaat Bayern''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Court of Justice]] held that the citizenship provisions provided substantive equal treatment rights alongside those already granted by union law. The case of Baumbast &lt;ref&gt;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61999CJ0413&lt;/ref&gt; later established that the right to equal treatment applies equally to both economically active and inactive citizens. Despite these broad interpretations, the landmark case of Dano &lt;ref&gt;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62013CJ0333&lt;/ref&gt; combined the criteria of freedom to move and equal treatment, citing them as inter-dependant, subsequently limiting the scope of Martinez Sala.

==Stated rights==
Historically, the main benefit of being a citizen of an EU country has been that of free movement. The free movement also applies to the citizens of [[European Economic Area]] countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EEA Agreement|url=http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement.aspx|publisher=European Free Trade Association|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Switzerland|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/switzerland/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the creation of EU citizenship, certain political rights came into being. The [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on the functioning of the European Union|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;ref name="TFEU" /&gt; provides for citizens to be "directly represented at Union level in the [[European Parliament]]" and  "to participate in the democratic life of the Union" ([[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on European Union|Treaty on the European Union]], Title II, Article 10). Specifically, the following rights are afforded:

;Political rights
* '''Voting in European elections''': a [[right to vote]] and [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|stand]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections to the European Parliament]], in any [[Member state of the European Union|EU member state]] (Article 22)
* '''Voting in municipal elections''': a right to vote and stand in [[local election]]s in an EU state other than their own, under the same conditions as the nationals of that state (Article 22)
* '''Accessing European government documents''': a right to access to European Parliament, [[Council of the European Union|Council]], and [[European Commission|Commission]] documents (Article 15).
* '''Petitioning Parliament and the Ombudsman''': the right to petition the [[European Parliament]] and the right to apply to the [[European Ombudsman]] in order to bring to his attention any cases of poor administration by the [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]] and bodies, with the exception of the legal bodies (Article 24)&lt;ref&gt;This right also extends to "any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State": [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html Treaty of Rome] (consolidated version), Article 194.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Language rights''': the right to apply to the [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]] in one of the [[Languages of the European Union|official languages]] and to receive a reply in that same language (Article 24).

;Rights of free movement
* '''Right to free movement and residence''': a right of [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|free movement and residence]] throughout the Union and the right to work in any position (including national civil services with the exception of those posts in the public sector that involve the exercise of powers conferred by public law and the safeguard of general interests of the State or local authorities (Article 21) for which however there is no one single definition);
* '''Freedom from discrimination on nationality''': a right not to be discriminated against on grounds of nationality within the scope of application of the Treaty (Article 18);

;Rights abroad
* '''Right to consular protection''': a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state).&lt;ref&gt;[[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free movement rights===
{{Politics of the European Union}}
;Article 21 Freedom to move and reside
Article 21 (1) of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on the functioning of the European Union|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;ref name="TFEU"/&gt; states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[European Court of Justice]] has remarked that, &lt;blockquote&gt;EU Citizenship is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States&lt;ref name="Grzelczyk"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61999J0184:EN:NOT Case C-184/99] ''Rudy Grzelczyk v Centre public d'aide sociale d'Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve'' .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ECJ has held that this Article confers a [[Direct effect|directly effective]] right upon citizens to reside in another Member State.&lt;ref name="Grzelczyk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumbast"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61999J0413:EN:NOT Case C-413/99] ''Baumbast and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department'', para. [85]-[91].&lt;/ref&gt; Before the case of ''Baumbast'',&lt;ref name="Baumbast" /&gt; it was widely assumed that non-economically active citizens had no rights to residence deriving directly from the EU Treaty, only from directives created under the Treaty. In ''Baumbast'', however, the ECJ held that (the then)&lt;ref&gt;Now article 20&lt;/ref&gt; Article 18 of the EC Treaty granted a generally applicable right to residency, which is limited by secondary legislation, but ''only'' where that secondary legislation is proportionate.&lt;ref name="kokottp5"&gt;[http://www.ecas.org/file_uploads/1055.pdf Durham European Law Institute, European Law Lecture 2005], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Member States can distinguish between nationals and Union citizens but only if the provisions satisfy the test of proportionality.&lt;ref name="Wyatt"&gt;{{cite book|title=European Union Law|first=Anthony|first2=Alan|first3=Michael|first4=Malcolm|first5=Eleanor|first6=Derrick|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|year=2006|isbn=978-0-421-92560-1|edition=5th|location=|pages=|id=|author-link3=Michael Dougan|author1=Arnull|author2=Dashwood|author3=Dougan|author4=Ross|author5=Spaventa|author6=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant EU citizens have a "legitimate expectation of a limited degree of financial solidarity... having regard to their degree of integration into the host society"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dougan, M.| title = The constitutional dimension to the case law on Union citizenship| journal=European Law Review| volume = 31| issue = 5| pages = 613–641| year = 2006 }}. See also [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62003J0209:EN:NOT Case C-209/03] ''R (Dany Bidar) v. London Borough of Ealing and Secretary of State for Education and Skills'', para. [56]-[59].&lt;/ref&gt; Length of time is a particularly important factor when considering the degree of integration.

The ECJ's case law on citizenship has been criticised for subjecting an increasing number of national rules to the proportionality assessment.&lt;ref name="Wyatt" /&gt;

;Article 45 Freedom of movement to work
Article 45 of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on the functioning of the European Union|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;ref name="TFEU"/&gt; states that &lt;blockquote&gt;1. Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Union.&lt;br /&gt;2. Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

State employment reserved exclusively for nationals varies between member states. For example, training as a barrister in Britain and Ireland is not reserved for nationals, while the corresponding French course qualifies one as a 'juge' and hence can only be taken by French citizens. However, it is broadly limited to those roles that exercise a significant degree of public authority, such as judges, police, the military, diplomats, senior civil servants or politicians. Note that not all Member States choose to restrict all of these posts to nationals.

Much of the existing secondary legislation and case law was consolidated&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite web| last = European Commission| authorlink = European Commission| title = Right of Union citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States| url = http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/lifelong_learning/l33152_en.htm| accessdate = 26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Citizens' Rights [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely]] within the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0038:EN:NOT Directive 2004/38/EC] of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Limitations
New member states may undergo transitional regimes for [[Freedom of movement for workers]], during which their nationals only enjoy restricted access to labour markets in other member states. EU member states are permitted to keep restrictions on citizens of the newly acceded countries for a maximum of seven years after accession. For the EFTA states (Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), the maximum is nine years.

Following the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004 enlargement]], three "old" member states—[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], Sweden and the United Kingdom—decided to allow unrestricted access to their labour markets.  By December 2009, all but two member states—[[Austria]] and Germany—had completely dropped controls. These restrictions too expired on 1 May 2011.&lt;ref name="euractiv-free-movement"/&gt;

Following the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|2007 enlargement]], all pre-2004 member states except [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]] imposed restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian citizens, as did two member states that joined in 2004: [[Malta]] and [[Hungary]]. As of November 2012, all but 8 EU countries have dropped restrictions entirely. These restrictions too expired on 1 January 2014. Norway opened its labour market in June 2012, while Switzerland kept restrictions in place until 2016.&lt;ref name="euractiv-free-movement"&gt;{{cite web |title=Free movement of labour in the EU 27 |date=25 November 2009 |publisher=Euractiv |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/socialeurope/free-movement-labour-eu-27/article-129648# |accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2013 enlargement of the European Union|2013 enlargement]], some countries implemented restrictions on Croatian nationals following the country's EU accession on 1 July 2013.  As of July 2013,  all but 13 EU countries have dropped restrictions entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/abroad/work-permits/index_en.htm|title=Work permits|work=Your Europe - Citizens}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Home Office has announced a bill to this effect.&lt;ref name="croatia"&gt;{{cite web| authorlink = UK Home Office| title = UK bill proposing work restrictions on Croatian nationals| url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/immigration/croatia-eu-accession/| date=18 October 2012| accessdate = 16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==
There is no common EU policy on the acquisition of European citizenship as it is supplementary to national citizenship. (EC citizenship was initially granted to all citizens of European Community member states in 1994 by the Maastricht treaty concluded between the member states of the European community under international law, this changed into citizenship of the European Union in 2007 when the European Community changed its legal identity to be the European Union. Many more people became EU citizens when each new EU member state was added and, at each point, all the existing member states ratified the adjustments to the treaties to allow the creation of those extra citizenship rights for the individual. European citizenship is also generally granted at the same time as national citizenship is granted; likewise it is removed at the point of removal of national citizenship). [[:s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Article 20]] (1) of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on the functioning of the European Union|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;ref name="TFEU"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF Treaty on the Function of the European Union] (consolidated version)&lt;/ref&gt; states that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While nationals of Member States are citizens of the union, "It is for each Member State, having due regard to Union law, to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990J0369:EN:NOT Case C-396/90] ''Micheletti v. Delegación del Gobierno en Cantabria'', which established that dual-nationals of a Member State and a non-Member State were entitled to freedom of movement; [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61999J0192:EN:NOT case C-192/99] ''R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p. Manjit Kaur''. It is not an abuse of process to acquire nationality in a Member State solely to take advantage of free movement rights in other Member States: [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62002J0200:EN:NOT case C-200/02] ''Kunqian Catherine Zhu and Man Lavette Chen v Secretary of State for the Home Department''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there is a great variety in rules and practices with regard to the acquisition and loss of citizenship in EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eup.sagepub.com/content/13/3/390.abstract Dronkers, J. and M. Vink (2012). Explaining Access to Citizenship in Europe: How Policies Affect Naturalisation Rates. European Union Politics 13(3) 390-412]; [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691831003763914 Vink, M. and G.R. de Groot (2010). Citizenship Attribution in Western Europe: International Framework and Domestic Trends. Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 36(5) 713-734].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions for overseas territories===
In practice this means that a member state may withhold EU citizenship from certain groups of citizens, most commonly in [[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas territories of member states]] outside the EU.

For example, owing to the complexity of [[British nationality law]], a 1982 declaration by Her Majesty's Government defined who would be deemed to be a British "national" for European Union purposes:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Declaration by the United Kingdom on 31 December 1982 on the definition of the term “nationals”|Wikisource: Declaration by the UK on 31 December 1982 on the definition of the term "nationals"]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[British citizen]]s, as defined by Part I of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]].
* [[British subject]]s, within the meaning of Part IV of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]], but only if they also possess the 'right of abode' under UK immigration law.
* [[British overseas territories citizen]]s who derive their citizenship by a connection to [[Gibraltar]].

This declaration therefore excludes from EU citizenship various historic categories of British citizenship generally associated with former British colonies, such as [[British Overseas Citizen]]s, [[British National (Overseas)|British Nationals (Overseas)]], [[British protected person|British Protected Persons]] and any [[British subject]] who does not have the 'right of abode' under British immigration law.

In 2002, with the passing of the [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]], EU citizenship was extended to almost all British overseas territories citizens when they were automatically granted full British citizenship (with the exception of those with an association to the British sovereign base areas of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] on the Island of Cyprus).&lt;ref&gt;British Overseas Territories Act 2002, s.3(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This has effectively granted them full EU citizenship rights, including free movement rights, although only residents of [[Gibraltar]] have the right to vote in European Parliament elections. In contrast, [[British citizens]] in the [[Crown Dependencies]] of [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] have always been considered to be EU citizens but, unlike residents of the [[British overseas territories]], are prohibited from exercising EU free movement rights under the terms of the UK Accession Treaty if they have no other connection with the UK (e.g. they have lived in the UK for five years, were born in the UK, or have parents or grandparents born in the UK) and have no EU voting rights. (see [[Guernsey passport]], [[Isle of Man passport]], [[Jersey passport]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1972:073:FULL:EN:PDF Protocol 3 to the 1972 Accession Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example are the residents of [[Faroe Islands]] of Denmark who, though in possession of full Danish citizenship, are outside the EU and are explicitly excluded from EU citizenship under the terms of the Danish Accession Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1972:073:FULL:EN:PDF Protocol 2 to the 1972 Accession Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to residents of the Danish territory of [[Greenland]] who, whilst also outside the EU as a result of the 1984 [[Greenland Treaty]], do receive EU citizenship as this was not specifically excluded by the terms of that treaty (see [[Faroe Islands and the European Union]]; [[Greenland and the European Union]]).

A person who is not descended from a Portuguese citizen becomes a Portuguese citizen at the moment of birth, by the effect of the law itsef, if that person was born in Portugal and:
* would otherwise be stateless
* is a foundling
* is born to non-citizen birth parents one of whom, at least, is resident in Portugal at the time of the birth (independently of the legality of such residency), but only if that parent resident in Portugal was also born in Portugal, and provided that such residency in Portugal is not due to service to a foreign State.

A person who is not descended from a Portuguese citizen and who is not covered by the conditions for automatic attribution of nationality by birth in Portugal set out above, has a right to declare that he or she wants to become a Portuguese citizen, and that person becomes a natural-born Portuguese citizen, with effects retroactive to the momement of birth, upon the registration of such declaration in the Portuguese Civil Registry (by application made by that person, once of age, or by a legal representative of that person, during minority), if that person was born in Portugal and:
* had, at the date of birth, a birth parent legally resident in Portugal for at least 5 years, either enjoying Treaty rights (namely, the European Union freedom of movement, for citizens of other Member States of the Union, or the special conditions for settlement in Portugal by citizens of the Member States of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries), or in possession of any of the categories of residence permit issued by the Portuguese State, but provided that such parent's residency in Portugal was not due to service to a foreign State.
|
Portuguese nationality is transmitted by descent under one of the following conditions:
{{hidden begin|title = Conditions}}
* a child becomes a Portuguese national at birth, and nationality is recognised by the law itself if at least one of the parents of that child is a Portuguese national and the birth takes place in Portugal or in a territory administered by Portugal. (That form of transmission of nationality, combining descent from a Portuguese parent and birth in Portugal is the main form of transmission of the Portuguese nationality). No registration is necessary for the transmission of nationality in that case.
* Nationality is also recognised by the law itself at birth to a child born outside Portugal, provided that the said child has at least one Portuguese parent, and the birth takes place outside Portugal due to the parent's service to the Portuguese State abroad. No registration is necessary for the transmission of nationality in that case,
* Nationality retroactive to the moment of birth is recognised by the law to a person born outside Portugal if at least one of the birth parents is a Portuguese national, but only if that person's birth is registered before the Portuguese Civil Registry or if a declaration by that person, stating that he or she wants to be a Portuguese citizen, is lodged with the Portuguese Civil Registry. The registration of the birth can be applied for, as a matter of right, at any time during the person's life, by the parents, by another legal guardian of a minor, or by the person himself, if the person is already of age (18 years old or older), and also by the legal guardian of an incapacitated adult. The registration of the birth or of the declaration, can be made at any time during the person's life, but the descendants of that person cannot ask for the registration under this rule after that person is dead. Thus, if one generation is skipped, the next generation cannot register under this rule. Registration can be made either in Portugal or by means of a Portuguese Consulate abroad. If the registration is applied to by means of a Consulate, the Consulate processes the request and sends the necessary papers to the central registry office of the Portuguese Civil Registry in Lisbon. Given that the registration produces legal effects retroactive to the moment of birth, the person, once registered as a Portuguese citizen, is recognised by law as a natural born citizen.(Sons and daughters of that person, even if born before the moment of that person's registration, and even if born outside Portugal are therefore themselves able to apply for registration as Portuguese citizens, because their parent is a Portuguese citizen since birth. Accordingly, this form of transmission of nationality, combining descent and registration, allows for the transmission of Portuguese nationality by parentage from generation to generation indefinitely, even if the members of the successive generations are born outside Portugal and never reside in Portugal, provided that registration is not skipped by one generation). Many descendants of Portuguese immigrants, especially in Brazil and other Lusophone countries, hold dual nationality, being recognised as natural born Portuguese citizens upon registration under that rule.
* Nationality retroactive to the moment of birth is recognized by law upon registration to a grandson or granddaughter of a Portuguese citizen who, having demonstrated that he or she has an effective connection to the Portuguese national community, declares to the Portuguese Civil Registry his or her will to become a Portuguese citizen, provided that, at the time of such declaration, the person has had no criminal conviction for a crime punishable under Portuguese law with a prison term of 3 years or more. The effective connection to the Portuguese national community is assumed by the law itself in certain cases (legal residence in Portugal for three years with registration as a taxpayer and as a user of the national health service, plus knowledge of the Portuguese language, or legal residence in Portugal for five years), and in other cases (ownership of real estate in Portugal, or constant travel to Portugal, or membership of Portuguese cultural associations abroad, or legal residence in Portugal for less than three years, etc.) it needs to be evaluated by the Government by means of an administrative procedure submitted by the Registrar to the Justice Minister. Once connection to the national community is ascertained (either by the Registrar recognising that the law itself assumes such connection or by the decision of the Justice Minister) interested person is then invited to register his or her birth at the Portuguese Civil Registry, and the attribution of nationality becomes a matter of right. The process becomes moot if the interested party does not follow through with the birth registration within six months of being notified to do so. Once the birth is registered, the interested person is thereafter recognized as a natural-born citizen. This form of attribution of nationality for grandchildren of Portuguese citizens, created in 2017, combining descent and registration of birth but requiring evidence of effective connection to the Portuguese community, is available for descendants of Portuguese nationals who otherwise would not be able to become natural-born citizens because the registration of one generation was missed. Because the nationality is retroactive to the moment of birth, sons and daughters of that new citizen, even if born before registration and outside Portugal, then become themselves able to be recognized as natural-born citizens as a matter of right, by having their births registered under the rule of registration for sons and daughters of Portuguese citizens.

{{hidden begin|title = Naturalisation conditions}}
* Naturalisation can be granted at the State's discretion to persons who are of age and who reside in Portugal for at least six years on a valid permit, provided that they demonstrate knowledge of the Portuguese language and have never been convicted of a crime punishable under Portuguese law with a prison term of 3 years or more.
* Naturalisation can be granted to persons who do not reside in Portugal, or who do not satisfy the condition of residing in Portugal for at least six years on a valid permit, provided that the person applying is a second degree relative (grandson or granddaughter, or a sibling)  of a Portuguese citizen.
* the Portuguese Government can also grant naturalisation to foreigners who are of age and who meet neither the six-year legal residency requirement nor the knowledge of the Portuguese language requirement, provided that the person was a Portuguese national in the past, or that the applicant is held to be a descendant of Portuguese citizens, or a member of Portuguese communities abroad, or provided that the applicant is found to have rendered, or is expected to render in the future relevant services to the Portuguese State or to the national community.
* Minors born in Portugal to foreign parents can by be granted Portuguese Nationality by the Government, if, at the time of the request made on their behalf by their legal representatives, they have completed the first cycle of the basic education in Portugal, and if one of the parents legally resides in Portugal for at least five years. The requirements of being of age at the time of the request and of legally residing in Portugal for at least six years are waived with respect to a minor meeting those conditions, but the minor must still demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the Portuguese language, and must not have been convicted to crimes that carry under Portuguese law a prison penalty of three years or more.
* the Portuguese Government can also grant naturalisation to foreigners who prove that they descend from Portuguese Sephardic Jews and who demonstrate that they belong to a traditional Jewish Sephardic community of Portuguese origin;
* Nationality is granted as a matter of right (and not by naturalisation in the strict sense), but without retroactive effect, to a person who is a son or a daughter of someone who acquires Portuguese Nationality by naturalisation, provided that the person was a minor at the time of the parent's naturalisation, and provided that the person in question, either represented by his parents or by another legal guardian (during minority or incapacity), or by himself (once of age) applies to be registered as a Portuguese national.

==Loss of EU citizenship due to member state withdrawal==
{{See also|Withdrawal from the European Union}}
{{Original research section|date=January 2017}}
The general rule for losing EU citizenship is that European citizenship is lost if member state nationality is lost,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilecproject.eu/sites/default/files/GUIDELINES%20INVOLUNTARY%20LOSS%20OF%20EUROPEAN%20CITIZENSHIP%20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but the automatic loss of EU citizenship as a result of a member state withdrawing from the EU is the subject of debate.&lt;ref name="ir.lawnet.fordham.edu"&gt;http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2324&amp;context=ilj&lt;/ref&gt;

One school of legal thought indicates that the Maastricht treaty created the European Union as a legal entity, it then also created the status of EU citizen which gave an individual relationship between the EU and its citizens, and a status of EU citizen. [[Clemens Rieder]] suggests a case can be made that "[n]one of the Member States were forced to confer the status of EU citizenship on their citizens but once they have, according to this argument, they cannot simply withdraw this status.". In this situation, no EU citizen would involuntarily lose their citizenship due to their nation's withdrawal from the EU.&lt;ref name="ir.lawnet.fordham.edu"/&gt;

Another school of legal thought indicates that the Maastricht treaty created the European Union as a legal entity, but it does not have a direct legal relationship with its citizens and EU citizenship is not comparable with any other citizenships and is not additional to the member state citizenship. EU citizenship is only a special feature that member states can offer their citizens. The relationship between an EU citizen and the EU as an organization, is therefore only legally through the member state. In this situation, when the member country leaves, the ex-member country can no longer offer that special feature to its citizens, thus (for example with respect to [[Brexit]]) British citizens would no longer be EU citizens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/577971/EPRS_BRI(2016)577971_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2016|reason=The cited source does not support all of this paragraph. It is not clear what it is intended to support}}{{Request quotation|date=November 2016}}

It is likely that only a court case before the European Court of Justice would be able to properly determine the correct legal position in this regard, as there is no definitive legal certainty in this area. As of 7 February 2018, the District Court of Amsterdam decided to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/Brexit/ECJ-asked-to-rule-on-Britons-EU-citizenship&lt;/ref&gt; but the state of the Netherlands has appealed against this referral decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/Brexit/Appeal-allowed-against-post-Brexit-EU-citizenship-bid |date=5 March 2018 |title=Appeal allowed against post-Brexit EU citizenship bid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenland===
All citizens of [[Greenland]] are eligible for EU citizenship under its [[Greenland–European Union relations#OCT status|OCT status]], even following [[Withdrawal from the European Union#Greenland|Greenland's withdrawal from the EU]] in 1985, because they remain eligible for Danish passports (which confer EU citizenship) or Greenlandic (which do not).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passport - Greenlandic and Danish|url=http://www.sullissivik.gl/English/Passport-Greenlandic-and-Danish?sc_lang=kl-GL|website=www.sullissivik.gl|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenland, however, was not a member state of the EU and is not a sovereign nation state unlike, for example, the United Kingdom.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Brexit}}
As a result of the [[Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union]], the opinion of both the European and British governments has been that British citizens would lose their European citizenship and European citizens would lose their automatic right to stay in the UK. To account for the problems arising from this, a provisional agreement outlines the right of UK citizens to remain in the EU (and vice versa) where they are resident in the Union on the day of the UK's withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/services/your-rights/Brexit_en EU citizens' rights and Brexit], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/08/main-points-of-agreement-uk-eu-brexit-deal Main points of agreement between UK and EU in Brexit deal], the guardian 8 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The only exception to this is citizens who possess dual citizenship with an EU state. This eligibility includes the majority of British citizens from Northern Ireland, who are automatically entitled to Irish citizenship as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/irish_citizenship/who_can_become_an_irish_citizen.html|title=Who can become an Irish citizen?|last=Citizensinformation.ie|website=www.citizensinformation.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Citizens' Initiatives to challenge Brexit====
As a result of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit referendum]], there were 3 [[European Citizens' Initiative]]s that were registered which sought to protect the rights and/or status of British EU citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/open/details/2017/000001|title=European Free Movement Instrument - Initiative details - European Citizens' Initiative - European Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123211940/http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/open/details/2017/000001|archive-date=2017-01-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/open/details/2017/000003|title=EU Citizenship for Europeans: United in Diversity in Spite of jus soli and jus sanguinis - Initiative details - European Citizens' Initiative - European Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330080504/http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/open/details/2017/000003|archive-date=2017-03-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/open/details/2017/000005|title=Retaining European Citizenship - Initiative details - European Citizens' Initiative - European Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726154251/http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/open/details/2017/000005|archive-date=2017-07-26|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of these three initiatives, the one with the strongest legal argument was registered on March 27, 2017 and officially named "[http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/open/details/2017/000003 EU Citizenship for Europeans: United in Diversity in Spite of jus soli and jus sanguinis]". It is clear that the initiative abides by the first school of thought mentioned above because the [http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/documents/3513 annex] that was submitted with the initiative clearly makes reference to [[Clemens Rieder|Rieder]]'s work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In an article titled "[http://vip.politicsmeanspolitics.com/2017/09/06/extending-full-eu-citizenship-to-uk-nationals-especially-after-brexit/ &lt;nowiki&gt;Extending [full] EU citizenship to UK nationals ESPECIALLY after Brexit&lt;/nowiki&gt;]" and published with the online magazine ''Politics Means Politics'', the creator of the Initiative argues that UK nationals ''must'' keep their EU citizenship by detaching citizenship of the European Union from Member State nationality. Perhaps the most convincing and authoritative source that is cited in the article is the acting President of the [[European Court of Justice]], [[Koen Lenaerts]] who published an article where he explains how the Court analyzes and decides cases dealing with citizenship of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenaerts|first=Koen|date=19 October 2015|title=EU citizenship and the European Court of Justice's ‘stone-by-stone’ approach|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2351667415000062|journal=International Comparative Jurisprudence|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lenaerts and the creator of the Initiative refer to rulings by the [[European Court of Justice]] which state that:
* “''Citizenship of the Union is intended to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States''” (inter alia: [[Grzelczyk v Centre Public d’Aide Sociale d’Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve|''Grzelczyk'']], paragraph 31; [[Baumbast and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department|''Baumbast and R'']], paragraph 82; ''Garcia Avello'', paragraph 22; [[Chen v Home Secretary|''Zhu and Chen'']], parag. 25; ''Rottmann'', parag. 43; ''Zambrano'', parag. 41, etc.) 
* “''Article 20 TFEU precludes national measures that have the effect of depriving citizens of the Union of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of their status as citizens of the Union''” (Inter alia: ''Rottmann'', parag. 42; ''Zambrano'', parag. 42; ''McCarthy'', parag 47; ''Dereci'', parag. 66; ''O and Others'', parag. 45; ''CS'', parag. 26; ''Chavez-Vilchez and Others'', parag. 61, etc.)
Based on the argument presented by "[http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/open/details/2017/000003 EU Citizenship for Europeans]" and its creator, Brexit is a textbook definition of a Member State depriving a European citizen of his or her rights as EU citizens, and therefore a legal act is necessary in order to protect not just rights but the status of EU citizen itself. Despite variances in interpretation of some points of law raised by the Initiative, the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2017.081.01.0018.01.ENG European Commission's decision to register the initiative] confirms the strength and merit of the initiative's legal argument.

====Associate Citizenship====
A proposal made first by [[Guy Verhofstadt]], the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, to help cover the rights of UK citizens post-Brexit would see UK citizens able to opt-out of the loss of EU citizenship as a result of the general clauses of the withdrawal agreement. This would allow visa free working on the basis of their continuing rights as EU citizens. This, he termed, "associate citizenship". This has been discussed with the UK's negotiator [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-keep-european-citizenship-free-movement-passport-article-50-european-parliament-leaked-a7656281.html|title=Brits should not lose EU citizenship rights after Brexit, leaked European Parliament plan says|date=29 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/u-k-is-open-to-talking-about-associate-citizenship-after-brexit|title=U.K. Open to Talking About Associate Citizenship After Brexit|date=2 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was made clear by the UK government that there would be no role for EU institutions concerning its citizens, effectively removing the proposal as a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-davis-repeal/ecj-will-have-no-future-role-in-interpreting-uk-law-post-brexit-uk-minister-idUSKBN1711G3|title=ECJ will have no future role in interpreting UK law post Brexit: UK...|date=30 March 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danish opt-out==
{{further|Opt-outs in the European Union}}
Denmark obtained four opt-outs from the Maastricht Treaty following the treaty's initial rejection in a [[Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum, 1992|1992 referendum]]. The opt-outs are outlined in the [[Edinburgh Agreement (1992)|Edinburgh Agreement]] and concern the EMU (as above), the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]] (CSDP), [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|Justice and Home Affairs]] (JHA) and the citizenship of the European Union. The citizenship opt-out stated that European citizenship did not replace national citizenship; this opt-out was rendered meaningless when the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] adopted the same wording for all members. The policy of recent Danish governments has been to hold referendums to abolish these opt-outs, including formally abolishing the citizenship opt-out which is still technically active even if redundant.

==Popularity==

Around 500,000 British people applied for Irish citizenship during the first half of 2017 with the possible intention of keeping European Union Citizenship after Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-news-irish-passport-apllications-british-citizens-ireland-eu-rights-ambassador-daniel-a7876186.html|title='Extraordinary' number of Britons are applying for Irish passports because of Brexit|date=4 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984''' is a [[Law of the United States|United States federal law]] authored to facilitate the [[Privately held company|private enterprise]] of the [[commercialization of space]] and [[space technology]]. The [[Act of Congress]] set forth the quest to acquire innovative equipment and services offered by [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ventures from the [[information technology]] services, [[Remote sensing|remote sensing technology]], and [[telecommunication]]s industries. The Act recognized the United States private sector as having the capability to develop commercial [[launch vehicle]]s, orbital [[satellite]]s, and [[private spaceflight|operate]] private [[Launch pad|launch sites]] and services. The Act also assigned the duties of overseeing and coordinating commercial launches, issuing of licenses and permits, and promotion of safety standards to the Secretary of [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title51/subtitle5/chapter509&amp;edition=prelim |title= Chapter 509 — Commercial Space Launch Activities |website=United States Code ~ Office of the Law Revision Counsel |publisher= U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate= 22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The H.R. 3942 [[legislation]] was enacted by the 98th Congressional session and signed by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|40th President of the United States]] Ronald Reagan on October 30, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=39335 |title= Ronald Reagan: "Statement on Signing the Commercial Space Launch Act ," October 30, 1984 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project |accessdate= 19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 1970s, the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] began to look for ways to outsource the use of its launching facilities and services to private companies such as [[Communications Satellite Corporation|COMSAT]], [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]], and [[Western Union]].&lt;ref&gt;McLucas, John L. ''Space Commerce.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1991. Page 89.&lt;/ref&gt; This search was due to the fact that maintaining, modifying, launching, and other duties required to launch expendable launch vehicles cost upwards of billions of dollars. Once the [[Space Shuttle|space shuttle]] became operational, NASA and the [[United States Air Force]] began using it almost exclusively. In order to accommodate the heavy weight of the space shuttle launch system, the USAF spent billions of dollars modifying one launch pad in [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. However, it was never used.&lt;ref&gt;McLucas, John L. ''Space Commerce.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1991. Page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon realizing the economic benefits of utilizing private space companies, the House Science and Technologies Commission proposed H.R. 3942 which eventually became Public Law 98-575, or the Commercial Space Act of 1984.

==Provisions of the Act==
Title 51 [[United States Code]] Subtitle V and Chapter 509 was compiled as twenty-three [[code of law]] sections to vitalize commercial opportunities and space launch services for the [[NASA|Space programme of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ314/pdf/PLAW-111publ314.pdf |title=Enactment of Title 51 - National and Commercial Space Programs ~ P.L. 111-314 |date=December 18, 2010 |series=124 Stat. 3328 ~ House Bill 3237 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3237 |title=H.R. 3237 ~ Charles "Pete" Conrad Astronomy Awards Act |date=July 16, 2009 |series=P.L. 111-314 ~ 124 Stat. 3328 |publisher=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compassionate conservatism''' is an American{{sfn|Olasky|2000|pp=xi-xii}}{{sfn|Olasky|2000|p=1}} [[political philosophy]] that stresses using traditionally [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] techniques and concepts in order to improve the general welfare of society.  The term itself is often credited to the American historian and politician [[Doug Wead]], who used it as the title of a speech in 1979, although its origins lie in [[paternalism]].&lt;ref name="McAdams2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan P. McAdams|title=George W. Bush and the Redemptive Dream: A Psychological Portrait|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QtpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134|date=27 October 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-978092-1|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This label and philosophy has been espoused by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politicians since then though in recent times it has been strongly associated with former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], who commonly used the term to describe his personal views.&lt;ref name="McAdams2010" /&gt; The term has also been used in the United Kingdom by former Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], and in [[New Zealand]] by former [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[John Key]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Audrey |title=Budget 2015: How it affects you |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11452450 |accessdate=8 September 2018 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=21 May 2015 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
Historian and presidential advisor [[Doug Wead]] may have been the first person to use the phrase ''compassionate conservative''. In 1977, Wead wrote a book about [[Kolkata]], [[India]], entitled ''The Compassionate Touch''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Compassionate Touch'', Doug Wead, [[Bethany House]], 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he gave a popular speech entitled "The Compassionate Conservative" at the annual Washington Charity Dinner. Tapes of the speech were sold across the country at corporate seminars.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Weisberg, The Bush Tragedy, Random House, 2008. Page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wead contended that the policies of Republican [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] should be motivated by compassion, not protecting the status quo. And Wead declared himself to be "a bleeding heart conservative," meaning that he cared for people and sincerely believed that a free marketplace was better for the poor.

In 1981, in a perhaps-unrelated usage, [[Vernon Jordan]] of the [[National Urban League]] said, of the [[Reagan administration]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', July 23, 1981, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I do not challenge the conservatism of this Administration. I do challenge its failure to exhibit a compassionate conservatism that adapts itself to the realities of a society ridden by class and race distinction.|Vernon Jordan}}

In 1982, Wead co-authored with [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[United States Secretary of Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], [[James G. Watt]], the book ''The Courage of a Conservative'' and developed his ideas further in chapter five of the book, which was entitled "The Compassionate Conservative."&lt;ref&gt;''The Courage of a Conservative'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[U.S. Representative]] [[James R. Jones]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Oklahoma|OK]]) told ''[[The New York Times]]'':&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', November 8, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I think we should adopt the slogan of ''compassionate conservatism''...We can be fiscally conservative without losing our commitment to the needy and we must redirect our policy in that direction.|Rep. James R. Jones}}

Earlier the same year Republican [[Ray Shamie]] proclaimed that "I believe in a visionary and compassionate conservatism"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', September 20, 1984, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1986, Wead wrote an article for the ''Christian Herald'', describing then-vice-president [[George H. W. Bush]], to whom he served as an aide, as a "compassionate conservative."&lt;ref&gt;"George Bush: Where Does He Stand?", Doug Wead, ''Christian Herald'', June 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist [[Jacob Weisberg]], [[George W. Bush]], George H. W. Bush's son, first picked up the term "compassionate conservative" from Wead, in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Weisberg]], The Bush Tragedy, [[Random House]], 2008. Page 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, when Doug Wead ran for U.S. Representative from [[Arizona]], he wrote a campaign book entitled ''Time for a Change''. The first chapter was called "The Compassionate Conservative" and outlined Wead's philosophy that the masses didn't care if [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] policies worked if the attitude and purpose behind the policies were uncaring.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Wead, ''Time for a Change'', 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some insist the doctrine was invented by Dr. [[Marvin Olasky]], who went on to memorialize it in his books ''Renewing American Compassion'' (1996) and ''Compassionate Conservatism: What it is, What it Does, and How it Can Transform America'' (2000), and [[Myron Magnet]] of the [[Manhattan Institute]]. Olasky has been called the "godfather of compassionate conservatism".&lt;ref&gt;Olasky, Martin, ''Renewing American Compassion'', "God promises blessings for obedience, but never an all-expense paid vacation.  Adam's work was not endlessly frustrating... That all changed with man's independent and rebellious grasping for the knowledge of good and evil.  Man must now do tiring work to live." p. 169; "Lazy hands make a man poor." (quoting Proverbs); "If a man does not work, he shall not eat." (quoting Paul, Second Thessalonians).&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was popularized when [[George W. Bush]] adopted it as one of his key slogans during [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|his 2000 presidential campaign]] against [[Al Gore]]. Bush also wrote the foreword to Olasky's ''Compassionate Conservatism''. Olasky said others had come up with the term first.

==As a political descriptor==

===Use in the 1990s===
Compassionate conservatism has been defined as the belief that [[conservatism]] and [[compassion]] complement each other.  A compassionate conservative might see the social problems of the [[United States]], such as [[health care]] or [[immigration]], as issues that are better solved through cooperation with private companies, charities, and religious institutions rather than directly through government departments. As former Bush chief speechwriter [[Michael Gerson]] put it, "Compassionate conservatism is the theory that the government should encourage the effective provision of social services without providing the service itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009135 |title=Opinion, Editorials, Columns, Op-Ed, Letters to the Editor, Commentary - Wall Street Journal - Wsj.com |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |date=2002-10-03 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnet and Olasky said 19th century compassionate conservatism was based in part on the [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine of [[original sin]], which held that “Man is sinful and likely to want something for nothing. … Man’s sinful nature leads to indolence.” (Olasky, ''Renewing American Compassion'', 64, 41).

In the words of Magnet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_wsj-what_is_compassionate_con.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031204140910/http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_wsj-what_is_compassionate_con.htm |date=December 4, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Compassionate conservatives [...] offer a new way of thinking about the poor. They know that telling the poor that they are mere passive victims, whether of racism or of vast economic forces, is not only false but also destructive, paralyzing the poor with thoughts of their own helplessness and inadequacy. The poor need the larger society's moral support; they need to hear the message of personal responsibility and self-reliance, the optimistic assurance that if they try – as they must – they will make it. They need to know, too, that they can't blame "the system" for their own wrongdoing.|Myron Magnet|The Wall Street Journal}}

Compassionate conservative philosophy argues for policies in support of [[nuclear family|traditional families]], [[welfare reform]] to promote individual responsibility (cf. [[workfare]]), active policing, standards-based schools (cf. [[No Child Left Behind Act]]), and assistance (economic or otherwise) to poor countries around the world.

[[U.S. president]] [[George W. Bush]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/04/20020430.html |title=Fact Sheet: Compassionate Conservatism |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"It is compassionate to actively help our citizens in need. It is conservative to insist on accountability and results."|President George W. Bush}}

Bush began his presidency hoping to make compassionate conservatism his centerpiece. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], he focused less on this theme, but, according to professor and author [[Ira Chernus]], its fundamental ideas became central in his rhetoric about the [[War on Terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views01/1110-05.ht |accessdate=October 5, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception and criticism===
[[Nicholas Lemann]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine in 2015, wrote that George W. Bush's "description of himself, in the 2000 campaign, as a 'compassionate conservative' was brilliantly vague&amp;mdash;liberals heard it as 'I'm not all that conservative,' and conservatives heard it as 'I'm deeply religious.' It was about him as a person, not a program."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lemann, [http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-value-of-jebs-unfortunate-comments The Real Value of Jeb's "Unfortunate Comments,"] ''New Yorker'' (October 7, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 1999 speech to the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], then-President [[Bill Clinton]] criticized Bush's "compassionate conservative" self-description, saying: "This 'compassionate conservatism' has a great ring to it, you know? It sounds so good. And I've really worked hard to try to figure out what it means... I made an honest effort, and near as I can tell, here's what it means: It means, 'I like you. I do. And I would like to be for the [[U.S. patients' bill of rights|patients' bill of rights]] and I'd like to be for closing the [[gun show loophole]], and I'd like not to squander the surplus and, you know, save Social Security and Medicare for the next generation. I'd like to raise the [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]]. I'd like to do these things. But I just can't, and I feel terrible about it.'"&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Chen, [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/15/news/mn-56247 Clinton Picks at Bush's 'Compassionate' Label], ''Los Angeles times'' (July 15, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in December 2005, then-British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], speaking in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], said: "the only difference between compassionate conservatism and conservatism is that under compassionate conservatism they tell you they're not going to help you but they're really sorry about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051214/debtext/51214-03.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 14 Dec 2005 (pt 3) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2005-12-14 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics of George W. Bush criticized the phrase "compassionate conservatism" as simply sugarcoating, an empty phrase to make traditional conservatism sound more appealing to moderate voters. Liberal commentator [[Joe Conason]], noting Bush's policy of tax cuts, wrote in 2003 that "so far, being a 'compassionate conservative' appears to mean nothing very different from being a hardhearted, stingy, old-fashioned conservative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20030915/conason/3 |title=September 15, 2003 |publisher=The Nation |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Others on the left have viewed it as an effort to remove America's social safety net out of the hands of the government and give it to Christian churches.  "Liberals make a big mistake if they dismiss 'compassionate conservatism' as just a hypocritical catch phrase," wrote [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] religion professor Ira Chernus.  "For the right, it is a serious scheme to give tax dollars to churches through so-called '[[faith-based initiatives]].'" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views01/1110-05.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018053640/http://www.commondreams.org/views01/1110-05.htm |date=October 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Prize–winning [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] economist and columnist [[Paul Krugman]] has called it a "[[Dog-whistle politics|dog whistle]]" to the religious right, referencing Marvin Olasky's ''The Tragedy of American Compassion,'' who believed the poor must help themselves and that poverty was the fault not of society but of the poor and of social workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/compassionate-conservatism/|title=Compassionate conservatism|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 February 2015|date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman endorses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/busybodies|title=Busybodies|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 February 2015|date=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digby (blogger)|Digby's]] analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/post-modern-slavery-by-digby-today-amy.html |title=Hullabaloo |publisher=Digbysblog.blogspot.com |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that right-wing compassionate 'charity' assumes that the giver has the right to investigate and dictate the life of the receiver, even for the smallest charity.

Conversely, the phrase has also been attacked from the right. [[John J. DiIulio, Jr.]] wrote that Bush's "Duty of Hope" speech, delivered in [[Indianapolis]] in May 1999, drew a "negative reaction from his party's right wings. ... Many Republican conservative activists hated the center-hugging 'compassionate conservative.' Others favored it, but only as a rhetorical [[Trojan Horse]]. If a 'compassionate conservative' was actually a government-shrinking libertarian in religious drag, then fine.  But, if Bush really meant what he said, [[Al Gore|Gore]]-like, about volunteerism not being enough .... or about rejecting as 'destructive' the Reagan-tested idea that government itself is the main problem, then many conservative Republicans would not suffer it."&lt;ref&gt;John J. DiIulio, Jr., ''Godly Republic: A Centrist Blueprint for America's Faith-Based Future'' (University of California Press, 2007), pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Cain]] criticized the idea of "compassionate conservatism" as leading to the Bush administration's increased government spending, saying that it "completely betrayed conservative voters and their decades of grassroots activism," and "alienated the party's conservative base," noting Bush policies such as the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare prescription-drug benefit]], which increased the size of the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program by around $500 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=18016 |title=Compassionate Conservatism Lost |publisher=Human Events |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, conservative commentator [[Jonah Goldberg]] has written that compassionate conservatism as implemented by George W. Bush differs markedly from the theoretical concept: "As countless writers have noted in National Review over the last five years, most conservatives never really understood what compassionate conservatism was, beyond a convenient marketing slogan to attract swing voters. The reality — as even some members of the Bush team will sheepishly concede — is that there was nothing behind the curtain."&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Goldberg, [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/217024/living-real-world-jonah-goldberg Living in the Real World], ''National Review'' (March 13, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, conservative commentator [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]] wrote: "Bush has famously defined himself as a compassionate conservative with a positive agenda. Almost by definition, this makes him a big government conservative."&lt;ref&gt;Fred Barnes, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/017wgfhc.asp?page=2 Big-Government Conservatism: How George W. Bush squares the fiscally expansive / conservative circle], ''Wall Street Journal'' (August 15, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
The phrase and the idea of compassionate conservativism declined after the Bush administration left office. In December 2011, Christian commentator [[Jim Wallis]] of [[Sojourners]], citing harsh rhetoric toward the poor and immigrants from [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2012|candidates for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination]], wrote that "the compassionate conservative agenda has virtually disappeared from the Republican Party."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Wallis, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-wallis/the-disappearance-of-the_b_1137208.html The Disappearance of the Compassionate Conservatives], ''Huffington Post'' (December 8, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, commentator [[Amy Sullivan]] wrote that "Just three years after George W. Bush left the White House, compassionate conservatives are an endangered species. In the new [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] era, they've all but disappeared from Congress, and their philosophy is reviled within the GOP as big-government conservatism."&lt;ref name="Sullivan2012"&gt;Amy Sullivan, [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-01-29/compassionate-conservatism-bush-santorum-republican/52873150/1 Column: Is compassionate conservatism dead?], ''USA Today'' (January 29, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan noted that Republican presidential candidates "have jostled to take the hardest line in opposing government-funded programs to help the poor."&lt;ref name="Sullivan2012"/&gt; ''Washington Post'' columnist [[Eugene Robinson (journalist)|Eugene Robinson]] made similar observations.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Robinson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/where-are-the-compassionate-conservatives/2011/09/15/gIQA83EfVK_story.html Where are the compassionate conservatives?], ''Washington Post'' (September 15, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom== 
According to a 2006 report by the British think tank [[Policy Exchange]], "compassionate conservative" has been "one of the most prominent themes" of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref name="NormanGanesh"&gt;Jesse Norman &amp; Janan Ganesh, ''[http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/compassionate%20conservatism%20-%20june%2006.pdf Compassionate Conservatism: What It Is, Why We Need It] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019022848/http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/compassionate%20conservatism%20-%20june%2006.pdf |date=2015-10-19 }}'', Policy Exchange (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In speeches and the party's statement of aims and values around 2005 and 2006, Cameron and other senior Conservatives emphasized a "modern, compassionate conservatism" theme.&lt;ref name="NormanGanesh"/&gt; At the 2011 Conservative Party Conference, the party released a pamphlet titled ''Modern Compassionate Conservatism'', and senior leaders such as Cameron and foreign secretary [[William Hague]] said that had pushed for "compassionate" and "cuddly" policies.&lt;ref&gt;Allegra Stratton, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/02/cameron-tory-party-modern-compassionate David Cameron: Tory party is 'modern and compassionate'], ''The Guardian'' (October 2, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Michael Gove]] described David Cameron as "a modern, compassionate Conservative."&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;Sebastian Payne, [http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/03/five-things-we-learnt-about-compassionate-conservatism-from-michael-goves-speech/ Five things we learnt about compassionate conservatism from Michael Gove's speech] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019022848/http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/03/five-things-we-learnt-about-compassionate-conservatism-from-michael-goves-speech/ |date=October 19, 2015 }}, ''Spectator'' (March 13, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The "compassionate conservative" idea is seen as a way for the Conservatives to distance themselves from the "[[Nasty Party|nasty party]]" image of the past.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

{{Politics of Portugal}}

The '''Constitutional Court''' ({{lang-pt|Tribunal Constitucional}}, {{IPA-pt|tɾibuˈnaɫ kõʃtitusiuˈnaɫ|pron}}) is a special court, defined by the [[Portuguese Constitution]] as part of the judicial branch of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] political organization. Unlike the rest of the country's courts, the Constitutional Court has important characteristics, such as a special composition, and unique competences. The main task of the court is [[Judicial review|to review]] the [[constitutionality]] of the newly approved laws, but it also has important powers related to the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], the [[political parties in Portugal|political parties]] and referenda.

The Portuguese Constitution defines the Constitutional Court as a completely independent organ, that operates independently from the other branches of government, such as the Executive or the Legislative. The judges of the Constitutional Court are independent and cannot be impeached. The decisions of the court are above the decisions of any other authority.

The court works in [[Lisbon]], in the [[Jácome Ratton|Ratton Palace]] located in [[Bairro Alto]].

==Organization==

The court is composed by thirteen judges, ten of them are elected by the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]], the main legislative branch of the country, and they must be elected by two thirds majority of the members of the Assembly. The remaining three are elected by the already elected judges. Of the thirteen judges, six must be chosen among the general court's judges, the remaining must have at least a degree in law. The judges serve a nine years mandate and cannot be re-elected.

The Constitutional Court elects its own president and vice-president and approves its own rules, schedule and budget.

The [[President of the Portuguese Constitutional Court|President of the Constitutional Court]] (together with the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|President of the Supreme Court]]) is the fourth person in the Portuguese state hierarchy (after the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], the [[List of Presidents of the Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|President of the Assembly of the Republic]], and the [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]], in that order) and has several competences, such as conducting the relations between the court and the other authorities, receiving the candidatures for President of the Republic and presiding the court's sessions. The current president ({{As of|2016|lc=on}}) is Manuel da Costa Andrade.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Portuguese constitutional court.jpg|thumb|right|Frontdoor of the Ratton Palace|{{deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 17 April 2008}}]] --&gt;

==Competences==

The Constitutional Court has several competences, defined in the Constitution, such as:

* Assure that the Constitution and regional autonomies are respected;
* [[Judicial review|Review and assure]] the constitutionality of the laws;
* Declare the President's death or inability to carry out his tasks;
* Manage the electoral processes;
* Assure that political parties fulfil the legal requirements to exist;
* Prohibit and dissolve [[Fascism|fascist]] parties and organizations;
* Assure the legality of the national and local [[referendum]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8360">United States copyright registrations, renewals, and other catalog entries since 1978 are published online at the 
[http://copyright.gov U.S. Copyright Office website]. Entries prior to 1978 are not published in the Online Catalog.  
Copyright registrations and renewals after 1890 were formerly published in semi-annual softcover catalogs called '''The Catalog of Copyright Entries''' or '''Copyright Catalog''' or published in microfiche.&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright and the Public Domain'' pages 11–10; Stephen Fishman – Law Journal Press (2008); {{ISBN|978-1-58852-151-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/cce/|title = The Catalog of Copyright Entries|website = onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu|access-date = 2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Publication history and format==
The [[United States Copyright Office| Copyright Office]] published the Catalog of Copyright Entries (CCE) in print format from 1891 through 1978. These volumes may often be available at federal depository libraries. From 1979 through 1982, the CCE was issued in microfiche format. The catalog was divided into parts according to the classes of works registered. Each CCE segment covered all registrations made during a particular period of time. Renewal registrations made from 1979 through 1982 are found in section 8 of the catalog. Renewals prior to that time were generally listed at the end of the volume containing the class of work to which they pertained. Effective with registrations made since 1982, the only way to see the CCE is by using the Internet to access the Copyright Office automated catalog. The automated catalog contains entries from 1978 forward. To access the catalog, go to copyright.gov.&lt;ref&gt;Publications on Copyright · 4 U.S. Copyright Office · Library of Congress · 101 Independence Avenue SE · Washington, DC 20559-6000 · www.copyright.gov circular 02 rev: 05 / 2010 print: 05 / 2010 — x,000 U.S. government printing office: 2010-xxx-xxx / xx,xxx [http://copyright.gov/circs/circ02.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of catalog entries and access to copies of documents==
The Catalog of Copyright Entries, the Copyright Card Catalog, and the online files are indexes, not reproductions of original documents. To view or copy the original documents yourself, you must visit the Copyright Office. Information such as registration numbers may be obtained from these files. Providing this information yourself rather than paying a fee to have the Office search for it will reduce the cost of obtaining records and copies from the Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://copyright.gov/circs/circ06.pdf Circular 6, ''Obtaining Access to and Copies of Records and Deposits'', page 4] U.

==Cumulative copyright catalogs==
For selected categories, the Library of Congress published hardcover books of copyright registrations covering ten or more years. These include
* ''Dramatic Compositions Copyrighted in the United States 1870 to 1916'', a two-volume set, published in 1918. Volume 1 (pages 1 – 1662) has alphabetized works with titles from A through N (consecutively numbered 1 – 33,176). Volume 2 (pages 1663–2830) has alphabetized works with titles from O through Z (consecutively numbered 33,177 – 56,066); page 2831 has titles that begin with numerals.

==Catalog reprints==
All of the cumulative Copyright Catalogs listed above are out of print. However, the complete text of registrations and indexes in the four volumes of motion pictures from 1894 through 1959 have been reprinted in the '''''[[Film Superlist]]''''' series.

A number of entities have scanned all or some of the volumes of the CCE. The [[Stanford Library]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania#Libraries|University of Pennsylvania library]] have each scanned a section of the records and put them into a database. At the University of Pennsylvania, they have scanned book and serials renewals, searchable by year at http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/cce/ . Stanford has also placed renewal records into a https://exhibits.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals?forward=home searchable database. More recently, [[Google]] has indexed many volumes of the CCE into a searchable index, available at https://books.google.com/googlebooks/copyrightsearch.html . The [[Internet Archive]] has similarly scanned and indexed the volumes of the CCE, as well as many other US Copyright Office works, and makes the works both searchable and viewable as scans by searching for the "collection:copyrightrecords" at https://archive.org/.

The '''Deer Act 1980''' (1980 c. 49) was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It came into operation in November 1980, and has since been fully repealed by the [[Deer Act 1991]].

The main effect of the Act was to put measures in place to prevent the [[poaching]] of [[deer]] and control the sale of [[venison]]. It amended the [[Deer Act 1963]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6100">'''Division of property''', also known as '''equitable distribution''', is a judicial division of property rights and obligations between spouses during [[divorce]].  It may be done by agreement, through a '''property settlement''', or by judicial decree.

Distribution of property is the division, due to a death or the [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]] of a marriage, of [[property]] which was owned by the deceased, or acquired during the course of the [[marriage]].  

==United Kingdom law==
In England &amp; Wales, partners in or out of marriage can agree how the joint and severally hold assets will be divided without the intervention of the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/money-property-when-relationship-ends|title=Money and property when a relationship ends |publisher=HM Government|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where agreement cannot be reached, the courts may be asked to determine a fair and equitable division. The case of [[Miller v Miller]] gave the wife a considerable proportion of the husband's recent gains resulting from dealings in the City even though the marriage was short lived.

==United States law==
In the event of a divorce, only marital property will be considered for property division and only those assets will be considered as marital property that have been acquired during the course of the particular marriage. Such assets may include marital home, bank accounts, investments (including stocks, bonds and retirement savings) and even businesses established during the course of the marriage in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Dominic|title=Seeking Property Division During Divorce in New Jersey|url=https://medium.com/@jonesdominic37/seeking-property-division-during-divorce-in-new-jersey-92270a3e3af7|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some states (New York state){{where|date=March 2016}}, educational degrees earned during the marriage may be considered marital property.  In such states, a resolution of the divorce will often entail payment from the educated spouse to the other spouse a share of their expected future earnings that are due to a degree they earned during the divorce,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324481204578180132637628330|title = After Divorce, a Degree Is Costly|last = Hollander|first = Sophia|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|issn = 0099-9660|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may require the expertise of labor economists or other statistical and financial experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Simkovic|first = Michael|last2 = McIntyre|first2 = Frank|date = 2014-01-01|title = The Economic Value of a Law Degree|jstor = 10.1086/677921|journal = The Journal of Legal Studies|volume = 43|issue = 2|pages = 249–289|doi = 10.1086/677921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = McIntyre|first = Frank|last2 = Simkovic|first2 = Michael|date = 2016-02-01|title = Timing Law School|ssrn = 2574587|location = Rochester, NY|publisher = Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Simkovic|first = Michael|last2 = McIntyre|first2 = Frank|date = 2016-03-05|title = Value of a Law Degree by College Major|ssrn = 2742674|location = Rochester, NY|publisher = Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Simkovic|first = Michael|date = 2015|title = The Knowledge Tax|ssrn = 2551567|journal = University of Chicago Law Review|volume = 82|page = 1981|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So.2d 921 (Miss. 1994)'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judybarnettpa.com/FERGUSON_FACTORS_II.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the court described equitable distribution of marital property at divorce as more fair, or equitable, than the separate property system. The court may consider such factors as "substantial contribution to the accumulation of the property, the market and emotional value of the assets, tax and other economic consequences of the distribution, the parties' needs, and any other factor relevant to an equitable outcome."  Fairness is the prevailing guideline the court will use. Alimony payments, child support obligations and all other property will be considered. Even non-tangible contributions such as a spouse's domestic contributions to the household will be taken into account, whether that spouse has anything titled in their name or not.  A spouse who has made non-tangible contributions may claim an equitable interest in the marital property at divorce.

The Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act §307 (UMDA §307)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stus9a_ula_238_39.htm|title=US - Divorce/Custody - Uniform Marriage &amp; Divorce Act. Section 307. Part III Dissolution. Section 307 Disposition of Property. - Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; also allows for the equitable distribution of property and lists factors the court should consider, e.g. "the duration of the marriage, and prior marriage of either party, antenuptial agreement of the parties [which is the same as a prenuptial agreement or premarital agreement], the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties, custodials provisions..." etc. Marital misconduct is not a factor in the decision-making process.

Another form of property distribution at divorce is called "[[community property]] distribution".

Equitable distribution is not the same as equal distribution.  For example, upon dissolution of a marriage in which the wife served as a stay-at-home mother for a substantial portion of the marriage, a court may award the wife a more-than-50% share of distributed property as advance compensation for her projected need to return to the work force at a lower wage than she would have been able to command had she spent her time developing outside-the-home work experience rather than laboring inside the home.

{{LGBT rights}}
The '''Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act''' or the DPBO Act ({{USBill|112|S.|1910}}, {{USBill|112|H.R.|3485}}) is a piece of United States legislation that would allow [[LGBT]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal employees]] to give their unrecognized same-sex spouses and partners [[health insurance]], [[life insurance]], government [[pensions]], and other employment related benefits and obligations that married heterosexual federal employees enjoy by being married and heterosexual.

==110th Congress==

The House version of the bill was originally introduced  December 19, 2007 by Rep. [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-WI). The bill garnered 90 cosponsors and was referred to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties|Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties]] but was not acted upon.

The Senate version of the bill was also introduced on December 19, 2007, by Sen. [[Joe Lieberman]] (I-CT). The bill was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] of which Lieberman himself was the chair.

A hearing was held on September 24, 2008, with testimony coming from the deputy director of the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], an executive at [[IBM]], the president of the [[National Treasury Employees Union]] and two others. Though it garnered 21 Democrats, 1 Republican and 1 Independent as cosponsors, the Senate bill also died when the committee did not vote on it.

==111th Congress==

The act was reintroduced in the 111th Congress on May 20, 2009.  The measure is sponsored by Reps. [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-WI) &amp; [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] (R-FL) in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and by Sens. [[Joe Lieberman]] (I-CT) &amp; [[Susan Collins]] (R-ME) in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].  The legislation has 140 cosponsors in the House and 31 in the Senate as of May 27, 2010.&lt;ref name=Thomas111&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR02517:@@@P|/bss/111search.html  Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress):]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN01102:@@@P|/bss/111search.html  Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress):]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Rep. [[Barney Frank]] told an interviewer from the ''[[Washington Blade]]'' that he believed supporters of the act "have a shot" at passing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Chris |title=Gay rights bills remain stalled in Congress |publisher=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |date=May 29, 2009 |url=http://www.washblade.com/2009/5-29/news/national/14609.cfm |accessdate=June 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602034950/http://www.washblade.com/2009/5-29/news/national/14609.cfm |archivedate=June 2, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 2009, President Obama announced his support for the Domestic Partners Benefits and Obligations Act, which he called "crucial legislation that will guarantee these rights for all federal employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Eleveld | first = Kerry| title = Obama Extends Partner Benefits | publisher = [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | date = June 17, 2009 | url = http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid91364.asp | accessdate = June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ex.ua''' is a [[one-click hosting]] service that offers both free and commercial services. Operating from Ukraine, it is financed by advertisements on the website. Ex.ua is said to be the largest [[file-sharing]] service in Ukraine and allows uploads of up to 50 [[Gigabyte|GB]]. The site's traffic accounted for 15–25% of domestic traffic.&lt;ref name="Пішковцій"&gt;{{cite news|last=Пішковцій|first=Сергій|title=Ex.ua closed (updated continuously)|url=http://watcher.com.ua/2012/01/31/ex-ua-zakryly/|accessdate=4 February 2012|newspaper=Watcher|date=January 31, 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 letter to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], the [[RIAA]] described the site as one of the top pirate sites online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RIAA Reports Torrent Sites, RapidShare and RLSLOG to US Government|url=http://torrentfreak.com/riaa-reports-torrent-sites-rapidshare-and-rlslog-to-us-government-101111/|accessdate=4 February 2012|newspaper=[[TorrentFreak]]|date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Service was founded in the summer of 2009, after the closure of the Ministry of Interior of similar resources infostore.org.

In November 2010, the Recording Industry Association of America(RIAA) made ex.ua in the list of 25 sites that contribute to the spread of illegal music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustr.gov/webfm_send/2595 Out-of-Cycle Review of Notorious Markets. February 28, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307014506/https://ustr.gov/webfm_send/2595 |date=March 7, 2016 }} (pdf) // [[USTR]]&lt;/ref&gt; The association claimed that the site was not a single video or song, the legality of which is confirmed by the spread of the copyright owner. After these events, the representative ex.ua Piskovyi Yuri said that the service can make free of charge, to deduct a percentage content creators and avoid accusations of copyright infringement.

December 16, 2010 the site was temporarily unavailable due to technical reasons. Some [[Internet media|electronic media]] reported that the service was closed for the distribution of unlicensed products. A day later the site worked again, but only became available for Ukrainian users.

On January 31, 2012, the office of Ex.ua was raided and 200 servers containing 6 [[petabyte]]s of data were confiscated and 16 employees questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukraine shuts down leading file-sharing site|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9SKIKR00.htm|accessdate=4 February 2012|newspaper=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Authorities Shut Down Ukraine’s Largest File-Sharing Site Ex.ua|url=http://torrentfreak.com/authorities-shut-down-ukraines-largest-file-sharing-site-120131/|accessdate=4 February 2012|newspaper=TorrentFreak|date=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blocking of ''ex.ua'' [[domain name]] by the ''[[Imena.ua]]'' registrar led to multiple [[Denial of service attack#Distributed attack|DDoS attacks]] on Ukrainian government websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Internal Ministry To Detect Persons Involved In Uploading Counterfeit Software To ex.ua Share Site|url=http://un.ua/eng/article/373586.html|accessdate=4 February 2012|newspaper=Ukrainian News|date=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outraged general users also took part in the attacks, mainly using [[LOIC]].

[[File:Female pair.jpg|thumb|a pair of hens]]
'''European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1999:203:0053:0057:EN:PDF |title=European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is legislation passed by the [[European Union]] on the minimum standards for keeping egg laying hens which effectively bans conventional [[battery cages]].  The directive, passed in 1999, banned conventional battery cages in the EU from 1 January 2012 after a 13-year phase-out. Battery cages were already banned in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden prior to 2012.  The directive does not apply to establishments with fewer than 350 laying hens or establishments rearing breeding laying hens. Such establishments are, however, subject to the requirements of Directive 98/58/EC.  The directive is not supported with fines, penalties or export bans.

As alternatives to battery cages, Directive 1999/74/EC allows non-cage systems and [[furnished cages]].  Furnished cages therefore represent a feasible alternative to battery cages in the EU after 2012.  Under the directive, furnished cages must provide at least the following: 750&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per hen, of which 600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 45&amp;nbsp;cm high, a nest, a littered area for scratching and pecking, 15&amp;nbsp;cm of perch and 12&amp;nbsp;cm of food trough per hen and a claw shortening device.  Austria banned battery cages in 2009 and is set to ban furnished cages by 2020. Belgium has also banned the battery cage – and proposes to ban furnished cages by 2024. Germany has introduced a ‘family cage’, which has more space than the furnished cages used in other countries, however, consumers in Germany have been rejecting these eggs. Outside the EU, Switzerland has already banned both the battery and furnished cage systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/other_comments/1046687/battery_egg_hens_still_face_hell_as_enriched_cages_phased_in.html|title=Ecologist, September 2011|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, the Polish government formally requested the EU to delay enacting Directive 1999/74/EC by 5 years until 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpoultry.net/news/poland-calls-on-delaying-cage-ban-to-2017-7102.html|title=WorldPoultry.net, February 2010|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this was unsuccessful.

According to figures submitted to the European Commission in 2011, 14 countries were expected to be battery cage free by 1 January 2012.  However, six states including Portugal, Poland and Romania admitted they would not be ready, while Spain and Italy, among others, did not know or would not say whether they will meet the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-end-of-battery-farms-in-britain--but-not-europe-6281802.html|title=The Independent, December 27th, 2011|accessdate=15 January 2012 | location=London|first=Martin|last=Hickman|date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France one third of egg producers have gone out of business and according to figures of the UGPVB (the industry association) 5% of producers were still not compliant as of January 2012 and have had their licences withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/economie/906491-marche-oeuf-bat-provisoirement-aile|title=20 Minutes (France), March 28th, 2012|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to fears that cheaper, illegal eggs, particularly liquid egg products, from non-compliant states will flood the market undercutting compliant egg producers.  John Dalli, the EU health commissioner, has issued legal warnings to 13 countries over their lack of readiness or effort to enforce the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=4042&amp;catId=8|title=Vegnews web-page|accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13 member states already found to be in breach of the directive are: Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Spain, Greece, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/livestock/member-states-face-legal-action-over-battery-cages/43758.article|title=Farmers Guardian, December 20th, 2011|accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance beyond January 2012==
It is clear that beyond the date of the law coming into effect, many hens are still being housed in battery cages. European Commission figures show that more than 47 million hens are still (January 2012) in conventional battery cages across the EU, representing 14.3% of production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theranger.co.uk/news/Director-of-Policy-report-24th-January-2012_21705.html|title=The Ranger, January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been reported this figure might be as high as 23% of EU egg production – equivalent to 84 million hens laying 70&amp;nbsp;million eggs a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/8986255/French-farmers-ignore-battery-hen-ban.html|title=The Telegraph, January 15th, 2012|accessdate=15 January 2012 | location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Jason|last=Lewis|date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

15 EU states reported to the EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health that they had non-compliant producers. These states were Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, UK, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Romania. Some of these countries, such as Italy and Belgium, admit to having 30% of illegal production.

In the UK, there are approximately 31 million egg laying hens.  Over £400&amp;nbsp;million has been spent to meet the standards.  In January 2012, reports stated that figures from the [[Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA) indicate 423,000 hens on 32 farms in the UK were still being housed in battery cages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theranger.co.uk/news/Director-of-Policy-report-24th-January-2012_21705.html|title=The Ranger, January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/laying_hens/uk_still_has_barren_battery_cages_despite_eu_ban.aspx|title=Compassion in World Farming web-page|accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/livestock/thirty-uk-farms-defying-battery-cage-ban-defra-reveals/44120.article|title=Farmers Guardian, January 13th, 2012|accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a non-compliance rate of 1%.

The '''Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857''' ({{lang-es|Constitución Federal de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos de 1857}}) often called simply the '''Constitution of 1857''' is the [[Liberalism in Mexico|liberal]] constitution drafted by 1857 Constituent [[Congress of Mexico]] during the presidency of [[Ignacio Comonfort]]. It was ratified on February 5, 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Día de la Constitución Mexicana| url =http://www.sanmiguelguide.com/constitucion.htm| language =Spanish| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20030811203929/http://www.sanmiguelguide.com/constitucion.htm| archivedate =2003-08-11| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing [[individual rights]] such as [[freedom of speech]]; [[freedom of conscience]]; [[freedom of the press]]; [[freedom of assembly]]; and the [[right to arms|right to bear arms]]. It also reaffirmed the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]], eliminated [[debtor prison]], and eliminated all forms of [[cruel and unusual punishment]], including the [[death penalty]].

Some articles were contrary to the interests of the [[Catholic Church]], such as education free of [[dogma]], the removal of institutional ''fueros'' (privileges) and the sale of property belonging to the church. The Conservative Party strongly opposed the enactment of the new constitution and this polarized Mexican society. The [[Reform War]] began as a result, and the struggles between liberals and conservatives were intensified with the implementation of the [[Second Mexican Empire]] under the support of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Quirarte. "Visión panorámica de la historia de México". Librería Porrúa Hnos y Cia, S. A. 27a. edición 1995. México, D. F. Pág. 170-171.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, with the restored republic, the Constitution was in force throughout the country until 1917.

== Background ==
Having overthrown the dictatorship of [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] in 1855, liberal leader [[Juan Álvarez|Juan Nepomuceno Álvarez Hurtado]] held the presidency for a short period. According to the established in [[Plan of Ayutla]] convened the Constituent Congress on October 16 the same year, in order to establish headquarters in [[Dolores Hidalgo]] to draft a new constitution of liberal ideology. The following year, the incumbent [[President of Mexico|president]], [[Ignacio Comonfort]], endorsed the call for moving the headquarters to [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="T"&gt;Tena Ramírez, Felipe ''Op.cit.'' capítulo "La Constitución de 1857"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress was divided between two main factions. The larger being the moderate liberals whose plan was to restore the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]] with some changes. It included prominent figures like Mariano Arizcorreta, Marcelino Castañeda, Joaquín Cardoso and Pedro Escudero y Echánove. The opposition was the ''pure liberals,''&lt;ref&gt;Reyes Heroles, Jesús ''Op.cit.'' p.200 : "On December 14, 1838 a popular movement emerged in Mexico City that invades the National Palace acting against the constituted authorities and according to Bocanegra, under the slogan of ''¡We want tailless Constitution and pure Federation!''. From this comes, by the same author, the title of pure, which met the radical sector of the Mexican liberals (according to the book in 1858, was popular advises that ''pure'' going forward, the ''moderate'' did not move and ''conservative'' went backward)".&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to make a complete new version of the constitution. Among them were [[Ponciano Arriaga]], [[Guillermo Prieto]], [[Francisco Zarco]], [[José María Mata]] and [[Santos Degollado]]. The discussions were heated and lasted over a year.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

President Comonfort interfered, through its ministers in favor of the moderate faction, which he preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= El Liberalismo Moderado en México | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=MWKz221FDzUC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=el+presidente+comonfort+era+de+ideolog%C3%ADa+moderado&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fZtnoJD64S&amp;sig=YeNLLtVxajpsYMXcpaPt0PHUsqQ&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=rT_XS9jtGYP8sgOJtqWqAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwBg#v=snippet&amp;q=comonfort%20ideologia&amp;f=false| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opposition from the executive branch and to be minority, 'pure liberals ensured that their proposals were included: the prohibition of purchase of property by ecclesiastical corporations, the exclusion of the clergy in public office, the abolition of ecclesiastical and military ''fueros''{{Ref|american|[a]}} ([[Reform War#Reform Laws|Juárez Law]]), and [[freedom of religion]].

These reforms were contrary to the interests of the [[Catholic Church]]. During the course of sessions in Congress, an insurrection in favor of the clergy supported by ''conservative'', the staunchest opponents of the Liberals, gathered force in [[Zacapoaxtla]] and [[Puebla]]. Comonfort sent federal troops, and the rebels were subjected.&lt;ref&gt;Valadés, Diego; Carbonell, Miguel ''Op.cit.'' "Fernado Zertuche Muñoz" p.865-867&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the Constitution was promulgated on February 5, 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= El Congreso Constituyente a la Nación al proclamar la nueva Constitución Federal. | url =http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1857_148/El_congreso_constituyente_a_la_naci_n_al_proclamar_la_nueva_constituci_n_federal.shtml| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the threats of the clergy that who swore the Constitution would be excommunicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= El clero, intolerante, amenaza a quienes juren la constitución. | url =http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1857_148/El_clero_intolerante_amenaza_a_quienes_juren_la_constituci_n.shtml| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The Constitution of 1857 consisted of 8 titles and 128 articles, was similar to the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]], [[federalism]] and representative [[republic]] was again implemented, which consisted of 23 [[States of Mexico|states]], a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] and the [[federal district]]. Supported the autonomy of [[municipalities]] in which each state was divided politically. The most relevant articles were:

Among other things, included a chapter on individual guarantees, and judicial proceedings to protect those rights known as [[amparo (law)|amparo]]. (created, used and endorsed by the [[Republic of Yucatán]], now, state of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= El Juicio de Amparo. | url =http://www.elporvenir.com.mx/notas.asp?nota_id=25984| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Texas case, some Deputies proposed a law granting certain rights to foreign colonization arguing that the country needed to be settled, the law was rejected.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt;

== Federation ==
{{Main|Territorial evolution of Mexico}}
At the time of the promulgation of the constitution, the nation was composed of 23 states and one federal territory. [[Nuevo León]] merges with [[Coahuila]] adopting the latter name, besides, ratified the creation of a new state and admitted three of the four territories as free states of the federation.

The only federal territory was: [[Baja California peninsula|Baja California]], [[Mexico City]] was called state of Valley of Mexico, but only if the powers of the Federation to move to another site. On February 26, 1864, Nuevo León was separated from Coahuila and regained its status as free state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Información turística INEGI| url =http://mapserver.inegi.gob.mx/geografia/espanol/estados/nl/nl-it.cfm?c=1219&amp;e=19&amp;CFID=2170463&amp;CFTOKEN=18853805| language =Spanish| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110722225642/http://mapserver.inegi.gob.mx/geografia/espanol/estados/nl/nl-it.cfm?c=1219&amp;e=19&amp;CFID=2170463&amp;CFTOKEN=18853805| archivedate =2011-07-22| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
On December, 1856, Pope [[Pius IX]] spoke out against the new Constitution, criticizing the Juarez Law and [[Ley Lerdo|Lerdo Law]]. In March 1857 the Archbishop José Lázaro de la Garza y Ballesteros, stated that Catholics could not swear allegiance to the Constitution on pain of [[excommunication]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Vanderwood, "Betterment for Whom? The Reform Period: 1855-1875" in ''The Oxford History of Mexico'', Michael C. Meyer and William H. Beezley, eds. New York: Oxford University Press 2000, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Minister Ezequiel Montes met in the [[Holy See]] with Cardinal Secretary of State. The pope accepted the Ley Juárez and disposals of [[Ley Lerdo|Lerdo Law]], but demanded the ability to acquire political rights. The negotiations were interrupted by the resignation of President Comonfort.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

It began to gestate a coup, General conservative [[Felix Maria Zuloaga]] promoted through several writings his repudiation to the Constitution. On December 17, 1857 was proclaimed the '''Plan of Tacubaya''' which aimed to repeal the Constitution and convene a new Constitutional Congress; in other words, a coup against the Congress and the Constitution. Several ministers of Presidential Cabinet resigned. President of the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation]], [[Benito Juárez]], and the President of [[Congress of Mexico|Congress]], Isidoro Olvera, were taken prisoner.

On December 19, [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Ignacio Comonfort]] adhered to the plan saying: ''"I just change my legal title of president, by those of revolutionary miserable"''.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; States of [[State of Mexico|México]], [[Puebla]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Veracruz]] annexed to the Plan Tacubaya. This last state changed side, through a revolution and switched to the Liberal side; the event was a major strategic blow against Comonfort. Without alternative, Comonfort had to resort to the ''pure'' and released Juarez and other political prisoners. On January 11, 1858, Comonfort decided to resign, with a guard went to [[Veracruz]], and on February 7 sailed to the United States. Benito Juárez took office on January 21, 1858.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;El Colegio de México, ''Op.cit.'' p.597-598&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
[[File:Alegoría de la Constitución de 1857.jpg|left|thumbnail|''Alegoría de la Constitución de 1857'', [[Petronilo Monroy]], 1869.]]
The Conservatives refused to recognize Juarez and was forced to move the ''Liberal government'' to [[Guanajuato]]. Felix Zuloaga established a ''Conservative Government'' in [[Mexico City]]; through the promulgation of '''Five Laws''' ({{lang-es|Cinco Leyes}}) repealed the liberal reforms. Thus began [[Reform War]].

States of [[Jalisco]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Querétaro]], [[Michoacán]], [[Nuevo León]], [[Coahuila]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Colima]] and [[Veracruz]] supported the liberal government of Benito Juarez and the constitution of 1857. States of [[State of Mexico|México]], [[Puebla]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Durango]], [[Tabasco]], [[Tlaxcala]], [[Chiapas]], [[Sonora]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Oaxaca]] and [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] supported the conservative government of Zuloaga.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

After the Liberal government won the [[Reform War]], President Juarez and his government added to the Constitution of 1857, the '''Reform Laws''' that had been enacted in [[Veracruz]]. Because of the war, the Constitution remained without effect on almost all the country until January, 1861, when the Liberals returned to the capital. On 1862, as a result of [[Franco-Mexican War]] and the establishment of [[Second Mexican Empire]], the validity of the Constitution was again suspended. On 1867 the government of Juarez overthrew the Empire, restore the Republic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=La República Restaurada. Una década en busca de un nuevo Estado | url =http://www.cronica.com.mx/especial.php?id_nota=463188&amp;id_tema=1315| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Constitution took effect in the country again.

== Repeal and the Constitution of 1917 ==
On February 5, 1903 in protest against the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]] a liberal group placed on the balcony of the newspaper's offices ''El hijo de El Ahuizote'' a great black curly for mourning with the legend "The Constitution is dead," a precursor of many that eventually trigger the [[Mexican Revolution]] on 1910, that overthrew Diaz and end with the enactment of the [[1917 Constitution of Mexico|Political Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1917]] during the government of [[Venustiano Carranza]].

==Notes==
*{{note|Fueros|a}}The '''fueros''' were privileges that kept the military and clergy to forbade members of these two groups were judged by the law, which effectively put them above the law and that no matter what kind of crime they committed, could not be judged, or in the best cases judged by special courts.

The '''Federal Election Commission''' ('''FEC''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent regulatory agency]] whose purpose is to enforce [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance law]] in United States federal elections.&lt;ref name="fec.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fec.gov/about/|title=About|last=|first=|date=|access-date=3 June 2017|work=Federal Election Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created in 1974 through amendments to the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30106|title=52 U.S. Code § 30106 - Federal Election Commission|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the commission describes its duties as "to disclose campaign finance information, to enforce the provisions of the law such as the limits and prohibitions on contributions, and to oversee the public funding of Presidential elections."

== Membership ==
The Commission is made up of six members, who are appointed by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]]. Each member serves a six-year term, and two seats are subject to appointment every two years.&lt;ref name="fec.gov"/&gt;  By law, no more than three Commissioners can be members of the same [[political party]], and at least four votes are required for any official Commission action.  

The chairmanship of the Commission rotates among the members each year, with no member serving as chairman more than once during a six-year term.  However, a member may serve as chairman more than once by serving beyond the six-year mark if no successor is appointed; for example, [[Ellen Weintraub]] was chairman in both 2003 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FEC biography of Ellen L. Weintraub|url=http://www.fec.gov/members/weintraub/weintraubbio.shtml|work=Federal Election Commission|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official duties ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Hard Rock Cafe Washington DC.JPG|thumb|left|Federal Election Commission building, in Washington, D.C.]]

The Commission's role is limited to the administration of federal campaign finance laws. It enforces limitations and prohibitions on contributions and expenditures, administers the reporting system for campaign finance disclosure, investigates and prosecutes violations (investigations are typically initiated by complaints from other candidates, parties, watchdog groups, and the public), audits a limited number of campaigns and organizations for compliance, administers the presidential public funding programs for presidential candidates and, until recently, nominating conventions, and defends the statute in challenges to federal election laws and regulations.

The FEC also publishes reports filed by Senate, House of Representatives and Presidential campaigns that list how much each campaign has raised and spent, and a list of all donors over $200, along with each donor's home address, employer and job title. This database also goes back to 1980. Private organizations are legally prohibited from using these data to solicit new individual donors (and the FEC authorizes campaigns to include a limited number of "dummy" names as a measure to prevent this), but may use this information to solicit [[Political Action Committee]]s. The FEC also maintains an active program of public education, directed primarily to explaining the law to the candidates, their campaigns, political parties and other political committees that it regulates.

== Criticism ==
{{Criticism section|date=November 2018}}
===Campaign finance===

Critics of the FEC, including [[campaign finance reform]] supporters such as [[Common Cause]] and [[Democracy 21]], have complained that it is a classic example of [[regulatory capture]] where it serves the interests of the ones it was intended to regulate.  The FEC's bipartisan structure, which was established by Congress, renders the agency "toothless."  Critics also claim that most FEC penalties for violating [[election law]] come well after the actual election in which they were committed. Additionally, some critics claim that the commissioners tend to act as an arm of the "regulated community" of parties, interest groups, and politicians when issuing rulings and writing regulations. Others point out, however, that the commissioners rarely divide evenly along partisan lines, and that the response time problem may be endemic to the enforcement procedures established by Congress. To complete steps necessary to resolve a complaint – including time for defendants to respond to the complaint, time to investigate and engage in legal analysis, and finally, where warranted, prosecution – necessarily takes far longer than the comparatively brief period of a political campaign.

===First Amendment issues===

Critics including former FEC chairman [[Bradley Smith (law professor)|Bradley Smith]] and Stephen M. Hoersting, executive director of the [http://www.campaignfreedom.org Center for Competitive Politics], criticize the FEC for pursuing overly aggressive enforcement theories that amount to an infringement on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bradley A. Smith|author2=Stephen M. Hoersting|title=A Toothless Anaconda: Innovation, Impotence, and Overenforcement at the Federal Election Commission|journal=Election Law Journal|volume=1|issue=2|pages=145–171|year=2002|doi=10.1089/153312902753610002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Division over the issue became especially prominent during the last several years of the Obama administration. Commissioners deadlocked on several votes over whether to regulate Twitter, Facebook, and other online mediums for political speech, as well as a vote to punish Fox News for the selection criteria it used in a presidential debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/30/fec-democrats-tried-to-punish-fox-news-over-debate-changes-files-show.html|title=FEC Democrats tried to punish Fox News over debate changes, files show|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|first=Judson|last=Berger|date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/regulators-spar-over-whether-unregulated-internet-harms-minorities/article/2603012|title=Regulators spar over whether unregulated Internet harms minorities|newspaper=[[Washington Examiner]]|first=Rudy|last=Takala|authorlink=Rudy Takala|date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats argued for more regulation on the basis that it would protect consumers and encourage more inclusive political speech. Republicans opposed regulation, with former chairman [[Lee E. Goodman]] accusing Democrats of trying to alter the First Amendment by "administrative fiat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/fec-commissioner-regulators-attacking-first-amendment-by-administrative-fiat/article/2595363|title=FEC Commissioner: Regulators attacking First Amendment by 'administrative fiat'|newspaper=[[Washington Examiner]]|first=Rudy|last=Takala|authorlink=Rudy Takala|date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deadlocks===

Critics of the Commission also argue that the membership structure regularly causes deadlocks on 3-3 votes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombwatch.org/node/11215 CREW Sues the Federal Election Commission over Case Dismissals, OMB Watch, August 17, 2010] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120221220953/http%3A//www.ombwatch.org/node/11215 |date=February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but others argue that deadlocks are actually quite rare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/members/former_members/smith/smithstatement05.pdf|title=Opening Statement of Bradley A. Smith, Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, Before the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, June 4, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically based on principle rather than partisanship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moresoftmoneyhardlaw.com/news.html?AID=1410 Politics (and FEC enforcement) make strange bedfellows: The Soros book matter, Bob Bauer, More Soft Money Hard Law, January 29, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915223222/http://moresoftmoneyhardlaw.com/news.html?AID=1410 |date=September 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, 3-3 votes have become more common at the FEC. From 2008 to August 2014, the FEC has had over 200 tie votes, accounting for approximately 14 percent of all votes in enforcement matters.&lt;ref name=NConfessore&gt;{{cite news|last1=Confessore|first1=Nicholas|title=Election Panel Enacts Policies by Not Acting |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/us/politics/election-panel-enacts-policies-by-not-acting.html|accessdate=August 26, 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Feindstrafrecht''' (German for '''"Criminal Law of the Enemy"''') is a [[criminal law]] and [[civil rights]] concept outlined in 1985 by the German criminal law professor and legal philosopher [[Günther Jakobs]]. The Feindstrafrecht says that certain people, as enemies of the society (or the state), do not deserve the protections of the civil or penal law. The Feindstrafrecht allows every available means to pursue and punish those enemies.

It is worth pointing out that the Feindstrafrecht is not a law. Most notably, it means the suspension of certain laws in order to protect the society or the state from certain dangers. Jakobs writings propose the term "Criminal Law of the Citizen" ("Bürgerstrafrecht") as the counterpart of the "Criminal Law of the Enemy". The concept of the Feindstrafrecht is opposed by most scholars of penal law and legal philosophy alike. Günther Jakobs points out that he was merely describing the existing Feindstrafrecht, while critics say that he took an affirmative position in his 2004 publication.

In the latter publication, Jakobs proposes that anybody who does not respect the laws and the legal order of a state - or even wants to destroy them - should lose all rights as a citizen and as a human being, and the state should be allowed to persecute him or her with all available means. This means that a terrorist who wants to subvert the societal norms, a criminal who ignores all laws, or a [[mafia]] member who only respects the rules of his clan should be designated as "unpersons" and not deserve to be treated as a citizen anymore. Rather, such people must be treated as enemies.

Jakobs justifies the necessity of a Feindstrafrecht philosophically, and refers to the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[social contract theory]] and its interpretation by [[Immanuel Kant]]. Whoever terminates that social contract by dishonoring it, leaves society and enters the lawless [[State of nature|natural state]]. Thereby, he loses his rights as a person and turns into an enemy, and as such, he has to be persecuted by the society.

== Current events ==
Although the Feindstrafrecht has been applied back by the [[Germanic peoples]] and in the [[Medieval Ages]], the German [[Nazi era]] was notorious for it. Beggars, disabled people, Jews, trade union members and other persons were designated "Volksschädlinge" ("vermin of the people"), and thus imprisoned at will by the [[Gestapo]], and quickly condemned by the [[Volksgerichtshof]].

In [[Colombia]], since 1990 a kind of Feindstrafrecht is applied against drug dealers. The accused are imprisoned without accusation, often for years, and held without access to a lawyer. The accused are then often tried based on anonymous witness evidence.

The designation of [[Al Qaida]] terrorists and [[Taliban]] fighters as "[[unlawful combatant]]" and their imprisonment at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] is also likened to the Feindstrafrecht concept, as are the [[targeted killings]] by drones of the U.S. Air Force.

== Criticism ==
Criticism is leveled by several law scholars, for example because the Feindstrafrecht in itself is not a law, but intends to disable existing laws in order to deprive people of legal protections. The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic law]] also stipulates that [[human dignity]] of all people has to be protected by the German government, not only the dignity of those who respect the law. The social philosopher [[Oskar Negt]], in his 2010 work "Der politische Mensch - Demokratie als Lebensform", summarizes some other criticism.

Feudal duties were not uniform over time or across political boundaries. And in their later development also included duties from and to the [[peasant]] population, such as [[abergement (feudal law)|abergement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Reynolds, Susan|authorlink=Susan Reynolds|year=1994|title=Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=65|isbn=0-19-820458-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feudal duties ran both ways, both up and down the feudal hierarchy; however, aside from distribution of land&lt;ref&gt;All lands belonged to the lord under feudal law, ''[[Nulle terre sans seigneur]]''. {{harvnb|Gananhof|1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Feudal maintenance|maintenance]] of landless retainers, the main obligation of the feudal lord was to protect his [[vassal]]s, both militarily from incursion and judicially via court justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Briggs, John H.

These grants were called ''[[Ban (medieval)|bans]]''&lt;ref&gt;The word ''ban'' at the time referred to a troop of armed men. See "Ban" ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911&lt;/ref&gt; and included extensive governmental autonomy, or immunities.&lt;ref&gt;Citation from French Wikipedia, original not viewed: {{Cite encyclopedia|editor1=Bouillet, Marie-Nicolas |editor2=Chassang, Alexis |year=1878|encyclopedia=Dictionnaire universel d’histoire et de géographie Bouillet Chassang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duties owed by a vassal to his lord can be categorised into four types:&lt;ref name="Russelll-types"&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1968|pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Military''' (''auxilium''), which included personal service, providing troops (raising levies), and later [[scutage]] in lieu of service. Military duties also included work on fortifications and roads and bridges, thus the ''[[trinoda necessitas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Abels, Richard|year=1999|title=Trinoda necessitas|editor=Lapidge, Michael|editor2=Blair, John|editor3=Keynes, Simon|display-editors = 3 |editor4=Scragg, Donald|encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages= 456–457|isbn=978-0-631-22492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Court duties''' (''consilium''), which encompassed everything from security (being a guard) through rendering advice in council, providing [[squire]]s and even in some cases providing ''[[de facto]]'' hostages.
* '''Special taxes''' (aids), often called [[feudal aid]]s, were monies due upon certain contingent events, such as contributing to the lord's ransom, or to pageant-like events at court such as royal marriages.&lt;ref&gt;An example of such a recurring aid was support for the ''baillée des roses'' held each Spring for the French parliaments. {{Cite book|author=Goody, Jack|year=1993|title=The Culture of Flowers|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wWg5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA159 159]|isbn=978-0-521-41441-8}}, citing {{Cite encyclopedia|author=Cheruel, Adolphe|year=1865|title=Redevances feodales| encyclopedia=Dictionnaire historique des institutions, moeure et coutumes de la France|edition=second|language=French|location=Paris|publisher=Hachette|volume=II|page=1049|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb10480799.html?pageNo=493&amp;contextSort=score%2Cdescending&amp;contextType=scan&amp;contextRows=10&amp;context=baill%C3%A9e+des+roses}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Incidents''', which included such things as a negotiated [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]] to the lord upon being granted a fief (politely called a ''receipt''), the duty to feed and house the lord and his retinue when the lord visited (''[[droit de gîte]]''), allowing the lord to hunt or fish on his land (''[[droit de garenne]]'') and being subject to the residual lordly rights of guardianship upon minority inheritance, and forfeiture upon a failure of heirs or failure to observe his feudal obligations.&lt;ref name="Russelll-types" /&gt;

In Europe, church lands were also held with feudal duties. While some churchmen did provide direct military service, most either hired substitutes, paid scutage, or later converted the duty to one of prayer, [[frankalmoin]].&lt;ref name="Russelll-types" /&gt;

==List==
Feudal duties included, but were not limited to:
* [[Amober]]
* [[Appanage]]
* [[Avera and inward]]
* [[Carucage]]
* [[Castle-guard]]
* [[Chiefage]]
* [[Corvée]]
* [[Droit de gîte]]
* [[Droit de garenne]]

'''''Florida v. Jimeno''''', 500 U.S. 248 (1991), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case involving the [[exclusionary rule]] of evidence under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=Oyez&gt;{{cite web

==Background==
A police officer pulled over Enio Jimeno for a traffic violation after following him due to information that he may have been involved in a drug deal. Jimeno consented to a search of his car, but nothing more. The officer had informed Jimeno that he suspected him of having drugs in the car.&lt;ref name=Oyez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt; The officer opened up a package and found cocaine inside. At trial, Jimeno argued that his consent to search his car did not extend to his permission to search within containers and packages. The lower court and the Florida Supreme Court upheld that Jimeno's consent did not cover the officer's efforts and thus ruled in Jimeno's favor. The State of Florida appealed to the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Oyez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
In a 7-2 vote, the Court overturned the lower courts' decision and ruled that the officer's search of containers within the car were not considered unreasonable. Since a reasonable person would expect narcotics to be carried in a container, and because the officer told Jimeno of his suspicions, the Court ruled that the officer acted within reason. Jimeno was thus found guilty and the officer was not in violation of the 4th amendment.&lt;ref name=Oyez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt;

==Significance==
This case grants law enforcement greater ability to conduct searches. It also narrows the definition of unreasonable searches and thus limits the protection citizens can seek against such searches. Evidence cannot be excluded from a case if it is deemed to have been discovered through reasonable means.&lt;ref name=Oyez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt;

'''French v Auckland City Council''' [1974] 1 NZLR 340 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding land based [[nuisance]] claims in tort.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
French leased some land in [[Glendowie]]. Auckland City owned some of the neighbouring land.

Initially, both parties land were infested with weeds, until French started a weed eradication program, whilst the council did not.

As a result of the weeds on the council land, their seeds continually reinfested French's land.

Eventually, French sued the council for nuisance.

==Held==
The court awarded French $799.39 in damages for weed eradication.

In 1971, President [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Zulfikar Bhutto]] constituted a commission to investigate the [[:Category:Causes and prelude of the Bangladesh Liberation War|responsibility causes]] of the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|war with India]] that led the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation]] of [[East Pakistan]] and to provide insightful recommendations to prevent future armed [[Foreign interventionism|foreign intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=War|first1=Pakistan Hamoodur Rehman Commission of Inquiry into the 1971|title=The report of the Hamoodur Rehman Commission of inquiry into the 1971 war: as declassified by the Government of Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_xtAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Vanguard|accessdate=22 August 2016|language=en|date=1 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US Institute of Peace Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=Howard B.|last2=Schaffer|first2=Teresita C.|title=How Pakistan Negotiates with the United States: Riding the Roller Coaster|publisher=US Institute of Peace Press|isbn=9781601270757|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axT9i-FhO0UC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=hamoodur+rehman+chief+justice+1971&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgjd-GxNTOAhVPxCYKHV1XDSIQuwUIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=hamoodur%20rehman%20chief%20justice%201971&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission, known as War Enquiry Commission (or otherwise known as [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission]]), was led by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rehman as its chairman and consisted of both civilian and military members.&lt;ref name="US Institute of Peace Press"/&gt;

Initially, Chief Justice Rahman was tasked to investigate the causes and the break-up of Pakistan, and role of the Pakistan Armed Forces in the [[Politics of Pakistan|national politics]].&lt;ref name="US Institute of Peace Press"/&gt; His report revealed many aspects of politics in Pakistan Armed Forces during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|East-Pakistan war]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baig|first1=Muhammad Anwar; Ebad|title=Pakistan: Time for Change|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477250310|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H_A5-RABah4C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=hamoodur+rehman+chief+justice+1971&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgjd-GxNTOAhVPxCYKHV1XDSIQ6wEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=hamoodur%20rehman%20chief%20justice%201971&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 August 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the nature of the findings, it was not declassified for decades until an Indian newspapers, later Pakistani newspapers, published the details.&lt;ref name="Routledge, Dixit"/&gt;

===Fact finding and recommendations===

From 1971 until 1975, the Commission led by Rahman conducted several interviews of [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistan military]]'s senior officers, bureaucrats, politicians, activists, and the Bengali nationalists.&lt;ref name="US Institute of Peace Press" /&gt; Criticism on the [[Government of Pakistan|government]] and misconduct of civilian politicians were very heavy and intense, therefore, the [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report|Report]] was never made it [[Public domain|public]] in Pakistan and concealed all of its information as the report was marked as "Top secret".&lt;ref name="US Institute of Peace Press" /&gt;

The report explores a number of issues such as, [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|killing of thousands of East Pakistanis]]—both civilians and "Bengali" soldiers—rape, pan smuggling, looting of banks in [[East Pakistan]], drunkenness by military officers, even an instance of a [[One-star rank|one star]] rank officer "entertaining" women while their troops were being shelled by Indian troops.&lt;ref name="Brookings Institution Press"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Stephen P. |author-link=Stephen P.

Despite recommending field [[court martial|courts-martial]] by the Commission, there were no actions taken by Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] or the successive governments.&lt;ref name="The Hamood-ur-Rahman Commission Report"/&gt; Nearly 300 individuals were interviewed and hundreds of classified armed forces [[Morse code|military signals]] were examined, with the final comprehensive [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report|Report]] was submitted on 23 October 1974 by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman who submitted the report to Prime minister Secretariat.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Rehman on "Separation"===

Originally, the Commission was to overlook the military failure to prevent the [[Breakup of East and West Pakistan|break–up]] of [[Eastern Pakistan]] but Chief Justice Rahman went into great depths in the roots of matter since the [[Independence of Pakistan|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947. A separate chapter on the [[Political history of Pakistan|political history]] of Pakistan was very detailed oriented and written by Chief Justice Rahman who critically opined on the political role of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Zulfikar Bhutto]]. Rahman critically opined on Bhutto and, with some degree, implicated Bhutto of manipulating President [[Yahya Khan]] to take the military action as a solution.

He noted that President [[Yahya Khan]] failed to seek a sincere political settlement with [[East Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="The Hamood-ur-Rahman Commission Report" /&gt; Though the responsibility of the debacle lay on the shoulders of the people in power then as was recommended in the report by Chief Justice Rahman.&lt;ref name="Brookings Institution Press" /&gt;

When the report was submitted the then Prime Minister Bhutto, the Prime minister wrote to the chairman War Enquiry Commission Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, that the commission has exceeded its limits. The Commission was appointed to look into the military "aspect of debacle", not the aspect of political failure; therefore, Bhutto classified the publications of the Commission and marked its report as "[[Top Secret]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Fate of the Report===
{{Main|Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report}}
In 1974, the final [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report|Report]] was submitted but both Bhutto and President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] claimed that the report was lost and was nowhere to be located in the [[National Archives of Pakistan|National Archives]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press, Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Owen Bennett|title=Pakistan: Eye of the Storm|publisher=Yale University Press, Jones|isbn=0300101473|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8iYEgPYG_EC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=hamoodur+Rahman+separation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic6v_v_9XOAhUW3mMKHWWHCnYQuwUIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=hamoodur%20rahman%20commission&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 August 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, it was revealed through [[investigative journalism]] by [[The News International|''News International'']] that the [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report|Report]] was suppressed and was held secretly at the [[JS HQ (Pakistan)|Joint staff HQ]] in [[Rawalpindi]].&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Bhatt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhatt|first1=Dr Arunkumar|title=Psychological Warfare and India|publisher=Lancer Publishers, Bhatt|isbn=9788170621331|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1whOBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=hamoodur+Rahman+commission&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA_Kjp_dXOAhUM5WMKHYrXDTUQuwUIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hamoodur%20Rahman%20commission&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 August 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, portion of the [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report|Report]] was leaked equally by the ''[[India Today]]'' and the [[Dawn (newspaper)|''Dawn'']].&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Bhatt"/&gt; However, the ''[[India Today]]'' wilfully suppressed its own publications as if the surrender was its own scandal.&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Bhatt"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Hamoodur Rahman lived a very quiet life in [[Lahore]] and remained active in the Supreme Court. He was appointed the Chairman of Islamic Ideology after his retirement for 3 years, later he was appointed as an advisor to the President of Pakistan on constitutional affairs. He also conducted a commission on election reforms and proposed the proportional representation system existing in Germany, Sri Lanka and many other countries .http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/ [[Supreme Court of Pakistan library|library]] to publish judicial supplements. He died in Lahore due to a [[Heart attack|cardiac arrest]] on 20 December 1981. He was buried in Lahore with close judicial associates and friends attending his funeral.&lt;ref name="All-Pakistan Legal Decisions"&gt;{{cite book |date=1984 |title=The All-Pakistan Legal Decisions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ki0-AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=hamoodur+rahman+BA+degree&amp;dq=hamoodur+rahman+BA+degree&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy0c6tx9DOAhVG6GMKHQ9oAHoQ6wEIPTAC |publisher=All-Pakistan Legal Decisions |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Justice Rahman remained a very respected in [[Court system of pakistan|Pakistan's judiciary]] even after his death, and is hailed for his [[honesty]] and [[Pakistani nationalism|patriotism]] that Senior Justice [[Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday]] once publicly noted that "his Commission was the most honorable commission that was investigated by a Bengali Chief Justice, in spite of East-Pakistan disaster", in 2010.&lt;ref name="Lahore Bar Association"/&gt;

'''''Hot Coffee''''' is a 2011 [[documentary film]] that analyzes and discusses the impact of [[tort reform]] on the [[United States]] judicial system. It is directed by Susan Saladoff, who has practiced as a [[medical malpractice]] attorney for at least 26 years. The film premiered at the [[2011 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 24, 2011, and later aired on [[HBO]] on June 27, 2011, as a part of HBO films documentary summer series. The title is derived from the ''[[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants]]'' lawsuit, in which the plaintiff Liebeck was severely burned after spilling into her lap hot coffee purchased from a [[McDonald's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tucker|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Tucker|title=The must-watch TV show of the night: 'Hot Coffee' on HBO|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2011/06/27/hot-coffee-hbo/|accessdate=28 June 2011|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff Post 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doroshow|first=Joanne|title=Watch Hot Coffee, a Powerful New Film on HBO June 27|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joanne-doroshow/watch-hot-coffee-a-powerf_b_884318.html|accessdate=28 June 2011|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases discussed==
''Hot Coffee'' discusses several cases and relates each to tort reform in the United States:
# ''[[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants|Liebeck v. McDonald's Rests.]]'', No. CV-93-02419, 1995 WL 360309 (N.M. 2d Jud. Dist. Aug. 18, 1994) (judgment awarding Liebeck $2.86 million in "hot coffee" case), ''vacated'', 1994 WL 16777704 (Nov. 28, 1994): how tort cases are publicized to instigate tort reform.
# ''Gourley v. Neb. Methodist Health Sys.'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1035096085453140871 663 N.W.2d 43] (Neb. 2003) (upholding Nebraska's [[Non-economic damages caps|statutory cap]] of $1.25 million on damages in medical malpractice actions).
# Prosecutions of then-Mississippi Supreme Court Presiding Justice [[Oliver E. Diaz, Jr.]] for bribery: how judges were elected for their positive stance on tort reform and were influenced by campaign contributions. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (not a United States government agency, but a lobbying group for businesses) funded negative campaign ads against judicial candidate Oliver E. Diaz and in support of candidate Keith Starrett. Oliver E. Diaz estimates ~$1,000,000+ dollars was spent on Keith Starrett's behalf for the judicial election.
# ''[[Jamie Leigh Jones#Civil lawsuit|Jones v. Halliburton Co.]]'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7577487418616160071 625 F. Supp. 2d 339] (S.D. Tex. 2008) (refusing to enforce [[mandatory arbitration]] of Jones's employment contract with respect to her claims of assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent hiring, retention, and supervision, and false imprisonment), ''aff'd'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4324929981623269022 583 F.3d 228] (5th Cir. 2009)

==''Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants''==
{{Main|Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants}}
This segment features interviews with Liebeck's family and focuses on their perspective of the trial. This included news clips, comments from celebrities and politicians about the case, as well as myths and misconceptions, including how many people thought she was driving when the incident occurred and thought that she suffered only minor superficial burns, while in truth she suffered severe burns and needed extensive surgeries. The concept of accountability is also discussed.
The film also discussed in great depth how ''Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants'' is often used and misused to describe a frivolous lawsuit and referenced in conjunction with tort reform efforts.&lt;ref name="Huff Post 1" /&gt; It argued that corporations have spent millions distorting certain tort cases in order to promote tort reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmerler|first=Jessica|title=Frivolous Lawsuits and How We Perceive Them|journal=Yale Journal of Medicine and Law|date=December 5, 2011|volume=VIII|issue=1|url=http://www.yalemedlaw.com/frivolous-lawsuits-and-how-we-perceive-them/|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Jamie Leigh Jones v. Halliburton Co.''==

[[Al Franken|Senator Al Franken]] features prominently in this segment.  He worked closely with [[Jamie Leigh Jones|Jones]] to get her case heard in court and proposed legislative changes to mandatory arbitration clauses. Subsequent to the film's release, Jones succeeded in trying her civil case before a federal court in Houston. However, she was unsuccessful in convincing a jury that she had been raped or that KBR had engaged in fraud when inducing her to sign her employment contract.  There was a long list of inconsistencies and contradictions exposed in her story during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mencimer|first=Stephanie|title=Why Jamie Leigh Jones Lost Her KBR Rape Case|date=July 7, 2011|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/07/kbr-could-win-jamie-leigh-jones-rape-trial|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds''' ('''IFSWF''') is a nonprofit international group of [[sovereign wealth funds]] managers which was established in 2009. It is based in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"/&gt;

==History==

In 2009, a group of 23 leading state-owned international investors from around the world established the IFSWF’s precursor, the International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds, following discussions with global groups such as the [[G20]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[U.S. Department of Treasury]] in 2007 and 2008. The Working Group created a set of Generally Accepted Principles and Practices, better known as the "[[Santiago Principles]]", for sovereign wealth funds’ institutional governance and risk-management frameworks. Following the Kuwait Declaration in 2009, the International Working Group became the IFSWF with the mandate of helping members implement the Principles.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.ifswf.org/about-us|website=IFSWF |accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

As of February 2018 IFSWF had 32 members, including some of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, like the [[China Investment Corporation]], [[Kuwait Investment Authority]], and the [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]].&lt;ref name="IFSWF003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifswf.org/our-members |title=Our Members  |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=9  February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was set up by the funds, so they could come together and create an organisation to promote [[best practice]] within their field. Its focus is "to exchange views on issues of common interest and to facilitate an understanding of sovereign wealth funds' activities and of the [[Santiago Principles]]".&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifswf.org/about-us |title=About us |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=27  September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 24 [[Santiago Principles]] are a voluntary standard of best practice principles and practices endorsed by the IFSWF members for the management of the Sovereign Wealth Funds.&lt;ref name="IFSWF002"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifswf.org/santiago-principles |title=Santiago Principles  |author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its member funds collectively have about $5.5 trillion under management, representing 80% of assets managed by sovereign funds globally.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"/&gt;

When established the IFSWF formalized a limited number of partnerships with world-leading financial and academic partners.&lt;ref name="YF001"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-appointed-international-forum-133300959.html |title=State Street Appointed by the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds as an Official Research Partner |author=Yahoo Finance |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural meeting of IFSWF was held in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], and it was hosted by the [[State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan]] and the government of [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="SOFRoA001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilfund.az/en_US/about_found/suveren-fondlarin-beynelxalq-forumu.asp |title=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds |publisher=State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan |website=oilfund.az |accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the IFSWF and [[Hedge Fund Standards Board|Standards Board for Alternative Investments]] establish a mutual observer relationship to share knowledge and experience with the objective to raise Standards in the financial industry.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hedgeweek.com/2016/04/04/238050/international-forum-sovereign-wealth-funds-ifswf-and-hedge-fund-standards-board-hf |title=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) and Hedge Fund Standards Board (HFSB) establish Mutual Observer relationship |author=Hedge Fund Standards Board |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the most recently published accounts at [[Companies House]], IFSWF Limited made a [[Net profit]] of £176,758 [[Pound sterling|GBP]] as of December 31, 2015. This included a nonrefundable capital transfer form the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] in relation to accumulated membership fees of £884,194 GBP. The accounts are generated in accordance with the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].&lt;ref name="2015Accounts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09060589/filing-history |title=IFSWF Limited |website=companieshouse.gov.uk |publisher=Companies House - UK Government |date=3 Oct 2016 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10668">The '''Iraq Oil Law''', also referred to as the '''Iraq Hydrocarbon Law''' was a piece of legislation submitted to the [[Iraqi Council of Representatives]] in May 2007 that laid out a framework for the regulation and development of Iraq's oil fields.&lt;ref name="PughCooper2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.

==Start of process==
The legislation started when the U.S.-backed Iraqi cabinet approved a new oil law that was set to give foreign companies the long-term contracts and the safe legal framework they have been waiting for.  The law rattled labour unions and international campaigners, who say oil production should remain in the hands of Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Oil Law Seen as Cover for Privatisation|first=Emad |last=Mekay|work=Inter Press Service|date=February 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2007, prominent Iraqi parliamentarians, politicians, ex-ministers and oil technocrats urged the Baghdad parliament to reject Iraq's controversial hydrocarbon law, fearing that the new legislation would further divide the country already witnessing civil strife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Some Iraqi Politicians Urge Rejection of Draft Oil Law |first=Hassan |last=Hafidh|work=[[Dow Jones Newswires]]|date=March 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2007, discussions turned contentious among the more than 60 Iraqi oil officials reviewing Iraq's draft hydrocarbons bill in the United Arab Emirates. But the dispute highlighted the need for further negotiations on the proposed law that was stalled in talks for nearly eight months, then pushed through Iraq's Cabinet without most key provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fight Rages Over Iraq Oil Law |first=Ben |last=Lando|work=[[United Press International]]|date=April 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 2, 2007, The Bush administration was concerned that recent security gains in Iraq may be undermined by continuing political gridlock, and started pushing the Iraqi government to complete long-delayed reform legislation within six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/01/AR2007120101750.html|title=U.S. Envoy, After Tour of Iraq, Seeks End to Political Impasse|first=Karen |last=DeYoung|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative law response==
{{see also|Administrative law}}
On June 30, 2008, a group of American advisers led by a small State Department team played an integral part in drawing up contracts between the Iraqi government and five major Western oil companies to develop some of the largest fields in Iraq American officials say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/world/middleeast/30contract.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=U.S. Advised Iraqi Ministry on Oil Deals|first=Andrew |last=Kramer|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the [[Iraqi Oil Ministry]] announced plans to go ahead with small one- or two-year [[no-bid contracts]] to [[Exxon Mobil]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Total S.A.|Total]] and [[BP]] — once partners in the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] — along with [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] and smaller firms to service Iraq’s largest fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By July 1, 2008, Iraq's government invited foreign firms Monday to help boost the production of the country's major oil fields, beginning a global competition for access to the world's third-largest reserves.

By February 2009, Iraq had "sweetened" the terms it was the offering international oil companies vying to develop the country’s reserves in the first concrete example of a global shift in power beginning to sweep through the oil industry.

Iraq, which pre-qualified about 45 companies to bid on oil projects, plans to award contracts for the six partly developed and four undeveloped fields offered in its second licensing round by mid-December.

One stumbling block was the unpopularity of the law, as it is perceived by the Iraqi people. An opinion poll conducted in 2007 by Oil Change International and other groups shows 63% of Iraqis surveyed would "prefer Iraq's oil to be developed and produced by Iraqi state-owned companies [than] by foreign companies". This explains why the law had stalled in the Iraqi parliament.&lt;ref name=OCI&gt;{{cite web

==Profit sharing==
The new law authorizes [[production share agreement]]s (PSAs) which guarantees a profit for foreign [[oil companies]].&lt;ref name=Janabi/&gt;

The central government distributes remaining oil revenues throughout the nation on a [[per capita]] basis.&lt;ref name=Juhasz&gt;{{cite news

==Criticism of the new law==
Some critics have claimed that the new Iraqi Oil law was not needed since Iraq has the cheapest oil to extract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Economic systems sidebar |By i}}
'''Islamic economics''' ({{lang-ar|الاقتصاد الإسلامي}}) is a term used to refer to '''Islamic commercial jurisprudence''' ({{lang-ar|فقه المعاملات}}, ''fiqh al-mu'āmalāt'').

Islamic commercial jurisprudence entails the rules of transacting finance or other economic activity in a ''[[Shari'a]]'' compliant manner,&lt;ref name=mat&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mat|first1=Ismail|first2=Yusof|last2=Ismail|title=A Review of Fiqh al-Mua'malat Subjects in Economics and Related Programs at International Islamic University Malaysia and University of Brunei Darussalam|url=http://www.kantakji.com/media/6426/op57.pdf|website=kantakji.com|accessdate=22 January 2015|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., a manner conforming to [[Islam]]ic [[scripture]] ([[Quran]] and [[sunnah]]).
Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') has traditionally dealt with determining what is required, prohibited, encouraged, discouraged, or just permissible,&lt;ref name=saleem/&gt; according to the revealed word of God ([[Quran]]) and the religious practices established by [[Muhammad]] ([[sunnah]]). This applied to issues like property, money, employment, taxes, along with everything else. The social science of [[economics]],&lt;ref name=saleem&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saleem|first1=Muhammad Yusuf|title=Methods and Methodologies in Fiqh and Islamic Economics|url=http://www.kantakji.com/media/6423/op54.pdf|website=kantakji.com|accessdate=22 January 2015|page=1|date=n.d. |quote=The paper argues that the methods used in Fiqh are mainly designed to find out whether or not a certain act is permissible or prohibited. Islamic economics, on the other hand, is a social science.

In the mid-twentieth century, campaigns began promoting the idea of specifically Islamic patterns of economic thought and behavior.&lt;ref name=Kuran-x/&gt; By the 1970s, "Islamic economics" was introduced as an academic discipline in a number of institutions of higher learning throughout the Muslim world and in the West.&lt;ref name=mat/&gt;  The central features of an Islamic [[economy]] are often summarized as: (1) the "behavioral norms and moral foundations" derived from the [[Quran]] and [[Sunnah]]; (2) collection of ''[[zakat]]'' and other [[Islamic taxes]], (3) [[Riba#Prohibition of riba|prohibition of interest]] (''[[riba]]'') charged on loans.&lt;ref name="KuranEconSys"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/163259 ''The economic system in contemporary Islamic thought: Interpretation and assessment''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529112345/http://www.jstor.org/stable/163259 |date=May 29, 2016 }}, by Timur Kuran, International Journal of Middle East Studies, 18, 1986, pp. 135–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran (Al-Baqarah 2:275), (Al-Baqarah 2:276–80), (Al-'Imran 3:130), (Al-Nisa 4:161), (Ar-Rum 30:39)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Islamic Moral Economy: A Study of Islamic Money and Financial Instruments | author=Karim, Shafiel A. | year=2010 | publisher=Brown Walker Press | location=Boca Raton, FL | isbn=978-1-59942-539-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Regulation in Crisis?: The Role of Law and the Failure of Northern Rock By Joanna Gray, Orkun Akseli p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of Islamic economics generally describe it as neither [[socialism|socialist]] nor [[capitalism|capitalist]], but as a "third way", an ideal mean with none of the drawbacks of the other two systems.&lt;ref name="allacademic.com"&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p108508_index.html Islam and Economic Justice: A 'Third Way' Between Capitalism and Socialism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107114616/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p108508_index.html |date=January 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gemsofislamism.tripod.com"&gt;[http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/muhammad_qutb_islam.html#welfare How Do We Know Islam Will Solve the Problems of Poverty and Inequality?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503061611/http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/muhammad_qutb_islam.html#welfare |date=May 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ishaque&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ishaque|first1=Khalid M.|editor1-last=Esposito,|editor1-first=John L.|title=Voices of Resurgent Islam|date=1983|pages=268–276|chapter=Islamic Approach to Economic Development|quote=the two models projected by the First and the Second Worlds.

==Definitions and descriptions==
{{Islamism sidebar|Fundamentals}}
According to Hasan Raza, after more than six decades of its formal/ informal existence, a consensus definition of Islamic economics has not yet emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Iqbal |first1=Dunawar |last2=Syed Ali |first2=Salman |last3=Muljawan |first3=Dadang |date=2007 |title=Advances in Islamic Economics and Finance |url=http://www.iefpedia.com/english/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Advances-in-Islamic-Economics-Finance-%E2%80%93-Munawar-Iqbal-Salman-Syed-Ali-Dadang-Muljawan.pdf |accessdate=22 June 2016 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions that have been offered include:

He proposes a definition based on purely Islamic sources: "Islamic Economics is the EFFORT/STRUGGLE to implement the orders of Allah pertaining to economic affairs in our individual lives (Micro),  in our communities (Meso), and at the level of Ummah (Macro)." 

===Fiqh and Islamic economics===
FIqh (religious law)  has developed several traditional concepts having to do with economics. These included:
* ''[[Zakat]]''—the "[[charity (practice)|charitable]] taxing of certain assets, such as [[currency]], [[gold]], or [[harvest]], with an eye to allocating these taxes to eight expenditures that are also explicitly defined in the Quran, such as aid to those in need."
* ''[[Gharar]]''—"uncertainty". The presence of any element of excessive uncertainty, in a [[contract]] is prohibited.
* ''[[Riba]]''—"referred to as [[usury]] (modern Islamic economists reached consensus that Riba is any kind of interest, rather than just usury)"&lt;ref name="Roy, 1994, p. 132"&gt;{{harvnb|Roy|1994|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source lists "general rules" include prohibition of ''Riba'', ''Gharar'', and also  
*''[[Qimar]]'' (gambling)&lt;ref name="tabari" /&gt;   and 
*the encouragement of ''[[Taa’won]]'' (mutual cooperation),&lt;ref name="tabari" /&gt;
*"the overriding doctrine of fairness in commercial dealings is established."&lt;ref name="tabari" /&gt;

These concepts, like others in Islamic law, came from study of the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith|ahadith]]—or as one observer put it, were   
&lt;blockquote&gt;constructed on the basis of isolated prescriptions, anecdotes, examples, words of the Prophet, all gathered together and systematized by commentators according to an inductive, casuistic method."&lt;ref name="roy-13"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YEGw8S3ovaoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Failure+of+Political+Islam+by+Olivier+Roy#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Failure%20of%20Political%20Islam%20by%20Olivier%20Roy&amp;f=false|title=The Failure of Political Islam|date=1994|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=13|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|accessdate=22 January 2015|isbn=9780674291416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition to [[Quran]] and [[Hadith|ahadith]] sometimes other sources such as ''[[al-urf]]'' (custom), or ''al-[[ijma]]'' (consensus of the [[Ulama|jurists]]) are employed,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schirazi|Asghar||1997|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create laws that determine whether actions were [[Haram|forbidden]], [[Makruh|discouraged]], [[Mubah|allowed]], [[Mustahabb|encouraged]] and [[Fard|obligatory]] for Muslims. The different school of fiqh (''[[madhhab]]'') vary slightly in their rulings.

Works of fiqh  are typically divided into different "books" such as a Book of ''[[Iman (concept)|Iman]]'',  of ''[[Salah]]'',  ''[[Zakat]]'',  ''[[Taqwa]]'',  ''[[Hajj]],'' but not  `economics` or `economy`.&lt;ref name="roy-133" /&gt;  Some brief works  might contain almost nothing related to matters of property, sales, finance {{#tag:ref|such as ''The Essential Hanafi Handbook of Fiqh'' by Qazi Thanaa Ullah).&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Hanafi Handbook of Fiqh'' A Translation of Qazi Thanaa Ullah's Ma La Budda Minhu,  by Maulana Yusuf Talal Ali al-Amriki, (Kazi Publications, Lahore, Pakistan)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  Others do not gather questions on economic issues in one heading, the case in  ''Tawzih al-masa'il'', a work of [[fatwa|fatawa]] by Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], who although a pioneer of [[political Islam]] approached the subject of economy&lt;blockquote&gt;"as the classical ulamas do ... the chapter on selling and buying (''Kharid o forush'') comes after the one on pilgrimage and present economic questions as individual acts open to moral analysis: `To lend [without interest, on a note from the lender] is among the good works that are particularly recommended in the verses of the Quran and in the Traditions.`"&lt;ref name="roy-133"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YEGw8S3ovaoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Failure+of+Political+Islam+by+Olivier+Roy#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Failure%20of%20Political%20Islam%20by%20Olivier%20Roy&amp;f=false|title=The Failure of Political Islam|date=1994|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=133|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|accessdate=22 January 2015|isbn=9780674291416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(source: Ruhollah Khomeini, ''Tawzih al-masa'il'',  p.543)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other works divided the subjects of fiqh into four "quarters":&lt;ref name="4IToFM2014:8"&gt;[[Islamic economics#4IToFM2014|JALIL, et. al., ''FOUR INTRODUCTORY THEORIES OF FIQH MUAMALAT'']]: p.8&lt;/ref&gt; typically worship  (al-`Ibadat), marriage and family law (al-Munakahat), criminal law (Jinayat),  commercial transaction law (''[[Muamalat|Mu'amalat]]'').&lt;ref name="ODI-muamala"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1564?_hi=0&amp;_pos=4953|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam.

A number of scholars ([[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]], [[Timur Kuran]], Omar Norman) have noted the recentness of reflecting on economic issues in the Islamic world,&lt;ref name="Kuran-x" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roy-133" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norman-74" /&gt; and the difference between economics the social science based on data, and Islamic jurisprudence based on revealed truth.

Salman Ahmed Shaikh and Monzer Kahf insist on a clear distinction between the roles of ''Fiqh'' and Islamic Economics, Shaikh saying &lt;blockquote&gt;to be meritorious as a separate field of inquiry, Islamic economics cannot confine itself just to explaining and deducing laws in economic matters based on core principles. Since this function is already performed by the discipline of Islamic jurisprudence ...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamiceconomicsproject.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/difference-between-islamic-economics-and-islamic-law/|title=Difference between Islamic Economics and Islamic Law|last=Shaikh|first=Salman Ahmed|date=2014-03-11|website=Islamic Economics Project|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
M. Kahf writes that ''mu'amalat'' and Islamic economics "often intermingle",&lt;ref name="MKRDMIE2003:47"&gt;[[Islamic economics#MKRDMIE2003|Kahf, "Relevance definition and methodology", 2003]]: p.47&lt;/ref&gt; ''mu'amalat''  "sets terms and conditions of conduct for economic and financial relationships in the Islamic economy" and provides the "grounds on which new instruments" of Islamic financing are developed,&lt;ref name="MKRDMIE2003:46" /&gt; but that the "nature of ''Fiqh'' imposes a concern about individual transactions and their minute legalistic characteristics", so that analyzing Islamic economics in terms of ''Fiqh''" risks losing "the ability to provide a macro economic theory".&lt;ref name="MKRDMIE2003:49"&gt;[[Islamic economics#MKRDMIE2003|Kahf, "Relevance definition and methodology", 2003]]: p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economist Muhammad Akram Khan the "main plank" of Islamic economics is the "theory of riba", while "another landmark" is [[zakat]], a tax on wealth and income.&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:xv-xvi&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.xv-xvi&lt;/ref&gt; According to another contemporary writer Salah El-Sheikh, "Islamic economic principles"  (what he calls a "FiqhiConomic model") utilize the [[Faqīh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) as supporting material, but are grounded upon the ethical teachings within the Qu'rān.  Sharīah's basic tenets involve gharar and (fadl māl bilā 'iwad). Gharar insists all knowledge about a trade or transaction is known before two individuals complete a transaction and (fadl māl bilā 'iwad) warns against unjustified enrichment through trade and business. These tenets were "among the first economic regulations" and their philosophy can be seen today in modern Capitalism.  Within Sharīah, El-Sheikh states, Gharar functions as a divine deterrent against asymmetric information and allows trade to prosper. Riba, ensures each transaction is conducted at a fair price, not allowing one party to benefit exceedingly, which shares a parallel philosophy with Karl Marx "Das Kapital": seeking a greater outcome for the community.&lt;ref&gt;El-Sheikh, Salah. 2008.

===Pre-modern Muslim thought on economics===
Classical scholars in the Muslim world did however, make valuable contributions to Islamic thought on issues involving production, consumption, income, wealth, property, taxation, land ownership, etc. are [[Abu Yusuf]] (d. 798),  Muhammad bin al-Hasan (d. 805), [[Al-Mawardi]] (d. 1058), [[Ibn Hazm]] (d. 1064), Al-Sarakhsi (d. 1090), Al-Tusi (d. 1093), [[Al-Ghazali]] (d. 1111), [[Abu al-Fadl Ja'far ibn 'Ali al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]] (d. after 1175), [[Ibn Rushd]] (d. 1187), [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (d.1328), Ibn al-Ukhuwwah (d. 1329), [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] (d. 1350), [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani|Sayyid Ali Hamadani]] (d. 1384), [[Al-Shatibi]] (d. 1388), [[Ibn Khaldun]] (d. 1406), [[Al-Maqrizi]] (d. 1442), Al-Dawwani (d. 1501), and [[Shah Waliyullah]] (d. 1762).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Chapra|first=Umer|editor=Whaples, Robert|title=Islamic Economics: What It Is and How It Developed|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/chapra.islamic|encyclopedia=EH.net: Encyclopedia of Economic and Business History|year=2010|accessdate=8 July 2011|ref=harv|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609123906/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/chapra.islamic|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abu Yusuf]] (d. 798) was author of the book ''al Kharaj''&amp;mdash;literally "the return or revenue" but was used by the author to mean "public revenues and taxation"&amp;mdash;which was a policy guide to [[Harun al-Rashid]], the fifth [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]].&lt;ref name="MKRDMIE2003:2"&gt;[[Islamic economics#MKRDMIE2003|Kahf, "Relevance definition and methodology", 2003]]: p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad bin al-Hasan (d.805)  wrote  ''al Iktisab fi al Rizq al Mustatab'' [Earned Desired income], intended as advice to businessmen "in their endeavors to create income opportunities".&lt;ref name="MKRDMIE2003:2" /&gt;  Abu 'Ubaid al Qasim bin Sallam (d.839) was the author of  ''al-Amwal''  (plural of "wealth").&lt;ref name="MKRDMIE2003:2" /&gt;

Perhaps the most well-known Islamic scholar who wrote about economics issues was [[Ibn Khaldun]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Sobhi Mahmassani|Mahmassani, Sobhi]] (1932). ''Les Idées Economiques d'Ibn Khaldoun (The Economic Thought of Ibn Khaldoun)'', BOSC Frères, M. et L.

Boulakia (1971), "Ibn Khaldun: A Fourteenth-Century Economist", ''The Journal of Political Economy'' '''79''' (5): 1105–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun wrote on what is now called economic and political theory in the introduction, or ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (''Prolegomena''), of his ''History of the World'' (''[[Kitab al-Ibar]]''). He discussed what he called ''asabiyya'' (social cohesion), which he cited as the cause of some civilizations becoming great and others not. Ibn Khaldun felt that many social forces are cyclic, although there could be sudden sharp turns that break the pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|1995|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His idea about the benefits of the [[division of labor]] also relate to ''asabiyya'', the greater the social cohesion, the more complex the successful division may be, the greater the economic growth. He noted that growth and development positively stimulates both [[supply and demand]], and that the forces of supply and demand are what determines the prices of goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|1995|p=31}} quotes Muqaddimah 2:276–78&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted [[macroeconomic]] forces of population growth, [[human capital]] development, and technological developments effects on development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|1995|p=31}} quotes ''Muqaddimah'' 2: 272–73&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Ibn Khaldun thought that population growth was directly a function of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|1995|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval Islamic economics appears to have somewhat resembled a form of capitalism, some arguing that it laid the foundations for the development of modern capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Charlemagne, Muhammad, and the Arab roots of capitalism|first=Gene W.|last=Heck|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|year=2006|isbn=978-3-11-019229-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Capitalism and Freedom: The Contradictory Character of Globalisation|first=Peter|last=Nolan|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84331-280-2|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of "Islamic economics"===
According to  Timur Kuran, "not until the mid-twentieth century" was there any body of thought that could be called "Islamic economics", that was "recognizable as a coherent or self-contained doctrine". But around 1950 "campaigns launched to identify self-consciously, if not also exclusively, Islamic patterns of economic thought and behavior".&lt;ref name=Kuran-x&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuran|first1=Timur|title=Islam and Mammon: The Economic Predicaments of Islamism|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=x|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22Islam+and+mammon%22+%22most+muslims,+whether+or+not%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Islam%20and%20mammon%22%20%22most%20muslims%2C%20whether%20or%20not%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2015|isbn=978-1400837359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous early-20th Century Muslim nationalist and author [[Muhammad Iqbal]], for example, did not refer to religion in his treatise on economics.&lt;ref name=norman-74&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hathaway |editor1-first=Robert M.|editor2-last=Lee|editor2-first=Wilson |title=Islamization and the Pakistani Economy|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/~/media/E49831A1165C49EBA902C83648F0CE36.pdf |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|date=2006|accessdate=13 August 2012|first=Omar |last=Norman |chapter=5.

Even at the turn of the 19th century, the phrase was not used by major Islamic thinkers.

Iqbal's Ilm–ul–Iqtesaad, published in 1902, was notable in its absence of religion in the understanding of the economy. The intellectual father of Islamic economics is Maulana Maudoodi, the scholar whose views have shaped the Jamaat-e-Islami|ref=IPERH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic economics grew naturally from the Islamic revival and political Islam whose adherents considered Islam to be a complete system of life in all its aspects, rather than a spiritual formula&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam101.com/economy/economicLife.htm The Economic Life of Islam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153555/http://www.islam101.com/economy/economicLife.htm |date=April 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that it logically followed that Islam must have an economic system, unique from and superior to non-Islamic economic systems.{{#tag:ref|M.T.

;1960, 70s
In the 1960s and 1970s, Shi'a thinkers worked to describe Islamic economics' "own answers to contemporary economic problems." Several works were particularly influential:
* ''Eslam va Malekiyyat'' (Islam and Property) by Mahmud Taleqani (1951),
* ''[[Iqtisaduna]]'' (Our Economics) by [[Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr]] (1961) and
* ''Eqtesad-e Towhidi'' (The Economics of Divine Harmony) by [[Abolhassan Banisadr]] (1978)
* ''Some Interpretations of Property Rights, Capital and Labor from Islamic Perspective'' by Habibullah Peyman (1979).&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, Shaul, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'', Basic Books, c1984, pp. 167–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="international.ucla.edu"&gt;[http://www.international.ucla.edu/cms/files/behdadtxt.pdf Revolutionary Surge and Quiet Demise of Islamic Economics in Iran] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117090118/http://www.international.ucla.edu/cms/files/behdadtxt.pdf |date=January 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Sadr in particular was described as having "almost single-handedly developed the notion of Islamic economics"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/825 The Renewal of Islamic Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007051609/http://www.meforum.org/article/825 |date=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their writings, Sadr and the other authors "sought to depict Islam as a religion committed to social justice, the equitable distribution of wealth, and the cause of the deprived classes," with doctrines "acceptable to Islamic jurists," while refuting existing non-Islamic theories of [[capitalism]] and [[Marxism]].  [[Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr]] and also cleric [[Mahmoud Taleghani]] developed an "Islamic economics" emphasizing  a major role for the state in matters such as circulation and equitable distribution of wealth, and a reward to participants in the marketplace for being exposed to risk or liability. 
This version of Islamic economics, which influenced the [[Iranian Revolution]], called for public ownership of land and of large "industrial enterprises," while private economic activity continued "within reasonable limits."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bakhash|1984|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas informed the large public sector and public subsidy policies of the Iranian Revolution.

Sunni cleric [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]] proposed economic system (''Nidham ul-Iqtisad fil Islam'' (The Economic System of Islam) by Taqiuddin Nabhani (1953)) combined public ownership of large chunks of the economy (utilities, public transport, health care, energy resources such as oil, and unused farm land), with use of the [[gold standard]] and specific instructions for the gold and silver weights of coins, arguing this would "demolish ... American control and the control of the dollar as an international currency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hizb-ut-Tahrir.org/english/books/hizb-ut-Tahrir/chapter_09.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040704022600/http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/english/books/hizb-ut-Tahrir/chapter_09.html |title=Untitled Document |archivedate= 4 July 2004 |publisher= |accessdate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sunni world the first international conference on Islamic economics was held at the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah in 1976. Since then the [[International Association for Islamic Economics]] in collaboration with the [[Islamic Development Bank]] has held conferences in Islamabad (1983), Kuala Lumpur (1992), Loughborough (2000), Bahrain (2003), Jakarta (2005) and Jeddah (2008), Iqbal (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal, Zamir and Abbas Mirakhor (2008). ''An Introduction to Islamic finance.'' Lahore; Vanguard Books&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there have been hundreds of seminars, workshops and discussion groups around the world on Islamic economics and finance.&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:6&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.6&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. a small number of [[patent application]]s have been filed for Sharia compliant financial service methods.&lt;ref&gt;An example of a pending patent application: {{Cite patent|US|US20030233324A1}} "Declining balance co-ownership financing arrangement" (an allegedly Sharia compliant financing arrangement for home purchases and refinances that does not involve the payment of interest).&lt;/ref&gt;
;Khomeini era
What has been called one of "two versions" of "Islamic economy" existed during the first ten years (1979-1989) of the [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]] during the life of [[Supreme Leader]] (and [[Iranian Revolution|revolution]] founder) [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]. This was an "Islamist [[socialist]], and state-run": It was "little by little supplanted" by a more liberal economic policy.&lt;ref name=roy-138&gt;Roy, Olivier, ''The Failure of Political Islam'' by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk, Harvard University Press, 1994, p.138, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

;Post-socialist trend
In the 1980s and 1990s, as the [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran#Iran's economy and human development|Islamic revolution]] failed to reach the [[per capita income]] level achieved by the regime it overthrew, and Communist states and socialist parties in the non-Muslim world turned away from [[socialism]], Muslim interest shifted away from government ownership and regulation. In Iran, "''eqtesad-e Eslami'' (meaning both Islamic economics and economy) ... once a revolutionary shibboleth, is indubitably absent in all official documents and the media. It disappeared from Iranian political discourse" about 1990.&lt;ref name="international.ucla.edu"/&gt; During the era of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], several Islamic economic concepts and practices were introduced into the domestic economy, as part of Zia's Islamisation reforms (see [[Islamic economics in Pakistan]]).

The term lived on in the Muslim world, shifting form to the less ambitious goal of interest-free banking. Some Muslim bankers and religious leaders suggested ways to integrate Islamic law on usage of money with modern concepts of [[ethical investing]]. In banking this was done through the use of sales transactions (focusing on the fixed rate return modes) to support investing without interest-bearing debt. Many modern writers have strongly criticized this approach as a means of covering conventional banking with an Islamic facade.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Muhammad, ''What is Wrong with Islamic Economics'' Edward Elgar Publishing, 2013, pp. 216 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; (Sohrab Behada has argued that the economic system proposed by Islam is essentially a capitalist one.&lt;ref name = Behada&gt;Sohrab Behada, "Property Rights in Contemporary Islamic Economic Thought, ''Review of Social Economy'', Summer 1989 v. 47, (pp. 185–211)&lt;/ref&gt;)

==As an academic discipline==

===Achievements===

As of 2008 there were:
*Eight magazines recently started "exclusively devoted to Islamic economics and finance",&lt;ref name=Ali-2008-155&gt;Ali, S Nazim. 2008. Islamic finance and economics as reflected in research and publications. ''Review of Islamic Economics'', 12 (1):  155&lt;/ref&gt;

*One school—the Kulliyyah of Economics and Management Sciences of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) -- has produced over 2000 graduates in 25 years as of 2009.&lt;ref name=Haneef-2009-4&gt;Haneef, Mohamed A. 2009.

King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah hosted the first international conference on Islamic economics in 1976. Thereafter the International Association for Islamic Economics in collaboration with the Islamic Development Bank has held conferences in Islamabad (1983), Kuala Lumpur (1992), Loughborough (2000), Bahrain (2003), Jakarta (2005) and Jeddah (2008) Iqbal 2008).&lt;ref name="WIWWIE2013:6"/&gt;

===Challenges===
Along with these achievements, some Islamic economists have complained of problems in the academic discipline: a shift in interest away from Islamic Economics to Islamic Finance since the 1980s, a shortage of university courses, reading materials that are "either scant or of poor quality",&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:8&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.8&lt;/ref&gt; lack of intellectual freedom,&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:11&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.11&lt;/ref&gt; "narrow focus" on interest-free banking and [[zakat]] without data-based research to substantiate claim made for them—that interest causes economic problems or that zakat solves them.&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:14-5&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.14-5&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of economists have lamented that while [[Islamic Finance]] was originally a "[[subset]]" of Islamic Economics, economics and research in pure Islamic economics has been "shifted to the back burner".&lt;ref name=Kayed-2008-193&gt;Kayed, Rasem N. 2008.

&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:13-4&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.13-4&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economist Rasem Kayed, while a number of universities and institutes of higher learning now offer courses on Islamic economics and finance "most of the courses offered by these institutions pertain to [[Islamic finance]] rather than Islamic economics."&lt;ref name=Kayed-2008-190-1&gt;Kayed, Rasem N. 2008. ''[http://islmiccenter.kaau.edu.sa/7iecon/index.html Appraisal of the status of research on labor economics in the Islamic framework]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.'' Paper presented at 7th International Conference on Islamic Economics, King Abdulaziz University, 1–3 April, Jeddah, : 190-1)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Surveying Islamic economics and finance courses being offered as of 2008 by 14 universities in Muslim countries, Kayed found 551 courses in conventional economics and finance, and only 12 courses in Islamic economics and finance (only 2% of the total).&lt;ref name=Kayed-2008-190-1/&gt; This "appalling and intolerable ... negligence" was made worse by the curriculum of the courses which failed to debate "the issues" the discipline or give "due thought to ... the future development of Islamic financial industry" but rather attempted "to squeeze as much abstract information" as possible in their courses, according to Kayed.&lt;ref name=Kayed-2008-193/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:6-7&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Another economist (Muhammad Akram Khan) lamented that "the real problem is that despite efforts for developing a separate discipline of Islamic economics, there is not much that can be genuinely called `economics`. Most of Islamic economics consists of theology on economic matters."&lt;ref name="WIWWIE2013:7"/&gt; 
Another (M.N. Siddiqi) notes Islamic economics has been teaching "conventional economics from an Islamic perspective", rather than Islamic economics.&lt;ref name=Hasan-2005-30/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siddiqi, M.N., 1996, ''Teaching economics in Islamic perspective.'' Jeddah: King Abdulaziz University, Centre for Research in Islamic Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its start in 1976, as of 2009, 2013 Islamic economics was called still in its infancy,&lt;ref name=Haneef-2009-4/&gt;&lt;ref name="WIWWIE2013:7"/&gt; 
its "curricula frames, course structures, reading materials, and research", "mostly" anchored in the "mainstream tradition",&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:7/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hasan-2005-30&gt;Hasan, Zubair. 2005 Treatment of consumption in Islamic economics: An appraisal. ''Journal of King Abdulaziz University: Islamic Economics'', 18 (2): 29-46&lt;/ref&gt;  "lacking sufficiency, depth, coordination and direction," with teaching faculties in many cases ... found short of the needed knowledge, scholarship, and commitment."&lt;ref name=Hasan_2009_81&gt;Hasan, Zubair. 2009, "Islamic finance education at the graduate level: Current state and challenges." ''Islamic Economic Studies'', 16 (1,2) (January) 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:7-8&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.7-8&lt;/ref&gt; "Distinct textbooks and teaching materials" required have been found to "neither exist" nor be "easy to create."&lt;ref name="WIWWIE2013:8"/&gt;  Despite shortcomings in academic writing—most of the books are "not cohesive" and are "at best no more than extended papers on specific topics"—constructive evaluations are not common and response to what there is even less common.&lt;ref name=Hasan_2009_92-3&gt;Hasan, Zubair. 2009, "Islamic finance education at the graduate level: Current state and challenges." ''Islamic Economic Studies'', 16 (1,2) (January) 92-3&lt;/ref&gt; 
The lack of an Islamic economics textbook "looms large" for Muslim economists and scholars. Despite the holding of a workshop in November 2010 to arrange the writing of such a textbook, the participation of "a number of eminent Muslim economists", (at the International Institute of Islamic Thought in London) and the appointment of "a noted Muslim economist" to coordinate the production of the textbook, as of 2015 "no standard textbook of Islamic economics was available."&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:9-10&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic economic institutes are not known for their intellectual freedom, and according to Muhammad Akram Khan are unlikely to allow criticism of the ideas or policies of their founding leaders or governments. The Centre for Research in Islamic Economics, an organ of the Jeddah University in Saudi Arabia, for example, "cannot allow publication of any work that goes against the orthodox thinking of the influential" Saudi religious leadership.&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:11/&gt; Despite "tall talk about ijtehad", Islamic economists "are shy" about "suggesting innovative ideas" for fear of antagonizing religious clerics.&lt;ref name="WIWWIE2013:11"/&gt;

Use of Islamic terminology not only for distinctive Islamic concepts such as ''riba, zakat, mudaraba'' but also for concepts that do not have specific Islamic connotation -- ''adl'' for justice, ''hukuma'' for government—locking out non-Muslim and even not Arabic speaking readers from the content of Islamic economics and even "giving legitimacy" to "pendantry" in the field.&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:12&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Property ==

According to authors F. Nomani and A. Rahnema, the Qur'an states that God is the sole owner of all matter in the heavens and the earth,&lt;ref&gt;Nomani and Rahnema quote {{cite quran|2|107|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|255|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|284|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|5|120|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|48|14|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; but man is God's viceregent on earth and holds God's possessions in trust (''amanat''). Islamic jurists divide properties into public, state, private categories.&lt;ref name =NomaniP1&gt;F. Nomani and A. Rahnema. 1994. ''Islamic Economic Systems'', Zed Press. pp. 66–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Muslims believe that the Shariah provides "specific laws and standards regarding the use and allocation of resources including land, water, animals, minerals, and
manpower."&lt;ref name=hamed&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamed|first1=Safei-Eldin|title=SEEING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH ISLAMIC EYES: Application of Shariah to Natural Resources Planning and Management|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=145–164 |url=http://www.arch.ttu.edu/scienceandspirituality/hamed_sands_colloquium_paper.pdf|date=1993|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public property===
According to M.A.Khan, "Islam introduced the distinction between private property and public property and made the rulers accountable to the people".&lt;ref name="IIE-MAK-20"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khan|first1=Muhammad Akram|title=Introduction to Islamic Economics|date=1994|publisher=THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT and INSTITUTE OF POLICY STUDIES|location=Islamabad, Pakistan|isbn=978-1-56564-079-5 |page=20|url=http://www.muslim-library.com/dl/books/English_An_Introduction_to_Islamic_Economics_.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2018}} 
Scholars F. Nomani and A. Rahnema state that public property in Islam refers to natural resources ([[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s, uncultivated land, [[water]], [[Mining|mines]], [[Ocean#Economy|oceanic resources]] etc.) to which all humans have equal right. Such resources are considered the [[the commons|common]] property of the community. Such property is placed under the guardianship and control of the Islamic state, and can be used by any citizen, as long as that use does not undermine the rights of other citizens, according to Nomani and Rahnema.&lt;ref name =NomaniP1/&gt;{{better source|date=April 2018}}

The owner of previously public property that is privatized pays ''zakat'' and, according to Shi'ite scholars, ''[[khums]]'' as well.
In general, the [[privatization]] and [[nationalization]] of public property is subject to debate amongst Islamic scholars.

According to an analysis by Walid El-Malik in 1993, only the Maliki school took the position that all kinds of natural resources are state-owned; the Hanafi school took the opposite view and held that mineral ownership followed surface ownership, while the other two schools, Shafi'i and Hanbali, drew a distinction between "hidden" and "unhidden" minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=g1G52SwFjeQC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=maliki+natural+resources+hanafi#v=onepage&amp;q=maliki%20natural%20resources%20hanafi&amp;f=false | title=Finders Keepers?: How the Law of Capture Shaped the World Oil Industry| isbn=9781936331765| last1=Daintith| first1=Terence| year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State property===
State property includes certain natural resources, as well as other property that can't immediately be privatized. Islamic state property can be movable, or immovable, and can be acquired through conquest or peaceful means. Unclaimed, unoccupied and heir-less properties, including uncultivated land (''mawat''), can be considered state property.&lt;ref name =NomaniP1/&gt;

During the life of Muhammad, one fifth of military equipment captured from the enemy in the battlefield was considered state property. During his reign, [[Umar]] (on the recommendation of [[Ali]]) considered conquered land to be state rather than private property (as was usual practice). The purported reason for this was that privatizing this property would concentrate resources in the hands of a few, and prevent it from being used for the general good. The property remained under the occupation of the cultivators, but taxes were collected on it for the state treasury.&lt;ref name =NomaniP1/&gt;

Muhammad  said "Old and fallow lands are for God and His Messenger (i.e. state property), then they are for you". Jurists draw from this the conclusion that, ultimately, private ownership takes over state property.&lt;ref name =NomaniP1/&gt;

===Private property===
There is consensus amongst Islamic jurists and social scientists that Islam recognizes and upholds the individual's right to private ownership. The Qur'an extensively discusses taxation, [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|inheritance]], prohibition against stealing, legality of ownership, recommendation to give charity and other topics related to private property. Islam also guarantees the protection of private property by imposing stringent punishments on thieves. Muhammad said that he who dies defending his property was like a [[Shahid|martyr]].&lt;ref name =NomaniP2&gt;{{harvnb|Nomani|Rahnema|1994|pp=71–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic economists classify the acquisition of private property into involuntary, contractual and non-contractual categories. Involuntary means are inheritances, bequests, and gifts. Non-contractual acquisition involves the collection and exploitation of natural resources that have not previously been claimed as private property. Contractual acquisition includes activities such as trading, buying, renting, hiring labor etc.&lt;ref name =NomaniP2/&gt;

A tradition attributed to Muhammad, with which both Sunni and Shi'a jurists agree, in cases where the right to private ownership causes harm to others, then Islam favors curtailing the right in those cases. [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] jurists argue that if private ownership endangers public interest, then the state can limit the amount an individual is allowed to own. This view, however, is debated by others.&lt;ref name =NomaniP2/&gt;

When Muhammad migrated to Madinah many of the Muslims owned agricultural land. Muhammad confirmed this ownership and allocated land to individuals. The land allotted would be used for housing, farming or gardening. For example, Bilal b. Harith was given land with mineral deposits at 'Aqiq Valley&lt;ref&gt;al-Baladhuri, Futuh al-Buldan&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan b. Thabit was afforded the garden of Bayruha&lt;ref&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari, 17&lt;/ref&gt; and Zubayr received oasis land at Khaybar and Banu Nadir.&lt;ref&gt;Futuh al-Buldan, Abu Ubayd&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of Caliph Umar, a vast expanse of Persian royal family terrain had been acquired, this lead his successor Caliph Uthman to accelerate the allotment of land to individuals in return for a portion of the crop yield.&lt;ref&gt;al-Maqrizi, al-Mawa'iz wa'l-I'tibar&lt;/ref&gt;

== Markets ==
According to M.S.Naz, regulation of markets is among the main functions of ''[[hisbah]]'',&lt;ref name=IEStL2008:111&gt;[[#IEStL2008|Zaman, ''Islamic Economics: A Survey ...'', 2008]]: p.111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Naz (1991) ''Islami Riyasat men Muhtasib ka Kirdar'' IRI. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; the "semi-judicial institution"  operational from the "earliest days of Islam". It was “charged with responsibility of carrying out the spirit of the system, setting conditions that preserve and enhance the public health and interests, protect the consumers, solve business and labor disputes, promote good market behavior, and ensure their observance.”&lt;ref name="Kahf (1996, Chapter 6, p.55)"&gt;Monzer Kahf (1996) Principles of Islamic Economics, IIUM. 41, 115, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; M.A. Khan states, institution of ''Hisbah'' as established to "supervise markets, to provide municipal services, and to settle petty disputes".&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Tamiyah, ''Public Duties in Islam'', Leicester: The Islamic Foundation, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IIEMAK1994:83&gt;[[#IIEMAK1994|Khan, ''Introduction to Islamic Economics'', 1994]]: p.83&lt;/ref&gt;  In the contemporary era, Pakistan has attempted to re-create this institution, although it has jurisdiction only over the administrative excesses of the federal government departments and agencies, not provincial ones or private companies.&lt;ref name=IIEMAK1994:83/&gt;

According to Nomani and Rahnema, Islam accepts markets as the basic coordinating mechanism of the economic system. Islamic teaching holds that the market, given perfect competition, allows consumers to obtain desired goods and producers to sell their goods at a mutually acceptable price.&lt;ref name =NomaniM1&gt;{{harvnb|Nomani|Rahnema|year=1994|pp=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three necessary conditions for an operational market are said (by Nomani and Rahnema) to be upheld in Islamic primary sources:&lt;ref name =NomaniM1/&gt;
* Freedom of exchange: the Qur'an calls on believers to engage in trade, and rejects the contention that trade is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nomani|Rahnema|year=1994}} cite {{cite quran|4|29|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|275|style=ref}} and {{cite quran|2|279|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Private ownership (see [[Islamic economics#Private property|above]]).
* Security of contract: the Qur'an calls for the fulfillment and observation of contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nomani|Rahnema|year=1994}} cite {{cite quran|5|1|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|16|91|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|23|8|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|17|34|style=ref}} and {{cite quran|70|32|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest verse of the Qur'an deals with commercial contracts involving immediate and future payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nomani|Rahnema|year=1994}} cite {{cite quran|2|282|style=ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another author (Nima Mersadi Tabari) claims that the general doctrine of fairness in sharia law creates "an ethical economic model" and forbids market manipulation such as  "inflating the price of commodities by creating artificial shortages (''Ihtekar''), overbidding for the sole purpose of driving the prices up (''Najash'') and concealment of vital information in a transaction from the other party (''Ghish'')".&lt;ref name=tabari/&gt;

Further, "uninformed speculation" not based on a proper analysis of available information is forbidden because it is a form of ''Qimar'', or gambling, and results in accumulating ''Maysir'' (unearned income).&lt;ref name=tabari/&gt;  Commercial contracting under conditions of "excessive uncertainty" (however that is defined) is a form of ''[[Gharar]]'' and so also forbidden.&lt;ref name=tabari/&gt;

===Interference===
Proponents such as M.A.Khan,&lt;ref name=IIEMAK1994:10&gt;[[#IIEMAK1994|Khan, ''Introduction to Islamic Economics'', 1994]]: p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Nomani and Rahnema also contend that the "Islamic economy" forbids or at least discourages market manipulation such as [[price fixing]], [[hoarding]] and [[bribery]]. Government intervention in the economy is tolerated under specific circumstances.&lt;ref name =NomaniM1/&gt;

Another author (Nima Mersadi Tabari) states that in Islam "everything is ''[[Halal]]'' (allowed) unless it has been declared ''[[Haram]]'' (forbidden)", consequently "the Islamic economic model is based on the freedom of trade and freedom of contract so far as the limits of Shari’ah allow".&lt;ref name="tabari"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=423027122029096009123031098103091085055056033007026070025023078117106122081088083030097010120030123038049120096083067005029106016054063082050071126092124122008119120042042047067004020001122028127005022073023114099127097076089102073090090075027075071024&amp;EXT=pdf|title=The Sharia'h Dimension of the Persian Gulf's Hydrocarbon Resources|date=|website=social science research network|ssrn=1997131|last1=Tabari|first1=Nima Mersadi|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nomani and Rahnema say that Islam prohibits price fixing by a dominating handful of buyers or sellers. During the days of Muhammad, a small group of merchants met agricultural producers outside the city and bought the entire crop, thereby gaining a [[monopoly]] over the market. The produce was later sold at a higher price within the city. Muhammad condemned this practice since it caused injury both to the producers (who in the absence of numerous customers were forced to sell goods at a lower price) and the inhabitants.&lt;ref name =NomaniM1/&gt;

The above-mentioned reports are also used to justify the argument that the Islamic market is characterized by free information. Producers and consumers should not be denied information on demand and supply conditions. Producers are expected to inform consumers of the quality and quantity of goods they claim to sell. Some scholars hold that if an inexperienced buyer is swayed by the seller, the consumer may nullify the transaction upon realizing the seller's unfair treatment. The Qur'an also forbids discriminatory transactions.&lt;ref name =NomaniM1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nomani|Rahnema|year=1994}} cite {{cite quran|55|9|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|26|181|end=183|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|11|84|end=85|style=ref}}. They also point out that a chapter is devoted to such fraudulent practices: {{cite quran|83|1|end=3|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bribery is also forbidden in Islam and can therefore not be used to secure a deal or gain favor in a transaction, it was narrated that Muhammad cursed the one who offers the bribe, the one who receives it, and the one who arranges it.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim&lt;/ref&gt;

Nomani and Rahnema say government interference in the market is justified in exceptional circumstances, such as the protection of public interest. Under normal circumstances, governmental non-interference should be upheld. When Muhammad was asked to set the price of goods in a market he responded, "I will not set such a precedent, let the people carry on with their activities and benefit mutually."&lt;ref name =NomaniM1/&gt;

== Banking and finance ==
{{main article|Islamic banking and finance}}
{{see|History of Islamic economics}}
Islamic banking has been called "the most visible practical achievement" of Islamic economics,&lt;ref name=Kuran-x/&gt; and the "most visible mark" of Islamic revivalism.&lt;ref name=MOFRIEI2005:33&gt;[[#MOFRIE2005|Farooq, ''Riba-Interest Equation and Islam'', 2005]]:p.33&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2009, there were over 300 "shariah compliant [[bank]]s and 250 [[mutual fund]]s around the world,&lt;ref name=economist-2009&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14859353 | work=The Economist | title=Sharia calling | date=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around $2 trillion were sharia-compliant by 2014.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamic finance: Big interest, no interest|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21617014-market-islamic-financial-products-growing-fast-big-interest-no-interest|accessdate=15 September 2014|work=The Economist|agency=The Economist Newspaper Limited|date=Sep 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLME Company Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/middle-east/company/profile/1007422/|title=Bank of London and the Middle East|accessdate=12 July 2013|publisher=Zawya.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the domination of the industry by debt-like instruments such as ''[[murabaha]]'' rather than risk-sharing products, has driven even some leading advocates and experts in Islamic banking (such as [[Muhammad Nejatullah Siddiqi]]) to talk about "a crisis of identity of the Islamic financial movement."&lt;ref&gt;referring to Siddiqi, 1983 (Mohammad Nejatullah SIDDIQI. Issues in Islamic Banking [Leicester: The Islamic Foundation, UK, 1983), in  Munawar IQBAL and Philip Molyneux. Thirty Years of Islamic Banking: History, Performance and Prospects [Palgrave, 2005], p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interest===
The most noticeable and/or important objective of Islamic Banking has been a ban on the charging of interest on loans.&lt;ref name=Kuran-x/&gt; The Quran (3: 130) condemns ''riba'' (which is usually translated as "interest"): "O, you who believe! Devour not ''riba'', doubled and redoubled, and be careful of Allah; but fear Allah that you may be successful."

===Islamic public finance (''Bayt-al-Mal'')===
The only financial institution under Islamic Governance (Prophethood and Caliph Period) was Baitulmaal (public treasury) wherein the wealths were distributed instantly on the basis of need. During Prophethood the last receipt was tribute from Bahrain amounting eight hundred thousands dirham which was distributed in just one sitting. Though the first Caliph earmarked a house for Baitulmaal where all money was kept on receipt. As all money was distributed immediately the treasury generally remained locked up. At the time of his death there was only one dirham in the Baitulmaal. The second caliph besides developing the Central Baitulmaal also opened Baitulmaal at state and headquarters levels. He also carried census during his caliphate; and provisioned salaries to Government employees, stipend to poor and needy people along with social security to unemployed and retirement pensions.

The concept of a public financial institution played a historic role in the Islamic economy. The idea of state collected wealth being made available to the needy general public was relatively new. The resources in the Bayt-al-Mal were considered God's resources and a trust, money paid into the shared bank was common property of all the Muslims and the ruler was just the trustee.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The shared bank was treated as a financial institution and therefore subjected to the same prohibitions regarding interest.&lt;ref&gt;K-al-Mabsut, Al-Sarakhsi, Shamsuddin&lt;/ref&gt; Caliph Umar spoke on the shared bank saying: "I did not find the betterment of this wealth except in three ways: (i) it is received by right, (ii) it is given by right, and (iii) it is stopped from wrong. As regards my own position vis-a-vis this wealth of yours; it is like that of a guardian of an orphan. If I am well-off, I shall leave it, but if I am hard-pressed I shall take from it as is genuinely permissible."&lt;ref&gt;Uyun-al-Akhbar, ad-Dinawri&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--How many banks were there in Islam under Caliph Umar????--&gt;{{Verify source|date=January 2015}}

===Proposals===
====Savings and investment====
An alternative Islamic savings-investment model can be built around [[venture capital]]; [[investment banks]]; restructured corporations; and restructured [[stock market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Economic Model |author=Meinhaj Hussain |version=2.0 |date=June 2010 |url=http://www.grandestrategy.com/2010/01/21st-century-islamic-state-economic.html |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--Bot-inserted parameter.

====Hybrids====
Islamic banks have grown recently in the Muslim world, but are a very small share of the global economy compared to the Western debt banking paradigm. Hybrid approaches, which applies classical Islamic values but uses conventional lending practices, are much lauded by some proponents of modern [[human development theory]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Criticism and dispute==
Islamic economics has been disparaged for
*its alleged "incoherence, incompleteness, impracticality, and irrelevance",  driven by "[[cultural identity]]" rather than [[problem solving]] ([[Timur Kuran]], John Foster);&lt;ref name=FosterMM2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuran, "The Economic Impact of Islamic Fundamentalism," in Marty and Appleby ''Fundamentalisms and the State'', U of Chicago Press, 1993, pp. 302–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Discontents of Islamic Economic Mortality" by Timur Kuran, ''American Economic Review'', 1996, pp. 438–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tobin-2014-139"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tobin|first1=Sarah A.|editor1-last=Wood|editor1-first=Donald C.|title=Production, Consumption, Business and the Economy: Structural Ideals And …|date=2014|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing.|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JGStBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22incoherence,+incompleteness,+impracticality,+and+irrelevance%22+finance#v=onepage&amp;q=%22incoherence%2C%20incompleteness%2C%20impracticality%2C%20and%20irrelevance%22%20finance&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 September 2016|chapter="Is it really Islamic?"|isbn=9781784410551}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*being  "a hodgepodge of populist and socialist ideas" in theory, and "nothing more than inefficient state control of the economy and some almost equally ineffective redistribution policies" in practice ([[Fred Halliday]]);&lt;ref name="Halliday, Fred p. 89"&gt;Halliday, Fred, ''100 Myths about the Middle East'', Saqi Books, 2005 p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In a political and regional context where [[Islamist]] and [[ulema]] claim to have an opinion about everything, it is striking how little they have to say about this most central of human activities, beyond repetitious pieties about how their model is neither [[capitalism|capitalist]] nor [[socialist]].&lt;ref name="Halliday, Fred p. 89"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*being little more than a mimicry of conventional economics embellished with verses of the [[Quran]] and [[sunnah]] (Muhammad Ahram Khan);&lt;ref name="WIWWIE2013:xv"/&gt; 
*claiming to call for a return to Islamic practices that are actually an "[[invented tradition]]" (Timur Kuran);{{#tag:ref|Islamic economics itself exemplifies what has been called an `invented tradition.` ... not until the mid-twentieth century were campaigns launched to identify self-consciously, if not also exclusively, Islamic patterns of economic thought and behavior. Until that time the economic content of discourses grounded in Islam's traditional sources lacked systematization; they hardly formed a body of thought recognizable as a coherent or self-contained doctrine.&lt;ref name=Kuran-x/&gt;|group=Note}}
*failing to achieve its goals of abolishing interest on money, establishing economic equality, and a superior business ethic;&lt;ref name=Pipes-26-09-07&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pipes|first1=Daniel|title=Islamic Economics: What Does It Mean?|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/4973/islamic-economics-what-does-it-mean|accessdate=5 August 2015|agency=Jerusalem Post|date=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but nonetheless "spared critical scrutiny out of ignorance, misguided tolerance", and because its methods and objectives are considered "too unrealistic to threaten prevailing economic structures" ([[Timur Kuran]]).&lt;ref name=Kuran-x/&gt;

;Islamic banking and finance
One significant result of Islamic economics (and target of criticism) is the creation of Islamic banking and finance industry.&lt;ref name=MOFRIE2005:34&gt;[[#MOFRIE2005|Farooq, ''Riba-Interest Equation and Islam'', 2005]]: p.34&lt;/ref&gt; According to several scholars it has bred a new "Power Alliance" of "wealth and Shari'ah scholarship",&lt;ref&gt;Monzer KAHF. "Islamic Banks: The Rise of a New Power Alliance of Wealth and Shari'ah Scholarship," in Clement HENRY and Rodney WILSON (eds.). ''The Politics of Islamic Finance'' [Edinburgh University Press, 2004], pp. 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MOFRIE2005:27&gt;[[#MOFRIE2005|Farooq, ''Riba-Interest Equation and Islam'', 2005]]: p.27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:317&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.317&lt;/ref&gt;—wealthy banks and clients paying Islamic scholars to provide bank products with Islamic "shariah compliance". Journalist John Foster,  quotes an investment banker based in the Islamic Banking hub of [[Dubai]] on the practice of "[[fatwa]] shopping",

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We create the same type of products that we do for the conventional markets. We then phone up a Sharia scholar for a Fatwa [seal of approval, confirming the product is Shari'ah compliant]. If he doesn't give it to us, we phone up another scholar, offer him a sum of money for his services and ask him for a Fatwa. We do this until we get Sharia compliance. Then we are free to distribute the product as Islamic."&lt;ref name=FosterMM2010&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=John|title=How Sharia-compliant is Islamic banking?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8401421.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 September 2016|date=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foster explains that the fee for services provided by "top" scholars is "often" in six-figures, i.e. over US$100,000.&lt;ref name=FosterMM2010/&gt;

One critic (Muhammad O. Farooq) argues that this unfortunate situation has arisen because the "preoccupation" among supporters of Islamic Economics that any and all interest on loans is ''[[riba]]'' and forbidden by Islam, and because [[Profit and loss sharing|risk-sharing alternatives]] to interest bearing loans originally envisioned for Islamic banking have not proven feasible. With the elimination of interest being both the basis of the industry and impractical, shari'a scholars have become "entrapped in a situation" where they are forced to approve transactions fundamentally similar to conventional loans but using "''[[hiyal]]''" manipulation to "maintain an Islamic veneer".&lt;ref name=MOFRIE2005:36&gt;[[#MOFRIE2005|Farooq, ''Riba-Interest Equation and Islam'', 2005]]: p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

;Justice
Instead of "fixating" on interest, Farooq urges a focus on "the larger picture" of "justice", and in economics on fighting  exploitation from "greed and profit," and the concentration of wealth. He quotes an ayat in support: "What God has bestowed on his Messenger (and taken away) from the people of the townships, - belongs to God, - to his Messenger and to kindred and orphans, the needy and the wayfarer; ''in order that it may not (merely) make a circuit between the wealthy among you.'' ..." {{cite quran|59|7|s=ns}}&lt;ref name=MOFRIE2005:33&gt;[[#MOFRIE2005|Farooq, ''Riba-Interest Equation and Islam'', 2005]]: p.33&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the neglect of this issue, Farooq complains that one "rather comprehensive" bibliography of Islamic economics and finance, contains "not a single citation for exploitation or injustice" among its 700 entries.&lt;ref name=MOFRIE2005:31&gt;[[#MOFRIE2005|Farooq, ''Riba-Interest Equation and Islam'', 2005]]: p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

A former director of Pakistan Institute of Development Economics and the head of Pakistan's Economic Affairs Division, Syed [[Nawab Haider Naqvi]],{{#tag:ref|During an "earlier phase" of the Islamic Banking movement in 1981|group=Note}} also called for "comprehensive Islamic reform to establish an exploitation-free economic system" and not just "mechanical substitution of profit for interest."&lt;ref&gt;Syed Nawab Haider NAQVI. ''Ethics and Economics: An Islamic Synthesis'' [U.K.: The Islamic Foundation, 1981], p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

;Zakat
On the issue of ''[[zakat]]'', one of the pillars of Islam, M.A.Khan also criticizes the conservatism of Islamic Economics, complaining that "the insistence of Muslim scholars in implementing it in the same form in which it was in vogue in the days of the Prophet and the first four caliphs ... has made it irrelevant to the needs of a contemporary society."&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:xvi&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

;Practicality
A supporter of Islamic economics ([[Asad Zaman]]) describes a "major difficulty" faced by Islamic reformers of Islamic economics and pointed out by other authors, namely that because a financial system is an "integrated and coherent structure",  to create an Islamic system "based on trust, community and no interest" requires "changes and interventions on several different fronts simultaneously".&lt;ref name="Zaman-2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaman|first1=Asad|title=Islamic Economics: A Survey of the Literature |url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1282786 |website=ssrn.com |publisher= Religions and Development Research Programme|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12525">'''Israeli labor law''' provides a number of protections to workers in [[Israel]]. They are governed by the [[Basic Law of Israel|Basic Laws]], the Hours of Work and Rest Law, as well as various other laws, statutes, and regulations.

==Unions==
[[Labor union]]s are legal in Israel, and about one-third of the workforce is unionized. The [[Histadrut]], a large federation of trade unions, has a prominent place in Israel's economy and society. Workers in most industries have a right to strike provided a fifteen-day notice of intention to strike is given. It is illegal to fire a worker for unionizing and participating in union activities, including strikes. However, the right to strike is restricted in the civil service and in institutions considered vital such as medicine, water, energy, and the police force. [[Labor Courts of Israel|Israeli labor courts]] are tasked with settling labor disputes. There are five regional labor courts which handle local disputes, and the National Labor Court in [[Jerusalem]], which handles nationwide strikes, collective disputes, and appeals of decisions of the regional courts.&lt;ref name=ilo&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/ifpdial/information-resources/national-labour-law-profiles/WCMS_158902/lang--en/index.htm National Labour Law Profile: The State of Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ima.org.il/ENG/ViewCategory.aspx?CategoryId=6137&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of Collective Bargaining ===
Wage bargaining in Israel has changed from a very centralized corporatist system that collectively represented almost all workers, to a decentralized, pluralist, system with many wage agreements in different sectors of labor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kristal|first=Tali|last2=Cohen|first2=Yinon|date=July 2007|title=Decentralization of Collective Agreements and Rising Wage Inequality in Israel|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~yc2444/Decentralization%20of%20Collective%20Wage%20Agreements%20and%20Rising%20Wage%20Inequality%20In%20Israel.pdf|journal=Industrial Relations|volume=46|issue=3|pages=613–635|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1990s, bargaining was negotiated between the Private Employers' Association representing businesses and the Histadrut representing the labor force. The state's role in these negotiations was unofficial and its main purpose was to promulgate the new agreements to the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Economy of Modern Israel: Malaise and Promise|last=Razin|first=Assaf|last2=Sadka|first2=Efraim|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1993|isbn=9780226705897|location=Chicago|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations over wages were conducted at the statewide level, determining standard pay across whole sectors of industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Yinon|last2=Haberfeld|first2=Yitchak|last3=Kristal|first3=Tali|last4=Mundlak|first4=Guy|date=Spring 2007|title=The State of Organized Labor In Israel|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~yc2444/The%20State%20of%20Organized%20Labor%20in%20Israel.pdf|journal=Journal of Labor Research|volume=28|issue=2|pages=255–273|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a decrease in both union and employer association memberships, it has been harder to collectivize workers across labor sectors. This decentralization is also attributed to the rise of unions outside the traditional Histadrut, or General Federation of Trade Unions, which had previously not been allowed under the laws of the more corporatist system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Israel's Labor Evolution ===
Israel's history, and its changes from corporatist to pluralist exhibit its position as a unique type of economy. Coordination between the government, labor, and employers in regard to how wages are set show its distinction from liberal economies like the United States. The massive influence of the Histadrut in the mid to late 20th century shows a very centralized government who allowed high levels of corporatism with the state's largest labor union in administering public health care and public pension funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Split Corporatism in Israel|last=Grinberg|first=Lev Luis|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Tel Aviv|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the state-owned military equipment industry replacing more traditional job sectors like agriculture in the 1980s, Israel progressed into a more industrial economy. It is only in the past few decades, as large-scale industrial work has seen a decline, and service sector jobs have increased, that the Histadrut has lost power. In the 1990s former soviet scientists came to Israel and helped the country further its diversity of exports in order to become a more competitive country in the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/Economy/Pages/ECONOMY-%20Sectors%20of%20the%20Economy.aspx|title=Economy: Sectors of the Israeli Economy|last=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs|first=|date=2013|website=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Israel has shown itself to have great potential from its younger generation as it achieved the 2nd highest rate of 25-64 year olds who had achieved tertiary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/edu/Israel_EAG2013%20Country%20Note.pdf|title=Education at a Glance 2013: Israel|last=Schleicher|first=Andreas|date=2013|website=OECD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new younger generation may prove to change Israel's labor system and further bring it into a more service-sector oriented world.

==Workweek and hours==
Israeli law sets out a 43-hour workweek. This is being reduced to 42 hours as of April 1, 2018. For those with a five-day workweek, the length of a work day is set out as 8.6 hours, while those with a six-day workweek have a work day of 8 hours, with a half-day of work on Friday. Those with a work day of at least six hours are entitled to 45 minutes of rest, including an uninterrupted 30-minute break, although with a special permit those working in non-manual jobs can have full workdays without breaks. However, in practice, additional time is added to make up for these breaks, leading to a maximum 45-hour workweek. As a result, many employees in Israel work 45 hours a week, or 9 hours a day for 5 days. Any work beyond these hours is considered overtime. Overtime work is illegal unless a permit is obtained from the Ministry of Labor, and is subject to certain conditions. The first two hours of overtime must be compensated by a 125% wage raise, and any overtime work beyond that must be accompanied by a 150% raise. No more than four hours of overtime work can be performed in a single day. Those with a six-day workweek cannot work more than 12 hours of overtime per week, while those with a five-day workweek cannot work more than 15 hours of overtime per week. Those who work during a religious holiday are entitled to a 150% raise and an alternative day off.&lt;ref name=justlanded&gt;[https://www.justlanded.com/english/Israel/Israel-Guide/Jobs/Working-Conditions Working Conditions] Justlanded.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglo-list.com/israel-jobs-and-employment2/israel-overtime-rates Israel Overtime Rates]: anglo-list.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=conditions&gt;[http://www.gov.il/FirstGov/TopNavEng/EngSituations/ESMigrantWorkersGuide/ESMWGRights/ Salary, Benefits, and Working Conditions].

==Discrimination==

Discrimination over race, religion, age, sexual preference, or disability is banned. It is also illegal to fire a pregnant employee unless the employer can satisfy the Ministry of Labor that the reasons for termination are unrelated to the pregnancy. Employers other than government security bodies and those providing services to children or the mentally or physically disabled are prohibited by law from conducting criminal background checks of job candidates.

==Leave entitlements==
All Israeli workers are entitled to a weekly consecutive rest period of at least 36 hours, although with a special permit from the Ministry of Labor, it can be reduced to a minimum of 25 hours. Israelis typically follow a Sunday-Thursday five-day workweek, although some, with a six-day workweek, work until midday on Friday. This is done to accommodate the Jewish [[Sabbath]] and Muslim [[Jumu'ah]].&lt;ref name=moital/&gt;&lt;ref name=lexology/&gt;

All Israeli employees with a five-day workweek are entitled to a minimum of 12 paid vacation days for the first four years of employment, while those with a six-day workweek are entitled to 14 days. This gradually increases after four years to a maximum of 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mintus-law.co.il/?p=14053&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lexology&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f5c5b969-fe64-45d6-82e9-1e0baeda99e1|title=Employment &amp; labour law in Israel|access-date=2018-02-14|date=2018-01-10|website=lexology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[Public holidays in Israel|9 paid public holidays]], including a continuous two-day one.

Workers are also entitled to 18 days of paid sick leave per year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolzchut.org.il/en/Sick_Days Sick Days (Right)]. Kolzchut.org.il&lt;/ref&gt; and a female employee who has worked for the same employer for one year is entitled to 26 weeks of maternity leave, although she can divide it with the father, and those on parental leave are entitled to an allowance from the government for the first 14 days. It is illegal to fire someone on maternity leave or within 60 days after its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolzchut.org.il/en/Maternity_Leave Maternity Leave (Right)]. Kolzchut.org.il&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labor Rights for Migrants ===
There are high levels of immigrants in Israel's workforce, with most being authorized immigrants and a smaller percentage being unauthorized. By 1999, when immigrants made up 16% of the full-time labor force, they made up an even higher 27% of part-time labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~yc2444/The%20Rise%20in%20Involuntary%20Part%20time%20Workers%20in%20Israel.pdf|title=The rise in involuntary part-time employment in Israel|last=Cohen|first=Yinon|last2=Stier|first2=Haya|date=May 2003|website=Columbia Press|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently in 2001, of the total 2,500,000 workers in the labor force, about 200,000 are immigrants.&lt;ref name="ilo" /&gt; These migrant workers usually take low-paying jobs in the private sector, where they can be exploited without adequate protection from labor laws&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/il1806a.pdf|title=Migrant Workers in Israel- A Contemporary Form of Slavery|last=Ellman|first=Michael|last2=Laacher|first2=Smain|date=2002|website=|publisher=International Federation for Human Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of migrant workers in the labor force limit the bargaining power of Israeli workers for higher wages, as they tend to take low-paying part-time jobs which are outside collective bargaining agreements. In 2000, 80.2% of male migrant workers were paid less than minimum wage.  In 1991, the Israeli Parliament, the [[Knesset]], passed the Foreign Workers’ Law (Unlawful Employment and the Guarantee of Decent Conditions) to protect immigrants from being subject to the market economy without any labor protections. Under the law, employers are required to pay into a fund that provides social benefits for migrant workers. Additionally, in an attempt to protect the wages of all migrant workers, the law advocates for employers to set up collective agreements with their workers, similar to how Israel's large private sector has been coordinated.&lt;ref name="ilo" /&gt;

'''''{{lang|la|Jus ad bellum}}''''' ([[Latin (language)|Latin]] for "right to war") is a set of criteria that are to be consulted ''before'' engaging in [[war]] in order to determine whether entering into war is permissible, that is, whether it is a [[just war]].

==Definition==
''{{lang|la|Jus ad bellum}}'' is sometimes considered a part of the [[laws of war]], but the term "laws of war" can also be considered to refer to ''[[jus in bello]]'', which concerns whether a war is conducted justly (regardless of whether the initiation of hostilities was just).  ''Jus ad bellum'' refers to "legitimate reasons a State may engage in war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimes of War  –  Jus ad Bellum / Jus in Bello|url=http://www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/jus-ad-bellum-jus-in-bello/|website=www.crimesofwar.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117155359/http://www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/jus-ad-bellum-jus-in-bello/|archivedate=2011-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These rules focus on certain criteria for what makes a war just.

Article 51 of the UN Charter clarifies: "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter VII {{!}} United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/|website=www.un.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international agreement limiting the justifiable reasons for a country to [[Declaration of war|declare war]] against another is concerned with ''jus ad bellum.'' In addition to bilateral non-aggression pacts, the twentieth century saw multilateral treaties defining entirely new restrictions against going to war. The three most notable examples are the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] outlawing war as an instrument of national policy, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|London Charter]] (known also as the Nuremberg Charter) defining "[[crimes against peace]]" as one of three major categories of international crime to be prosecuted after [[World War II]], and the [[United Nations Charter]], which binds nations to seek resolution of disputes by peaceful means and requires authorization by the [[United Nations]] before a nation may initiate any use of force against another, beyond the inherent right of [[Self-defence in international law|self-defense]] against an armed attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Charter of the United Nations: Chapter VII: Action with Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace and Acts of Aggression| accessdate = 2014-08-22| url = https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, agreements defining limits on acceptable conduct while already engaged in war are considered "rules of war" and are referred to as the ''jus in bello.'' Thus, the [[Geneva Conventions]] are a set of ''"jus in bello".'' Doctrines concerning the protection of [[civilians]] in wartime, or the need for "[[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]]" when force is used, are addressed to issues of conduct within a war, but the same doctrines can also shed light on the question of when it is lawful (or unlawful) to go to war in the first place.

==Principles of ''jus ad bellum''==

===Proper authority and public declaration===
The principle of right authority suggests that a war is just only if waged by a legitimate authority. Such authority is rooted in the notion of [[Sovereignty|state sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=Hubert&amp;Weiss&gt;Don Hubert and Thomas G. Weiss et al. "The Responsibility to Protect: Supplementary Volume to the Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty". (Canada: International Development Research Centre, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  In his Summa Theologica St. Thomas Aquinas notes that to be a just war, war has not only to be [[Declaration of war|declared]] publicly, but also must be declared by the proper authority.&lt;ref name="Rochester"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rochester|first=J. Martin|title=The New Warfare: Rethinking Rules for an Unruly World|date=February 19, 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-27642-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper authority is what differentiates war from murder: "It is the rules of warfare that give the practice meaning, that distinguish war from murder and soldiers from criminals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finnermore|first=M.|editor=John Boli and George M. Thomas|title=Constructing World Culture: International Nongovernmental Organizations Since 1875|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3422-6|pages=149–165|chapter=Rules of war and wars of rules: The international red cross and the restraint of state violence}}&lt;/ref&gt; A soldier is treated as a prisoner of war ([[Prisoner of war|POW]]) and not a criminal because they are operating under the proper authority of the state and cannot be held individually responsible for actions committed under the orders of their military leadership.

===Just cause / right intention===
According to the principle of right intention, the aim of war must not be to pursue narrowly defined national interests, but rather to re-establish a just peace. This state of peace should be preferable to the conditions that would have prevailed had the war not occurred.  Wars cannot be fought simply to annex property or install a regime change.  Current doctrines of "anticipatory self-defense" or preemptive strikes, commonly called the [[Bush Doctrine]], have challenged concepts of right intention/just cause. Right cause includes humanitarian intervention, particularly when actions "[[Martens Clause|shock the conscience]]".  The [[responsibility to protect]] covers more in depth the nature of humanitarian intervention.

===Probability of success===
According to this principle, there must be good grounds for concluding that aims of the just war are achievable.&lt;ref name=Hubert&amp;Weiss /&gt; This principle emphasizes that mass violence must not be undertaken if it is unlikely to secure the just cause.&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{Cite web
| title = War (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) | accessdate = 2014-08-27| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/#2.1 |website= plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This criterion is to avoid invasion for invasion's sake and links to the proportionality criteria.  One cannot invade if there is no chance of actually winning.  However, wars are fought with imperfect knowledge, so one must simply be able to make a logical case that one can win; there is no way to know this in advance. These criteria move the conversation from moral and theoretical grounds to practical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seybolt|first=Taylor B.|title=Humanitarian Military Intervention: The Conditions for Success and Failure|date=January  2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925243-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, this is meant to gather coalition building and win approval of other state actors.

===Proportionality===
The principle of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]] stipulates that the violence used in the war must be proportional to the military objectives.  This objective is meant to preclude "[[scorched earth]]" policies.  The level of military victory must be proportional to the level of destruction that ensues.  For example, if there is one enemy combatant in a shopping plaza full of 400 civilians, it would not be considered proportional to the blow up the plaza.  However, if there is a high value military target in an area with far fewer civilians (a car or a private home) an attack and the [[collateral damage]] may be considered justifiable under the rule of proportionality.

===Last resort===
The principle of last resort stipulates that all non-violent options must first be exhausted before the use of force can be justified.  Diplomatic options, sanctions, and other non-military methods must be attempted or validly ruled out before the engagement of hostilities.  Further, in regard to the amount of harm—proportionally—the principle of last resort would support using small intervention forces first and then escalating rather than starting a war with  massive force such as carpet bombing or nuclear attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just War Theory and the Last of Last Resort - Ethics &amp; International Affairs|url=https://www.ethicsandinternationalaffairs.org/2015/just-war-theory-last-last-resort/|website=Ethics &amp; International Affairs|accessdate=April 2, 2017|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
St. Thomas Aquinas is one of the earliest philosophers on what makes a just war.  His list of criteria were intended to protect civilians and guarantee that wars were not just fought for the interest of private parties.&lt;ref name="Rochester" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Church's Just War Theory - Part 1|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/the-church-s-just-war-theory-part-1.html|website=www.catholiceducation.org|accessdate=April 2, 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the Thirty Years' War, scholars became concerned with finding a way to control interstate war while respecting State sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Rochester" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace of Westphalia|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Peace-of-Westphalia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=April 2, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn’t until the formation of the United Nations after World War II that notions of jus ad bellum were formalized.

===The Modern era===
Since the 1950s, declarations of jus ad bellum have dropped dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Fazal, T. (2012). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2012.734227?journalCode=fsst20"Why States No Longer Declare War"]. ''Security Studies'', '''21''' (4), pp. 557-593.&lt;/ref&gt;   In "Why States No Longer Declare War" Tanisha Fazal notes the drop in formal declarations of war since the 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Fazal&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be as a result of the nuance of war in modern times, given the rise of non-state actors such as terrorist groups.

'''Legal cultures''' are described as being temporary outcomes of interactions and occur pursuant to a challenge and response [[paradigm]]. Analyses of core legal paradigms shape the characteristics of individual and distinctive legal cultures.
“Comparative legal cultures are examined by a field of scholarship, which is situated at the line bordering [[comparative law]] and historical [[jurisprudence]].” &lt;ref&gt;Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) p. xix.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal cultures can be examined by reference to fundamentally different legal systems. However, such cultures can also be differentiated between systems with a shared history and basis which are now otherwise influenced by factors that encourage cultural change. Students learn about legal culture in order to better understand how the law works in society. This can be seen as the study of Law and Society. These studies are available at schools such as Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.

== Western legal culture vs non-Western legal culture ==
[[Western legal culture]] is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include [[corporations]], [[contracts]], [[Estate (law)|estates]], rights and powers. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"&gt;J.C. Smith (1968) ‘The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law’ The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on [[language]] and [[symbols]] and any attempt to analyze non-western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"/&gt;  So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group’s culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level.

Traditional law in Africa is based on natural justice and lacks abstract concepts. This is characteristic of cultures that have an absence of written language which is necessary to elaborate concepts into theory.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"&gt;Max Gluckman (1964) ‘Natural Justice in Africa’ Natural Law Forum vol: 9 (pp. 25-44) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrines of traditional [[African law]] are based on social considerations whereby parties to disputes seek not declarations of right or wrong but rather they seek restitution of social relationships.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The trier of fact and law adjudicates between closely related people from communities as opposed to strangers in commerce. Judgments stress the importance of living together in generous, loving kindness, mutual helpfulness and reciprocity. Evidence suggests that ‘African law demonstrates that all men, because they live in society, have some theory of rules of justice which they believe arise from reason itself; [and Gluckman’s evidence] suggests that Africans may well have formulated, in embryonic form at least, a theory of natural justice coming from human kindness itself.’ &lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The [[Sharia|Islamic legal system]] exemplifies law as part of a larger culture where the concepts of knowledge, right and human nature play a central role. A case study by [[Lawrence Rosen (anthropologist)|Lawrence Rosen]] explains the anthropological, procedural and [[judicial discretion]] aspects of bringing a case to court in [[Sefrou]], [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"&gt;Lawrence Rosen (1989) The Anthropology of Justice: Law as Culture in Islamic Society (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge).&lt;/ref&gt;  The case study makes explicit those fundamentals in Islamic society that shape Islamic legal culture and differentiate this from western legal cultures.

Rigid procedural rules and strict court room decorum or etiquette which is entrenched in western legal cultures clears the way for a more natural process of dispute resolution.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  In Morocco, close attention is paid to social origins, connections and identity where these concepts influence a [[qadi]]’s (judge) judicial interrogation and discretion.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

While the systems of law found in the western world consist of conceptualisation and implementation that mimic the extrajudicial world only slightly, in the Islamic courts of Morocco, the culture of law being propounded reflects the overall culture of its people.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  This is attributable to the goals of law in Islamic society, which is not to hold state or religious power as supreme or to develop an exacting body of legal doctrine, but to restore relationships and then facilitate the resolution of disputes independently of rigid [[precedent]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

== Western comparisons ==
The traditional focus between [[common law]] culture and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] culture has been highlighted by court room procedure, whereby the former nurtures an [[adversarial]] environment and the latter an [[inquisitorial]] one. Indeed no system of court procedure can ever be purely adversarial or purely inquisitorial.

In fact [[France]], which subscribes to a civil legal system, historically gave the [[judge]] a passive role and left the parties to engage in an accusatorial manner.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Jolowicz ‘Civil Procedure and the Common and Civil Law’ (pp. 55-78) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless the common law culture predominately consists of oral arguments where legal representors steer the case in search of [[justice]] and reinforcement of rights.

The use of a [[Jury]] in the common law as a judge of fact is unique when compared to civil law systems. The Jury are triers of fact in both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases and this reflects a particular culture of law; namely the direct involvement of society in the [[legal framework]]. In France a judge’s role as trier of law and fact is merely as an administrator without creating binding [[legal principle]]. Hence the civil law culture is more rational, orderly, authoritative and [[paternalistic]].

Common law has a culture of judicial inventiveness and even flexibility. Enunciation of principle is not forever paramount but indeed a continuing flow of cases and statutes add to the ebb and flow of the law, whereby ‘case law represented the modern man’s realisation of his own limitations.’ &lt;ref&gt;A. G. Chloros (1978) ‘Common Law, Civil Law and Socialist Law: Three Leading Systems of the World, Three Kinds of Legal Thought’ The Cambridge Law Review (pp. 11-26) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) at 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Further differences include where a civilian [[lawyer]] speaks in terms of the law of nature while the common lawyer speaks to reason. It follows that the culture of these legal systems has been moulded by perceptions of justice and the means available to attain it.

== Common law comparisons ==
Legal culture can differ between countries despite their conformity to a similar if not identical legal system. Both the [[United States]] and [[England]] possess common law systems of law and yet each country embodies a distinctive legal culture. This has been attributable by contrasting both the institutions within the legal system and characteristics of the profession ([[judge]]s, [[barristers]] and [[solicitors]]).&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard A. Posner|Posner]]&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; during 1996 there was about 15 times more American judges than English judges but only about 10 times more American lawyers than English lawyers. Posner suggests that English judges have more prestige than American judges and a related point is that the ratio of judges to lawyers is lower in England than the United States.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; The consequence of this is that the English common law system, as opposed to the American legal system, displays a legal culture of greater prestige and [[elitism]] not only in the judiciary but also those who are candidates for the [[judiciary]].

In England, and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, barristers are apt candidates for judicial nomination. The reasons for this stem from the common law systems which have a culture to encourage, harness and capture high quality intellect and experience within a concentrated portion of non-judicial officers of the legal profession known as barristers (which includes and accounts for their subsequent appointments to higher ranking [[queens counsel]] and [[senior counsel]]).

Barristers are engaged upon a solicitor's [[Brief (law)|brief]] instead of direct engagement with the client. This insulation avoids lay persons being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lawyers which is evidently "a big problem in the United States, where incompetent lawyers, and known to be such both by judges and by other lawyers, often wow naïve clients." &lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford) at 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of pursuing [[litigation]] influences the culture of each legal system in terms of what society perceives as the net benefit gained from the court and the profession. To litigate similar cases in England and the United States would cost approximately the same; however English courts are not as generous as their American counterparts in awarding [[damages]], especially [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  Therefore the net expected benefit of litigation being greater in the United States encourages a legal culture that is more litigious in nature than England.

National character is inherent in the legal institutions of the [[courts]] and [[parliament]], their formation and their output in terms of [[legislation]] or [[judgments]]. For example it has been said that many factors have contributed to the litigiousness of the United States, including: the rights afforded to the people, a written [[constitution]], immigrant origins of its population, racial and ethnic heterogeneity and the wealth and spoils of its population.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  To this end [[national character]] and [[history]] influence current legal culture.

== Chinese legal culture ==
The legal culture of [[China]], as well as its social and economic culture, continues to undergo dramatic change since the [[People’s Republic of China]]'s reforms of 1978. Transformation has occurred by legal modernisation whereby a rule of law has been suggested to replace the rule of man. The latter is a characteristic of the traditional rural Chinese society where unwritten rules, personal relationships and trust govern citizens' legal relationships; analogous to [[gemeinschaft]]. In the modern society of China, institutional, customary and legal reform (a rule of law that embodies universal rules uniformly enforced by a centralised and bureaucratic state) is necessary to govern legal relations; analogous to [[gesellschaft]].

Direct [[legal transplant|transplants]] of [[western legal systems]] or culture may not provide an adequate rule of law where the life of ordinary Chinese may be marginalised in favour of legal elite who use legal instruments for self-promotion. Furthermore, implanting western legal norms disregards the local culture and relations; thus potentially destroying significant cultural bonds and relationships in the rural community. The traditional [[rural Chinese]] legal culture which is premised on personal and informal relations faces erosion unless [[legal pluralism]] is promoted.

A top down approach in analysing the legal culture of China suggests that both under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Jiang Zemin]], China is "a country under rule by law, not rule of law."&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence comes from post Mao-China, where law is seen as necessary for institutionalising and generalising ad hoc policies for [[economic reform]] and as maintaining party leadership.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;

Further problems with the Chinese legal culture include a piecemeal approach to law making with an imbalance between [[law and policy]]; denials of private law; neglect towards [[human rights]] and individual liberties; and poor enforcement of laws.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;  According to Chen, the consensus in China among scholars is that the lack of [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] are interdependent concepts whereby "the rule of law is legitimate only if it is the product of democratic government." &lt;ref&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart) at 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is evident with the China experience is that legal culture is susceptible to change in pursuance to [[socio-economic]] and [[political]] forces. While such a change could be beneficial for portions of the society and [[international relations]], traditional and established cultural methods face extinction.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}

A '''love contract''' is a [[legal contract]] that is meant to limit the [[legal liability|liability]] of an [[employer]] whose [[employee]]s are [[romantic love|romantic]]ally involved. An employer may choose to require a love contract when a romantic relationship within the company becomes known, in order to [[indemnify]] the company in case the employees' romantic relationship fails, primarily so that one party can't bring a [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit against the company. To that end, the love contract states that the relationship is [[consensual]], and both parties of the relationship must sign it. The love contract may also stipulate rules for acceptable romantic behavior in the workplace.

The '''Nkomati Accord'''  (Official name; ''Agreement on Non-Aggression and Good Neighbourliness between Mozambique and South Africa''&lt;ref name="UNMOZAMBIQUESOUTHAFRICA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://peacemaker.un.org/mozambique-southafrica-nkomati84|title=   Agreement on Non-Aggression and Good Neighbourliness between Mozambique and South Africa (Nkomati Talks)|publisher= United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) was a [[non-aggression pact]] signed on 16 March 1984 between the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]] and the [[Republic of South Africa]]. The event took place at the South African town of [[Komatipoort]] with the signatories being [[President of Mozambique]]  [[Samora Machel]] and [[Prime Minister of South Africa]] [[P.W. Botha]]. Despite repeated pleas from Machel for leaders of other [[SADCC]] nations to attend, the complete absence of any such heads of state demonstrated the derision the accord was viewed with from these nations. The treaty's stated focus was on preventing Mozambique from supporting the [[African National Congress]] on the one hand, and South Africa from supplying the [[RENAMO]] on the other.

Machel did not expel ANC members that had taken refuge in Mozambique and the South African government continued to funnel arms and other supplies to RENAMO. A permanent peace accord, the [[Rome General Peace Accords]], finally ended the [[Mozambican Civil War]] in 1992 and was supervised by [[ONUMOZ|the United Nations' ONUMOZ force]] until 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3740">The '''Ordinance of Labourers 1349''' is often considered to be the start of [[England|English]] [[labour law]].&lt;ref name="Liebman 6th"&gt;Employment Law: Cases and Materials.  Rothstein, Liebman.  Sixth Edition, Foundation Press.  Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, it fixed wages and imposed [[Price ceiling|price controls]]; required all those under the age of 60 to work; prohibited the enticing away of another's servants; and other terms.

==Background==
The ordinance was issued in response to the 1348−1350 outbreak of the [[Black Death in England]].&lt;ref name=disease&gt;Cartwright, Frederick F. 1991. ''Disease and History''. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble. pp. 32-46.&lt;/ref&gt; During this outbreak, an estimated 30−40% of the population died.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070430031619/http://www.cf.ac.uk/hisar/teach/history/projects/plague/economy.html What was the Economy Like After the Black Death?] ''The Plague and England'', Cardiff University. Retrieved on April 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in population left surviving workers in great demand in the [[Economics of English Agriculture in the Middle Ages|agricultural economy of Britain]].&lt;ref name=disease/&gt;

Landowners had to face the choice of raising wages to compete for workers or letting their lands go unused. Wages for labourers rose and translated into [[inflation]] across the economy as goods became more expensive to produce. The wealthy elites suffered under the sudden economic shift. Difficulties in hiring labour created frustration. [[John Gower]] commented on post-plague labourers: "they are sluggish, they are scarce, and they are grasping. For the very little they do they demand the highest pay."&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;  On the other hand, while some workers suffered from increasing prices, others benefited from the higher wages they could command during this period of labour shortage.

The law was issued by King [[Edward III of England]] on 18 June 1349.

==The law==
The ordinance required several things including:

* Everyone under 60 must work.
* Employers must not hire excess workers
* Employers may not pay and workers may not receive wages higher than pre-plague levels
* Food must be priced reasonably with no excess profit
* No one, under the pain of imprisonment, was to give any thing to able bodied beggars 'under the color of pity or alms'

==Aftermath and repeal==
The ordinance has largely been seen as ineffective.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Despite the [[Parliament of England|English parliament]]'s attempt to reinforce the ordinance with the [[Statute of Labourers]] of 1351, workers continued to command higher wages and the majority of England (those in the labouring class) enjoyed a century of relative prosperity before the ratio of labour to land restored the pre-plague levels of wages and prices. While the economic situation eventually reverted, the plague radically altered the social structure of English society.&lt;ref name=disease/&gt;

It was later repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863 and the Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6300">{{Wiktionary|out-of-pocket}}
An '''out-of-pocket expense''' (or '''out-of-pocket cost''') is the direct payment of money that may or may not be later [[reimbursement|reimbursed]] from a third-party source.

For example, when operating a vehicle, [[gasoline]], parking fees and [[Road pricing|tolls]] are considered out-of-pocket expenses for a trip. [[Car insurance]], [[oil]] changes, and [[interest]] are not, since the outlay of cash covers expenses accrued over a longer period of time. The services rendered and other in-kind expenses are not considered out-of-pocket expenses; the same goes for [[depreciation]] of [[capital goods]] or [[depletion (accounting)|depletion]].

Organizations often reimburse out-of-pocket expenses incurred on their behalf, especially expenses incurred by employees on their employers' behalf. In the [[United States]], out-of-pocket expenses for such things as charity, medical bills, and education may be deductions on [[US income taxes]], according to [[IRS]] regulations.

To be '''out of pocket''' is to have expended personal resources, often unexpectedly or unfairly, at the end of some enterprise.

==Health financing==
In the [[Health care system#Financing|health care financing]] sector, this represents the share of the expenses that the insured party must pay directly to the health care provider, without a third-party (insurer, or government).&lt;ref name="pmid17625126"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McWilliams JM, Meara E, Zaslavsky AM, Ayanian JZ | title=Use of health services by previously uninsured Medicare beneficiaries. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2007 | volume= 357 | issue= 2 | pages= 143–53 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa067712 | pmc= | pmid=17625126  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States'''

Out-of-pocket costs are high especially when it comes to prescription drugs in the United States.&lt;ref name="pmid23550670"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hurd MD, Martorell P, Delavande A, Mullen KJ, Langa KM | title=Monetary costs of dementia in the United States. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2013 | volume= 368 | issue= 14 | pages= 1326–34 | pmid=23550670 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa1204629 | pmc=3959992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before investing in a health care plan, it is very useful to examine the out-of-pocket prescription costs as they may be very low or very high.

However, after the first year of Medicare Part D, out-of-pocket drug costs were down, but there was not a noticeable reduction in [[emergency department]] visits, hospitalization, or health utility score. Perhaps, some diseases will be more sensitive to Medicare Part D.&lt;ref name="pmid23635051"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baicker K, Taubman SL, Allen HL, Bernstein M, Gruber JH, Newhouse JP, etal | title=The Oregon experiment--effects of Medicaid on clinical outcomes. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2013 | volume= 368 | issue= 18 | pages= 1713–22 | pmid=23635051 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa1212321 | pmc=3701298 | url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/82640/1/Gruber_The%20oregon%20experiment.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/1735.full The Impact Of Medicare Part D On Prescription Drug Use By The Elderly].

'''Australia'''

A recent study published from Australia shows that the out-of-pocket cost burden falls most heavily on patients who are least able to bear it, both in terms of their health and in terms of their income. Among the respondents 14% experienced a heavy financial burden. Medication and medical service expenses were the major costs. This study concluded that despite Australia's universal health coverage (medicare) a substantial portion of senior citizens suffer from excessive out-of-pocket expenditure, and this burden increases with increasing number of chronic conditions. Among the specific conditions, those who experienced cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes or depression were likely to report higher out-of-pocket expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM |author2=Yen, L |author3=Valderas, JM |author4=McRae, I |last-author-amp=yes |title= Out-of-pocket expenditure by Australian seniors with chronic disease: the effect of specific diseases and morbidity clusters |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=14 |pages=1008 |year=2014 |pmid= 25260348 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1008 |pmc=4182884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ways to improve physician knowledge of drug costs were thought to be increased physician-patient communication or higher use of information technology. Physicians with high rates of IT use did not have significantly higher knowledge or drug costs. Health IT design should be improved to make it easier for physicians to access cost information at the point of care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://codingandbillingcareer.org/health-information-technology/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9472">The '''Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law''' of 16 April 1856 was a diplomatic policy agreed to by 55 nations. Written by France and Great Britain. its primary goal was to abolish [[privateer]]ing, whereby a belligerent party gave formal permission for armed privately owned  ships to seize enemy vessels. It also regulated the relationship between neutral and belligerent and shipping on the high seas introducing new [[prize rules]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2005|p=75}}  They agreed on three major points: free ships make free goods, effective blockade, and no privateering. In return for surrendering the practice of seizing neutral goods on enemy ships, France insisted on Britain's abandoning its [[Rule of 1756]] prohibiting neutral assumption of enemy coastal and colonial trade.&lt;ref&gt;Warren F. Spencer, "The Mason Memorandum and the Diplomatic Origins of the Declaration of Paris." in ''Diplomacy in an Age of Nationalism'' (1971) pp. 44-66.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
On the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], which was signed on 30 March 1856, putting an end to the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856), the [[plenipotentiaries]] also signed this declaration at the suggestion of [[Alexandre Joseph Count Colonna-Walewski|Count Walewski]], the French plenipotentiary.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Barclay|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration is the outcome of a ''modus vivendi'' signed between France and Britain in 1854, originally intended for the Crimean War. These two powers had agreed that they would not seize enemy goods on neutral vessels nor neutral goods on enemy vessels. The belligerents had also agreed that they would not issue [[letters of marque]], which they had not done during the war. At the close of this war the principal states of Europe concluded that private armed ships, maintained at private cost for private gain, and often necessarily for a long time beyond the reach of the regular naval force of the state, could not be kept under proper control. The Declaration of Paris confirmed these rules and added to them the principle that [[blockade]]s, in order to be obligatory, must be effective.

The Declaration did not as such make privateers into a new category of international criminals, but rather made it a treaty obligation of states that they refrain from commissioning privateers in the first place. Most states normally treated foreign privateers as [[pirate]]s in any case.

Ultimately, 55 states ratified the Declaration, including Britain, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Second French Empire|France]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&amp;xp_treatySelected=105 Ratifications].&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty established maritime law among the major powers of Europe. It represented the first multilateral attempt to codify in times of peace rules which were to be applicable in the event of war. This declaration bound only its signatories when at war with each other, and left them free to use privateers when at war with other states.

The United States, which aimed at a complete exemption of non-contraband private property from capture at sea, withheld its formal adherence in 1857 when its “[[William L. Marcy|Marcy]]” amendment was not accepted by all powers, chiefly as a result of British influence. The US was also keen on maintaining privateers. It argued that, not possessing a great navy, it would be obliged in time of war to rely largely upon merchant ships commissioned as war vessels, and that therefore the abolition of privateering would be entirely in favour of European powers, whose large navies rendered them practically independent of such aid. All other maritime states acceded to the declaration except [[Venezuela]] and [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&amp;xp_treatySelected=105 International Red Cross, Status of Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, during the [[American Civil War]], the United States declared that it would respect the principles of the declaration during hostilities. The same was done during the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898, when the United States Government affirmed its policy of conducting hostilities in conformity with the dispositions of the declaration. Spain too, though not a party, declared its intention to abide by the declaration, but it expressly gave notice that it reserved its right to issue letters of marque. At the same time both belligerents organized services of auxiliary cruisers composed of merchant ships under the command of naval officers.

Some of the questions raised by this declaration were clarified by the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)#Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]].

The rules contained in this declaration later came to be considered as part of the general principles of [[international law]] and the United States too, though not formally a party, abides by provisions.

'''Scots civil procedure''' governs the rules of [[civil procedure]] in Scotland. It deals with the jurisdiction of the country's [[Courts of Scotland|civil courts]], namely the [[Court of Session]] and [[sheriff court]]s.

Civil procedure is regulated by [[Act of Sederunt|Acts of Sederunt]] which are [[Scottish Statutory Instrument|ordinance]]s passed by the Court of Session.

== Proposed reform of civil procedure ==
In 2009 Lord Gill, the Lord Justice Clerk, delivered his ''Scottish Civil Courts Review'' which was heralded as the "most far-reaching reform of Scotland's civil justice system in nearly two centuries".&lt;ref name=SC20091001&gt;David Leask, "Blueprint for cheaper, faster, fairer justice for all", ''[The Scotsman]'', 1 October 2009, p 4 via factiva.com accessed 23 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his 206 proposals were:&lt;ref name=SC20091001/&gt;
* a major shift of work from the Court of Session to sheriff courts,
* removal of the jurisdictional overlap between those courts,
* specialisation of sheriffs in areas such as family law, commerce, personal injury,
* new [[Judiciary of Scotland|district judges]] to deal with less legally complicated and low-value civil actions such as small claims and housing disputes.

In November 2010 the Scottish Government released its response to the ''Review'' accepting "the majority of Lord Gill's recommendations" including expressly the following proposals:&lt;ref name=Gillresponse&gt;The Scottish Government, "Proposals for Civil Justice Reform" (Media Release), Edinburgh, Scotland, 11 November 2010, via factiva.com accessed 23 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Civil court business should be reallocated to more appropriate levels, with a far greater proportion of civil court business to be heard by the sheriff courts
* "A specialised personal injury court should be established as part of Edinburgh Sheriff Court
* "The creation of a new Sheriff Appeal Court
* "The introduction of a new role of District Judge
* "Adoption of an improved and more active approach to case management
* "The introduction of designated specialist judges"

In October 2011, the Scottish Government announced consultation on appointments to a new Scottish Civil Justice Council to draft rules of procedure for civil proceedings in the Court of Session and sheriff court. The establishment of the Council was one of Lord Gill's 2009 recommendations.&lt;ref name=Mondaq&gt;Julie Hamilton, "Scottish Government Consulting On Appointment Of A Scottish Civil Justice Council", Mondaq Business Briefing, 14 October 2011 via factiva.com accessed 23 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''secular state''' is an idea pertaining to [[secularity]], whereby a [[State (polity)|state]] is or purports to be officially neutral in matters of [[religion]], supporting neither religion nor [[irreligion]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeley, John T. S. and Zsolt Enyedi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n5Brda6FmswC&amp;dq Church and state in contemporary Europe: the chimera of neutrality], p. 14, 2003 Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; A secular state also claims to treat all its citizens equally regardless of religion, and claims to avoid preferential treatment for a citizen from a particular religion/nonreligion over other religions/nonreligion. Secular states do not have a [[state religion]] (e.g. an established religion) or an equivalent, although the absence of an established state religion does not necessarily mean that a state is fully secular in all respects. For example, many secular states have [[Religion in national symbols|religious references in their national anthems and flags]].

==Origin and practice==
Secular states become secular either upon creation of the state (e.g. the [[United States|United States of America]]), or upon [[secularization]] of the state (e.g. [[France]] or [[Nepal]]). Movements for ''[[laïcité]]'' in France and for the [[separation of church and state]] in the United States defined modern concepts of secularism. Historically, the process of secularizing states typically involves granting religious freedom, disestablishing state religions, stopping public funds being used for a religion, freeing the legal system from religious control, freeing up the education system, tolerating citizens who change religion or abstain from religion, and allowing political leadership to come to power regardless of their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baubérot [http://www.ambafrance-us.org/atoz/secular.asp The secular principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222013645/http://www.ambafrance-us.org/atoz/secular.asp |date=February 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Italy and Spain for example, official holidays for the public administration tend to be Christian [[feast day]]s. Some have pagan roots dating from before Christianisation: [[All Saints' Day]] is pagan [[Halloween]] and [[Easter]] is named after the pagan goddess [[Eostre]]. Also any private school in France that contracts with Education Nationale gets the teachers salaried by the state,  so most of [[Catholic school]] are in this case and they are the majority because of history but it's not an exclusive pass right and other religion or non religion school can contract this way.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Teese, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1188531 Private Schools in France: Evolution of a System], ''[[Comparative Education Review]]'', Vol. 30, No. 2 (May, 1986), pp. 247–59 &lt;/ref&gt; In some European states where secularism confronts [[monoculturalism|monoculturalist]] [[philanthropy]], some of the main [[Christianity#Major groupings within Christianity|Christian sects]] and [[List of religions and spiritual traditions|sects of other religions]] depend on the state for some of the financial resources for their [[Private foundation (United States)|religious charities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Twinch|first=Emily|title=Religious charities: Faith, funding and the state|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/Article/914534/religious-charities-faith-funding-state/|work=Article dated 22 June 2009|publisher=Third Sector – a UK Charity Periodical|accessdate=3 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510221443/http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/Article/914534/religious-charities-faith-funding-state/|archivedate=10 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in [[corporate law]] and [[charity law]] to prohibit [[organized religion]] from using those funds to organize religious worship in a separate [[place of worship]] or for [[Religious conversion|conversion]]; the religious body itself must provide the religious content, educated clergy and [[layperson]]s to exercise its own functions and may choose to devote part of their time to the separate charities. To that effect some of those charities establish secular organizations that manage part of or all of the donations from the main religion(s).

Religious and non-religious organizations can apply for equivalent funding from the government and receive subsidies based on either assessed social results{{clarify|date=February 2017}} where there is indirect religious state funding, or simply the number of [[beneficiary|beneficiaries]] of those organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/|title=Department for Education|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resembles [[charitable choice]] in the United States. It is doubtful whether overt direct state funding of religions is in accordance with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Apparently this issue has not yet been decided at supranational level in [[European Court of Human Rights|ECtHR case law]] stemming from the rights in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], which mandates [[non-discrimination]] in affording its co-listed basic social rights.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}} Specifically, funding certain services would not accord with non-discriminatory state action.&lt;ref&gt;[Sejdic and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (application nos. 27996/06 and 34836/06) found a violation of the non-discrimination overarching right [[wikt:vis-à-vis|vis-à-vis]] all other rights on a wider subject from often arbitrary funding of social charities viz. rights afforded by law Art. 1 of Prot. No. 12, namely protecting "any right set forth by law".{{clarify|date=February 2017}}{{Fix|text=plain English please}} The convention introduces a general prohibition of discrimination in legally enshrined state action, as well as where rights under the convention such as an education or health care are funded. A superior level of services supported by religious bodies is permitted.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states that are nowadays secular in practice may have legal vestiges of an earlier [[established religion]]. Secularism also has various guises which may coincide with some degree of official religiosity. In the United Kingdom, the head of state is still required to take the [[Coronation Oath Act 1688|Coronation Oath enacted in 1688]], swearing to maintain the Protestant Reformed religion and to preserve the established [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/royaleventsandceremonies/coronation/coronation.aspx|title=Coronation Oath|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK also maintains seats in the [[House of Lords]] for 26 senior clergymen of the Church of England, known as the [[Lords Spiritual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/whos-in-the-house-of-lords/members-and-their-roles/how-members-are-appointed/#jump-link-3|title=How members are appointed|work=UK Parliament|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy is a secular state since 1985 but still recognize a special status to the Catholic Church. The reverse progression can also occur, however; a state can go from a secular state to a [[state religion|religious state]], as in the case of [[Iran]] where the secularized state of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] was replaced by an [[Islamic Republic]] (list below). Nonetheless, the last 250 years has seen a trend towards secularism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1131 |title=Harris Interactive: Resource Not Found |publisher= |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723125147/http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1131 |archivedate=July 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=300|title=A Portrait of "Generation Next"|date=9 January 2007|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11240/Secularization-Secularism-History-Nature-Secularization-Secularism-1914.html|title=Secularization and Secularism – History and Nature of Secularization and Secularism to 1914|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businesses close on [[Shabbat]], including many forms of public transportation, restaurants, and Israeli airline [[El Al]]. In order for a Jewish couple to be formally married in Israel, a couple has to be married by a [[rabbi]]. Jewish married couples can only be divorced by a rabbinical council. Many secular Israelis may go abroad to be married, often in Cyprus. Marriages officiated abroad are recognized as official marriages in Israel. Also, all food at army bases and in cafeterias of government buildings has to be [[kosher]], even though the majority of Israelis do not follow these dietary laws. Many religious symbols have found their way into Israeli national symbols. For example, the flag of the country is similar to a [[tallit]], or prayer shawl, with its blue stripes. The national coat of arms also displays the [[menorah (Temple)|menorah]]. However, some viewpoints argue that these symbols can be interpreted as ethnic/cultural symbols too, and point out that many secular European nations (Sweden, Georgia, and Turkey) have religious symbols on their flags. Reports have considered Israel to be a secular state, and its definition as a "Jewish state" refers to the [[Jewish people]], who include people with varying relations to the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] including non-believers, rather than to the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Israel.pdf Religion and the Secular State in Israel]. Page 421-422: " Not every Jew, in Israel or elsewhere, is a religious individual. It is in collective terms that religion has been an essential ingredient in the self-definition and behavior of the Jews, believers or not, observant or not. For that reason, it was aptly stated that Judaism conceived of itself not as a denomination but as the religious dimension of the life of a people. Hence peoplehood is a religious fact in the Jewish universe of discourse. In its traditional self-understanding, Israel is related not to other denominations but to the “‟nations of the world‟… Israel‟s… body is the body politic of a nation. a denomination but as the religious dimension of the life of a people. Hence peoplehood is a religious fact in the Jewish universe of discourse. In its traditional self-understanding, Israel is related not to other denominations but to the “‟nations of the world‟… Israel‟s… body is the body politic of a nation". Page 423: "It seems reasonable to accept that the reference to Israel as a “Jewish State” is equivalent to stating that in historical, political, and legal terms, it is the state of the Jewish people". Page 424: "all refer to a Jewish state, and Jewish means, in all of them, pertaining to Jews, namely the individuals seeing themselves as composing the Jewish people, or nation, or community. It clearly does not mean the body of religious precepts, commands or convictions regulated by the Halakha, the Jewish religious law developed over centuries.".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supplementary process''' is a method of [[debt collection]] where the debtor who has a court money judgement against him is brought into court, "requiring the judgment debtor to appear at a time and place named therein and submit to an examination relative to his or its property and ability to pay."&lt;ref&gt;M.G.L. Ch. 224, s. 14 https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter224/Section14&lt;/ref&gt; The process is common in [[Massachusetts]] under M.G.L. Ch. 224, s. 14.  If the debtor does not appear in court, a [[Capias ad respondendum]] may issue where a sheriff brings the debtor into court to respond.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2409">'''Supply reduction''' is one approach to social problems such as [[drug addiction]]. Other approaches are [[demand reduction]] and [[harm reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burnet.edu.au/freestyler/gui/files//Supply%20Demand%20and%20Harm%20Reduction.pdf|title=Supply, demand and harm reduction|publisher=Burnet Institute, The Centre for Harm Reduction|date=14 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[illegal drugs]], supply reduction efforts generally involves attempts to disrupt the manufacturing and distribution [[supply chain]]s for these drugs, by both civilian [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] and sometimes [[military]] forces. This approach, sometimes characterized as the "[[War on Drugs]]", has been the dominant approach to drugs policy since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/pdf/report_lawenforce.pdf|title= Report Three: Law Enforcement and Supply Reduction|publisher=Beckley Foundation Drug Policy Programme|author=Marcus Roberts, Mike Trace and Axel Klein|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little or no evidence showing that supply reduction methods can be successful as a means to reduce the supply of illicit drugs. For example, the retail price of cocaine in the US in 2007 was less than half the price in 1984, despite massive investments by the US government in supply reduction strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7376131&amp;page=1#.T8_JxVKSzJY|title= Cheap High: Cocaine Prices Still Falling|publisher=ABC News|author=Justin Rood|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have argued that the abject failure of supply reduction in the US actually contributed to a significant and lasting reduction in crime and violence beginning in the 1990s, when cocaine prices hit record lows. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2011/11/cocaine-plummeting-price-nationwide-drop-violent-crime/474/|title= How the Plummeting Price of Cocaine Fueled the Nationwide Drop in Violent Crime|publisher=The Atlantic Cities|author=Llewellyn Hinkes-Jones|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-e8wYlugBcUTFQ4TnRkenBkVW8 systematic review] documents moderate and growing evidence that retail greater availability is associated with greater relapse to smoked tobacco.

[[Image:Lozang Gyatso.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso, "The Great" 5th Dalai Lama|Fifth Dalai Lama]] implemented the traditional Cho-sid-nyi (dual system) in [[Tibet]].]]

The '''Dual System of Government '''is the traditional [[diarchy|diarchal]] political system of [[Tibetan people]]s whereby the Desi (temporal ruler) coexists with the spiritual authority of the realm, usually unified under a third single ruler. The actual distribution of power between institutions varied over time and location. The Tibetan term Cho-sid-nyi ({{bo|t=ཆོས་སྲིད་གཉིས་|w=chos-srid-gnyis}}; alternate spellings include ''Chhos-srid-gnyis'', ''Chhoe-sid-nyi'', and ''Chos-sid-nyi'') literally means "both [[Dharma]] and temporal,"&lt;ref name=Sinha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/bot/pdf/bot_05_03_02.pdf |title=Chhos Srid Gnyis Ldan |format=PDF |work=Bulletin of Tibetology, Vol. V, No. 3 |last=Sinha |first=Nirmal C. |date=1968-11-12 |pages=13–27 |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DWBDict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/diction/diction.htm |title=Tibetan-English-Dictionary of Buddhist Teaching &amp; Practice |publisher=Rangjung Yeshe Translations &amp; Publications |work=Diamond Way Buddhism Worldwide |year=1996 |accessdate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328014624/http://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/diction/diction.htm |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be translated as "dual system of religion and politics."&lt;ref name=CoBE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20(A5).pdf |format=PDF |title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan (English) |publisher=Government of Bhutan |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2010-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162637/http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20%28A5%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the ultimate ruler is the patron and protector of [[state religion]], some aspects of the dual system of government may be likened to the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governance]] of the [[Church of England]], or even to [[theocracy]]. However, other aspects resemble [[secularism]], aiming to separate the doctrines of religion and politics. Under the Cho-sid-nyi, both religious and temporal authorities wield actual political power, albeit within officially separate institutions. Religious and secular officials might work side by side, each responsible to different [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]].

==History==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-13-11-31, Tibetexpedition, Minister.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Tibetan [[Kashag]] in 1938–39. From 1751 to 1951, the Kashag replaced the office of Desi in the Cho-sid-nyi (dual system) of [[Tibet]]]]

Since at least the period of the [[Mongol-Tibetan relations in the 13th and 14th centuries|Mongol presence]] in Tibet during the 13th and 14th centuries, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Bön]] clerics had participated in secular government, having the same rights as laymen to be appointed state officials, both military and civil.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt; This system stood in stark contrast with that of [[China]], in which the Buddhist view of politics as a "dismal science" as well as the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] monopoly on the bureaucracy precluded such political activity by the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt; By the [[Ming Dynasty]] (founded 1368), the [[Sakya#Feudal lordship over Tibet|Sakya]] held office above the heads of both components, embodying a government of both ''chos'' and ''srid''. As a result, there were two sets of laws and officials, the religious ({{bo|t=ལྷ་སདེ་|w=lha-sde}}) and the temporal ({{bo|t=མི་སྡེ་|w=mi-sde}}), however the branches shared the government and did not operate exclusively of each other.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt; This system often operated under Mongol and Chinese overlordship&lt;ref&gt;Whether historical Mongol/Chinese power over Tibet is classified as suzerainty or sovereignty is debated, with views often split along modern political lines.&lt;/ref&gt; with the respective emperor above the local Tibetan administration.

The Tibetan form of government from 1642 until 1951 was the Cho-sid-nyi.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt; The dual system was implemented during a period of consolidation under the [[Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso, "The Great" 5th Dalai Lama|Fifth Dalai Lama]] (r. 1642–1682), who unified Tibet religiously and politically after a prolonged civil war. He brought the government of Tibet under the control of the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] after defeating the rival [[Kagyu]] and [[Jonang]] sects and the secular ruler, the [[Tsangpa]] prince. The Tibetan model sought to produce a synthesis of the complementary components of the mundane norm: [[Dharma]] ({{bo|t=ཆོས་ལུགས་|w=chos-lugs}}) and [[Samsara]] ({{bo|t=འཇིག་རྟེན་|w='jig-rten}}).&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt;&lt;ref name=DWBDict/&gt; One basic assumption of this system is that the temporal lord depended on religion for legitimacy, while the institution of [[state religion]] depended on patronage and protection from the political élite.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt;

In 1751, the [[Kelzang Gyatso|Seventh Dalai Lama]] abolished the post of Desi (or Regent), in whom too much power had been placed. The Desi was replaced by the [[Kashag]] (Council) to represent the [[Central Tibetan Administration|civil administration]]. The [[Dalai Lama]] thus became the spiritual and political leader of Tibet.&lt;ref name=Namgyal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://namgyalmonastery.namgyalarchive.com/dala-lama/7th-dalai-lama/his-holiness-the-seventh-dalai-lama-kelsang-gyatso/ |title=His Holiness the Seventh Dalai Lama, Kelsang Gyatso |work=Namgyal Monastery: Personal Monastery of [[14th Dalai Lama|His Holiness the XIVth Dalai Lama]] |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714150509/http://namgyalmonastery.namgyalarchive.com/dala-lama/7th-dalai-lama/his-holiness-the-seventh-dalai-lama-kelsang-gyatso/ |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Samphel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Samphel |first1=Thubten |last2=Samphel |first2=Tendar |title=The Dalai Lamas of Tibet |page=101 |publisher=Roli &amp; Janssen |location=[[New Delhi]] |year=2004 |ISBN=81-7436-085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shakabpa&gt;{{cite book|last=Shakabpa |first=Tsepon W.

[[Image:Shabdrung.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal]] instituted the Tibetan Cho-sid-nyi (dual system) in [[Bhutan]]]]
In [[Bhutan]], the Cho-sid-nyi was established by [[Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal]] in the 17th century under the code known as the [[Tsa Yig]]. Having fled sectarian persecution in Tibet, Ngawang Namgyal established the [[Drukpa Lineage]] as the state religion. Under the Bhutanese system, the powers of the government were split between the religious branch headed by the [[Je Khenpo]] of the [[Drukpa Lineage]] and the civil administrative branch headed by the [[Druk Desi]]. Both the Je Khenpo and Druk Desi were under the nominal authority of the [[Shabdrung]], a reincarnation of Ngawang Namgyal. After the death of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, Bhutan nominally followed the dual system of government. In practice, the Shabdrung was often a child under the control of the Druk Desi, and regional [[penlop]]s (governors) often administered their districts in defiance of the Druk Desi until the rise of the unified monarchy at the beginning of the 20th century.

In [[Ladakh]] and [[Sikkim]], two related [[Chogyal]] dynasties reigned with [[absolute monarchy|absolute control]], punctuated by periods of invasion and colonization by [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], and the [[British Empire]]. The basis of the Chogyal monarchy in both Ladakh and Sikkim was its recognition by Three Lamas, and the title ''Chogyal'' ({{bo|t=ཆོས་རྒྱལ་|w=chos-rgyal}}; "Dharma Raja" or "Religious King") itself refers to the dual system of government. [[Namgyal dynasty of Ladakh|Ladakh's Namgyal dynasty]] lasted from 1470 until 1834. The autonomy of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] élite in Ladakh, as well as their system of government, ended with the campaigns of [[General Zorawar Singh]] and [[Rajput]] [[suzerainty]]. Ladakh became a region within the [[States and territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. The Namgyal dynasty continued in Sikkim from 1542 until 1975, when the kingdom voted by plebiscite to join the union of [[India]].

===Kingdom of Bhutan===
{{see|Constitution of Bhutan|Druk Gyalpo|Shabdrung}}
[[Image:King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck (edit).jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Bhutanese [[Druk Gyalpo]] [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]] is the embodiment of the '''Cho-sid-nyi''' under the [[Constitution of Bhutan]]]]
The only modern example of a sovereign government operating under the Cho-sid-nyi is [[Bhutan]], although it exists in a highly modified form. In 1907, in an effort to reform the dysfunctional political system, the [[penlop]]s (governors) of Bhutan orchestrated the establishment of a Bhutanese monarchy with [[Ugyen Wangchuck]], the [[penlop]] of [[Trongsa]] installed as hereditary king, with the support of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and against the wishes of Tibet. Since the establishment of the [[House of Wangchuck|Wangchuck]] dynasty in 1907, the office of the [[Druk Desi]] has been held by the reigning [[Druk Gyalpo]] (King of Bhutan). Under the monarchy, the relative influence of the [[Je Khenpo]] has diminished. Nonetheless, the position remains a powerful one and the Je Khenpo is typically viewed as the closest and most powerful advisor to the Druk Gyalpo.

The office of [[Shabdrung]] has fared less well, and has been subsumed by the office of the [[Druk Gyalpo]]. The royal family suffered from questions of legitimacy in its early years, with the reincarnations of the various Shabdrungs posing a threat. According to one Drukpa source, the Shabdrung's brother [[Chhoki Gyeltshen]] challenged the 1926 accession of King [[Jigme Wangchuck]]. He was rumored to have met with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] to garner support for the Shabdrung against the King.  The Seventh Shabdrung, [[Jigme Dorji]] was then "retired" to [[Nalanda bhutan|Talo monastery]] and died in 1931, under rumors of assassination. He was the last Shabdrung recognized by Bhutan; subsequent claimants to the incarnation have not been recognized by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Politics of Bhutan |last=Rose |first=Leo E. |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |year=1977 |isbn=0-8014-0909-8 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rongthong Kunley Dorji |title=My understanding of Shabdrung |work=The Bhutan Today |year=2003 |accessdate=4 March 2009 |url=http://www.bhutandnc.com/aprilmay03_3.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Jigme Ngawang Namgyal]], known as ''Shabdrung Rimpoche'' to his followers, fled Bhutan for [[India]] where he spent the remainder of his life.  Until 2002, Bhutanese pilgrims were able to journey to [[Kalimpong]], just south of Bhutan, to visit with the Master. On April 5, 2003, the Shabdrung died. Some of his followers claim he was poisoned, while [[Kuensel]] took pains to explain he died after an extended bout with cancer. In early 2007, reports alleged that the current Shabdrung Pema Namgyel, then a small child, had been held under house arrest in [[Bhutan]] along with his parents since 2005 after being invited to Bhutan from his home in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Respected Buddhist teacher under house arrest in Bhutan |work=The Buddhist Channel |date=Feb 3, 2007 |accessdate=4 March 2009 |url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=40,3674,0,0,1,0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Bhutan]], enacted in 2008, confirms Bhutan's commitment to the Cho-sid-nyi system. However the title "Druk Desi" never appears in the Constitution, and all administrative powers are vested in the [[Druk Gyalpo]] and civilian offices directly. Furthermore, the Druk Gyalpo appoints the [[Je Khenpo]] on advice of the Five Lopons, and the [[democracy|democratic]] Constitution itself is the supreme law of the land, as opposed to a Shabdrung figurehead.&lt;ref name=CoBE/&gt; In the 2008 Constitution, there is no reference whatsoever to the office of Shabdrung.

===Government of Tibet in exile===
{{main|Central Tibetan Administration}}
The [[Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration|Parliament]] of the [[Central Tibetan Administration|Tibetan government in exile]] consists of 43–46 members including 10 religious delegates (2 members each from the four schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and the traditional [[Bön]] school). Aside from seats reserved for religious representatives, offices are generally open to clerics: the [[Kalon Tripa|Prime Minister]] of its [[Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration|Parliament]] is [[Lobsang Tenzin]], a Buddhist monk. The administration of the government in exile was headed for decades by the [[Dalai Lama]], but in 2011, he ceded his temporal (secular) powers, keeping only his role as spiritual leader.

[[Image:Spain and Portugal.png|350px|thumb|The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas Treaty]] [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] (purple) and the [[Moluccas]] [[antimeridian]] (green), set by the Treaty of Zaragoza, 1529]]
The '''Treaty of Zaragoza''',  or '''Treaty of Saragossa''', also referred to as the '''Capitulation of Zaragoza''', was a peace treaty between the Spanish Crown and [[Portugal]], signed on 22 April 1529 by [[John III of Portugal|King John III]] and the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], in the Aragonese city of [[Zaragoza]]. The treaty defined the areas of Castilian (''Spanish'') and Portuguese influence in Asia, in order to resolve the "Moluccas issue", which had arisen because both kingdoms claimed the [[Moluccas|Moluccas islands]] for themselves, asserting that it was within their area of influence established by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494. The conflict began in 1520, when expeditions of both kingdoms reached the Pacific Ocean, because no agreed meridian of longitude had been established in the orient.

== Background: the "Moluccas Issue" ==
In 1494 [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and Portugal signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], dividing the world into two areas of exploration and colonisation: the Castilian and the Portuguese. It proclaimed a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] in the Atlantic Ocean, with areas west of the line exclusive to Spain, and east of the line to Portugal.

In 1511, [[Malacca]], then the centre of Asian trade, was conquered for Portugal by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]]. Getting to know the secret location of the so-called "[[Maluku Islands|spice islands]]" – the [[Banda Islands]] in the Moluccas, then the single world source of [[nutmeg]] and [[cloves]], and the main purpose for the travels in the Indian Ocean – Albuquerque sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] in search of the Moluccas, particularly the Banda islands. The expedition arrived in early 1512, passing en route through the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], being the first Europeans to get there.&lt;ref&gt;Hannard (1991), page 7; {{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton  | coauthors =  | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn  = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{what?|date=December 2015}} Before reaching Banda, the explorers visited the islands of [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram]]. Later, after a separation forced by a shipwreck, Abreu's vice-captain [[Francisco Serrão]], sailed to the north and, but his ship sank off [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese [[factory (trading post)|fortress-factory]]: the {{Interlanguage link multi|Forte de São João Baptista de Ternate|pt}}.

Letters describing the "Spice Islands", from Serrão to [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who were friends and possibly cousins, helped Magellan persuade the Spanish crown to finance the first [[circumnavigation]] of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Bandanaira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 1521, the Moluccas, "the cradle of all spices", were reached from the east by Magellan's fleet, sailing then under [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], at the service of the Spanish Crown. Before Magellan and Serrão could meet in the Moluccas, Serrão died on the island of Ternate, almost at the same time Magellan was killed in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Duarte Barbosa]]; [[Mansel Longworth Dames]]; Fernão de Magalhães. The book of Duarte Barbosa: an account of the countries bordering on the Indian Ocean and their inhabitants. New Delhi:  {{ISBN|81-206-0451-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano expedition]] (1519–1522), Charles V sent a second expedition, led by [[García Jofre de Loaísa]], to colonise the islands, based on the assertion that they were in the Castilian zone, under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The expedition of [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] (1525–1526) aimed to occupy and colonise the Moluccas. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men included the most notable Spanish navigators: [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], who lost his life in this expedition, and the young [[Andrés de Urdaneta]].&lt;/ref&gt; After some difficulties, the expedition reached the Moluccas, docking at [[Tidore]], where the Spanish established a fort. There was inevitable conflict with the Portuguese, who were already established in Ternate. After a year of fighting, the Spanish suffer as defeat but, despite that, nearly a decade of skirmishes over the possession of the islands ensued.

== Conference of Badajoz–Elvas ==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}
In 1524, both kingdoms organised the "Junta de Badajoz-Elvas" to resolve the dispute. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians, who formed a committee to establish the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, and the intention was to divide the whole world into two equal [[hemispheres of the Earth|hemisphere]]s.

The Portuguese delegation sent by King João III included António de Azevedo Coutinho, [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], [[Lopo Homem]], a cartographer and [[cosmography|cosmographer]], and [[Simon Fernandez|Simão Fernandes]]. The plenipotentiary from Portugal was Mercurio Gâtine, and those from Spain were Count Mercurio Gâtine, [[Garcia de Loaysa]], [[Bishop of Osma]], and García de Padilla, grand master of the [[Order of Calatrava]]. Former Portuguese cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]], was part of the Spanish delegation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The records of the committee, held in the Portuguese national archive at [[Torre do Tombo]], include a letter written by Lopo Homem, Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer, alluding to the quarrel between the two kingdoms over the sovereign rights of each.&lt;/ref&gt;

An amusing story is said to have taken place at this meeting.  According to contemporary Castilian writer [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], a small boy stopped the Portuguese delegation and asked if they intended to divide up the world.  The delegation answered that they were.  The boy responded by baring his backside and suggesting that they draw their line through his butt crack.&lt;ref&gt; Anghiera, Pietro Martire d'.

The board met several times, at [[Badajoz]] and [[Elvas Municipality|Elvas]], without reaching an agreement. Geographic knowledge at that time was inadequate for an accurate assignment of [[longitude]], and each group chose maps or globes that showed the islands to be in their own hemisphere.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As an example of this partiality, the chief advisor to Charles V, [[Jean Carondelet]], possessed a globe by [[Franciscus Monachus]] which showed the islands in the Spanish hemisphere.&lt;/ref&gt; John III and Charles V agreed to not send anyone else to the Moluccas until it was established in whose hemisphere they were situated.

Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions to the area around the Moluccas. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and [[Diogo da Rocha]] were sent by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Meneses]] to the [[Celebes]] (also already visited by Simão de Abreu in 1523) and to the north. The expeditioners were the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named "Islands de Sequeira ".&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Galvano, Richard Hakluyt, C R Drinkwater Bethune, ''The discoveries of the world: from their original unto the year of our Lord 1555'', The Hakluyt Society, 1862, a partir da tradução inglesa de 1601 da edição portuguesa em Lisboa, 1563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There is a much-disputed theory that [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] (1522) and [[Gomes de Sequeira]] (1525) were the first Europeans to discover Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Explorers such as Martim Afonso de Melo (1522-24), and possible Gomes de Sequeira (1526-1527), sighted the [[Aru Islands]] and the [[Tanimbar Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Luis Filipe F. R. Thomaz, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/arch_0044-8613_1995_num_49_1_3038?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard ''The image of the Archipelago in Portuguese cartography of the 16th and early 17th centuries''], Persee, 1995, Volume 49 pages: 56&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526 Jorge de Meneses reached northwestern [[Papua New Guinea]], landing in [[Biak]] in the [[Schouten Islands]], and from there he sailed to [[Waigeo]] on the [[Bird's Head Peninsula]].

On the other hand, in addition to the [[Loaísa expedition]] from Spain to the Moluccas (1525-1526), the Castilians sent an the expedition there via the Pacific, led by [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] (1528) (prepared by [[Hernán Cortés]] in Mexico), in order to compete with the Portuguese in the region. Members of the Garcia Jofre de Loaísa expedition were taken prisoner by the Portuguese, who returned the survivors to Europe by the western route. Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón reached the [[Marshall Islands]], and in two failed attempts to return from the Moluccas via the Pacific, explored part of west and northern [[New Guinea]], also reaching the [[Schouten Islands]] and sighting [[Yapen]], as well as the [[Admiralty Islands]] and the Carolines.

On 10 February 1525, Charles V's younger sister [[Catherine of Austria (1507–1578)|Catherine of Austria]] married John III of Portugal, and on 11 March 1526, Charles V married king John's sister [[Isabella of Portugal]]. These crossed weddings strengthened the ties between the two crowns, facilitating an agreement regarding the Moluccas. It was in the interests of the emperor to avoid conflict, so that he could focus on his European policy, and the Spaniards did not know then how to get spices from the Moluccas to Europe via the eastern route. The [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco route]] was only established by Andrés de Urdaneta in 1565.

== Treaty ==
The Treaty of Zaragoza laid down that the eastern border between the two domain zones was 297.5 leagues (1,763 kilometres, 952 nautical miles){{#tag:ref| Using the ''legua náutica'' (nautical league) of four Roman miles totalling {{nowrap|5.926 km}}, used by Spain for navigation during the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Charon, "The linear league in North America", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 70 (1980) 129–153, pp. 142, 144, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}, or 17° east, of the Maluku Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Helen Blair, [http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Philippine-Islands-1493-18033.html ''The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803''], part 3&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty included a safeguard clause which stated that the deal would be undone if at any time the emperor wished to revoke it, with the Portuguese being reimbursed the money they had to pay, and each nation "will have the right and the action as that is now." That never happened however, because the emperor desperately needed the Portuguese money to finance the [[War of the League of Cognac]] against his arch-rival [[Francis I of France]].

The treaty did not clarify or modify the line of demarcation established by the Treaty of Tordesillas, nor did it validate Spain's claim to equal [[Hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]]s (180° each), so the two lines divided the Earth into unequal portions. Portugal's portion was roughly 191° of the Earth's circumference, whereas Spain's portion was roughly 169°. There was a ±4° margin of uncertainty as to the exact size of both portions, due to the variation of opinion about the precise location of the Tordesillas line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/pacific/spice-islands/demarcation-lines.html |title=Demarcation Lines |last=Delaney |first=John |website=Strait Through: Magellan to Cook &amp; the Pacific |publisher=Princeton University Library |access-date=2018-04-20 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the treaty, Portugal gained control of all lands and seas west of the line, including all of Asia and its neighbouring islands so far "discovered", leaving Spain with most of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Although the [[Philippines]] was not mentioned in the treaty, Spain implicitly relinquished any claim to it because it was well west of the line. Nevertheless, by 1542, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles V]] had decided to colonise the Philippines, assuming that Portugal would not protest too vigorously because the archipelago had no spices. Although he failed in his attempt, [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] succeeded in 1565, establishing the initial Spanish trading post at [[Manila]]. As his father had expected, there was little opposition from the Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Tan2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Samuel K.|title=A History of the Philippines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pw5FWmdNmj8C&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=20 April 2018|year=2008|publisher=UP Press|isbn=9789715425681|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treaty on Open Skies''' entered into force on January 1, 2002, and currently has 34 party states. It establishes a program of unarmed [[surveillance aircraft|aerial surveillance flights]] over the entire [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of its participants. The [[treaty]] is designed to enhance mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information about military forces and activities of concern to them. Open Skies is one of the most wide-ranging international efforts to date promoting openness and transparency of military forces and activities. The concept of "mutual aerial observation" was initially proposed to [[Soviet Premier]] [[Nikolai Bulganin]] at the Geneva Conference of 1955 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]; however, the Soviets promptly rejected the concept and it lay dormant for several years. The treaty was eventually signed as an initiative of US president (and former Director of Central Intelligence) [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1989. Negotiated by the then-members of [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], the agreement was signed in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], on March 24, 1992.

This treaty is not related to civil-aviation [[Freedoms of the air|open skies agreements]].

==Membership==
The 34 state parties to the Open Skies Treaty are: [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]] (including [[Greenland]]), [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[the United States]].
[[Kyrgyzstan]] has signed the treaty but has not yet ratified it. [[Canada]] and [[Hungary]] are the Depositories of the treaty in recognition of their special contributions to the Open Skies process. The "Depository" countries maintain treaty documents and provide administrative support.

The Open Skies treaty is one of unlimited duration, and is open to accession by other states. The republics of the [[former Soviet Union]] ([[USSR]]) that have not already become state parties to the treaty may join it at any time. Applications from other interested countries are subject to a [[consensus]] decision by the [[Open Skies Consultative Commission]] (OSCC), the organization, based in [[Vienna, Austria]], that is charged with carrying out the implementation of the treaty. The [[Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe]] meets monthly at its headquarters in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/oscc|title=Open Skies Consultative Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Eight countries have joined into the treaty since it entered into force in 2002: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Sweden. Notably missing are [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Armenia]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]].

== Open Skies Consultative Commission ==
The '''Open Skies Consultative Commission''' is the implementing body for the Treaty on Open Skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty on Open Skies|url=http://www.osce.org/oscc|publisher=Open Skies Consultative Commission|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It meets monthly at the [[Vienna]] headquarters of the [[Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe]], and consists of representatives from each of the states that is a party to the treaty.

==Basic elements of the treaty==

===Territory===
The Open Skies regulations covers the territory over which the parties exercise sovereignty, including [[mainland]], islands, and internal and territorial waters. The treaty specifies that the entire territory of a member state is open to observation. Observation flights may only be restricted for reasons of flight safety and not for reasons of national security.

===Aircraft===
[[Image:Oc-135 xxl.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Boeing OC-135B Open Skies]].]]
Observation aircraft may be provided by either the observing party or by the observed party (the "taxi option"), at the latter's choice. All Open Skies aircraft and sensors must pass specific certification and [[pre-flight inspection]] procedures to ensure that they are compliant with treaty standards. The official certified U.S. Open Skies aircraft is the [[OC-135B Open Skies]].

Canada uses a [[C-130 Hercules]] aircraft equipped with a "SAMSON" sensor pod to conduct flights over other treaty nations. The pod is a converted CC-130 fuel tank modified to carry the permitted sensors, along with associated on-board mission systems. A consortium of nations consisting of Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain own and operate this system. The costs of maintaining the SAMSON Pod are shared, based on each nation's flight quota and actual use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[Image:An-30 - RA-26226.jpg|thumb| [[An-30]] monitoring aircraft]]
[[File:Russian Air Force Tu-214ON RA-64519 UUBW 2011-8-12.png|thumb|[[Tupolev Tu-214]]ON of the [[Russian Air Force]].]]
Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and Ukraine use the [[Antonov An-30]] for their flights. The Czech Republic also used to use the An-30 for this purpose but they apparently retired all of theirs from service in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Russia also uses a [[Tupolev Tu-154A|Tu-154M-ON]] monitoring aircraft. [[Germany]] formerly used this type as well until the aircraft was lost in a 1997 [[Mid-air collision#List of notable military mid-air collisions"List of notable military mid-air collisions|accident]]. Russia is phasing out both An-30 and Tu-154M-ON and replacing them with two [[Tupolev Tu-204#Tu-214ON|Tu-214ON]] with the registrations RA-64519 and RA-64525; though this aircraft's new sensor suite is currently being challenged by the USA.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Sweden uses a [[Saab 340]] aircraft ("OS-100") that was certified in 2004.

Until 2008, the UK designated aircraft was an [[Hawker Siddeley Andover|Andover C.1(PR)]] aircraft, registration XS596.  Since then the UK has used a variety of aircraft including a Saab 340, An-30 and an OC-135.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2013-07-16a.165334.h&amp;s=%28%28section%3Awrans%29+open+skies%29+speaker%3A11189#g165334.q0|title=Surveillance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[German Air Force]] purchased an [[Airbus A319]] as its future Open Skies aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;http://augengeradeaus.net/2017/01/flugbereitschaft-erhaelt-zusaetzlichen-airbus/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensors===
Open Skies aircraft may have video, optical panoramic and framing cameras for daylight photography, infra-red line scanners for a day/night capability, and [[synthetic aperture radar]] for a day/night all weather capability. Photographic image quality will permit recognition of major military equipment (e.g., permit a member state to distinguish between a tank and a truck), thus allowing significant transparency of military forces and activities. Sensor categories may be added and capabilities improved by agreement among member states. All sensors used in Open Skies must be commercially available to all signatories. Imagery resolution is limited to 30 centimetres.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Quotas===
Each state party is obligated to receive observation flights per its passive quota allocation. Each state party may conduct as many observation flights - its active quota - as its passive quota. During the first three years after entry into force, each state will be obligated to accept no more than seventy-five percent of its passive quota. Since the overall annual passive quota for the United States is 42, this means that it will be obligated to accept no more than 31 observation flights a year during this three-year period. Only two flights were requested over the United States during 2005, by the Russian Federation and Republic of Belarus Group of states parties (which functions as a single entity for quota allocation purposes). The United States is entitled to 8 of the 31 annual flights available over Russia/Belarus. Additionally, the United States is entitled to one flight over Ukraine, which is shared with Canada.

===Data sharing and availability===
Imagery collected from Open Skies missions is available to any state party upon request for the cost of reproduction. As a result, the data available to each state party is much greater than that which it can collect itself under the treaty quota system.

==History==
At a [[Geneva Summit (1955)|Geneva Conference]] meeting with [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikolai Bulganin]] in 1955, President Eisenhower proposed that the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] conduct [[surveillance]] overflights of each other's territory to reassure each country that the other was not preparing to attack.&lt;ref name = "eisenhower"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eisenhower-foreign/ |title=Foreign Affairs |work=American Experience |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |date= |accessdate=28 July 2013 |quote=The two sides would not meet face-to-face until the Geneva summit of 1955. At the summit, Eisenhower asserted, "I came to Geneva because I believe mankind longs for freedom from war and the rumors of war. I came here because my lasting faith in the decent instincts and good sense of the people who populate this world of ours." In this spirit of good will, Eisenhower presented the Soviets with his Open Skies proposal. In it he proposed that each side provide full descriptions of all their military facilities and allow for aerial inspections to insure the information was correct. The Soviets rejected the proposal. Eisenhower was disappointed, but not surprised. In truth, the Open Skies proposal would have benefited the U.S. much more so than the Soviets -- the Russians already knew the location of most American strategic defense facilities, it was the Americans who stood to gain new information.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fears and suspicions of the [[Cold War]] led Soviet General Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to reject Eisenhower's proposal.&lt;ref name = "eisenhower"/&gt;

During a five-day summit conference held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland at the end of July 1955, the Soviet Union and United States held serious talks about disarmament and the United States put forward proposals for mutual reconnaissance flights over each other's air space, known as the '''Open Skies''' proposal. The United States had a large number of [[B-47 Stratojet|RB-47]] and [[B-36 Peacemaker|RB-36]] reconnaissance aircraft at its disposal for such activities, however the Soviets turned down this proposal. However, this Geneva Conference was universally accepted as a turning point in the Cold War. The tensions in Europe were felt to be a stalemate. However, both the Soviet Union and United States were willing to talk about their differences, rather than increase them into a state of war.

Thirty-four years later, the Open Skies concept was reintroduced by President George H. W. Bush as a means to build confidence and security between all [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. In February 1990, an international Open Skies conference involving all NATO and Warsaw Pact countries opened in [[Ottawa, Canada]]. Subsequent rounds of negotiations were held in [[Budapest, Hungary]]; [[Vienna, Austria]]; and [[Helsinki, Finland]].

On March 24, 1992,&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; the Open Skies Treaty was signed in Helsinki by Secretary of State [[James Baker]] and foreign ministers from 23 other countries. The treaty entered into force on January 2, 2002, after [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]] completed ratification procedures.

In November 1992, President Bush assigned responsibility for overall training, management, leadership, coordination and support for U.S. Open Skies observation missions to the [[On-Site Inspection Agency]] (OSIA), now a part of the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] (DTRA). Until entry into force in January 2002, DTRA support for the treaty involved participating in training and joint trial flights (JTFs). The U.S. has conducted over 70 JTFs since 1993. By March 2003, DTRA had successfully certified 16 camera configurations on the OC-135B aircraft. They also had contributed to the certification of the Bulgarian An-30, Hungarian [[Antonov An-26|An-26]], POD Group (consisting of Belgium, Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain) C-130H, Romanian An-30, Russian An-30, and Ukrainian An-30. The United States successfully flew its first Open Skies mission over Russia in December 2002.

With entry into force of the treaty, formal observation flights began in August 2002. During the first treaty year, state parties conducted 67 observation flights. In 2004, state parties conducted 74 missions, and planned 110 missions for 2005. On March 8 and 9, 2007, Russia conducted overflights of Canada under the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/07/openskies-russians.html?ref=rss|title=Russian military to inspect Canada from above|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=March 8, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310162645/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/07/openskies-russians.html?ref=rss|archivedate=March 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OSCC continues to address modalities for conducting observation missions and other implementation issues.

Since 2002 a total of 40 missions have taken place over the UK. There were 24 quota missions conducted by: Russia—20; Ukraine—three; and Sweden—one. There were 16 training flights conducted by: Benelux (joint with Estonia); Estonia (joint with Benelux); Georgia—three (one joint with Sweden); Sweden—three (one joint with Georgia); USA - three; Latvia; Lithuania; Romania; Slovenia; and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2013-09-02d.166929.h&amp;s=%28%28section%3Awrans%29+open+skies%29+speaker%3A11189#g166929.q0|title=Military Intelligence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also since 2002 the UK has undertaken a total of 51 open skies missions. 38 were quota missions to the following countries: Ukraine (five); Georgia (seven) and Russia (26). 13 missions were training missions to the following nations: Bulgaria; Yugoslavia; Estonia; Slovenia (three); Sweden (three); USA; Latvia, Lithuania and the Benelux.
