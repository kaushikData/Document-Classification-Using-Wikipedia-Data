'''''Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by Canadian studio H2O Interactive and published by [[THQ]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] (N64) [[video game console]].

== Development ==

=== Writing ===
Noting that the RPG genre in particular needs a good narrative at its core, the developers hired Chris Klug (of TSR's ''DragonQuest'' fame'')'' as the scriptwriter and lead designer for the project. he devised a story built around the concept of a magical true name. To explore this idea, he worldbuilt a universe with two places: the spirit plane (the source of magic) and the mundane plane (where mortals live). Once a person discovers their magical true name, they are able to unite their spirit and mundane forms, thereby unlocking unlimited power.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417035828/http://www.dailyradar.com:80/previews/game_preview_314.html|title=DailyRadar.com Preview - Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage|date=2001-04-17|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage'' follows a young squire named Alaron who, while searching for a missing farmer named Kendall, encounters a strange spirit and is poisoned by Goblins. He awakes from a terrifying vision of monsters to find himself inside the hut of Oriana, a healer, who tells Alaron that the poison is beyond the powers of normal medicine to cure. Upon returning to Castle Gwernia, the king, Phelan, instructs him to ask the Mirari people of Erromon to help heal his poison. Upon reaching Erromon, the Mirari King, Txomin, explains that they've been under attack from goblins and seeks Alaron's aid, promising to direct him to a naming wizard named Cradawgh.

Alaron clears the goblins off the mountains, however when he returns to Erromon he discovers that Txomin lied, and does not know the whereabouts of Cradawgh, telling Alaron instead to travel to Talewok, and see the sorceress, Ardra. Before leaving, Alaron converses with the Mirari queen Yeraza, who gives him the Stormbreaker, a blessed tree branch able to calm any storm.

At the Wizard School, the doorman asks everyone's [[True name|True Name]], but Alaron cannot answer. Ardra the sorceress begins the healing spell, which brings on another vision. This one includes a feeble, old man in a rocking chair. Ardra explains that the healing spell failed because Alaron is a Wildling – he has no True Name. Without a True Name, his spirit is not bound to his body, and Alaron is incomplete. Ardra tells him to travel to Port Saiid and take a boat to Cradawgh's Island.

Alaron is eventually able to hire a boat at Port Saiid – after an unusual encounter with a cryptic [[jester]]  but the ship travels into a powerful storm, and as the Stormbreaker is tied to the mast instead of the helm, the ship is damaged and forced to land at Chaos Isle. Following repairs the party sets off for Cradawgh's Island; this time the ship arrives safely, however a group of monsters has already reached Cradawgh. The dying wizard asks Alaron to bring his body to Talewok, and suggests seeking the Jundar King Zaratas in the desert.

After Cradawgh's funeral in Talewok, Alaron heads down to the city of Terminor. He then soon discovers that the nearby village of Pome was destroyed by a wizard with a twisted staff. The final level of Terminor has a house, in which resides Mago, a wizard without a True Name, who went insane several years ago and called up a huge storm when the townspeople tried to kill him. Mago is the feeble, old man from Alaron's earlier vision and can no longer speak.

Alaron travels to a nearby bog, where he finds the Tower of Shamsuk, a powerful necromancer who had previously destroyed Pome and cursed Niesen, slowly turning him into a zombie. Niesen gets the party into the tower where they eventually reach a chamber with a large stone hand. The jester from Port Saiid appears once more, revealing himself to be Farris – a wizard. Farris joins the party, assisting them in defeating Shamsuk, who has already killed Oriana – now revealed to be Alaron's mother. Farris then leaves the party, taking Shamsuk's necromantic staff with him.

Alaron crosses a desert to reach the Jundar city of Ugarit, where he speaks with the Jundar Emperor, Zaratas, who explains that only the dragon Rooughah can name Alaron. He needs to find the Golden Horn of Kynon and play it for Rooughah. Alaron retrieves the Horn, and begins heading back to Erromon.

Alaron travels through the Erromon tunnels until he comes across the dragon Rooughah. After Alaron plays the Horn of Kynon, Rooughah tells him he knows his True Name: "Alaron". The Mirari then tell Alaron that the forces of Chaos are gathering outside Gwernia. Alaron returns to Gwernia castle and fights his way to Prince Sheridan, who confesses to always being jealous of Alaron. Sheridan explains that Alaron is the son of Oriana and King Phelan. Alaron fights and kills Sheridan, only to then meet Pochangarat (the leader of Chaos) – the huge monster from Alaron's first vision in Oriana's hut.

After Pochangarat's death, Alaron finds his father, King Phelan, who is dying from the wounds he suffered at Pochangarat's hands. He requests to be buried under the Great Wall of Knights in Gwernia, and appoints Alaron as his successor before dying. The story ends with Alaron's coronation ceremony.

==Reception==
In a preview, Daily Radar noted the game's potential as the "defining RPG for the Nintendo 64".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aidyn received "mixed or average" reviews from critics, scoring a 53 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/nintendo-64/aidyn-chronicles-the-first-mage&lt;/ref&gt; And a negative 47.36% on Game Rankings.&lt;ref name="gr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/n64/196565-aidyn-chronicles-the-first-mage/index.html |title=''Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage'' for Nintendo 64 |work=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their review, [[IGN]] gave the game a 4.2/10 stating, "The scope of it was too large and led to a really -- and I mean really -- tedious experience. It has no way of pulling you into the story or gameplay."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/17/aidyn-chronicles-the-first-mage&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Percy Sledge Alabama Music Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|right|[[Percy Sledge]] performing at the Hall of Fame in March 2010.]]
The '''Alabama Music Hall of Fame''', first conceived by the [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio|Muscle Shoals]] Music Association in the early 1980s, was created by the Alabama Music Hall of Fame Board, which then saw to its Phase One construction of a {{convert|12500|sqft|m2|-1|abbr=on}} after a statewide referendum in 1987. It currently stands in the town of [[Tuscumbia, Alabama]].

==Purpose==

The Alabama Music Hall of Fame serves to showcase a multitude of different [[List of people from Alabama|Alabamians]] who have had a significant impact upon the music industry. From musicians to songwriters, management, and publishing, The Alabama Music Hall of Fame provides several ways of honoring its "achievers," including informative exhibitions, a bronze star on their Walk of Fame, and the achievers' inclusion in the Hall of Fame roster.

==Plans==
Both a second and third phase are being planned as future expansions for the Alabama Music Hall of Fame:
*The second addition is going to be a 1500-seat "state of the art" audio-video recording auditorium.
* The third addition is to be a "southern music" research library.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Big Brother Award.jpg|thumb|right|Big Brother Award, USA sculpture ("If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face— forever.")]] --&gt;
The '''Big Brother Awards''' ('''BBAs''') recognize "the government and private sector organizations ... which have done the most to threaten [[personal privacy]]". They are named after the [[George Orwell]] character [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] from the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. They are awarded yearly to authorities, companies, organizations, and persons that have been acting particularly and consistently to threaten or violate people's privacy, or disclosed people's [[personal data]] to third parties.

The awards are intended to draw public attention to [[privacy]] issues and related alarming trends in society, especially in [[data privacy]]. The contest is organized by loose coalition of  [[nongovernmental organization]], including Iuridicum Remedium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iure.org/|title=Lidská práva, watchdog, advocacy (Aktuality) - Iuridicum Remedium - IuRe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Privacy International]],&lt;ref name="BBAI"&gt;http://www.bigbrotherawards.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and others, although some national-level BBAs are organized by specific sponsors.

The German Big Brother Awards are organized and hosted by [[Digitalcourage]] (formerly FoeBuD) in [[Bielefeld]].

The United States most recently hosted its Big Brother Awards – also known as the '''Orwell Awards''' or simply '''the Orwells''' – on 14 April 2005 in Seattle, Washington.  They had previously been hosted in Berkeley, California, on 12 April 2004; New York City on 3 April 2003; San Francisco, California, on 18 April 2002; and Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 7 March 2001. The first annual US Big Brother Awards were made at the [[Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference]] in Washington, D.C., on 7 April 1999, the 50th anniversary of the publication of Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.&lt;ref name="Diederich99"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diederich |first1=Tom |title=Intel, US Govt "honored" for breaches of privacy |url=http://linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-04/lw-04-orwell.html |accessdate=25 Jul 2014 |work=Computerworld |date=8 April 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991004233003/http://linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-04/lw-04-orwell.html |archivedate=October 4, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were made by [[Simon Davies (privacy advocate)|Simon Davies]], managing director&lt;ref name=Boodhoo99&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boodhoo |first1=Niala |title=Orwell's Legacy: Big Brother Awards |url=http://www.pcworld.com/pcwtoday/article/0,1510,10441,00.html |accessdate=25 Jul 2014 |work=PC World Today |date=8 April 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508055915/http://www.pcworld.com/pcwtoday/article/0%2C1510%2C10441%2C00.html |archivedate=May 8, 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the London-based Privacy International to recognize "the government and private sector organizations which have done the most to invade personal privacy in the United States."&lt;ref name="Diederich99"/&gt; The awards were given in five categories: Greatest Corporate Invader, Lifetime Menace, Most Invasive Program, People's Choice, and Worst Public Official.&lt;ref name="Boodhoo99"/&gt;

'''''Bridge to the Sun''''' is a 1961 film, directed by [[Étienne Périer (director)|Etienne Périer]], starring [[Carroll Baker]], [[James Shigeta]], James Yagi, [[Tetsurō Tamba]], and [[Sean Garrison]]. It is based on the 1957 autobiography ''Bridge To The Sun'' by [[Gwen Terasaki]], which detailed events in Gwen's life and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDC133DF932A15751C1A966958260 Gwen Harold Terasaki, Author, 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=March 2018}}
Gwen Harold, an American woman from Tennessee, meets Hidenari Terasaki (called Terry by his friends and family), the secretary to the Japanese Ambassador, while attending a reception at the Japanese Embassy in [[Washington D.C.]] with her Aunt Peggy and friend Bill.  They share a moment while Terry is showing her the antique Japanese artworks on display in the Embassy, and after some reluctance, she agrees to allow him to call on her.

They begin dating and they quickly fall in love, even though Terry occasionally has fits of anti-western sentiment.  When Terry asks her to marry him, she agrees, much to the chagrin of Aunt Peggy (who was raised in the [[Jim Crow Laws|Jim Crow South]]), and who sees the relationship as unnatural, especially when there are "nice clean young men" available.  The Japanese Ambassador also calls on Gwen and attempts to dissuade her from accepting, claiming it would hurt Terry's career by giving him an American bias, and states that even though the two countries are friendly, anything could happen between foreign countries.  He seems to hint at possible [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|aggression]] in the future, even though it is only 1935 and the Japanese have not yet resumed [[Second Sino-Japanese War|conflicts with China]], keeping the countries of Gwen and Terry at an uneasy peace. They eventually marry despite the obstacles and, when Terry is recalled, travel to Japan by ship.

Almost immediately after disembarking and arriving in [[Tokyo]], Terry begins to treat Gwen much differently, expecting her to behave according to the male-centric beliefs of contemporary Japan, such as being silent among men, always entering doors after the men, and virtually bending to every whim of Terry and her male relatives.  They continually fight and make up, mostly because of Gwen's outspokenness among men and Terry's strict adherence to the local customs.

After having a fight one night over a general saying that Terry should be proud he may have a son to die for the [[Hirohito|Emperor]], and Gwen speaking out about his distasteful comment, they make up and she reveals that she was so offended by the comment because she is pregnant. The baby daughter is named Mako.

By November 1941 Terry has been reassigned to the Embassy in America. They have [[Thanksgiving]] dinner in Washington with Aunt Peggy, as [[World War II]] embroils the world around them and America is one of the few powers of the world still at peace. Terry speaks on the phone with his friend Haro. He mentions that Mako, now about 5 years old, has an apparent illness involving too many antibodies in her blood. He also mentions a possible upcoming invasion of Thailand by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].

Sensing that it may be the last chance for peace between America and the Empire of Japan, Terry attempts to go over the heads of his superiors and have a cable sent directly to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]], alerting him to cable the Emperor to seek to preserve the peace. However, the Emperor is rapidly becoming the leader of Japan in name only, because of a power struggle with the army leaders. Terry's effort is in vain as [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|December 7th]] comes and war is declared shortly after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack]].

Terry calls Gwen after hearing of the attack and tells her to leave Washington for Tennessee with Mako, but the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] enter and force her to hang up the phone. She decides to accompany Terry back to Japan, as he is due to be deported in an Ambassador exchange, and there is nearly a riot as she leaves with the other Japanese families, because of anti-Japanese fervor sweeping the nation in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, [[The Philippines]], and other European and American held colonies and bases in the Pacific and Asia.

In Japan, a similar nationalist, anti-American hatred, is shown among the citizens. Terry, however, is less enthusiastic about the war, and attempts to be a mediator for peace, which is dangerous due to sentiment and secret police. Gwen is briefly accosted by a group of soldiers, who try and force her to walk on an American flag. She refuses and an air raid begins, causing panic in the streets as bombs begin to destroy the area. She sees a crying child and remembering her daughter, runs to the smoldering school to rescue Mako, who says that children had hit her and called her an American.

Later, Terry reveals that he is under suspicion for being disloyal, because he has an American wife, does not belong to any patriotic clubs, and speaks out against the war. Soldiers enter and search the house, and while they don't arrest him, it is clear that he and his family are going to have a rough time as long as they stay in Tokyo. They agree to stay at a friend's empty house outside of the city.

As they leave Tokyo, they run into Terry's cousin, Ishi, who has been one of the few people who has been kind to Gwen. Now a soldier, he informs them that he is captain in a [[Kamikaze]] squadron, and will soon "die for a descendent of the sun-god". While taking a train, Gwen sees [[Prisoners of War#Empire of Japan|captured American soldiers]], possibly on a death march. They arrive at their new home and meet the young girl who lives there. Terry reveals that he is going back to Tokyo, and didn't tell her earlier because she would not have gone to stay without him. He offers to arrange her passage back to America, but she refuses, wanting to be close to her husband.

As the war continues, food shortages and widespread damage make it clear that things are going against Japan. As the years go on, Terry visits less and less, and Mako grows not knowing any other existence besides one of perpetual war. Terry returns after months and they enjoy a night's sleep together. They awaken to a visit from a military police officer, who is looking for Terry. As the war continues to turn against them, they begin to suspect disloyalty from anyone critical of the government. Gwen manages to convince them that she has not seen Terry, and they leave. Terry reveals that he has brought a radio, and an American news station announces the end of the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], which will be used as a base to launch bombers against mainland Japan. Later on, the surrender of [[Nazi Germany]], Japan's main ally, is also announced, and it is clear that the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]] is coming soon.

Terry and Gwen have a fight one night because he gave away the last of their food. Gwen goes to the village to get her hair done to please her husband and on her way home she allows Mako to play in the village but then a squadron of American bombers and fighters attack. The couple rush to find her, and amid the devastation of the village, they find Mako, alive and unhurt.  Her close friend, however, has been hit and died instantly. At the burial, Gwen comments on Mako's jaded reaction, showing no tears or emotion for her friend, because of Japanese customs, as well as growing up during a war.

One night Gwen visits Terry's old friend Hara, who has some power within the party, pleading for him to keep her husband safe. He introduces her to [[Tokyo Rose]], a radio [[propaganda]] announcer who tries to hurt the moral of enemy armies listening to her broadcasts. They agree to help Terry, but only if Gwen makes an anti-American speech on the radio, recognizing the propaganda value of an actual American denouncing her country. Gwen refuses, and learns that Ishi has been fatally injured and is in the hospital. She visits, and realizing he is dying asks why he sent his wife away at this time. He reveals that it is tradition that he not want his loved ones to see him die. She returns home in time to see Terry, who had been hiding in the hills to avoid arrest, return.

The next day, the entire village arrives at their house, being the only one with a radio, for the Emperor's radio address. The Emperor has never spoken in public before, so they realize he must have major news, possibly surrender. As the village listens to the Emperor's voice for the first time, the speech starts:

{{quote|We are fully aware of the inner-most feelings of all of you, however, have resolved to pave the way for peace for all generations to come. By enduring the unendurable, and suffering what is insufferable, let the entire nation unite as one family, from generation to generation, and cultivate the ways of rectitude and nobility of spirit.}}

With the war over, Terry asks Gwen to return to her home of Johnson City, Tennessee, to put Mako in an American school while she is young and can lose her prejudices against America, to "become a bridge between the two nations". At that time Gwen vehemently refuses to leave him. Later on, she finds Terry, who has been overworked, malnourished, and ill for many months, standing over his parents' graves.  She recalls a speech he once gave her about visiting the graves of ancestors at times of marriage, birth and death. She also recalls the conversation with Ishi at the hospital before his death when he said he didn't want his wife to see him die. She speaks to Terry's doctor and learns that he has at most, months to live, and was trying to send his family away because, like his cousin, he didn't want them to see him die.

Days later, after Gwen agrees to his final wish to leave for America, Terry sees her and Mako off at the dock. They kiss and embrace for the last time, and Gwen reassures him that they'll be expecting him soon, knowing she will never see him again. She holds her composure until he is out of sight, then breaks down and begins crying.

As the ship departs, Terry walks down the dock, keeping pace with it until he can go no farther. The film ends with Gwen and Terry lovingly meeting each other's gaze for a final time.

==Historical Accuracy==
The memoir narrates the life of Gwen Harold (an American from [[Tennessee]] (1906&amp;ndash;1990)), who in 1931 married Hidenari "Terry" Terasaki (b.1900), a Japanese diplomat. He was [[Diplomatic rank|First Secretary]] at the Japanese Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1941 when [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor was bombed]], was one of the staff who helped [[translate]] the Japanese [[declaration of war]] and delivered it (late) to the [[U.S. government]] and (Mrs. Terasaki wrote in her memoirs) earlier sent secret messages to Japanese pacifists seeking to avert war. The couple and their daughter Mariko were like all Axis diplomats interned in 1942 and repatriated via neutral Angola later that year. Terasaki held various posts in the Japanese Foreign Affairs department up to 1945 when he became an advisor to the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], and was the official liaison between the Palace and General [[Douglas MacArthur]], the [[Supreme Allied Commander]].

Mariko and her mother left Japan in 1949 so Mariko could attend college in Tennessee. Terry died in 1951 in Japan; he was 50 years old.

During the scene in which the Japanese Ambassador to America tries to persuade Gwen to call off the marriage, he seems to hint at a possible conflict between the two countries.  It is unlikely that he was aware of any definitive war aims, however, as being 1935, Japan was still at peace with China. Soon after, they would declare war and, in protest to their actions, the United States would issue an oil embargo against Japan, escalating the disagreement between the two and paving the way for war.

The speech that Hirohito gives on the radio at the end of the film is a part of the actual recording of the speech that was played to announce plans of surrender. Terry's translation for Gwen, however, is actually only bits and pieces of the much longer speech, even though it sounds as though he is translating it word for word.

'''''Carpool''''' is a web series presented by English actor and comedian [[Robert Llewellyn]]. In each episode he interviews a guest while giving them a lift in an eco-friendly car (normally a [[Toyota Prius]] [[hybrid electric vehicle]]). The guests are often well-known British television personalities such as [[Jonathan Ross]] or [[Ade Edmondson]]. However, Llewellyn also interviews less-well-known figures as long as he feels that they will prove to be an interesting subject. The guests also included Llewellyn's fellow ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' actors, [[Danny John Jules]], [[Craig Charles]], [[Chris Barrie]] and [[Hattie Hayridge]] (as well as [[Tony Hawks]], [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]] and [[Ruby Wax]] who all appeared in cameo roles in ''Red Dwarf'', while [[Ed Bye]], the show's producer/director, was the first person interviewed for the series). Llewellyn has also reunited with his ''[[Scrapheap Challenge]]'' co-hosts, [[Cathy Rogers]] and [[Lisa Rogers]] for interviews.

The show was filmed using small cameras mounted within the car. Llewellyn drives his guest to a destination of their choosing as they talk informally about a variety of subjects. As Llewellyn is driving for the majority of the time, it can be difficult to deal with technical problems especially interference from mobile phones. Occasionally, as in the Lisa Rogers episode, outside events such as being stopped by police interrupt the discussions.

The [[Carpool (TV series)|TV show]], based on the web format, has been developed by RDF. Funded and sponsored by Toyota, Carpool was first broadcast on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] on 4 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''' Tyneside Songs ''' (or to give it its full title "Tyneside Songs Volume (here the number is stated) with pianoforte accompaniment – by C. E. Catcheside-Warrington – Copyright – (published by) J. G. Windows Ltd., Central Arcade, [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] – Printed in England") is a [[Chapbook]] of [[Geordie]] [[folk song]]s consisting of four volumes, first published 1912 and 1913. As it stated on the cover, the publications were compiled and edited by [[Charles Ernest Catcheside-Warrington]].

The books cost initially 2/= (Two [[Shilling]]s). A further reprint was carried out in 1927, when a price of 3/= (Three Shillings) was printed on the front of the book. Many of this reprint had a red star shaped sticker placed on the front showing that the selling price was in fact 3/6 (Three Shillings and Six Pence). A further reprint was done in the middle 1950s. The later editions were renamed "Album of Tyneside Songs with pianoforte accompaniment".

This collection is important as the songs are all important traditional standards and that they are arranged in the "parlor" performance style representing the classic tradition as opposed to "music hall"

== The publication ==
[[Charles Ernest Catcheside-Warrington]].edited the four volumes of "Tyneside Songs", a series of small booklets each of around 26 pages long, containing mainly well-known songs, by well-known [[Tyneside]] composers.

The contents of these volumes now have a great historical value in that we are able to learn of the types of music popular at (and sometimes, many years before) the time of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=C.

The '''Cinekid Festival''' is the largest international film, television and new media festival for children aged 4 to 14 held at the [[Westergasfabriek]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. It started as a small children's [[film festival]] and has now grown into a large organisation that develops activities for children in the areas of film, television and new media throughout the year. These activities are presented alongside the festival, whereas the festival itself screens films from all over the world and a selection of the best television programs for children. It also organises several new media activities. Each year the festival is attended by over 50,000 children, parents and (international) guests.

==Cinekid Foundation==

The [[Cinekid Foundation]] is the organisation behind the festival and accompanying activities. The foundation's goal is to improve the quality of [[visual culture]] for children as well as to stimulate children's active and creative participation in the media in order to strengthen their position in relation to the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinekid.nl/cinekid/foundation Cinekid | Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve these goals, Cinekid's core activities include: 

'''1. Festival'''
The Cinekid Film, Television and New Media Festival is the main event each year. It is preceded by a series of school screenings throughout Amsterdam and a satellite program held in 30 cities throughout the Netherlands: Cinekid On Location.

'''2. Cinekid for Professionals'''
The Cinekid for Professionals Conference is a new addition to Cinekid's activities. The conference has a seminar program and co-production markets where media professionals can view a selection of children's films and television programs. 

'''3. Development and renewal'''
Cinekid focuses on development of the [[intercultural]] field defined as Child and Media. This is a central element in Cinekid's core activities and includes trainings, test, knowledge, development and innovation programs.

==Media Literacy==

Cinekid focuses on media education through broad culture participation. Children from all layers of society are allowed festival participation through leading discussions, voting, creating media productions, talking to industry representatives and (child) actors, joining workshops etc. In order to introduce diverse quality media productions, passive participation included, Cinekid aims to stimulate less accessible genres like child [[documentaries]] and cultural [[interactive]] media as well.

A tool for this is Cinekid Studio, an interactive environment which allows children to create their own media productions throughout the year. The goal is to improve media consciousness in a playful way. Cinekid Studio is part of the media literacy program that Cinekid offers.

The [[Cinekid Klappers]] is a children's film canon, an international list of around one hundred films that are considered essential. The list has been compiled by a broad commission of experts and consists of high quality contemporary and older films, for different age groups and with several themes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinema.nl/cinekidklappers/ Cinema.nl | Welkom bij de CinekidKlappers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Finnish cinema''' has a long history, with the first public screenings starting almost as early as modern motion picture technology was invented (the first screening in the world was in 1895, in Finland in 1896). It took over a decade before the first Finnish film was produced and screened in 1907. After these first steps of Finnish cinema, the progress was very slow. After 1907 there were two periods (1909–1911 and 1917–1918) when no Finnish films were produced. This was partly caused by the political situation, as Finland held a status as an [[Grand Duchy of Finland|autonomous]] part of [[Russia]] and was thus influenced by the worldwide political situation.

In 1917 Finland became an independent country and in 1918 there was a [[Finnish civil war|civil war]]. After the political situation had settled and stabilized, Finnish society and its cultural life began to develop. This was very clear with cinematic arts. More films were produced and they became an important part of Finnish society. The culmination of this development came soon after the silent era, around the 1940s and 1950s, when three major studios were producing films and competing for the market. When society changed in the 1960s, partly because of political trends and partly because of new forms of entertainment, like [[television]], the appeal of films was threatened, practically all studios were closed, and films became political and too artistic for the masses, as commercial production was considered a thing of the past and distasteful. Few filmmakers were opposed to this development, and kept producing popular films that were bashed by the critics but loved by the people.

A revival in Finnish cinema came in the 1990s, which was partly influenced by the new generation of filmmakers bringing in new ideas, and partly because commercial success was no longer considered to be "non-artistic," thus commercial film projects started to receive support from governmental funds. In the 2000s the Finnish cinema is alive and well, with some films and filmmakers gaining global success and many films receiving a good response from audiences and critics. Today, around 15–20 Finnish full-length feature films are produced every year, and the Finnish cinema is gaining new forms from global influence, such as [[action film|action]] and [[wuxia]].

The majority of Finnish movie theaters are owned by the company [[Finnkino]].

==History==

===1896–1920: Before Independence===
The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière]] company screened the first moving images at Helsinki in 1896, but it wasn't until 1904 that the first films were actually filmed in Finland. It is unknown who made the first film (called ''Novelty from Helsinki: School youth at break''), but it was shown by [[American Bioscope]] in December. The first Finnish film company, [[Atelier Apollo]], was founded in 1906 by engineer [[K. E. Ståhlberg]]. It produced mainly documentary shorts, but also the first Finnish feature film, ''The Moonshiners'' (1907). From the very beginning, Finnish film production was centered to the country's capital, although for few years starting from 1907 there was a noteworthy company [[Oy Maat ja Kansat]] producing short documentaries in [[Tampere]].

''The Moonshiners'' was directed by [[Teuvo Puro]], who was also in charge of directing the first full-length Finnish feature, ''Sylvi'', based on a play by [[Minna Canth]]. The film was shot in 1911 with two other full-length literature adaptations, but it didn't premiere until 1913. The filmmakers didn't have enough money to send films to the nearest laboratory in Copenhagen at once, so the material remained undeveloped too long, and two out of three films were ruined.

The years following ''Sylvi'' saw the formation of the first active feature film company, [[Hjalmar V. Pohjanheimo|Hjalmar V. Pohjanheimo's]] Lyyra-Filmi, which produced both short farces and "art films". There was also an attempt to create larger-scale film production by [[Erik Estlander]], who build a studio with glass walls and roof in Helsinki in 1916. At the end of the same year the Russian officials forbid all filming activity in Finland, so nothing much was made anymore before the country's independence in 1917.

The Finnish film industry of the first two decades of the 20th century was never even near the creativity or the productiveness of its Scandinavian neighbours, Sweden and Denmark – one might even say that it there was barely no industry or production at all. In addition, most of the footage filmed before independence is lost. Of feature films, only thirteen minutes of ''Sylvi'' still remains.

===1920–1930: The Silent Years===
[[Image:Erkki karu.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Erkki Karu]], founder of [[Suomi-Filmi]] and [[Suomen Filmiteollisuus]]]]

====Suomi-Filmi====
It wasn't until the 1920s before regular film production started, thanks to a successful company called [[Suomi-Filmi]] (founded under the name Suomen Filmikuvaamo in 1919) and its creative leader [[Erkki Karu]]. He also directed the most important films of the era and was the prime figure of Finnish cinema before his early death in 1935. His ''The Village Shoemakers'' (1923) is the essential silent masterpiece, a freshly told folk comedy after [[Aleksis Kivi]]'s play with mildly experimental camerawork by German [[Kurt Jäger]]. Other notable films by Karu include: ''The Logroller's Bride'' (1923), with superb cinematography by Jäger and [[Oscar Lindelöf]], and also the first Finnish film distributed widely abroad; ''When Father Has Toothache'' (1923), a short and surrealistic farce; and ''Our Boys'' (1929), a patriotisic forerunner of many military farces.

Audiences of the agricultural country were affected by Suomi-Filmi's rural subjects. Dealing with deeply national countryside stories remained as company's policy through the silent era. Occasionally there were some attempts to make more urban, or more "European" films like Karu's ''Summery Fairytale'' (1925), but the public stayed away.

Another important director at Suomi-Filmi was the aforementioned Puro, who made the company's first feature ''Olli's Years of Apprenticeship''(1920) and one of the few Finnish horror films, ''Evil Spells'' (1927). An interesting oddity of the last two silent years was [[Carl von Haartman]], a soldier and an adventurer, who had worked as a military advisor in Hollywood. Because of this he was considered capable of directing films. His two upper-class spy dramas, ''The Supreme Victory'' (1929) and ''Mirage'' (1930), were quite passable, but didn't attract the public.

====Other companies====
Suomi-Filmi heavily dominated the Finnish film production in the 1920s. The company produced 23 out of 37 full-length feature films made between 1919-1930. Other companies (that appeared occasionally) seemed to vanish from Suomi-Filmi's and [[Erkki Karu]]'s way after producing one or two films. The most important of these alternative production companies appeared during the latter half of the decade.

The German cinematographer Jäger left Suomi-Filmi, and formed his own company [[Komedia-Filmi]]. It linked with a global film trust (Ufanamet), which at the time possessed most of the film distribution of Finland, thus being a great threat to Suomi-Filmi. Suomi-Filmi defended itself with national values, accusing Komedia-Filmi and Ufanamet for being foreign invaders. Luckily for Suomi-Filmi, both companies proved to be unsuccessful. Komedia-Filmi only made two films, of which the latter one, ''On the Highway of Life'' (1927, directed by Jäger and [[Ragnar Hartwall]]) is an interesting attempt to make some kind of a modern comedy.

The year 1929 saw the premiere of the first two films produced by a minor company [[Fennica]] and directed by [[Valentin Vaala]], who was yet to come one of the greatest directors of the golden years of Finnish cinema. When he started making the first one of these (''Dark Eyes'') he was only 17 years old, and his leading actor Theodor Tugai (later [[Teuvo Tulio]]) 14 years old. This film and its instant remake ''The Gypsy Charmer'' were new kind, passionate dramas with clearly oriental influences. Unfortunately only the latter one has remained; the filmmakers destroyed the only negative of ''Dark Eyes'' by throwing it to the sea, because they thought the remake was far superior.

There were also enterprises to produce films outside the capital, but at least the films made in Viipuri and Oulu were too primitive to even premiere at Helsinki. ''No Tears at the Fair'' (1927) and ''The Man of Snowbound Forests'' (1928), two now lost films produced in Tampere by [[Aquila-Suomi]] and directed by [[Uuno Eskola]] were better attemptsl, at least according to their contemporaries. Nothing permanent production was left in Tampere, but one of Aquila's producers, painter [[Kalle Kaarna]], proved to be a gifted director in his own right. His first film ''With the Blade of a Sword'' (1928) was boldly advertised as a neutral story about the painful civil war of 1918, and his second film, ''A Song about the Heroism of Labour'' (1929) introduced (although quite conventionally) a new kind of proletarian hero to the public. Unfortunately these films have also vanished for good.

===1931–1933: The Coming of Sound===

[[File:Teuvo Tulio.jpg|thumb|[[Teuvo Tulio]], a Finnish film director in the 1930s.]]

The first experiments with sound were done by [[Lahyn-Filmi]], a provincial company operating in Turku. The first full-length sound film with song and talk was Lahyn's ''Say It in Finnish'' (1931), directed by company's leader Yrjö Nyberg (later [[Norta]]). This lost film was more a collection of musical revue numbers than a feature.

Suomi-Filmi transformed its production from silent to sound films during the same year. The first Finnish film with soundtrack was the company's ''Dressed Like Adam and a Bit Like Eve Too'' (1931), based on a popular play by Agapetus (pseudonym of [[Yrjö Soini]]). There was only music and some sound effects on the soundtrack, so the company's first true sound film was Karu's ''The Lumberjack's Bride'' (1931), another rural drama.

===1934–1939: The Golden Age===

====The studio system====
In 1933 Karu was kicked out from Suomi-Filmi, his own company. He took his revenge by founding a new one called [[Suomen Filmiteollisuus]], which started to use initials SF in its logo. This company managed far better than previous attempts to compete with Suomi-Filmi, and right after couple successful comedies directed by Karu it had grown as significant as its rival. It seemed at this point to be possible only for Karu to create successful production companies in Finland.

The competition between the two companies proved to be fruitful. At the end of the decade there were about twenty full-length features made every year. The quality of the productions was high, the field of the subjects expanding and the popularity of domestic films increasing. With its own stars and creative producers, Finnish film industry began to remind a national miniature of Hollywood. Alongside with the two big studios, some minor ones did well also.

Sound had increased the public's eagerness to see domestic films. The great breakthrough for Finnish talkies came with ''The Foreman of Siltala Farm'' (1934), a well-recorded comedy by Suomi-Filmi, that was seen by over 900 000 viewers.

====Suomi-Filmi====
[[Erkki Karu]] was instantly replaced with [[Risto Orko]] as the head of company, a place he held until the 1990s (although this was long after the company had stopped movie-making). Orko had directed ''The Foreman of Siltala Farm'', and he returned to directing a few times since, most notably with two historical and patriotic dramas at the end of the decade: ''Soldier's Bride'' (1938) and ''Activists'' (1939). Most of his films as a director remain forgettable.

The most important director at Suomi-Filmi was [[Valentin Vaala]], who had a stunningly creative period at the end of the 1930s. After the silent years, [[Vaala]] had directed three more films for his first company Fennica. When he started the fourth, the company went broke. Now he moved to Suomi-Filmi, and although his first movie there (''Everybody's Love'', 1935) was quite a modest comedy, it was very popular, and most importantly, introduced two of the most beloved Finnish stars to the public: [[Ansa Ikonen]] and [[Tauno Palo]].

[[Vaala]]'s last Fennica-films had been urban comedies, a genre which he greatly developed at his new studio with his next two light-weighted films, ''Substitute Wife'' and ''Substitute Man'' (both 1936) . ''Hulda of Juurakko'' (1937) was far more serious attempt in the same field: a socially conscious story about a country girl who arrives to the big city, and who inevitably faces the problems of inequality between sexes. The film and its subject were greeted with huge enthusiasm by the audiences.

[[Vaala]] was also a master within the rural subjects and romantic melodramas. In 1938 he made the first and best film in the series of agrarian family saga of [[Niskavuori]] (''Women of Niskavuori'').

====SF====
After his early death in 1935, Karu was replaced by [[Toivo Särkkä]] in the head of the company. [[Särkkä]] led SF until its bankruptcy in 1965. [[Särkkä]] was the most prolific producer and director that Finnish film has ever seen: he has way over 200 feature productions in his filmography, of which he directed 51. With [[Yrjö Norta]], he directed most of the company's films in the 1930s, including religious drama ''As Dream and Shadow...'' (1937) and patriotic historical film ''Manifest in February'' (1939). [[Särkkä]]'s and [[Norta]]'s output includes some highly popular folk comedies like ''Lapatossu'' (1937) - with beloved comedy actor [[Aku Korhonen]] - and ''The Regiment's Trouble Boy'' (1938), the model of Finnish military farce genre.

====Other companies====
Along with Suomi-Filmi and SF, few minor companies were able to produce many films during the golden age. With [[Vaala]]'s films, these sort of local "poverty row" productions are the most fascinating films made during the 1930s.

==The New Wave from 1960 to 1980==

A new generation of film-makers were eager to take over as the old production companies, such as Suomi-Filmi and SF, were collapsing. [[Risto Jarva]] was inspired by the French [[avant-garde]] and new wave, which developed to [[social realism]] seen in ''[[Työmiehen päiväkirja]]'' (1967), and eventually to comedies ''[[Loma (1976 film)|Loma]]'' (1976) and ''[[Jäniksen vuosi]]'' (1977). [[Mikko Niskanen]] began his career back in 1962 with ''[[The Boys (1962 Finnish film)|Pojat]]'', starring then unknown [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]]. Niskanen joined the new wave with ''[[Käpy selän alla]]'' (1966) and ''[[Lapualaismorsian]]'' (1967). The 1960s also marked the rise of new style of Finnish comedy films under [[Pertti Pasanen]], such as [[X-Paroni]], [[Noin 7 Veljestä]] and [[Näköradiomiehen Ihmeelliset Siekailut]]. [[Rauni Mollberg]] adapted two of [[Timo K. Mukka]]'s ''magically realistic'' [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] novels to the big screen: ''[[Maa on syntinen laulu]]'' (1973) and ''[[Milka – A Film About Taboos|Milka]]'' (1983).

==Kaurismäki Era of the 1980s==

The old guard of the previous film-making generation was symbolically thrown from the throne in the beginning of 1980 by a Finnish-Soviet co-production, ''Tulitikkuja lainaamassa'', followed by Tapio Suominen's ''Täältä tullaan, elämä!''. Edvin Laine and Mikko Niskanen made their last movies, and the decade saw nearly 30 directorial debuts, including movies from [[Mika Kaurismäki|Mika]] &amp; [[Aki Kaurismäki]], [[Markku Lehmuskallio]], [[Pirjo Honkasalo]], Taavi Kassila, [[Janne Kuusi]], Matti Kuortti, [[Matti Ijäs]], Olli Soinio, [[Lauri Törhönen]], Claes Olsson, [[Veikko Aaltonen]], and [[Pekka Parikka]].

''Valehtelija'' (1981) and ''[[Arvottomat]]'' (1982), directed by Mika and written by Aki Kaurismäki, broke the status quo in Finnish film industry by bringing back creativity and small scale production. Mika went to pursue a more traditional way of film making in his career with ''Klaani'' (1984), ''Rosso'' (1985), and ''[[Helsinki Napoli All Night Long]]'' (1987). Aki has taken less deviations in style and theme, and his films are known for minimalistic non-verbal communication and dead-pan delivery of dialogs. While Aki is best known for the [[Finland|Suomi]]-trilogy ''[[Kauas pilvet karkaavat]]'' (1996), ''[[Mies vailla menneisyyttä]]'' (2002), and ''[[Laitakaupungin valot]]'' (2006), his work also includes comedy such as ''[[Leningrad Cowboys Go America]]'' (1989).

==From the 1990s to present==

[[File:Sara Melleri.jpg|thumb|Sara Melleri, a Finnish actress.]]

The beginning of the 1990s did not look too good to the film industry, because the national economy was on a strong decline. Film financing was not a priority to the government-backed [[Finnish Film Foundation]], which is responsible for the majority of movie financing in Finland. Fortunately the situation would flip completely upside down by 1999, when nearly 30 domestic movies premiered. ''Poika ja ilves'', ''[[Häjyt]]'', and ''[[Kulkuri ja joutsen]]'' enjoyed over 200 000 viewers each, and helped to bring the popularity of domestic movies back to where it was a decade earlier.

Prolific directors introduced in the 1990s include [[Markku Pölönen]], [[Auli Mantila]], and [[Jarmo Lampela]]. A few popular genres can be identified from the last two decades. ''[[Rukajärven tie]]'', ''Pikkusisar'', and ''Hylätyt talot, autiot pihat'' take place during World War II. ''[[Kulkuri ja joutsen]]'' (1999), ''Badding'' (2000), ''[[Rentun Ruusu]]'' (2001), ''[[Sibelius (film)|Sibelius]]'' (2003), and ''[[Aleksis Kiven elämä]]'' (2002) portray the life of popular public figures in Finland.

2005 saw the release of [[amateur film|amateur]] [[science fiction]] [[parody film]] [[Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning]], which was released online as a free download. The film has been downloaded over 9 million times and is internationally the most viewed Finnish film.

In 2011, Finland produced 31 films, 24 of which were full-length features and the other seven were documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1908215017 |page= 114 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 5 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the three most watched films in Finland were all Finnish family films: ''[[Ricky Rapper]] and The Nighthawk 2016'', ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]'', and ''[[Kanelia kainaloon, Tatu ja Patu!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ses.fi/ajankohtaista/ajankohtainen/?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=229&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1325&amp;cHash=e06693df521c99b5e09886ec0c157eaf |title=Vuoden 2016 kolme katsotuinta elokuvateatterielokuvaa olivat kaikki kotimaisia koko perheen elokuvia |website= |publisher=The Finnish Film Foundation |access-date=15 January 2017 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">'''Eastmancolor''' is a trade name used by Eastman Kodak for a number of related film and processing technologies associated with color motion picture production.

Eastmancolor, introduced in 1950, was one of the first widely successful "single-strip colour" processes, and eventually displaced the more cumbersome [[Technicolor]]. Eastmancolor was known by a variety of names such as ''Deluxe color'' ([[20th Century Fox]]), Warnercolor, Metrocolor, Pathecolor and Columbiacolor, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nfsa.gov.au/site_media/uploads/file/2010/09/09/NFSAJournal-Vol3-Nos2_3.pdf |format=PDF |title=NFSA Journal |volume=3 |date=2008 |publisher=Nfsa.gov |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lev.

==Examples of films that use Eastmancolor==
{{undue|date=September 2015}}
The 1959 British satirical comedy film ''[[The Mouse That Roared (film)]]'' was filmed using the Eastmancolor process. 

Eastmancolor became very popular in the [[South Indian film industry]] during early 60's.

'''''Fallout Online''''' was a [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMO) set in the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' universe that was being developed by [[Masthead Studios]] and was to be published by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]], with members of the Interplay team providing creative control and design. [[Christopher Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]] and Mark O'Green, two of the creators of the original ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'', were among the developers; [[Jason Anderson (artist)|Jason Anderson]], one of the other makers of ''Fallout'', was involved in the project between 2007 and 2009, but then left the team. Interplay's rights to develop and publish this game have been the subject of legal disputes between Interplay and [[Bethesda Softworks]], the current owner of the ''Fallout'' franchise. An out-of-court settlement was reached in 2012 as Bethesda received full rights to the ''Fallout'' online game for two million dollars, eventually releasing its own online game, ''[[Fallout 76]]'', six years later.

According to Interplay, they had created a large and multi-part "game-worldwide meta-puzzle". This meta-puzzle includes the puzzle structure, code system, and planned locations, which is designed to foster cooperation and competition among players for an extended time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.duckandcover.cx/#10286|title=Fallout Online Gameplay|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interplay claimed it had mapped out approximately {{convert|65,500|sqmi|km2}} of terrain which had textures, with objects and characters implemented into it. Several game zones had been blocked out with textured and populated 3D objects. The initial starting zones for each player character race have also been designed, making it so that each character of a different race has a different story to start with. Computer models for many types of creatures had been designed and the 3D geometry and textures created and some NPCs have been created to live in the game. ''Fallout Online'' combat, leveling, character development, item crafting, skills have been written and tested. Interplay has revealed that it has created player-run towns (towns controlled by players), guild centers and social centers for players to interact in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.duckandcover.cx/#10286|title=Setting of Fallout Online|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black Isle Studios ===
According to [[Feargus Urquhart]], when [[Brian Fargo]] was still the president of Interplay, Fargo proposed a possible ''Fallout'' MMO to be made by [[Black Isle Studios|Black Isle]], but Urquhart refused, saying, "The reason at the time, because I would have loved to have made a ''Fallout'' MMO, was that I believed that Interplay was just not in a situation where they had the resources to do it. When you go off to do an MMO it's going to cost $100 million before you get it on the shelf; you've gotta buy servers and you've gotta have service people, and you have to have Game Masters. It's an undertaking, and on top of that, it means that you do have to do all that stuff so what else are you going to focus on? What other games are you going to be able to make?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Neverwinter Nights 2 Q&amp;A Feature|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/NeverWinter-Nights-2/feature-9221.html|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interplay&amp;nbsp;— Masthead Project ===
In November 2006, Interplay, headed by Herve Caen, filed a Form 8-K filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding a potential ''Fallout'' massively multiplayer online game. In April 2007, Bethesda Softworks, the developer of ''Fallout 3'', purchased full rights to the ''Fallout'' IP for US$5.75 million. While Bethesda now owned the rights to the ''Fallout'' MMO IP as well, clauses in the purchase agreement allowed Interplay to license the rights to the development of the MMO. Specific requirements were stated in the agreement that if not met, Interplay would immediately lose and surrender its license rights for ''Fallout''. Development must have begun within 24 months of the date of the agreement (April 4, 2007), and Interplay must have secured $30 million within that time frame or forfeit its rights to license. Interplay would furthermore need to launch the MMOG within four years of the beginning of development, and pay Bethesda 12 percent of sales and subscription fees for the use of the IP.

On August 1, 2007, [[ZeniMax Media]] Inc., parent company of Bethesda Softworks, announced the creation of ZeniMax Online Studios. The division would be headed by Matt Firor, a well-known expert in the field of online gaming, and would focus on the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) market segment. It might work on a ''Fallout'' MMO in the future, if Interplay fails to gather enough money for their ''Fallout Online'' project.

In November 2007, Interplay reopened in-house development and hired ''Fallout'' developer Jason D. Anderson as creative director for an unannounced MMO. Given the aforementioned facts, it is most likely that the game Anderson was working on is Interplay's ''Fallout'' MMO, given that he was the contact name of Interplay's jobs appliance and that ''Fallout'' was referred in the job requirements. In March 2009, Anderson left Interplay and joined [[InXile Entertainment]].

On June 30, 2008, it was announced that Interactive Game Group, LLC (created by Frederic Chesnais, former CEO of [[Atari]], which now also owns [[MicroProse]]) purchased 2,000,000 shares of Interplay stock, as consideration for entering into a game production agreement, likely related to ''Fallout Online''.

On April 2, 2009 Interplay announced a binding letter of intent with [[Masthead Studios]], a Bulgarian-based developer, to fund the development of ''Project V13''. Masthead and Interplay teams would work together under the direction and control of Interplay to complete development of the project. On June 15, 2010, the game was officially announced as ''Fallout Online''. The game was planned to be co-developed between Interplay and Masthead Studios, and to use Masthead's Earthrise Engine, used on Masthead's first game, ''[[Earthrise (video game)|Earthrise]]''.

=== Legal dispute and cancellation ===
On April 15, 2009, Bethesda Softworks announced a move to rescind the ''Fallout'' MMO license. Interplay received notice from Bethesda that it intended to terminate the trademark license agreement, claiming that Interplay was in breach of the agreement for failure to commence full scale development by April 4, 2009 and to secure certain funding for the game. Interplay disputed these claims. On July 15, 2009, "Project V13" developer Chris Taylor posted a reply on the Interplay website "Project V13" Forum thread refuting the claims that Interplay lost the rights to the ''Fallout'' MMO.

On September 8, 2009 Bethesda filed a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit against Interplay in the Maryland District Court. Bethesda claimed that Interplay had only licensed the ''Fallout'' name to use for their game and could not use any of its assets. Interplay counteracted this claim by stating that they did not license the name to make an online poker game titled ''Fallout''. They stated that what Bethesda was claiming was comparable to having a ''[[Snow White]]'' movie and the princess not appearing in it at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.falloutwiki.com/Blog:News/Bethesda_vs._Interplay_court_transcripts:_Snow_White,_Donald_Duck_and_hair_falling_out|title=Fallout Online comparable to Snow White and Daffy Duck|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interplay further stated that if Bethesda refuses to let them complete ''Fallout Online'', then they will be able to release only one more ''Fallout'' IP with its DLCs before the rights revert to Interplay, a notion that will give Interplay the full rights to ''Fallout Online'' and the rest of the ''Fallout'' series. Interplay won the injunction resulting in Bethesda calling for an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.falloutwiki.com/Blog:News/Bethesda_vs._Interplay_court_transcripts:_Snow_White,_Donald_Duck_and_hair_falling_out|title=The Sixth Fallout IP could be Interplays|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then revealed that prior to April 9, 2009 that Interplay had employed game designers, writers, and artists who had substantially completed the ''Fallout Online'' game design, including an online [[wiki]] dedicated to the game's development, which when printed and produced to Bethesda's counsel as it existed on April 4, 2009 consisted of nearly 2,200 pages. Prior to April 4, 2009, Interplay had created substantial concept art, solidified its technology plan by licensing a game engine and development tools set from Masthead Studios that would have cost Interplay millions of dollars to develop from scratch. A playable game space also existed, based on Interplay's concept art and developed by Masthead and multiple users from Europe and the U.S. could log into and interact within the game. For the game, Masthead was tasked with  revising and improving its technology, including its game engine, tools and network software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.duckandcover.cx/#10286|title=More info on the court case|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, 2009 the court denied Bethesda's request for preliminary injunction. Interplay was able to continue development on the project until the case was resolved.

Bethesda then sued Masthead Studios and asked for a preliminary injunction against the company. The Court denied Bethesda's motion before Masthead Studios had even had an opportunity to file a response in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/37428/Bethesda_Denied_Restraining_Order_Against_Fallout_MMO.php|title=Bethesda's Restraining Order Denied|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethesda's attempt to appeal the unfavorable decision was quickly denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/121/1210805p1.html?_|title=Bethesda Denied its Appeal|last=Goldfarb|first=Andrew|date=October 26, 2011|publisher=IGN|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethesda later filed a motion in limine against Interplay in an attempt to suppress evidence that would have supported Interplay at trial, namely that Interplay had satisfied the conditions of the original contract. In response, Interplay filed its own motion in limine the day after in an attempt to prevent Bethesda from producing a formally undisclosed expert witness, who was expected to offer expert testimony regarding the meaning of contract terms contained in the Trademark License Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.duckandcover.cx/forums/viewtopic.php?t=25793|title=Bethesda Files Motion In Limine|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury trial requested by Bethesda was canceled due to the language of the APA contract (contract that sold ''Fallout'' to Bethesda), which stated that all legal disputes could only be resolved by a bench trial, leaving the outcome of the case in the hands of a single judge. It is unknown if this was a simple oversight by Bethesda or something brought to the courts attention by Interplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.duckandcover.cx/forums/viewtopic.php?t=25796|title=Trial By Court Ensued|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per an out of court settlement, ''Fallout Online'' was cancelled. However, Interplay through its Black Isle division continues to work on ''Project V13'' but will remove any and all references to ''Fallout'' to honor the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Interplay Loses Rights to Make a Fallout MMO|url=http://www.1up.com/news/interplay-loses-rights-fallout-mmo|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of legal terming and no previous legal action before Bethesda filed the suit, Interplay was forced to give over all property pertaining to the ''Fallout'' MMO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2012-01-10 |url=http://www.wouldyoukindly.com/falloutip-rights-bethesda-nvultimateedition |title=All Fallout IP Rights Restored to Bethesda &amp; New Vegas Ultimate Edition Announced |publisher=WouldYouKindly.com |date=2012-01-10 |author=Jones, David K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interplay was still able to sell copies of  ''Fallout'', ''[[Fallout 2]]'' and ''[[Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel]]'', but its permission to do so ended on December 31, 2013.&lt;ref name=kotaku&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Fallout Legal Battle Ends Without a Fallout MMO|url=http://kotaku.com/5874561/the-great-fallout-legal-battle-ends-without-a-fallout-mmo|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethesda's own ''Fallout'' MMO game, ''[[Fallout 76]]'', was released in 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7182">{{Music of France}}

'''French electronic music''', a panorama of [[Music of France|French music]] that employs [[electronic musical instrument]]s and [[electronics|electronic]] [[music technology]] in its production.

Notable early French artists and composers in electronic music include [[Maurice Martenot]], the inventor of the [[Ondes Martenot]] in 1928, and [[Pierre Schaeffer]], the developer of the [[musique concrète]] in 1948. Among the famous contemporary artists include [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Air (French band)|Air]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Justice (band)|Justice]] and [[M83 (band)|M83]].

==History==

===Phonautograph (1857)===
{{main article|Phonautograph}}
The earliest known sound recording device was the [[phonautograph]], patented in 1857 by [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosen|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ondes Martenot (1928)===
{{main article|Ondes Martenot}}
In 1928, the [[Ondes Martenot]] was invented by [[Maurice Martenot]], who debuted it in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Composers using the instrument ultimately include [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[André Jolivet|Jolivet]], [[Charles Koechlin|Koechlin]], [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Gilles Tremblay (composer)|Tremblay]], and [[Edgard Varèse|Varèse]]. In 1937, Messiaen wrote ''Fête des belles eaux'' for 6 ondes Martenot, and wrote solo parts for it in ''[[Trois petites Liturgies de la Présence Divine]]'' (1943&amp;ndash;44) and the ''Turangalîla Symphonie'' (1946&amp;ndash;48/90).&lt;/ref&gt; This electronic musical instrument was most famously used in the ''[[Turangalîla-Symphonie]]'' by [[Olivier Messiaen]] as well as other works by him. The Ondes Martenot was also used by other composers such as [[Andre Jolivet]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[Charles Koechlin]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Gilles Tremblay (composer)|Gilles Tremblay]] and [[Edgard Varèse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orton|Davies|n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musique concrète (1948)===
{{main article|Musique concrète}}
In 1942, the French composer and theoretician [[Pierre Schaeffer]], began his exploration of radiophony when he joined Jacques Copeau and his pupils in the foundation of the [[Studio d'Essai]] de la [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|Radiodiffusion Nationale]]. His work laid the foundations of the [[Musique concrète]]. This technique involved editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds.&lt;ref name="lebrecht1"&gt;"Musique Concrete was created in Paris in 1948 from edited collages of everyday noise" ({{harvnb|Lebrecht|1996|p=107}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The first pieces of ''musique concrète'' in Paris were assembled by him, who went on to collaborate with [[Pierre Henry]].

On 5 October 1948, [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|Radiodiffusion Française]] (RDF) broadcast composer [[Pierre Schaeffer]]'s ''Etude aux chemins de fer''. This was the first "[[movement (music)|movement]]" of ''Cinq études de bruits'', and marked the beginning of studio realizations and musique concrète (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disk-cutting [[lathe]], four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, [[Edgard Varèse]], began work on ''[[Déserts]]'', a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio, and were later revised at Columbia University.

In 1950, Schaeffer gave the first public (non-broadcast) concert of musique concrète at the [[Ecole Normale de Musique de Paris]]. "Schaeffer used a [[Public address|PA system]], several turntables, and mixers. Later that same year, Pierre Henry collaborated with Schaeffer on ''Symphonie pour un homme seul'' (1950) the first major work of musique concrete. In Paris in 1951, in what was to become an important worldwide trend, RTF established the first studio for the production of electronic music. Also in 1951, Schaeffer and Henry produced an opera, ''Orpheus'', for concrete sounds and voices.

[[File:Jarre helsinki 2009.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Jean-Michel Jarre]] playing a [[laser harp]] in Helsinki (2009).]]

===I.R.C.A.M. (1975)===
{{main article|IRCAM}}
In 1970, the President of France [[Georges Pompidou]] asked to the composer [[Pierre Boulez]] to found an institution for research in new forms of music. The ''[[Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique]]'' was created under his direction. Since then, IRCAM has been an [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] institute for [[science]] about music, sound and [[Electroacoustic music|electro-acoustical art music]] in [[France]].

===Early electronic and Space Music (1970s)===

In 1969, La cage/Erosmachine is a very early electronic music work by [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] who become worldwide famous with the album Oxygene in 1976. Among other experimental we can cite Igor Wakhevitch with Hathor (1973) and [[François de Roubaix]] for the soundtrack of the [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]]'film Antartique (1974). The space music and [[space disco]]  become popular with [[Space (French band)|Space]], Magic Fly (1977) ; [[Cerrone]], Supernature (1977) ; [[Droïds]], The force (1977)  and Bernard Fevre aka [[Black Devil Disco Club]] (1975-1978). The following one in the late 70's and early 80's were notably Philippe Laurent aka Hot Bip (Industrieuse, 1979) and René Roussel with Caramel (1980).

===French Touch (1990)===
{{main article|French touch}}
Following precursors [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] and [[Cerrone]], many French electronic artists have gained worldwide recognition under the name of "French Touch", especially [[Daft Punk]], [[David Guetta]], [[M83 (band)|M83]], [[Justice (band)|Justice]] and [[Air (French band)|Air]].

Pictures]].&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; It is based on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|1997 novel of the same name]]. The film is the first instalment in the long-running [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] and was written by [[Steve Kloves]] and produced by [[David Heyman]]. Its story follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s first year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his education. The film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], with [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]].

Warner Bros. bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported £1 million ($1.65 million in 1999). Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Chris Columbus being chosen to create the film from a short list of directors that included [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Rob Reiner]]. Rowling insisted that the entire cast be British and Irish, and the film was shot at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]] and historic buildings around the United Kingdom.

The film was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom and United States on 16 November 2001. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $974.8 million at the box office worldwide.

In late 1981, [[Albus Dumbledore]], [[Minerva McGonagall]], and [[Rubeus Hagrid]], professors of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], deliver a recently orphaned infant named [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] to his only remaining relatives, [[the Dursleys]]. Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointed life with the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid any more letters, Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is actually a wizard, and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to [[Diagon Alley]] to buy his supplies for Hogwarts including a wizard uniform, a wand and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid informs him of his past; Harry is the son of two wizards who met their demise via a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]] at the hands of [[Lord Voldemort]], a malevolent, all-powerful wizard. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding world as "The Boy Who Lived".

Harry is then taken to [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] to board a train to the school, where he meets three other students: [[Ron Weasley]], whom he quickly befriends; [[Hermione Granger]], an intelligent witch born to [[muggle]] parents; and [[Draco Malfoy]], a child from a wealthy wizarding family whom he immediately clashes with. After arriving at school, the students assemble in the Great Hall, where Harry and all the other "first-years" are sorted by the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] between four houses: [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], [[Ravenclaw]], and [[Slytherin]]. Although the Sorting Hat considers placing Harry in Slytherin alongside Draco, he is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione.

At Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magic spells and discovers more about his past and his parents. After recovering the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Remembrall|Remembrall]] of clumsy Gryffindor student [[Neville Longbottom]], Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's [[Quidditch]] team as a Seeker, which is extremely rare for first-year students. While exploring the school one night, Harry and his friends discover a [[Cerberus|giant three-headed dog]] named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. Ron insults Hermoine after being embarrassed by her in a charms lesson with [[Professor Flitwick]], causing Hermione to lock herself in the girls' bathroom. She is soon attacked by a troll but Harry and Ron manage to save her, befriending her in the process.

The children later find out Fluffy is guarding the [[Philosopher's Stone]], an object that can be used to grant its owner immortality. Harry suspects that potions teacher and head of Slytherin House [[Severus Snape]] is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. Hagrid accidentally reveals to the trio that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that night to try and find the stone before Snape does, but discover that Fluffy is already asleep. They get past Fluffy and face a series of safeguards. These include surviving a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys which bruises Harry, and a dangerous life-sized game of [[chess]] that nearly kills Ron.

After getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher [[Professor Quirrell]] who was trying to claim the stone, and that Snape was actually protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort to be living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds himself in possession of the stone. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for bringing his parents back from the dead, but Harry refuses, causing Quirrell to attack. Harry kills Quirrell by burning his skin and reducing him to dust, after which Voldemort's spirit rises from Quirrell's ashes and passes through Harry, knocking him unconscious.

Harry wakes up in the school's hospital wing with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville, who had attempted to stop his friends, giving Gryffindor enough points to win the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.

===Development===
In 1997, producer [[David Heyman]] searched for a children's book that could be adapted into a well-received film.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; He had planned to produce [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' novel ''[[The Ogre Downstairs]]'', but his plans fell through.

He took inspiration from [[David Lean]]'s adaptations of ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' (1946) and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1948), wishing to use "that sort of darkness, that sort of edge, that quality to the cinematography,"  while being further inspired by the colour designs from ''[[Oliver!

[[Steve Kloves]] was selected to write the screenplay.

And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted."&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.

Warner Bros. had initially planned to release the film over 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several proposed directors pulled themselves out of the running. Due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034103p1.html |title=Bewitched Warner Bros.

===Filming===

Two British film industry officials requested that the film be shot in the United Kingdom, offering their assistance in securing filming locations, the use of [[Leavesden Film Studios]], as well as changing the UK's child labour laws (adding a small number of working hours per week and making the timing of on-set classes more flexible).&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; Warner Bros. accepted their proposal.

===Design and special effects===
[[Judianna Makovsky]] designed the costumes. She re-designed the Quidditch robes, having initially planned to use those shown on the cover of the American book, but deemed them "a mess." Instead, she dressed the Quidditch players in "preppie sweaters, 19th century fencing breeches and arm guards."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001148-1,00.html |title=The First Look at Harry |accessdate=19 September 2007 |date=5 November 2001 |work=Time |first=Jess |last=Cagle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production designer [[Stuart Craig]] built the sets at Leavesden Studios, including Hogwarts Great Hall, basing it on many English cathedrals. Although originally asked to use an existing old street to film the [[Diagon Alley]] scenes, Craig decided to build his own set, comprising [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] architecture.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

Columbus originally planned to use both animatronics and CGI animation to create the magical creatures, including Fluffy.&lt;ref name="columbointer" /&gt; Nick Dudman, who worked on ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'', was given the task of creating the needed prosthetics, with [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] providing creature effects.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034143p1.html |title=Davis Confirms Potter Role |accessdate=9 July 2007 |date=8 January 2001 |first=Brian |last=Linder |publisher=IGN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426003551/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034143p1.html |archivedate=26 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Coppinger stated that the magical creatures that needed to be created had to be designed multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034144p1.html |title=Potter Creature Feature |accessdate=9 July 2007 |date=11 January 2001 |first=Brian |last=Linder |publisher=IGN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426003556/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034144p1.html |archivedate=26 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film features nearly 600 special effects shots, involving numerous companies.

&lt;!-- This information should be integrated into the rest of the article --&gt;
&lt;!-- This information is sourced, please DO NOT add any other changes to this without having a reliable source to back it up. Thank you. --&gt;Columbus repeatedly checked with Rowling to make sure he was getting minor details correct.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; Kloves described the film as being "really faithful" to the book. He added dialogue, of which Rowling approved. One of the lines originally included had to be removed after Rowling told him that it would directly contradict an event in the then-unreleased fifth ''Harry Potter'' novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034146p1.html |title=Screenwriter Kloves Talks ''Harry Potter'' |accessdate=10 July 2007 |date=6 February 2001 |first=Brian |last=Linder |publisher=IGN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019053413/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034146p1.html |archivedate=19 October 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, most prominent among them the spectral History of Magic teacher, [[Professor Binns]], and [[Peeves]] the poltergeist. The book's first chapter is from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley the day before they are given Harry to look after, highlighting how non-magical people react to magic. The film removes this, beginning with Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid leaving Harry with the Dursleys (although McGonagall tells Dumbledore how she had been watching the Dursleys all day). Harry's less than pleasant times at Mrs. Figg's are cut from the film while the [[boa constrictor]] from Brazil in the zoo becomes a [[Burmese Python]] in the film. Some conflicts, such as Harry and Draco's encounter with each other in Madam Malkin's robe shop and midnight duel, are not in the film. Some of [[Nicolas Flamel#In popular culture|Nicolas Flamel]]'s role is changed or cut altogether. [[Rubeus Hagrid#Norbert|Norbert]] is mentioned to have been taken away by Dumbledore in the film; whilst the book sees Harry and Hermione have to take him by hand to [[Charlie Weasley]]'s friends. Rowling described the scene as "the one part of the book that she felt [could easily] be changed".&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; As a result, the reason for the detention in the Forbidden Forest was changed: In the novel, Harry and Hermione are put in detention for being caught by Filch when leaving the Astronomy Tower after hours, Neville and Malfoy are given detention when caught in the corridor by Professor McGonagall. In the film, Harry, Hermione and Ron receive detention after Malfoy catches them in Hagrid's hut after hours (Malfoy however, is given detention for being out of bed after hours). [[Firenze (Harry Potter)|Firenze]] the [[centaur]], who is described in the book as being [[palomino]] with light [[blonde]] hair, is shown to be dark in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/a64205/harry-potter-books-vs-films.html |title=Harry Potter: Books vs films |accessdate=10 July 2007 |date=9 July 2007 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |first=Kimberley |last=Dadds |author2=Miriam Zendle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quidditch]] pitch is altered from a traditional stadium to an open field circled by spectator towers.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; In the trio's final quest for the Philosopher's Stone, Hermione's test, solving a logic problem about a row of bottles, is omitted.

[[File:640 × 960 Hon. Ronald Savage at a Press Release.jpg|thumb|Ronald "Bee-Stinger" Savage carved the term Six elements of the Hip Hop Movement]]


'''The [[Hip Hop]] Movement''' offers a critical theory and history of hip hop culture as stated by [[Reiland Rabaka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/ethnicstudies/people/rabaka/|title=People :: Reiland Rabaka :: University of Colorado Ethnic Studies|website=www.colorado.edu|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''The Hip Hop Movement: From R&amp;B and the Civil Rights Movement to Rap and the Hip Hop Generation''. The movement connects [[R &amp; B|R&amp;B]], the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and hip hop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/students/features/series/hip-hop|title=ARTSEDGE: Hip-Hop: A Culture of Vision and Voice|first=The Kennedy Center|last=ArtsEdge|website=artsedge.kennedy-center.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hiphopmovement.org/about-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;The six elements Of the Hip Hop Movement are: Consciousness Awareness, Civil Rights Awareness, Activism Awareness, Justice, Political Awareness, Community Awareness in music. In 1990 while working with the rap/pop group [[Snap!]] [[Ronald Savage|Ronald "Bee-Stinger" Savage]] while in the [[State of New York]] carved the term Six elements of the Hip Hop Movement.The Hip Hop Movement is not only to entertain people but also to enlighten listeners of the struggle, the oppressed, and those who through lyrics to connect with.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.birthofhiphop.com/1184-2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Tourette-Syndrome-Discriminated-Harassed-Supervisor/dp/1517027837&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uupetaluma.org/services/getting-trouble-helping-troubled-kids/|title=From Getting in Trouble to Helping Troubled Kids - uupetaluma|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enspireusall.com/2017/05/17/hip-hop-pioneers-ronald-savage-and-busy-bee-acquire-use-of-the-trademark-for-the-hip-hop-movement/#.WvTQLYgvzmZ|title=HIP HOP PIONEERS RONALD SAVAGE AND BUSY BEE ACQUIRE USE OF THE  TRADEMARK FOR THE HIP HOP MOVEMENT!|website=enspireusall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kriphopnation.com/the-son-of-hip-hop-ronald-savage-speaks-about-his-disability-discrimination/|title=The Son Of Hip-Hop, Ronald Savage, Speaks About His Disability, Discrimination &amp;…|date=February 6, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.birthofhiphop.com/1184-2/|title=Jay-Z with Dean Baquet of The New York Times here: - BOHH|date=December 5, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopmovement.hiphop/|title=Home Page 5|website=Hip Hop Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four elements of hip hop culture are graffiti, rapping, DJing, and break-dancing. Rabaka argues that the hip hop movement is just as deserving of critical scholarly inquiry as other black popular music, such as R &amp; B. Hip hop has been documented to 1973 by [[Steven Hager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Hip-Hop-Steven-Hager-ebook/dp/B00Q8PFRIQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479353454&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=+Steven+Hager|title=Hip Hop|first=search|last=results|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "hip hop" first appeared in print on September 21, 1981, in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in a profile story of [[Africa Bambaataa]] written by Hager, who published the first comprehensive history of hip hop culture with St. Martins' Press. Taymullah Abdur-Rahman in a blog in The Huffington Press compares hip hop to The Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref name="ack"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/taymullah-abdurrahman/hip-hop-a-child-of-the-civil-rights-movement_b_9039664.html|title=Hip-Hop: A Child Of The Civil Rights Movement|first=Taymullah|last=Abdur-Rahman|date=26 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taymullah Abdur-Rahman]] opined "We couldn't reproduce [[Frederick Douglass]] but we had [[KRS-One]]. We didn’t try to imitate [[MLK]] but we had [[Chuck D]]. We remembered [[Harriet Tubman]] when we looked at [[Lauryn Hill]].

'''''Project: Knoxville''''' is a cancelled video game developed by [[Press Play (company)|Press Play]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]] exclusively for the [[Xbox One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Exclusive: Press Play discuss Project Knoxville, their ambitious and exclusive Xbox One survival game|publisher=windowscentral.com |

| accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game puts emphasis on [[survival game|survival]] and lets players co-operate with each other to achieve success. The game adapts an open development and allows the community to give input regarding the game's development. As Press Play was closed in March 2016, the game was no longer in development.

==Gameplay==
''Project: Knoxville'' is a [[third-person perspective|third-person]] [[multiplayer game|multiplayer]] [[survival game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-09-press-plays-next-game-is-project-knoxville|title=Press Play's next game is Project: Knoxville|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the game, players can jump, sprint, and interact with the environments. The game's major objective is to survive and escape from an arena which is filled with different hostile enemies. These arenas are round-based, each one lasting for approximately ten to twenty minutes, and the game does not feature a persistent world.&lt;ref name="Skype"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-choose-which-game-this-studio-makes-next/1100-6429854/|title=You Can Choose Which Game This Studio Makes Next|first=Chris|last=Pereira|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can interact with characters that are controlled by other players, and can choose whether to trust them or to distrust them. The game supports [[co-operative gameplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameplanet.com.au/news/g55ef6bd0d66d3/Press-Plays-next-project-is-the-Hunger-Games-inspired-Project-Knoxville/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.hk%2F|title=Press Play's next game is the Hunger Games-inspired Project Knoxville|first=Andrew|last=Todd|work=[[Gameplanet (New Zealand)]]|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, players have the option to demand attention from other players, as well as requesting weapons, healing and currency from them. Some missions require multiple players to work and ally together, or else they will be unable to complete them. Competitive multiplayer elements are also present in the game, in which players can choose to eliminate or backfire at each other.&lt;ref name="Transparent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/09/knoxville-the-next-game-from-press-play|title=Knoxville: The Next Game From Press Play|work=[[IGN]]|first=Michael|last=Martin|date=September 8, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/08/18/you-can-vote-on-press-plays-next-game.aspx|title=You Can Vote On Press Play's Next Game|first=Hershall|last=Cook|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YTPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm4QNxoszTQ|title=Project: Knoxville Prototype Gameplay|publisher=[[Press Play (company)|Press Play]]|work=[[YouTube]]|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the arena, the player will be accompanied by seven different players at the beginning of each match.&lt;ref name="Transparent"/&gt; They can pick up weapons that are sparsely scattered across the world to defend themselves and attack enemies&lt;ref name="spawn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-devs-next-game-is-the/1100-6430403/|title=Max: The Curse of Brotherhood Dev's Next Game is The Hunger Games Meets The Running Man And Left 4 Dead|first=Tamoor|last=Hussain|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also tasked to collect coins, which can be used to escape a level and upgrade the character the player is using. The number of coins in a level is limited, and some players may not be able to collect the coin needed to escape the level, and will get left behind in the arena.&lt;ref name="YTPP"/&gt; Players who die in the game can also enter an Afterlife mode. They can spawn objects that will influence a round, such as enemies or medkit next to surviving characters.&lt;ref name="YTPP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YTPP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spawn"/&gt;

==Development==
The game was currently being developed by [[Press Play (company)|Press Play]], who had previously worked on ''[[Max: The Curse of Brotherhood]]'' and ''[[Kalimba (video game)|Kalimba]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-08-18-microsofts-kalimba-and-max-developer-opens-public-vote-on-next-project|title=You can vote on which game the developer of Max: the Curse of Brotherhood makes next|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 2015, Press Play revealed three different projects they may work on, and asked the public to vote and choose the one that they wanted the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/microsofts-press-play-open-development-process|title=Microsoft's Press Play Opens Its Development Process to the Players|first=Mike|last=Williams|work=[[USgamer]]|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-and-kalimba-dev-press-play-letting-fans-pick-studios-next-game|title=Max: The Curse of Brotherhood and Kalimba Dev Press Play Letting Fans Pick Studio's Next Game|first=Evan|last=Campbell|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three projects were  ''Project: Dwarka'', ''Project: Karoo'' and ''Project: Knoxville''. ''Dwarka'' is a [[dungeon crawler]] set in a [[first-person perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/08/18/xbox-one-knoxville-dwarka-karoo-vote/|title=Vote on which game Max: The Curse of Brotherhood studio develops next|first= Stephany|last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tasks players to play as a dwarf and investigate dungeons, which are procedurally generated. '' Karoo'' is a [[simulation game]], which tasks players to build and customize their own vehicles, and explore a wasteland to gather different resources. The third project is ''Knoxville'', which was ultimately chosen by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/09/09/knoxville-chosen-as-press-plays-next-project/|title=Knoxville chosen as Press Play’s next project|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them feature multiplayer components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/18/9174427/developer-press-play-turns-to-players-to-choose-next-game|title=Developer Press Play asks public to choose next project|first=Colin|last=Campbell|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-studio-press-play-vote-dwarka-karoo-knoxville/|title=Xbox studio is letting you pick its next game|first=Sam|last=Prell|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GIB"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-09-08-press-play-let-gamers-choose-its-next-project|title = Press Play let gamers choose its next project|last = Weber|first = Rachel|date = September 8, 2015|work = Gameindustry.biz|accessdate = September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Press Play, the game was inspired by films like ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' and ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/press-play-announces-hunger-games-style-knoxville/|title=Press Play announces Hunger Games-style Knoxville|first=Jordan|last=Erica Webber|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the films, they put emphasis on survival and the relationships between players.&lt;ref name="Transparent"/&gt; The game's development was aimed to be transparent,&lt;ref name="Transparent"/&gt; as they would share new information of the game every other week through [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]].&lt;ref name="Transparent"/&gt; Supporters would also get to join meetings of the development team through [[Skype]].&lt;ref name="Skype"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/19/press-play-open-development-vote/|title=Microsoft studio wants you to choose and shape its next game|first=Aaron|last=Souppouris |date=August 19, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015|work=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2016 Microsoft announced that [[Press Play (company)|Press Play]] has closed down, and that the development of ''Project: Knoxville'' had ended. The decision was made as Microsoft wished to "focus its investment and development on the games and franchises that fans find most exciting and want to play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/lionhead-ceases-fable-legends-development-considering-closure/0217545|title=Lionhead ceases Fable Legends development, considering closure|first=Matthew|last=Jarvis|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|date=March 7, 2016|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le blog de Frantico''''' is a supposedly autobiographical [[Webcomics in France|Franco-Belgian webcomic]] that ran in 2005. It is drawn by Frantico, thought to be a [[pen name]] of [[Lewis Trondheim]]. In his blog, Frantico describes the miseries of his sex life. ''Le blog de Frantico'' was compiled into a comic book published by [[Albin Michel]] in October 2005, and it was nominated for the 2006 [[Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for First Comic Book|Prize for First Comic Book]] at the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toutenbd.com/article.php3?id_article=1480 ToutenBD.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006093920/http://www.toutenbd.com/article.php3?id_article=1480 |date=October  6, 2014 }}, Angoulême palmarès&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In ''Le blog de Frantico'', the anonymous author describes the miseries of his daily life, with a specific focus on his sexual life.&lt;ref name=Telerama /&gt;

==Author==
It is widely speculated that the author of ''Frantico'' is [[Lewis Trondheim]], and though he initially denied it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=639&amp;Itemid=48 |work=[[The Comics Journal]] |title=Lewis Trondheim |last=Wivel |first=Matthias |date=2007-06-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610060157/http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=639&amp;Itemid=48 |archive-date=June 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he later admitted that he indeed created the blog.&lt;ref name=Telerama&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telerama.fr/livres/M0608071713430.html|work=[[Telerama.fr]]|title=Le maître du dérisoire|date=2006-08-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014529/http://www.telerama.fr/livres/M0608071713430.html|archivedate=September 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auto-biographical nature of the Frantico webcomic has been confirmed to be false.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} A first comic book compilation of ''Le blog de Frantico'' was published by [[Albin Michel]] in October 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bedetheque.com/serie-12558-BD-Blog-de-Frantico-(Le).html|work=Bédétheque.com|title=Le blog de Frantico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Library Access to Music Project''' (LAMP) is a free music library for [[MIT]] students started by [[Keith Winstein]] and [[Joshua Mandel]], and funded by the MIT/Microsoft iCampus alliance. Originally launched on October 27, 2003,&lt;ref name="nyt-cable"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/business/technology-with-cable-tv-at-mit-who-needs-napster.html|title=With Cable TV at M.I.T., Who Needs Napster?|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=27 October 2003|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been in continuous operation since October 25, 2004.

== Using LAMP ==
A student wishing to use LAMP goes to the LAMP website, and selects several songs. LAMP assigns to the student a channel on MIT [[cable television|Cable]] (e.g. Channel 63), then begins playing the selected music on that channel for anyone to listen to.&lt;ref name="usatoday2003"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Jefferson|title=LAMP lights way for those seeking free, legal, Net tunes|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2003-10-26-mit-music_x.htm|accessdate=27 July 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=26 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal Significance ==
One key advantage of LAMP, in addition to its being free for its users, is the fact that any piece of music is in theory available on it because [[copyright]] law is more lax about broadcasting over analog transmissions, such as MIT Cable, than it is about digital transmissions such as those made over computer networks.&lt;ref name="nyt-cable"/&gt; For example, a person wanting to transmit a copy of "... Baby One More Time", written by [[Max Martin]] and performed by [[Britney Spears]], could do it either with an analog transmission or a digital transmission.  Using an analog transmission would only require permission from [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], the publisher, whereas use of a digital transmission would require Spears's permission as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kohn | first = Al | title = Kohn on music licensing | publisher = Aspen Publishers | location = Frederick, MD | year = 2010 | isbn = 0735590907 |page=1469|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vkIhwzTs_UC&amp;pg=PA1469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This aspect of copyright law is problematic for those wishing to transmit songs by artists such as [[The Beatles]]. Their label, [[Apple Corps]], as well as others, typically do not allow digital transmissions of their music, which is why their songs were not available on online music stores such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] until late 2010. However, songs by The Beatles are available on LAMP, since LAMP doesn't require Apple Corps's permission.

Initially, MIT purchased audio from [[LoudEye]], Inc., in MP3 form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loudeye Supports Launch of MIT's Electronic Music Library; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Unveils On-Demand Electronic Music Library Leveraging Loudeye's Digital Media Services.|url=http://lamp.mit.edu/loudeye.txt|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=27 July 2013|author=Loudeye Corp.|date=27 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the day of LAMP's initial launch, [[Universal Music Group]] approached Loudeye with concerns that it lacked the necessary licenses to make the MP3s that were sold to MIT.&lt;ref name=st03&gt;{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Kim|title=Loudeye's hard music lesson plants it in center of controversy|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2001783243_loudeye05.html|accessdate=27 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=5 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without music, LAMP was forced to go on a hiatus of about one year, until a different method of obtaining music was devised.&lt;ref name=tech-lamp-returns&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Jeffrey|title=After Legal Issues, LAMP Returns to MIT|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V124/PDF/N48.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]|date=26 October 2004|pages=1, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LAMP in its current incarnation requires someone to purchase a physical CD and place it in a CD jukebox, where it is then turned into an MP3. However, ripping MP3s of individual songs at will is still legally questionable, so LAMP takes advantage of the "ephemeral recording" provision of copyright law. Under this provision, consumers can create a "transmission program" so long as it is designed to be played back as a whole, in sequence. LAMP currently uses "transmission programs" that are approximately 30 minutes in length.&lt;ref name=tech-lamp-returns/&gt;

==Technical information==
LAMP is appropriately built with [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] technologies. That is to say, it runs on Linux machines, uses an Apache webserver, a MySQL database, and Perl and PHP. Portions of the software are also written in C++.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://lamp.mit.edu/lamp-qa.html|publisher=LAMP project|accessdate=28 July 2013|date=20 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Master the Mainframe contest''' is a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] [[Computer programming|programming]] challenge that is organized annually by IBM Academic Initiative System z.&lt;ref name=Salamone&gt;{{cite web|last=Salamone|first=Salvatore|title=It's Now Cool to Master the Mainframe|url=http://www.smartertechnology.com/c/a/Technology-For-Change/Its-Now-Cool-to-Master-the-Mainframe|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==

Originally catered to students attending [[North America]]n institutions of higher learning ([[United States|US]] and [[Canada]], excluding [[Quebec]]), the contest is currently running in separate countries across the globe (30 to date).&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite web |last1=Todd |first1=Mike |title=Master the Mainframe Contest: Past, Present and Future|url=http://ecc.marist.edu/conf2011/materials/NewtonMaster_the_Mainframe_-_Past,_Present_and_Future_v3.pdf|publisher=ECC 2011|accessdate=10 January 2012 |author2=Newton, P|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the contest is to provide students with the opportunity to experience working with mainframes.&lt;ref name=Tood2&gt;{{cite web |last1=Todd |first1=Mike |title=Master the Mainframe Contest: Past, Present and Future|url=http://ecc.marist.edu/conf2011/materials/NewtonMaster_the_Mainframe_-_Past,_Present_and_Future_v3.pdf|publisher=ECC 2011|accessdate=10 January 2012 |author2=Newton, P|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest was created in part to increase the number of mainframe skilled individuals in the [[computing]] workforce.&lt;ref name=Sharma&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharma|first=Niranjan|title=IBM Academic Initiative Helps Fill the Skills Gap|url=http://destinationz.org/Community/Evangelizing-Mainframe/October-2011/IBM-Academic-Initiative-Helps-Fill-the-Skills-Gap.aspx|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American contest has successfully completed 7 contests to date.

== Contest ==

The contest that runs for North America typically starts during the Fall semester and runs until the end of December. It is separated into 3 parts in which each part increases in complexity. Part 1 introduces the contestants to the basic aspects necessary to get started with mainframe technologies and requires minimal time to complete. Part 2 on the other hand involves more steps for each tasks and usually takes a day or so to accomplish. The first 60 winners of Part 2 will receive monetary prize in recognition of their achievement. Lastly, part 3 is more in depth and may involve multiple programming challenges such as [[COBOL]], [[REXX]], [[Job Control Language|JCL]], etc. (depending on the questions set for the year's challenge).&lt;ref name=Todd3&gt;{{cite web |last1=Todd |first1=Mike |title=Master the Mainframe Contest: Past, Present and Futur|url=http://ecc.marist.edu/conf2011/materials/NewtonMaster_the_Mainframe_-_Past,_Present_and_Future_v3.pdf|publisher=ECC 2011|accessdate=11 January 2012 |author2=Newton, P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pogs''', generically called '''milk caps''', is a [[game]] that was popular among children during the mid 1990s.

The brand name "Pog" is owned by the World Pog Federation. The name pog originates from [[POG (drink)|POG]], a brand of juice made from [[passionfruit]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], and [[guava]]; the use of POG bottle caps to play the game preceded the game's commercialization.&lt;ref name=Lewis-23&gt;Lewis, Tommi: "Pogs: The Milkcap Guide", page 23. Andrews and McMeel, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Men'uchi.jpg|thumb|''Men'uchi'' from the [[Edo period]] were made from clay. They were converted into paper format (''[[menko]]'') during the [[Meiji period]].]]
The game of milk caps possibly originated in Maui, [[Hawaii]] during the 1920s or 1930s,&lt;ref name="Air Force Print News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Wire"&gt;{{cite news|title=POG Is Back!; Funrise Heads to Hawaii Where It All Began to Re-Introduce the International Collectible Craze of the 90s |publisher=Business Wire |date=2005-12-05 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Dec_13/ai_n15932949 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016184132/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Dec_13/ai_n15932949 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-16 |accessdate=2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly with origins in [[Menko]], a Japanese card game very similar to milk caps, which has been in existence since the [[Edo period|17th century]].&lt;ref name="Virginian Pilot"&gt;{{cite news  | title =  Flipping out pogs are popping up everywhere as the game that is sweeping through the nation catches on with South Hampton Roads youngsters  |work=The Virginian Pilot | publisher = Landmark Communications, Inc.) | date = 1995-03-07 | url = http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950307/03070454.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016183510/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950307/03070454.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-16 | accessdate = 2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game of milk caps was played on the Hawaiian island of [[Maui]] as early as 1927.&lt;ref name="Essoyan"&gt;{{cite news |title=New wave of 'pog' mania crests over Hawaii |author=Essoyan, Susan |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=June 7, 1993 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-07/news/mn-611_1_milk-cover |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=POG is newest kids' fad |author=Rothman, Jason |newspaper=Palo Alto Online |date=November 2, 1994 |url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/news/1994_Nov_2.POG.html |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blossom Galbiso |author= |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |date=December 31, 1994 |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-12-31/news/1994365103_1_pogs-liuzzo-civil-rights |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are cap collectors that have dating till 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=hc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1993-07-26/features/0000006874_1_new-caps-milk-bottle-caps-comic-books |title=Will Cardboard Caps From Milk Bottles Become Cream Of All |publisher=Hartford Courant |date=1993-07-26 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haleakala Dairy of Maui sold a mixed fruit drink in a glass bottle with a cap under the brand name of [[POG (drink)|POG]]. In 1955, Haleakala discontinued using the glass containers, but continued making the caps to allow the game to be played.&lt;ref name=hc/&gt; Orchards Hawaii also continued to make milk caps after having stopped using glass bottles.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; In 1991, Haleakala expanded to the more populated Oahu island, which led to a revival of the game. With this revival, the Pog name began being used generically for the game.&lt;ref name=hc/&gt;

The 1990s revival is credited to Blossom Galbiso, a teacher and guidance counselor who taught at [[Waialua, Hawaii|Waialua Elementary School]] in [[Oahu]]. In 1991, Galbiso introduced the game she had played as a little girl to a new generation of students, soon incorporating milk caps into her fifth grade curriculum as a way of teaching math and as a nonviolent alternative to other popular schoolyard games, such as [[dodgeball]].&lt;ref name="Essoyan"/&gt; The game quickly spread from Oahu's [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]], and by early 1992, STANPAC Inc., the small Canadian packaging company that had been manufacturing the milk caps distributed by Haleakala Dairy on Maui (the same caps that were collected by Galbiso for her class), was printing millions of milk caps every week for shipment to the Hawaiian island chain. The game soon spread to the mainland, first surfacing in California, Texas, Oregon, and Washington before spreading to the rest of the country. By 1993, the previously obscure game of milk caps, which had almost been forgotten, was now played throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It Was Hot In Hawaii, It's Ho-hum Here |author=Imperiale, Nancy |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=March 15, 1994 |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-03-15/lifestyle/9403130497_1_pogs-hawaii-cardboard |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Pogslam.jpg|thumb|250px|Real milk caps had small staples in them which, when stacked, produced a random element to the game. Regular milk caps were used to throw at the stack and were able to flip the pile.]]

Milk caps returned to popularity when the World POG Federation and the [[Canada Games Company]] reintroduced them under the Pog brand name in the 1990s. The Pog [[fad]] soared, and peaked in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;DeMasters, Tiffany. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100412015022/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1%2C5143%2C640192788%2C00.html "90s pog fad still has a few die-hard fans"], ''[[Deseret News]]'', July 11, 2006.

Accessed July 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Pogs were being handed out for opening bank accounts and in McDonald's Happy Meals.&lt;ref name=hc/&gt; With the end of the Pogs fad, Canada Games went out of business in 1997.

Seven other companies entered the milk cap field after a comic book and card industry convention in January 1993. [[SkyBox International]] and Marvel added the product to their lines under the names SkyCaps and Hero Caps respectively.&lt;ref name=hc/&gt; The game had spread to California, Florida and Texas.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Agreement Puts an End To 'Pog' Trademark War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/us/agreement-puts-an-end-to-pog-trademark-war.html|accessdate=November 22, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=November 9, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Pog was claimed as trademark by the World Pog Federation while other companies claimed it was generic term as it was selected by the children that played the game. In October 1994, a lawsuit was settled between World Pog and Universal Pogs Association. Pog was recognized as World Pog's exclusive term and Universal Pogs changed its name to Universal Slammers, Inc.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Because many children would keep the milk caps they won in games from other players, many school districts considered milk caps a form of gambling.&lt;ref name="Virginian Pilot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GPro68"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Milking the MK Craze|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=68 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1995|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milk caps proved to be major distractions from classes and the source of various playground arguments. These elements eventually led to the banning of milk caps from various schools across North America.&lt;ref name="GPro68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stay Free"&gt;{{Cite news

== Equipment ==
Milk caps generally involves two types of playing discs: milk caps and slammers. Milk caps are typically flat circular cardboard discs which are decorated with images on one or both sides. Traditional (or traditional-style) milk caps are made of rougher cardboard, are printed with limited colors, and often have a [[staple (fastener)|staple]] in them (as they appeared when used as actual POG bottlecaps), while modern commercial pogs were stiffer, thicker and are often printed with colorful glossy imagery.

The other equipment that is used is a slammer: a heavier game piece often made of metal, rubber, or more commonly plastic, which come in various thicknesses and weights. &lt;ref name="Virginian Pilot" /&gt; They are typically similar in diameter to milk caps. Metal slammers are not allowed in some games because they are usually heavier than other materials, giving the player with the first turn an unfair advantage, and have a tendency to damage the milk caps.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Kids playing pog.jpeg|thumb|Children in the Philippines playing pogs.]]
Rules vary among players, but the game variants generally have common gameplay features. Each player has his/her own collection of milk caps and one or more slammers. Before the game, players decide whether or not to play "for keeps", i.e. players get to keep the milk caps that they win during the game and must forfeit those that have been won by other players. The game can then begin as follows:

# The players each contribute an equal number of milk caps to build a stack with the pieces face-down, which will be used during the game.&lt;ref name="Virginian Pilot" /&gt;
# The players take turns throwing their slammer down onto the top of the stack, causing it to spring up and the milk caps to scatter. Each player keeps any milk caps that land face-up after they have thrown.&lt;ref name="Virginian Pilot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="milkcapmania"&gt;{{cite web |title = How to Play pogs |url = http://www.milkcapmania.co.uk/howtoplay.html |accessdate = 2007-02-17 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070716215117/http://www.milkcapmania.co.uk/howtoplay.html |archivedate = 2007-07-16 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# After each throw, the milk caps which have landed face-down are then re-stacked for the next player.
# When no milk caps remain in the stack, the player with the most pogs is the winner.&lt;ref name="Virginian Pilot" /&gt;

== World POG Federation ==
The World POG Federation was the licensed POG publisher, which was 14% owned by Haleakala Dairy, the trademark holder of POGs. Federation president in 1994 was Alan Rypinski. The company was based in Costa Mesa, California.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Military uses==

The [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]], the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s largest and oldest exchange system, distributes milk-cap-like [[coin]]age as change at its stores in contingency areas (those supporting Operations [[Operation Enduring Freedom|Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraqi Freedom]]).&lt;ref name="Stars and Stripes"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Why pogs and not legal tender?

 | format = website
 | accessdate = 2007-02-17 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for adopting milk caps as currency was that supply flights overseas had limited capacity and air-freight shipping involved high costs.&lt;ref name="Air Force Print News"&gt;{{cite news  | title = POGs – dollars, cents of setting up shop in a war zone | publisher = Air Force Print News Today | date = 2005-06-06 | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2005/06/mil-050606-afpn04.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal coinage weighs significantly more than paper milk caps, which are also much thinner than standard milk caps. While they are only issued in contingency areas, they are redeemable at any AAFES store worldwide.&lt;ref name="Stars and Stripes" /&gt;

== Global variants ==
[[File:Menko-square-circle-collection.jpg|thumb|left|A collection of Menko cards.]]

=== Japan ===
{{main|Menko}}
Menko (めんこ, 面子) is a Japanese card game played by two or more players, dating back to the 17th century. Each player uses Menko cards made from thick paper or cardboard, printed on one or both sides with images from anime, manga, and other works.

=== South Korea ===
[[File:Korean Play Takji.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Folding a ttakji from square paper.]]
The card used in ''ttakji'' or ''ddakji'' ([[:ko:딱지 (장난감)|딱지]]) is constructed by folding two square pieces of paper together into a square. As with milk caps, the game is won by flipping the other player's card. The popular Korean variety show ''[[Running Man (TV series)|Running Man]]'' occasionally features ddakji in its missions, which may contribute to the awareness of the game in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="talty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Talty|first1=Stephan|title=Under the Same Sky: From Starvation in North Korea to Salvation in America|date=2015|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0544373170|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91hCCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yi|first1=I-hwa|title=Korea's Pastimes and Customs: A Social History|date=2006|publisher=Homa &amp; Sekey Books|isbn=1931907382|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcsMRc6pbQoC&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Public Gardens Day''', occurring annually on the Friday before [[Mother's Day]], is a day to promote awareness of [[botanic gardens]], [[arboreta]], [[zoos]], historic gardens, or any of North America's [[public gardens]]. The day was established by the American Public Gardens Association, a [[Pennsylvania]] non-profit organization that supports, resources and promotes public gardens in North America.&lt;ref&gt;The American Public Gardens Association, ''American Public Gardens Association to Designate May 7, 2010 as the Second Annual National Public Gardens Day'', [http://www.publicgardens.org/web/2009/10/american_public_gardens_associat.aspx APGA Press Release], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Activities==
Members of the [[American Public Gardens Association]] celebrated National Public Gardens Day beginning in 2009 with activities that varied by garden. The [[Atlanta Botanical Garden]] invited visitors to bring flowers, so that they could be put into arrangements for patients and their families at Children's Hospital&lt;ref&gt;Atlanta On The Cheap. "50% off Admission to the Atlanta Botanical Garden on Friday &amp; Gardens for Connoisseurs Tour this Weekend", [http://www.atlantaonthecheap.com/2009/05/07/50-off-admission-to-the-atlanta-botanical-garden-on-friday-gardens-for-connoisseurs-tour-this-weekend/].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Desert Botanical Garden]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], asked visitors to pledge to conserve water, displaying 400 five-gallon water containers that pledgers could adopt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc15.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/Desert-Botanical-Garden-joins-National-Public-Gardens-Day ABC 15. "Desert Botanical Garden joins National Public Gardens Day."]&lt;/ref&gt; National spokesperson [[Paul James (gardener)|Paul James]] visited media gardens, speaking with the public and media about the role public gardens play in the local community.&lt;ref&gt;LaCrosse Tribune. "Don't Overlook Public Gardens." [http://lacrossetribune.com/lifestyles/home-and-garden/article_0014c3d2-47e6-11df-a78b-001cc4c03286.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Senator [[Dick Durbin]] of Illinois spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the importance of recognizing National Public Gardens Day, listing the [[US Botanic Garden]] and gardens in [[Illinois]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record S3353. Recognizing National Public Gardens Day. May 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Created in 2009, in partnership with sponsor, [[Rain Bird]], as a way to increase public awareness of the educational resources public gardens provide to local communities, National Public Gardens Day was adopted by the members of the American Public Gardens Association, to highlight programs such as plant conservation, [[water conservation]], the preservation of green spaces, and [[home gardening]].

The national spokesperson for National Public Gardens Day was [[Paul James (gardener)|Paul James]], host of [[HGTV]]'s Gardening By The Yard.

'''PhysicsOverflow''' is a [[physics]] website that serves as a [[Scholarly peer review#Postpublication|post-publication open peer review]]&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;https://physicsoverflow.org/faq&lt;/ref&gt; platform for [[academic paper|research papers]] in physics, as well as a [[collaborative blog]] and [[online community]] of physicists. It allows users to ask, answer and comment on graduate-level physics questions, post and review manuscripts from [[ArXiv]] (which lists PhysicsOverflow discussion pages among its trackbacks&lt;ref&gt;https://physicsoverflow.org/30425/we-have-arxiv-trackbacks?show=30425#q30425&lt;/ref&gt;) and other sources, and vote on both forms of content.

In addition to the two primary forms of content, the PhysicsOverflow community also welcomes discussions on [[List of unsolved problems in physics|unsolved problems]], and hosts a chat section for discussions on topics generally of interest to physicists and students of physics, such as those related to recent events in physics, physics academia, and the publishing process.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

==History==
PhysicsOverflow was started in April 2014 as a physics-equivalent of [[MathOverflow]] by Rahel Knöpfel, a physics PhD at the [[University of Rostock]], high-school student Abhimanyu Pallavi Sudhir, and Roger Cattin, a retired professor of computer science at the [[Fachhochschule|University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; The site was initially a mere question-and-answer forum, as it was started by users dissatisfied by the policies of the [[Stack Exchange|Physics Stack Exchange]], but it was eventually expanded to include a ''Reviews'' section in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://physicsoverflow.org/24235/the-reviews-section-is-out-of-beta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moderation practices==
PhysicsOverflow is well-known for its liberal moderation policy and hesitation to block contributors except for spam, as reflected in the website's bill of "user rights".&lt;ref&gt;https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6196/what-is-physics-overflow-and-how-is-it-linked-to-physics-se&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="physicsoverflow.org"&gt;https://physicsoverflow.org/user-rights&lt;/ref&gt; The content is largely community-moderated, much like MathOverflow, although exceptions have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;https://physicsoverflow.org/31863/violation-of-policy-to-close-questions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="https://physicsoverflow.org/review"&gt;https://physicsoverflow.org/review&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the site's moderation policy is publicly available as part of the [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_ra1Ss1E-rWN3cyRC1zalAtT1U/edit moderator manual], the site has been criticised for the excessive dispersion of policy-related material, such as the [https://physicsoverflow.org/faq FAQ], [https://physicsoverflow.org/user-rights the Bill of Rights], [https://physicsoverflow.org/users/special the moderator list] and the [https://physicsoverflow.org/review Community Moderation threads], leading to reduced transparency.&lt;ref&gt;https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6196/what-is-physics-overflow-and-how-is-it-linked-to-physics-se#comment25091_6213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://physicsoverflow.org/22268/physics-overflow-moderators-what-their-exact-role-and-powers&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the site's administrators posted a bulletin of all moderation-related content on the site on the homepage.

[[File:PhysicsOverflow Discus.svg|thumb|right|The PhysicsOverflow [[discus]] as it appears in the PhysicsOverflow logo.]]
PhysicsOverflow runs [[Q&amp;A software#Comparison of Q&amp;A software|Question2Answer]], an open-source Q&amp;A software, with a custom theme and several plugins and patches.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; Some of its plugins have been used by other Question2Answer websites, such as the [https://openscience.uni-bielefeld.de Open Science Q&amp;A] and the [http://physics.qandaexchange.com/ Physics Problems Q&amp;A].&lt;ref&gt;https://openscience.uni-bielefeld.de/768/how-do-i-regain-access-to-my-imported-account&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.wikimedia.de/author/christopher_schwarzkopf/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[Quantcast]] records around 3000 monthly visitors and between 20,000 and 50,000 global page views to PhysicsOverflow every month, over half of whom are located in four countries: the United States (26.8%), India (9.2%), the United Kingdom (8.5%), and Germany (6.4%).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quantcast.com/physicsoverflow.org?country=CN&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to PhysicsOverflow's own data, only around 1500 users actually contribute content to the site, and 440 are active at a given point in time.&lt;ref&gt;https://physicsoverflow.org/statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
The creation of PhysicsOverflow was well-received by the [[MathOverflow]] community.&lt;ref&gt;http://meta.mathoverflow.net/questions/1608/physicsoverflow-just-went-live&lt;/ref&gt; PhysicsOverflow was also featured at the 5th Offtopicarium&lt;ref&gt;https://physicsoverflow.org/22788/we-have-a-talk-at-the-offtopicarium?show=22788#q22788&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Scientific]]'s Asia-Pacific Physics News Letter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S2251158X15000193&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Baez]] suggested the website as a platform for discussing research-level physics questions.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/books.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Greg Bernhardt, the founder of PhysicsForums, acknowledged the site as a "very interesting development for the physics discussion communities".&lt;ref&gt;http://motls.blogspot.in/2013/08/discussion-on-old-and-new-theoretical.html?m=1&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arnold Neumaier, a professor at the University of Vienna, employs PhysicsOverflow as the platform for discussion about his Theoretical Physics FAQ.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/physfaq/physics-faq.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* String theorist [[Lubos Motl]] referred to the website as a "very promising competition [to Physics Stack Exchange]".&lt;ref&gt;http://motls.blogspot.in/2014/05/physics-overflow-is-live.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[University of Stavenger]]'s cosmology department commented that PhysicsOverflow "seems to implement some interesting ideas", and that "it makes some sense the {{sic}} review the reviewing process".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/uiscosmology/posts/1228470267242602&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Urs Schreiber]] publicised the site, claiming it could act as a catalyst to make physics academia more open like mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;https://plus.google.com/+UrsSchreiber/posts/SoWhSAqmUJ1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/Whats-your-impression-of-PhysicsOverflow/answer/Sebastian-Schacher&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''politico-media complex''' ( '''PMC''', also referred to as the '''political-media complex''' ) is a name that has been given to the close, systematized, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]]-like network&lt;ref name="network"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hacking reveals power network|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14846456 |publisher=[[The BBC]]|date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 15, 2011|quote=The story of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal has revealed a web of links between senior figures within politics, the police and the media.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of relationships between a [[Sovereign state|state's]] [[politics|political]] and [[ruling class]]es, its [[media industry]], and any interactions with or dependencies upon [[interest group]]s with other domains and agencies, such as [[law]] (and its enforcement through the [[police]]&lt;ref name="filkin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Filkin report: Police warned over press links|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16411329 |publisher=[[The BBC]] |date=January 4, 2012 |accessdate=January 6, 2012|quote=The "close relationship" between parts of Scotland Yard and the media has caused "serious harm", a report says.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[corporation]]s and the [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]].

There is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of "traditional" [[mainstream media]] [MSM]) are turning, more readily, to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior. One notable example of this is with regards to the [[Leveson Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="lse0"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson: Bloggers vs the Press | website=Media Policy Project | date=7 December 2012 | url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2012/12/07/leveson-bloggers-vs-the-press/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early media institutions==
Before [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in 1450, most information was delivered by town criers, ministers from the pulpit, or bartenders. [[Town criers]] spread information and news including royal edicts, police regulations, important community events and war news. These early methods of communication were often delivered by messengers on foot, and could be easily controlled by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Media History |last=Fellow |first=Anthony |year=2005 |publisher=Michael Rosenberg |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-495-56775-2 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7THGKyvBXScC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;dq=%22town+criers%22+polical+media&amp;ei=3IgcS67kN57IzAT2k5iEDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of the printing press news began to be spread in writing. [[Corantos]], which were semi-regular pamphlets that reported news, are an example of the early politico-media complex. Popular in England, corantos reported mostly foreign news, as the royal government attempted to control what domestic news reached the masses. Corantos eventually would become regular periodicals that were subject to less political control, and mark one of the earlier forms of industrialized media.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Catherine. "Inventing the News." Engines of our Ingenuity. University of Houston. 2005. http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1983.htm. Dec. 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print==

===Global print media===
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers".&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights". United Nations. 2009. [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ UN.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the international papers present in the world today are national papers re-edited for a wider audience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Because of this, there can be biases based on nationality.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} In any publication there is some sort of bias just from what news is covered and what stories are shown at the forefront of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Tunstall, Jeremy. pg 12. The Media In Britain. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2013}}

Although print media in the West has suffered from declining advertising trends,&lt;ref name="printdecline"&gt;{{cite web | last=Fontevecchia | first=Agustino | title=New York Times Agonizes As Print Media Ad Revenues Continue To Slide | website=Forbes | date=12 September 2011 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2011/09/12/new-york-times-agonizes-as-print-media-ad-revenues-continue-to-slide/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; many newspapers and magazines in the [[Middle East]] continue to do well.&lt;ref&gt;"Middle East Newspapers Struggle in New Age".

Routledge. New York. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the independence from political influence, and dependability of newsprint is questionable in many countries. The [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]] suggests that even in many first world countries the rights of the press are not fully respected, and that the press is not completely free to investigate or criticize the government, though the situation is far worse in third world or politically unstable nations.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref name="press freedom index"&gt;"Press Freedom Index 2009". [http://en.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/classement_en.pdf RSF.org] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/616iLWBGp?url=http://en.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/classement_en.pdf |date=2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The West====
[[File:Newspapers-20080928.jpg|thumb|[[Newspapers]], as seen here, are easily available in many parts of the world.]]

Newspapers and magazines do have a back and forth between readers and journalists. Some studies have shown that the print media are more likely to reinforce existing political attitudes of the masses than change them.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly, Caroline. Ross, Karen. “Women and media: international perspectives”. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters Without Borders, an international [[non-governmental organization]] that promotes [[freedom of the press]], produces an annual [[Press Freedom Index]] assessing countries' press freedom. Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-François Julliard said at the release of the 2009 Press Freedom Index, "It is disturbing to see European democracies such as France, Italy and Slovakia fall steadily in the rankings year after year [...] Europe should be setting an example as regards civil liberties. How can you condemn human rights violations abroad if you do not behave irreproachably at home? The Obama effect, which has enabled the United States to recover 16 places in the index, is not enough to reassure us."&lt;ref name="press freedom index"/&gt;

====Asia====
The press is censored in the People's Republic of China by the [[Golden Shield Project]], known colloquially as the [[Great Firewall of China]].&lt;ref name=Norris&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Sentinel: News Media and Governance Reform |last=Norris |first=Pippa |authorlink=Pippa Norris |author2=World Bank Staff |year=2009 |publisher=[[World Bank Publications]] |location= |isbn=978-0-8213-8200-4 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzFVxDDhfnkC&amp;pg=PA360 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reporters Without Borders'' ranks [[Media of the People's Republic of China|China's press situation]] as "very serious," the worst possible ranking on their five-point scale.&lt;ref&gt;"The News by Country". Reporters Without Borders.

Encyclopædia Britannica. November 2, 2009. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Middle East and North Africa====
Middle Eastern print media is mainly paid for by private funders, either a specific family or specific government party.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Some Middle Eastern newspapers and magazines have been accused of having obvious political ties.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. pg 11. The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years. Britain. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries in the Middle East and Africa have harsh government restrictions as to what can be published when, for various reasons depending on political and economic circumstances.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} [[Censorship in Iran|Iran]], ranked 174 out of 179 in 2013, is described as highly censored, as the Iranian government maintains strict control over much of the print and broadcast media and news websites.&lt;ref name="WPFI2013" /&gt; Reporters Without Borders has said that journalists in [[Israel]] "enjoy real freedom of expression despite the existence of military censorship."&lt;ref name="WPFI2013" /&gt; However, Professor Yoram Peri of the [[University of Maryland]] has said that Israel experienced a media control crackdown as the government censors coverage of military action coverage, displaying how governments often limit press freedom during times of war.&lt;ref&gt;Peri, Yoram.

===Struggles===
Where newspapers used to represent an exclusive connection between readers and advertisers, print media must now compete with the power of the entire Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan, Robert. The Krugman Paradox: newspaper websites' inability to generate economically sustainable advertising revenue. New York University. Fall 2008. pg. 18.[http://metaprinter.com/Projects/Robert_Ivan_MAthesis_2008NYU.pdf MA Thesis PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of declining advertising revenue and shrinking audiences, [[print press]] has been described as declining.&lt;ref name="printdecline" /&gt; Today a little more than half of Americans read a newspaper every day. However, a 2004 report notes that 55 million newspapers are still sold daily in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and newsprint still plays a significant role in the politico-media complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chozick|first1=Amy|title=Conservative Koch Brothers Turning Focus to Newspapers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/business/media/koch-brothers-making-play-for-tribunes-newspapers.html|accessdate=9 April 2015|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to economic struggles and readership decline, newsprint has also struggled with losing readers' trust. Surveys have found that people tend to trust newspapers less than other news media, in part because they believe that newspaper journalists are "isolated and out of touch" and motivated by commercial interests.&lt;ref name="2004att"&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/public-attitudes/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most people believe their local and national news television stations more than their local and national newspapers.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; The only news medium that people trust less than newspapers is print magazines.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt;

Some{{who|date=June 2013}} have speculated that the youth today are more visually inclined, and are therefore less likely to be influenced by written political news or propaganda.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; One Pew Center study found that 28% of this generation read the paper on a given day, and average only 10 minutes of reading time. [[Harvard]] Professor Thomas Patterson has said: "What's happened over time is that we have become more of a viewing nation than a reading nation, and the internet is a little of both. My sense is that, like it or not, the future of news is going to be in the electronic media, but we don't really know what that form is going to look like."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Juston. "Young Adults Are Giving Newspapers Scant Notice". July 16, 2007. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/business/media/16habits.html?_r=0 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==

===History of political radio===
[[File:RCA Radiola 25 - raw.jpg|thumb|An [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]] Radiola, manufactured 1925.]]

The early American radio industry was composed of commercial shipping companies that used radio for navigation, and amateur radio enthusiasts, who built radios at home.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Douglas B. Fireside Politics: Radio and Political Culture in the United States. pg 26. The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This mixture of military, industry and community went unregulated until the [[Radio Act of 1912]], which required all ships to use radio communication and keep a constant radio watch, amateur users to be licensed, and began regulating the use of wavelengths for radio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Regulate Radio Communication, August 13, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; This act represents one of the earliest interactions between the government and the radio media and also set a precedent for later radio legislation,{{OR|date=June 2013}} including the [[Radio Act of 1927]], which established the [[Federal Radio Commission]] and added further regulation to radio users, both commercial and amateur.&lt;ref&gt;Public Law No. 632, February 23, 1927, 69th Congress. An Act for the regulation of radio communications, and for other purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulation increased again with the American entrance into World War I, when President Woodrow Wilson ordered naval control of all radio stations, and ordered that amateurs cease all radio activity. [[Jonathan Reed Winkler]], a noted WWI historian, said “It was only during World War I that the United States first came to comprehend how a strategic communications network-the collection of submarine telegraph cables, and long-distance radio stations used by a nation for diplomatic, commercial and military purposes- was vital to the global political and economic interests of a great power in the modern world.”&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Jonathan Reed. Nexus: Strategic Communications and American Security in World War I. pg. 2. [[Harvard University Press]]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I radio was introduced to broader civilian audiences when Westinghouse released the Aeriola Jr. in 1919, and the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) released the Radiola in 1920. The Aeriola Jr. and Radiola helped established a new channel for the politico-media complex to enter into thousand of American homes.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} By 1919 the oldest licensed American radio station, KDKA, from Pittsburgh, PA began broadcasting regular music shows, and soon music, educational programming, sports coverage and eventually news coverage became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pgs. 10, 13-16. [[Columbia University Press]]. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of politics quickly caught on across the countries, as stations began covering elections, and reporting news of government actions. The close politico-media complex between government and radio was finalized in 1924{{OR|date=June 2013}} when the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were covered, and candidates made eve of election speeches, the first instance of radio broadcasting that was meant to affect the American political process.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pg. 18. Columbia University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers of radio users exploded, by 1935 about 2 in 3 American homes owned a radio.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr, Steven E. "Golden Age of Radio,1935-1950" [http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/radio2.html Sandiego.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians quickly learned to reach these huge audiences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt's [[Fireside Chats]] are an example of the politico-media complex.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} In his series of informal broadcasts from 1933 to 1944, Roosevelt developed a comforting rapport with the American public.&lt;ref&gt;"Treasures of American History: The Great Depression and World War II."

Politicians would continue to use the radio in World War II, in which the radio was used primarily for news transmissions and the spread of [[propaganda]]. One example of radio propaganda came from Iva Toguri D'Aquino, Ruth Hayakawa, June Suyamawho, and Myrtle Lipton collectively known as [[Tokyo Rose]]. These women hosted anti-American programming intended to lower American soldiers' morale and illustrate the use of governments' use of the media to influence the public, or their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;"Famous Cases: Iva Toguri d'Aquino and 'Tokyo Rose.'"

[https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/rose/rose.htm FBI.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people, such as [[Iva Toguri D'Aquino]] and Allied prisoners of war, were forced against their will to participate in these programs and worked hard to help Allied forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iva Toguri|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article652271.ece|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Willis Conover 1969.jpg|thumb|left|[[Willis Conover]], host of the [[Voice of America|VOA's]] Music USA program, 1969.]]
After WWII and throughout the [[Cold War]] era, Democratic nations used long-range radio waves to broadcast news into countries behind the Iron Curtain or otherwise information-compromised nations. The American international radio program, the [[Voice of America]], founded during World War II, became a critical part of Cold War era "public diplomacy," which aimed to spread democratic values, and popularize American policies abroad.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon Robert. "Channeling the Cold War: U.S. Overseas Broadcasting". The Foreign Service Journal. pg. 58. October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, President Harry S. Truman described the Cold War conflict as a "struggle, above all else, for the minds of men," which the American people would win by getting "the real story across to people in other countries." in other words, embracing the politico-media complex and using it to influence foreign listeners.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, Lyn. McLean, David. Media and Society in the Twentieth Century: a historical introduction. pg. 107. Wiley Blackwell. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice of America, operating under the authority of the [[United States Information Agency]], supported programming in forty five languages, broadcasting over 400 hours of programming a week.

===Modern political radio===
The Golden Age of Radio may have only lasted from 1935–1950, yet radio is still an active medium in the politico-media complex.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} Today there is extensive radio programming on politics. One notable example is the [[Rush Limbaugh Show]], which broadcasts the political commentary of Rush Limbaugh, referred to by listeners as "America's Truth Detector," the "Doctor of Democracy," and the "Most Dangerous Man in America."&lt;ref&gt;"About the Rush Limbaugh Show." Premier Radio Networks. [http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/about_the_show.guest.html RushLimbaugh.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rush Limbaugh Show has hosted numerous politicians, illustrating that politicians still use the radio to affect public opinion and the political process.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} The [[Air America Media]] company, provides progressive political commentary and news coverage and has described itself as the "most recognized progressive talk radio network, providing an independent and unfiltered voice to a grateful listening nation."&lt;ref&gt;"About Air America."

==Film==

===National cinema===
One of film's most powerful political and sociological forms is '''[[national cinema]]''', for which there are entire books for individual countries and varying definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Hjort, Mette, and Scott MacKenzie, eds. Introduction. ''Cinema and Nation''. By Hjort and MacKenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Through the national cinema, ideological groups within specific countries can construct and reinforce their collective identities through film, as well as the identities of foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Jimmy. "Is National Cinema Mr. MacGuffin?" International Films The Institute of Communications Studies, [[University of Leeds]], UK. Available at [http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=ifilm&amp;folder=17&amp;paper=22 Leeds.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, Charles and John A. Hall. "The Sociological Scope of National Cinema." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p.22-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural politics===
Ulf Hedetoft has observed, "In the real world of politics and influence, certain nationalisms, cultures, ideas and interpretations are more transnationally powerful, assertive and successful than others. Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"&gt;Hedetoft, Ulf. "Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its "national-cultural currency" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a "positive admixture" to other countries' cultures and identities or a "model for emulation."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt; He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt;

===Propaganda===
{{Main article|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"&gt;Furhammar, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

Such British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the "masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from "[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]
When sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{OR|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"&gt;Furhammar, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the "reality" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI "Operation Abolition," 1960 - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The Führer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.&lt;ref&gt;Furhammar, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in "Breaking into the Movies," is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"&gt;Giroux, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He argues, "We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values."&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"/&gt;

Though feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"/&gt;

===Anti-politics in film===
Despite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to "develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's "[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]" 1939.]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; After the hero of ''[[John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Lindholm and Hall observe that "the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"&gt;Lindholm, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt; Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt;

===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===
While films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actor-politicians===
{{Main article|List of actor-politicians}}

==Television==

===Role of television in United States presidential elections===
The [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"&gt;Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;

Rick Shenkman also analyzes the media’s impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that "politicians have repeatedly misled voters" by "[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation."&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;
[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]

Through setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation’s political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.&lt;ref name="agenda"&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.&lt;ref name="agenda" /&gt; When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.&lt;ref&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political influence on religion via television===
In his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in "shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present" in India.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"&gt;Rajagopal, Arvind. "Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India." Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that "television profoundly changes the context of politics".&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;24)&lt;/sup&gt;

The epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/sup&gt; This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.

Central to the BJP’s success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt; This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.

===Television and politics around the world===
In the “Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,” Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation’s television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation’s television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"&gt;Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"/&gt;

Another group who studied the impact of television on politics included Holli Semetko and Patti Valenburg. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are "conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information."&lt;ref&gt;Neuman et al., 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;60&lt;/ref&gt; They set the parameters "in which citizens discuss public events."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;IV&lt;/ref&gt; They are "persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Gitlin, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Framing is selecting "some aspects of a perceived reality" to enhance their salience "in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation."&lt;ref&gt;Entman, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;53&lt;/ref&gt; Frames are to help audiences "locate, perceive, identify, and label" the flow of information around themGoffman, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;21 and to "narrow the available political alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Semetko"&gt;Semetko, Holli A. and Valenburg, Patti M. “Framing European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.” Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

News frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&amp;nbsp;– such as its organization, content, or structure&amp;nbsp;– make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Price et al., 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;486&lt;/ref&gt; Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;

Like agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis "expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news."&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pan &amp; Kosicki, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;70; emphasis in the original&lt;/ref&gt; The results of Semetko and Valenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt; After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.

===Impact on political media===
The Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Handbook of Political Communication Research |last=Kaid |first=Lynda |year=2004 |publisher=Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3775-2 |page=508 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffqEaH6UM7UC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet |last=Shane |first=Peter |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-94864-9 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1 |last= Kaid |first=Lynda |author2=Holtz-Bacha, Christina |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5 |page=334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-woKG0HTstwC&amp;pg=PT350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics ''and'' media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhap less than flattering, may be 'adjusted' by one or more ''other'' entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).

For example, [[Wikipedia]] itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential [[Wikipedia:AC|Arbitration Committee]](ArbCom). It was shown that David Boothroyd - a serving Labour Party Councillor for Westminster City

The impact of the internet on politics has been notable, as this form of media has more current information than others since it is constantly being updated. Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics. Users, nonetheless, remain susceptible to bias, especially on websites that represent themselves as objective sources.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

[[File:Bill Clinton (square).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bill Clinton]] was the first [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] to utilize the [[Internet]] in a national campaign and to appoint a Director of Email and Electronic Publishing.]]
[[E-mail]] has achieved a large scale of usage amongst numerous levels of government, political groups, and even media companies as a means of communicating with the public and thus plays a significant role in the political-media complex. The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in. In a six-month period, at one point, there were half a million e-mails sent to the president and vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Media and American Politics |last=Davis |first=Richard |author2=Owen, Diana |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-19-512060-4 |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-Ka0nSKaFoC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=New+Media+and+American+Politics#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
The United States [[President of the United States|Presidential]] [[United States presidential election, 1996|campaign]] in 1996 between sitting-President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]] was one of the first campaigns to utilize the Internet on a national level in the US.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

With so many campaigns using the Internet it raises a significant amount of money in a shorter period of time than with any other method. The web sites are set up like advertising sites – there are links to click on to watch ads, information and background on the candidate, photos from the campaign trail, schedules, donation links, etc. E-mail gives a great low-cost way of connecting with the campaign trail and voters.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] United States [[Presidential election]] between [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]], the Internet was extensively utilized by both candidates. [[Facebook]], an Internet social network, was used heavily to give people the ability to support their views and share information with their friends. Both sent out messages daily to promote themselves and the issues at hand, for leverage against the other candidate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Discussion forums===
[[Blogs]] are a type of website, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Blogging started to become popular at the start of the millennium, and was used mostly by highly educated, highly paid, males. Around 2004 blogging became more mainstream and was typically used for political interaction. Many [[political campaign]]s use this as a stake in monitoring blogs and actively using them to spread information about their candidate.&lt;ref name=Tremayne &gt;{{cite book |title=Blogging, Citizenship, and the future of media |last=Tremayne |first=Mark |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group, LLC |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-97940-4 |page=266 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a6zPnOn9i9oC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet creates a space in which people can voice their opinions and discuss political issues under the protection of anonymity. Some discussion forums are actually groups or organizations that set up discussion for a specific purpose about one issue or person in politics. Some problems with discussion forums include the lack of personal contact, which allows people not to take responsibility for posts, such as personal attacks on others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Bias is another issue of online discussion forums because many websites attract like-minded individuals, making it less likely for alternative perspectives to be introduced.&lt;ref name=Tremayne/&gt;

===Electronic government===
An [[e-Government]] is a government that is inter-networked through digital technology for mass media distribution and communication for voters, taxpayers, schools, hospitals, etc. It has been described{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} as a new way to transform government programs by closing the gap between distance and time. This idea has been said to be a more cost effective and convenient way to form programs around the needs of citizens rather than civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netzhausen.de/internet/indage_bureaucracy_final.pdf |title= The Digital Economy: Promise &amp; Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence

==UK media phone hacking scandal==
{{Main article|News International phone hacking scandal}}
In perhaps what is the beginning of the first major reappraisal of the relationship between a political elite/class and the media in a major modern Western PMC, with respect to the enervation of representative political and legal processes and the consequent erosion of and dangers to the public interest in a Western democracy, is captured in excerpts from three contributions to an emergency three-hour debate&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1534 Column 1534]. ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by members of parliament (MPs) in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on the afternoon of the 6 July 2011.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We politicians have colluded for far too long with the media: we rely on them, we seek their favour, and we live and we die politically because of what they write and what they show, and sometimes that means we lack the courage or the spine to stand up when wrong has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Chris Bryant]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1540 Column 1540] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*As MPs, we depend on the media. We like to be liked by them; we need to be liked by them. We depend on the media, and that applies still more to Governments. It is an unavoidable observation that Parliament has behaved with extraordinary cowardice for many years...&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Zac Goldsmith]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1569 Column 1569] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We are faced with a scandal of expanding proportions, including hacking, allegations of interference in police investigations, and claims that payments have been made to officers. To restore faith and trust in the police and the media, we must lock up the guilty, establish a statutory inquiry, shine a cleansing light on the culture of the media and, if necessary, of the police, and implement the reforms necessary to ensure that the privacy of victims and citizens is never intruded on again. It is clear from today’s debate that this is the will of the House, and we are committed to making it happen.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Tom Brake]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0003.htm/#column_1580 Column 1580] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These comments refer to the apparent effects of the relationships between the members of  (the UK) parliament and those that form the [[UK Government]], the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan police]] and [[News International]] (NI [UK subsidiary of [[News Corporation]] ]) and the influence, expressed as malign, of the latter organization on the former two institutions.

The debate was precipitated by the type of some of the information procurement methods found to have been used by a major British Sunday newspaper (the title is now shut down) – the ''[[News of the World]]'' (was owned by NI). Now known as the (News International) ‘[[News of the World phone hacking affair|phone hacking affair]]’, the consequences&lt;ref&gt;The first major consequence being the [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14070856 closure] of the 168 year old title of the ''News of the World'' from Sunday 10 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; for the British PMC and NI (as part of the world’s second largest media empire after [[The Walt Disney Company]]) are likely to be unfolding for some considerable time as new sectors of vulnerable members of British society subjected to the particular malicious practice are brought to light.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Parliamentary turmoil resulted in the UK government instituting a three-pronged public judicial examination into the relations and interactions between the media and the public, the media and the police and the media and the politicians. Known as the [[Leveson Inquiry]], its findings were published November 29, 2012 based on a spread of around eight months (November 2011 to June 2012) of probing into the relationships. While the Leveson findings are obviously oriented toward the PMC of the UK, some commentators argue that its findings will have global implications through their relevance to similar existing networks in other countries.&lt;ref name="lse1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse3"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson Round-Up: Over Cosy?

==Noam Chomsky reaction==
Naming (as a 'complex')  points of intersection and apparent cooperative benefit, to some degree, of diverse, nominally independent, areas of public faced activity puts us in danger of missing a much more fundamental and general insight according to linguist and dissident [[Noam Chomsky]]. Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary [[conventional wisdom]], with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has also argued that the "two sectors" represent an "innocent fraud")&lt;ref name="galbraith"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bernhut|title=An Interview With John Kenneth Galbraith|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/leadership/an-interview-with-john-kenneth-galbraith|work=Ivey Business Journal|date=May–June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=The myth of the two sectors, the public sector and the private sector... at a time when the private sector has taken over big chunks of the public sector, particularly in military operations and armament, defense budget. That's a very fairly central theme.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has blamed its existence on the [[corporate welfare|"socialization of costs and the privatization of profits"]].

Chomsky discusses the ''[[military-industrial complex]]'' (MIC)&lt;ref name="chomsky1"&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Barsamian|title=War Crimes and Imperial Fantasies|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/200408--.htm|work=International Socialist Review|issue=37|date=September–October 2004|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=...the military-industrial complex, as he (Eisenhower) called it, is actually the core of the modern economy. It’s not specifically military.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the "military" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.

Using the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.

Observing the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).

Chomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.

Chomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.

[[Edward S. Herman]] and Chomsky, together, advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' to accomplish this '[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|manufacturing consent]]', showing the ways in which power and money filter the news and enable governments and dominant private interests to integrate the behavior of the citizenry into the structures of the industrial system. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, "All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news."&lt;ref name="orwell"&gt;{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.

Herman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.

Thus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) – a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.&lt;ref name="chomsky2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.

The shadow that the corporations cast on the media through advertising (corroboration of Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model filters through advertising) was illustrated in the closure of News International's 168-year-old flagship Sunday title, the ''News of the World'', when major advertisers boycotted the paper as a consequence of the 'phone hacking scandal' – the corporations, understandably, not wishing to be seen associated with a paper whose production had been based on frequent engagement in serious criminal activity.&lt;ref name="nowad"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon|last=Rogers|title=Top 50 News of the World advertisers - and what they spend|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jul/06/news-of-the-world-top-50-advertisers-spend |work=The Guardian |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Mason|title=Murdoch: the network defeats the hierarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14093772|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2011|quote=The ''News of the World'' is closing - at least partly due to a strong campaign to make advertisers drop the title, following the latest phone hacking revelations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Chomsky's perspective, then, whatever set of interactions is being named by the term 'politico-media complex' (PMC) simply instantiates the propaganda model to manufacture consent in the service of the industrial system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12900">The relationship between '''psychoanalysis and music''' is as old as the history of [[psychoanalysis]] itself. Psychoanalysts have examined musical phenomena, and the relationship has been reciprocal, as also [[musicology|musicologists]] have applied psychoanalysis to their work. [[Music therapy]], too, has utilized psychoanalytic theories.

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] discussed shortly some musical phenomena in his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1900), but he was more interested in other arts, especially [[literature]] and the [[visual arts]].

Freud’s attitude toward music was ambivalent. Freud described himself as being "ganz unmusikalisch" (totally unmusical).&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1936) Letter to M. Bonaparte, 06.12.36. In letters of Sigmund Freud, 1873-1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his much-protested resistance, he could enjoy certain operas such as ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and he used musical metaphors in the context of theory and therapy.

[[File:MaxGraf.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The musicologist [[Max Graf]], a pioneer of psychoanalytic study of music.]]
Freud seemed to feel uneasy without a guide from the more rational part. To be emotionally moved by something without knowing what was moving him or why, was an intrinsically anxious experience.&lt;ref&gt;Roazen, P. (1975) Freud and his followers. Harmondsworth: Penguin books, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  The operas he listened were "conversational" and "narrative" forms of music, which is theorized, provided him with some kind of "cognitive control" over the emotional impact of the musical sounds. Cheshire argued that maybe he was jealous and feared the potential therapeutic power of music as a rival to [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheshire, N. M. (1996) The empire of the ear: Freud's problem with music. ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 77, 1127-1168.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was up to other early psychoanalysts than Freud to initiate a serious psychoanalytic study of musical phenomena. First of them was the [[musicology|musicologist]] and critic [[Max Graf]] (1873–1958) who presented his views in the "Wednesday meetings" in 1905–1912. Among other pioneers was Desiderius (Dezső) Mosonyi (1888–1945) who published his writings in Hungarian and in German.

The early views of music were reductive and romantic: the composer expresses him- or herself directly in a musical composition;&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, David M. (1993). Freud and Max Graf: On the Psychoanalysis of Music. — ''Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music. Second series'' (eds. Stuart Feder &amp; Richard L. Karmel &amp; George H. Pollock), pp. 279–307. International Universities Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt; the reception of music is regressive.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Stuart — Karmel, Richard L. — Pollock, George H. (1990). Introduction. — ''Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music'' (eds. Stuart Feder &amp; Richard L. Karmel &amp; George H. Pollock), pp. ix–xvii. International Universities Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1950, psychoanalytical musicology started to flourish. Within a few years several studies were published by the French [[André Michel (musicologist)|André Michel]] (1951), [[Ernst Kris]] (1952), [[Anton Ehrenzweig]] (1953), [[Theodor Reik]] (1953), and others.

Theodor Reik (1888–1969) was one of Freud’s earliest students. Reik took up the theme of the "haunting melody" in Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1915–1917) to demonstrate, by contrast to Freud, that musical structure can represent feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Reik's view, [[melody]] can convey emotion far better than words.

Reik showed that music is the voice of the “unknown itself” that may become compulsive in its attempt to convey a secret message.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Reik speculated that the reason [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] material sometimes emerges as a melody rather than as mere thoughts may be that melody better indicates moods and unknown feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', pp. 17–15.&lt;/ref&gt; He did demonstrate that [[songs]] on the [[mind]] could be effectively interacted with in a psychotherapeutic fashion in a way that helped resolve repressed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flow of studies and articles from the latter part of the twentieth century was summarised in the two-volume essay collection ''Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music'' (1990–1993).

==Modes of approach==
From a methodological point of view, there are several approaches visible in the psychoanalytical study of music and psychoanalytically inspired musicology:&lt;ref&gt;Lång, Markus (2004). ''Psykoanalyysi ja sen soveltaminen musiikintutkimukseen'', pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Introspective studies examine one's musically induced experiences and their relations to the unconscious processes.
# Biographical studies examine musicians' and composers' (auto)biographies and descriptions of musical experiences.
# Psychoanalyses of musical patients are discussed.
# Musical experiences are explained with theories of early personal development.
# The elements of [[opera]] (including the hall, staging, plot, the human voice) have been examined.
# Study of [[film music]].
# Analyses of musical compositions, without reference to the personality of the composer.
# In [[music therapy]], how to lift repressions and work them through.
# In cultural studies, the beliefs, conceptions, and habits related to music can be analyzed to reveal unconscious meanings and thought patterns.

== Future: psychoanalysis, neuroscience and music ==
Recent developments in [[cognitive neuroscience of music]] have led to a new way of looking at [[music and emotion]]. Neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] states that music occupies more areas of the [[brain]] than [[language]] does, and that humans are primarily a musical species.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, O. (2007). ''Musicophilia, tales of music and the brain'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborating on this idea, psychoanalyst [[Gilbert Rose]] argues that our responsiveness to music begins with the [[nonverbal]] emotional rapport of the earliest [[infant–parent interplay]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. J. (2004). ''Psychoanalysis, Music, Art and Neuroscience'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reaching back even further, since the [[fetus]] has an active auditory system 3–4 months before [[birth]], the [[rhythm]] of the mothers [[womb]] and the sound of her heartbeat could be the start of our responsiveness to music.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. J. (2004).: ''Psychoanalysis, Music, Art and Neuroscience'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroscientist]] [[Antonio Damasio]] states that when an organism interacts with an object, [[nonverbal]] neural images map the [[organism]], the object and the [[interaction]] between them.&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A. (1999). ''The feeling of what happens.'' New York: Harcourt Brace.&lt;/ref&gt; As psychoanalysis gives verbal insight of non-verbal emotional involvement, and recent [[neurosciences]] found that music is able to contact this non-verbal emotions, music is stated to help the unison of thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. J. (2004). ''Psychoanalysis, Music, Art and Neuroscience'', pp. xxx–xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The influence of psychoanalysis on music==
Although psychoanalysis has had some influence on [[Psychoanalysis and literature|literature]] and [[Psychoanalytical film theory|cinema]] since the early 20th century, it is more difficult to discern whether musical compositions have been actually inspired or influenced by psychoanalysis.

One candidate has been put up by [[Erik W. Tawaststjerna]]: in his biography of [[Jean Sibelius]], he repeatedly emphasizes the psychological and even psychoanalytical dimensions of Sibelius' [[Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)|Fourth Symphony]] (1911). According to Tawaststjerna, the Symphony reflects the psychoanalytical and introspective era when Freud and [[Henri Bergson]] stressed the meaning of the unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Tawaststjerna, Erik (1989). ''Jean Sibelius 3'', pp. 8, 239, 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Sibelius himself called his composition "a psychological symphony".&lt;ref&gt;Tawaststjerna, Erik (1989). ''Jean Sibelius 3'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, the psychiatrist [[Christian Sibelius]] (1869–1922), was one of the first scholars to discuss psychoanalysis in [[Finland]]. According to Tawaststjerna, the Fourth Symphony is "one of the most remarkable documents of the psychoanalytical era."&lt;ref&gt;Tawaststjerna, Erik (1989). ''Jean Sibelius 3'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ratchet''' ('''Mécano''' in [[Québec]], '''Racsni''' in [[Hungary]], '''Храповик''' in [[Russia]] and '''Doc''' in [[Italy]]) is the chief medic of the Autobots in the [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] [[Transformers series#The Transformers|television]] and [[Transformers (comics)|comic]] series based on the popular [[Transformers (toy line)|toyline]] produced by [[Takara]] and [[Hasbro]]. His vehicle mode is an [[ambulance]]. He was named after [[Nurse Ratched]] by writer [[Bob Budiansky]], who originally intended the character to be female, an idea rejected by Hasbro. Ratchet is well-remembered by fans of the original comic series, in which he played a major role.

Ratchet would transform into an ambulance (cargo van type) and was colored white with red stripes and emergency lights. Ratchet had two robot modes, though only one was usually seen in the comic run and the television cartoon. Ratchet was one of the original and the longest-lived of all Transformers in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] ''[[Transformers (comics)|Transformers]]'' comic series. Often a fan favorite, he was a healer first, but a soldier nonetheless. His courage and loyalty are demonstrated time and again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transformers Identification and Price Guide|last=Bellemo|first=Mark|year=2007|publisher= Krause Publications|ISBN=978-0-89689-445-7|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Comics===
Ratchet made his first appearance in issue #1 of the Marvel Comics ''Transformers'' comic book series. Originally this was intended to be a 4-issue series, but became a monthly series that ultimately lasted 80 issues.

Ratchet play prominent roles in the comic. When the rest of the Autobots are incapacitated Ratchet defeats multiple Decepticons and pushes [[Megatron]] off a cliff. Later Ratchet seemingly dies fighting Megatron but the two were later revealed to have merged. The two were separated and put into stasis before being accidentally revived. Ratchet is killed when he crashes the Ark into Earth to kill [[Galvatron]], Megatron, and [[Starscream]].

Although there was no Ratchet toy for ''[[Transformers: Generation 2|Generation Two]]'', Ratchet did make several appearances in the memories of [[Optimus Prime]] in the ''Generation Two'' comic book series by Marvel Comics. Despite being dead, he would make two flashback appearances - one in his fused form with Megatron, and the other showing him protecting two humans, likely [[Witwicky family#Buster Witwicky|Buster Witwicky]] and his girlfriend Jesse.

===Animated series===
Ratchet was the Autobot medic, and therefore he seldom was ever seen in battle. He usually spent time at the Autobot base with Autobot scientist [[Wheeljack]] creating and repairing other Autobots. The two of them were credited for creating the [[Dinobots]] in an attempt to bolster their ranks versus the Decepticons.

Ratchet was eventually killed in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' in an attack by the Decepticons on an Autobot shuttle. The Decepticons penetrated the hull of the shuttle that he, [[Ironhide]], [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], and [[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]] were flying in. Ironhide and Ratchet attacked the invaders together after Prowl and Brawn's deaths. The two suffered the same amount of fire from the Decepticons; due to Ironhide's strong armor, he survived the first strike but ultimately died. Ratchet, on the other hand, was killed easily. He is later mentioned dead by [[Daniel Witwicky]] in the Autobot Mausoleum in the season 3 episode "Dark Awakening". Luckily, his role as medic is taken by [[Junkion]] leader [[Wreck-Gar]], who formed an alliance with the Autobots, and [[First Aid (Transfomers)|First Aid]] of the [[Protectobot]]s.

===Books===
Ratchet was featured in the 1985 Transformers audio books [[List of Transformers books#Autobots' Lightning Strike|Autobots' Lightning Strike]], ''[[List of Transformers books#Autobots Fight Back|Autobots Fight Back]]'', ''Laserbeak's Fury'' and [[List of Transformers books#Satellite of Doom|Satellite of Doom]].

Ratchet appeared in the 1985 story ''[[Autobots Fight Back]]'' by [[John Grant (children's author)|John Grant]], published by [[Ladybird Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| isbn=0-7214-0942-3|last=Grant|first=John|title=Autobots Fight Back|publisher=Ladybird Books| year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dreamwave Productions===
Ratchet appeared in much the same capacity as he did in the TV series, acting as the Autobots' chief medic. Joining the Autobot faction at the outbreak of the civil war, Ratchet accompanied [[Optimus Prime (Transformers)|Optimus Prime]] to search for survivors in part of Iacon city after [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] had activated the planetary engines. He later remained with the Autobots under [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] after Optimus Prime's disappearance in a Space Bridge accident.

[[File:Csratchet-cobra.jpg|left|thumb|Ratchet as a Cobra HiSS tank]]
In this reimagining of the ''Generation One'' story, the Ark was discovered by the terrorist Cobra organization, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. In this storyline Ratchet turned into a Cobra HiSS tank.&lt;ref&gt;"G.I.Joe Vs. Transformers" #3 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second series, he appeared as "The Autobot", the sole Autobot guardian of a future Earth overrun by Decepticons. This Ratchet had been changed by his experiences, ruthlessly gunning down several Decepticons and even destroying one in hand-to-hand-combat. He is located by a team of G.I. Joes trying to repair the damage done by the time-displaced Transformers. They forcibly teleported him back to Cybertron - where he was promptly gunned down by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. This Ratchet had reverted to his traditional ambulance-themed body.

He evidently survived, as he appeared again in the third series as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force attempting to rescue Optimus Prime.

===Fun Publications===
Ratchet also appeared as a remold of Energon [[Towline]] for the ''[[Transformers: Timelines]] series''. His function is Chief Medical Officer and his motto is "''You break it, I'll remake it.''"

The ''[[Transformers Classics]]'' comics published in the Official Transformers Collectors Club magazine are set in the Marvel Comics continuity, but in a timeline where the events of ''Generation 2'' did not occur. Ratchet's seemingly lifeless body appears behind Megatron's throne.

===IDW Publishing===
Ratchet plays a significant role in [[IDW Publishing|IDW]]'s new G1 continuity. His updated form is an ambulance that bears a close resemblance to a Dodge Sprinter Van. In [[The Transformers: Infiltration]], he picks up three humans who have evidence of their presence on Earth, protecting them from [[Thundercracker]] and the [[Battlechargers]]. He clashes with [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] over the issue of the humans and calling in [[Optimus Prime]]. Disobeying orders alongside [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], he is wounded in battle with [[Skywarp]] and [[Blitzwing]] (at one point being run over by the [[Triple Changer]]'s tank mode), but recovers before the end of the limited series.

He reappears in the subsequent series ''[[The Transformers: Escalation]]'', discovering that the "corpse" of [[Sunstreaker]] was in fact a fake. He disobeyed orders once again to let Verity and Jimmy find the location of the decoy's manufacturer - but was interrupted by [[Ironhide]]. However, instead of stopping them, Ironhide accompanied them to find the garage that had made the \fake Sunstreaker. However, when the two humans failed to reappear, Ironhide went in personally, while Ratchet warned him of approaching police. With Verity and Jimmy out cold, Ratchet assisted in cutting open the ceiling of hidden room they were in. While they saved the humans, Ironhide was too slow in getting out, and was destroyed by the blast.

Ratchet appeared in the ''[[New Avengers/Transformers]]'' crossover by Marvel Comics and IDW Publishing in 2007.

Optimus Prime leads Bumblebee, [[Drift (Transformers)|Drift]], [[Kup (Transformers)|Kup]], Prowl, Ratchet and [[Wheeljack]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] when a Cybertronian ship crashes containing [[Galvatron]], [[Cyclonus]], [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] and an infestation of zombies from another universe. Galvatron attempts to take command of the Autobots, and after fighting them explains his mission to stop an undead infestation. Wheeljack sets up an energy shield around the city to keep the infestation contained, but it will only last for 24 hours. Kup recognizes a Decepticon named Bayonet in Galvatron's command as not being right, and she is revealed to be the extradimensional vampire Britt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning| penciller = Nick Roche| inker = Joana Lafuente| story = | title = Transformers: Infestation| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = February 2011| publisher = IDW Publishing| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolutions: Hearts of Steel====
An alternate version of Ratchet would appear in IDW's [[The Transformers: Evolutions|Hearts of Steel]]. Here he seems to be willing to follow Prowl's lead in not contacting the humans, However, when [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]]'s plan is discovered Ratchet followed Bumblebee's lead in following the Decepticon train convoy, and was present at their defeat. Following this, he and the other Autobots went back into stasis.

===Other Media===
Ratchet appears in the 2003 video game ''[[Transformers (2003 video game)|Transformers]]'', voiced by Jack Merluzzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maru-z.com/Maru_Z/Narration.html|title=Narration|website=maru-z.com|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratchet appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Junk in the Trunk" voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]. In the segment he's in, he tells Optimus that he has prostate cancer and that he will die. It turns out that it was just a segment acted out by the Autobots.

In the 2007 [[Transformers (film)|live action film]], Ratchet appears as a [[LAFD]] Search and Rescue [[Hummer H2]]. As always, Ratchet is the medical officer of the Autobots. According to the official movie site, Ratchet believes the conflict can be solved peacefully, without any violence. However he still carries out Optimus Prime's orders, even if it means use of force.

Ratchet is armed with a heavy machine gun and a saw. Ratchet also has an assortment of other tools at his disposal; in the movie, he uses a red laser to scan and try to calibrate Bumblebee's voicebox as they are introduced to Sam Witwicky and [[Mikaela Banes]]. He has an enhanced sense of smell. According to the book ''Transformers - Meet The Autobots'' by [[Jennifer Frantz]], Ratchet has [[X-ray vision]]. According to the Transformers U.K. magazine Ratchet can produce a "chameleon" effect with his surface photo-electric cells allowing him to blend with his environment.

The official guide to the ''Transformers'' video game says he's 20 feet tall. The ''Transformers'' U.K. magazine states he is 20 feet 1&amp;nbsp;inch tall, weighs 6.7 tons and has a maximum speed of 230&amp;nbsp;mph. It also states he can "''haul/push 20 times his own weight''", which is 134 tons.

The vehicles used for [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Ironhide]], [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], and Ratchet were put on display by GM at the 2007 [[Detroit River Walk]] Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Transformers Movie Update: We Have An Exclusive Robogasm With Ironhide, Bumblebee, Jazz And Ratchet | publisher = Jalopnik | date = 2007-06-22 | url = http://jalopnik.com/cars/robots-in-disguise/transformers-movie-update-we-have-an-exclusive-robogasm-with-ironhide-bumblebee-jazz-and-ratchet-271505.php | accessdate = 2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One early concept sketch of Ratchet shown by Hasbro at [[BotCon]] 2007 had him as a red ambulance with white and black detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scream01.deviantart.com/art/Concept-art-on-Ratchet-59022052 |title=Concept art on Ratchet by *Scream01 on deviantART |publisher=Scream01.deviantart.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later used for the character of [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]].

In the sequel ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', Ratchet's color scheme is revised, sporting green and white colors with "E4" printed on his side panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-movie-just-movie-31/another-new-transformers-3-robot-face--a-red-head-on-a-stick-170318/ TFW2005.com - Another New Transformers 3 Robot Face: A Red Head on a Stick]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titan Magazines===
Note: Events occurring in the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle of Mission City are in ''italics''.

A character bio on Ratchet also revealed more of his pre-war days. Apparently a politician with a flair for cutting through bureaucracy, Ratchet was appointed as go-between for [[Optimus Prime]] and the High Council of Ancients. When war broke out Ratchet tried to act as a peacemaker, but was nearly killed by Megatron for it. Rebuilt, Ratchet served as a medical officer for the Autobots.

''In "Twilight's Last Greaming" part 3 Ironhide and Ratchet sneak into the Decepticon Allspark Power Distribution Hub in [[Savannah, Georgia]] disguised as Payload style drones. Although they believe the stolen code they used got them inside safely, once there they are ambushed by [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]], who says that the code didn't work and he let them in so he could fight them. In part 4 Ratchet and Ironhide continued fighting Bonecrusher in Savannah, but didn't stand much of a chance until they were joined by [[Arcee]], [[Armorhide|Armoride]] and [[Longarm (Transformers)|Longarm]], arriving from the moon.''

===Books===
Ratchet appeared in the prequel novel ''[[Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday]]'', where his personality was similar to that of G1 Ratchet. He was part of Prime's Autobot team searching for the Allspark, and was left onboard [[Ark (Transformers)|the Ark]] to cover the Autobots' rear in the battle, stopping [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]] from entering the hangar bay. He later saved Ironhide and Jazz by opening fire and distracting the Decepticons long enough for them to get aboard. He was unable to stop [[Scorponok]] from getting aboard and sabotaging the engines, although Ratchet furiously chased the insectoid Decepticon off. In the final battle, he and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] double-teamed [[Barricade (Transformers)|Barricade]], but were unable to stop Starscream from destroying the human ship Ghost-1.

Ratchet appears as a character in the book [[Transformers: Dark of the Moon The Junior Novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-316-18629-2 |title=Transformers: Dark of the Moon The Junior Novel |publisher=Ballantine Little, Brown Books for Young Readers |year=2011 |first=Michael |last=Kelly }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in films===
{{main|Transformers (film)|Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Transformers: Age of Extinction}}
Arriving on Earth at the same time as [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#2007 Transformers film|Optimus Prime]], [[Jazz (Transformers)#2007 Transformers movie|Jazz]] and [[Ironhide#2007 Transformers film|Ironhide]], Ratchet crash-lands outside a local diner. Ratchet quickly scans a yellow emergency [[Hummer H2]] and re-configures his protoform to a new camouflaged form before meeting up with the other [[Autobot]]s at [[Bumblebee (Transformers)#2007 Transformers film|Bumblebee]]'s location. During the Autobots' introductions, Ratchet unintentionally embarrasses Sam in front of Mikaela, not fully understanding human social rules yet, commenting on Sam's desire to have sex with Mikeala by using his enhanced senses. The Autobots then return to Sam's house and retrieve a pair of glasses owned by Sam's great-grandfather, Captain [[Witwicky family#Archibald Witwicky|Archibald Witwicky]] (the glasses have the location to the "[[Allspark#2007 Transformers movie|Allspark]]" engraved on them) whilst attempting to hide from Sam's parents, which results in his mother's and father's prized gardens being destroyed by Prime's massive feet. Ratchet also accidentally gets entangled in power lines, knocking him to the ground and causing a blackout in the neighborhood. Sam finds the glasses, but before he can hand them over to the Autobots, agents of Sector 7, suddenly arrive at his home and arrest Sam and Mikaela, and later capture Bumblebee. After Bumblebee's capture, when the Autobots are discussing the location of the Allspark and their war with the Decepticons for acquiring it first, Optimus states that he intends to unite the Cube with his spark. Ratchet warns him that the Cube's raw power would destroy them both. Ratchet plays a large role in the final battle, where he, Jazz and Ironhide first battle [[Brawl (Transformers)#2007 Transformers movie|Brawl]], then assists Ironhide in providing cover for Sam against Blackout and Brawl as the latter tries to escape with the Allspark. Ratchet and Ironhide also engage [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]], who disables both of the Autobots, leaving Sam to reach his destination building alone. Ratchet survives the battle and is seen along with Ironhide, Bumblebee, and Optimus Prime watching the sunset at the end of the film.

Ratchet appears in the [[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|sequel]]. Ratchet first appears for a brief moment when the Autobots go back to the NEST headquarters. He arrives with the other Autobot reinforcements after Optimus's death, and is later seen with the other Autobots when they are placed under arrest. He expresses a need to leave Earth, which Ironhide objects to on behalf of Optimus. He is then seen in the battle at Egypt fighting with the soldiers against the Decepticons and, with the help of [[Jolt (Transformers)|Jolt]], he repairs Optimus with [[Jetfire]]'s body.

Ratchet appears in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''. He is first seen accompanying Optimus Prime when they arrive in Chernobyl. He is present in the meeting at the NEST base when Optimus decides to go to the moon. Optimus and Ratchet wind up on the moon and retrieve [[Sentinel Prime|Sentinel Prime's]] body and his pillars from the ''Ark'' and bring them back to Earth. He is present when Optimus revives Sentinel with the [[Matrix of Leadership]]. Ratchet is also seen leaving with the rest of the Autobots on the Xantium and is present when Optimus and the rest of the Autobots return. Ratchet provides cover fire for the humans alongside [[Mirage (Transformers)|Dino]], [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]], and Bumblebee during the final battle. He also battles Sentinel Prime alongside Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]] and is at one point seen shooting down a Decepticon that is on top of a building. When Sam calls for help after he kills [[Dylan Gould]], Ratchet responds and shoots the Control Pillar several times before Bumblebee crashes through and destroys it. Ratchet is one of the surviving Autobots at the end of the movie, complimenting Bumblebee's bravery in battle.

Ratchet appears in ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction]]''. Five years after the battle in Chicago the human governments have become fearful of all Transformers and begun hunting all of them down, forcing all of the Autobots to disband and go into hiding, Ratchet included. Ratchet is soon found by human soldiers and though he tries to escape, he is badly injured. Ratchet tries to reason with James Savoy, leader of the soldiers, but he refuses, revealing he lost a relative in Chicago. Moments later, the Cybertronian mercenary, [[Lockdown (Transformers)|Lockdown]], working with the humans, questions Ratchet for Optimus Prime's location, but Ratchet refuses to give in, resulting in [[Lockdown (Transformers)|Lockdown]] tearing out Ratchet's spark, killing the Autobot. Later, his body is disassembled and taken to the KSI research labs for use in the production of man-made Transformers. While infiltrating the facility, Cade Yeager becomes appalled when he discovers Ratchet's head being melted for raw materials. Ratchet's death deeply affects Optimus who tries to kill the humans who were responsible. Ratchet is avenged when Optimus kills Attinger and Lockdown at the film's climax.

===Cyber Missions===
Ratchet is shown to be fighting his enemy, [[Lockdown (Transformers)|Lockdown]].

===Video games===
Ratchet was not among the playable characters in the 2007 console Transformers game, but was playable in the Nintendo DS versions. He made a fully playable appearance in the ''Revenge of the Fallen'' video game by Activision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/video-games-17/official-images-from-transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-game-167565/ |title=Official Images from Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Game - Transformers News |publisher=Tfw2005.com |date=2009-05-14 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the Nintendo DS version of the game Ratchet guides the player through training, and never appears in the game itself, other than talking to the other characters.

Ratchet is among the characters who appear in the ''TRANSFORMERS CYBERVERSE Battle Builder Game''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/en_US/play/details.cfm?R=E4651B16-5056-900B-1074-AA6D591357D5:en_US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformers: The Veiled Threat===
Ratchet appeared in the second film's prequel novel ''Transformers: The Veiled Threat''. He was present when [[Somali pirates]] attempted to take the freighter ship he and Ironhide were traveling on, the latter of the two scaring off the pirates by transforming. He later battled the Decepticon Dropkick in at the [[Zambezi river]] in Africa, and soon saved a dam from falling by raising his external body heat high enough to repair the cracks in the dam. Some time later, he ventured to Italy and fought Deadend and [[Swindle (Transformers)|Swindle]], and soon took on Starscream, who as always, fled the scene soon afterward.

Ratchet appears in the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' series.

Ratchet has retractable magnets in his arms which can attract or repel metal, as well as projecting a protective wall of magnetic force. The magnets can also function as rudimentary pincer claws. As of episode 7, "Thrill of the Hunt", Ratchet has an EMP Generator that can overload a Transformer's systems to enable him to patch them up without causing them pain, which he doesn't bring into battle until "Transwarped". His personality appears more based on G1's [[List of Autobots#Cars|Kup]] than the original Ratchet. He is the oldest of the main Autobot cast of the series and the only one who actually fought against Decepticons in the Great War.

It should also be noted that he along with his toy have the same transformation and accuracy that of the G1 Trailbreaker.

===Animated series===
As revealed in "Thrill of the Hunt", Ratchet was assigned by [[Ultra Magnus (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Ultra Magnus]] to rescue an intelligence officer, [[Arcee#Transformers Animated|Arcee]], and retrieve access codes vital to the war effort, when he ran into a Decepticon bounty hunter, [[Lockdown (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Lockdown]]. Lockdown captured both of them, and took Ratchet's EMP Generator as a trophy. Arcee requested that Ratchet use the generator at full blast to wipe her memory, erasing the access codes in the process. Ratchet did so, but Lockdown's interference overloaded it, completely erasing Arcee's memory. Attempting to restore her memory, Ratchet accidentally uploaded the access codes Arcee was carrying. When Highbrow notices this, he has Ultra Magnus bring Ratchet before the inactive [[Omega Supreme#Transformers Animated|Omega Supreme]], with Ratchet taking Arcee's place in teaching Omega prior to being introduced to battle. But in the aftermath of war, with Arcee still in stasis and Omega's near death in the final fight, Ratchet became the bitter war veteran that he is today.

Many years later, Ratchet became the crew member of the Autobot ship that Omega's body was converted into prior to it crashing onto Earth. There, Ratchet eventually ran into Lockdown again, having him painfully remember the incident which caused Arcee to lose her memory. During the events that transpired, Ratchet retrieved his EMP Generator from Lockdown while saving [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Optimus Prime]] from him, giving him some closure. However, when [[Blitzwing#Transformers Animated|Blitzwing]] and [[Lugnut (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Lugnut]] came to Earth, Ratchet admitted to [[Sari Sumdac|Sari]], who was against the Autobots leaving the planet in hopes of getting the Deceptions to pursue them, that he had no intention to see someone else suffer because of their war. After being ordered later by Prime to take away Sari's key, Ratchet heads to the ship and protect the [[Allspark]], but before he could get there, he was ambushed by Blitzwing and Lugnut, the former freezing him before ripping off most of Ratchet's right arm to get the key. After freeing himself, Ratchet reports to Optimus who tells him to enter the ship and protect the Allspark anyway. After making the ship airborne again, Ratchet managed to save Sari from Blackarachnia and then the rest of his team and Issac Sumdac, teaming up with Bumblebee and Prowl to fight Blitzwing.

In "Garbage In, Garbage Out", Ratchet encountered the newly created Transformer, [[Wreck-Gar#Transformers Animated|Wreck-Gar]]. Initially rebuffing the scatterbrained machine, when it became clear that the trash-eating nanobots he was carrying would destroy the entire city, Ratchet was forced to do that which, in his own words, "''requires more courage than anything I've ever done in my entire Autobot career''": apologizing. Ratchet convinced Wreck-Gar that he could be anything he wanted, even a hero, and the junk-bot removed the nanobots, only to sink into the river.

In the "A Bridge Too Close" two-parter, Ratchet, with Sari's help, managed to bring Omega Supreme back to life, only to be saddened to see his friend once again sacrifice himself to save everyone. During "Transwarped", Ratchet plays a large role in the story, and is infuriated when the other Autobots "choose" Sari's key over him when it comes to fixing things. But after saving Bumblebee after getting severely damaged by an out-of-control Sari, Ratchet attempts talk to Omega in regaining control over himself from [[Starscream#Transformers Animated|Starscream]].

In "Human Error", Ratchet, along with the Autobots, are trapped in a virtual world by [[Soundwave (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Soundwave]]. There, the Autobots take human forms. Ratchet is portrayed as a medium-built Caucasian with gray hair in his 60s.

In "This is Why I Hate Machines", Ratchet and Captain Fanzone arrive on Cybertron through Bulkhead's Space Bridge, just as Omega Supreme (containing Megatron, Starscream, and Lugnut) transwarps to there as well. Ratchet then fruitlessly attempts to stop Sentinel Prime from firing on his old friend, and flees the scene with Fanzone. With help from Jazz, the duo find the lair of Shockwave, who was in hiding all this time. After a duel, in which Shockwave reveals his intentions to get Omega's access codes from Arcee herself, Ratchet retells his tale to Fanzone, and battles Shockwave once more, only for Sentinel to interfere again. Shockwave escapes with Arcee, and Ratchet and Fanzone return to Earth with Ultra Magnus's hammer and Jazz, who wished no further part in Sentinel's government. Despite Perceptor assuring Ratchet that Shockwave can't get Arcee's codes, as the damage is beyond repair, on board Omega, who transwarped to the Moon, Arcee says Ratchet's name, implying she may indeed remember after all.

In the series finale, he helped facilitate Optimus's jet-pack upgrade, and later ventured to the Moon with Bulkhead, Bumblebee, and Sari. There, he and Sari returned Arcee's memories, with Arcee helping them regain control of Omega Supreme. After the battle, they all returned to Cybertron with the captured Megatron, Omega, and Prowl's body, greeted as superheroes one and all.

===IDW Publishing===
Set shortly after the events of "Total Meltdown" was the ''Transformers: Animated'' comic issue #2 by [[IDW Publishing]]. In it Bumblebee and Prowl apprehended the [[Angry Archer]] as the villain attempted to steal money from a used car salesman. In doing so they revealed the holographic trickery of the Detroit super hero known as [[The Wraith (Transformers)|The Wraith]]. With the secret of his power revealed The Wraith lost much of the respect he used to command in Detroit. The Wraith attempted to stop [[Cyrus "The Colossus" Rhodes]] from escaping prison, but was unable to fool the villain now that the secret was public, forcing the Autobots to stop the Rhodes and making The Wraith look foolish. The Wraith then attempted to discredit Bumblebee at a college football game by trapping the Autobot with a car boot and using his holograms to make a fake Bumblebee attack the stadium. Bumblebee eventually escaped and the other Autobots helped him capture The Wraith and he was placed in a mental institution.

This Ratchet is an evil mirror universe version of his ''Generation 1'' self. He likes to give his patients unnecessary weapon modification, whether they want it or not.

===Fun Publications===
An evil version of Ratchet first appeared in the [[Fun Publications]] fiction ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dinobots]]''. He is placed in charge of reformatting [[Wheeljack]] into an Earth-vehicle mode, then later repairs [[Rodimus]]' hand (by replacing it with a saw-weapon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[S.

Although not depicted directly, Ratchet is one of the many Autobots aboard the Ark in ''[[Do Over (Transformers)|Do Over]]''. The Ark launches from Cybertron for Earth under the command of Rodimus and is followed by the Decepticon ship Nemesis, under the command of [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]]. While battling over Earth it is shot down by human defense systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[S.

Ratchet later appears in the six part story Another light (which is based of [[The Transformers: The Movie|The Transformers: the Movie]]) where he takes part in the battle for Decepticon City. During the battle Ratchet is baldy wounded, so when the Autobots retreat aboard Sky Lynx, the Autobots are told that they must dump some weight. As Ratchet along with [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], [[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]] and [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]] are the most baldy wounded, they along with Optimus are jettisoned by Rodimus into space. While drifting though space they are found by [[Unicron]] and are reformatted, with Ratchet and Inferno becoming the Autotroopers with Prowl reformatted in Checkpoint becoming his leader.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratchet is among the Autobots on Earth in ''[[Blitzwing Bop]]''.

Ratchet is one of the main group of Autobots in the 2010 computer animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-prime-39/botcon-2010-transformers-prime-panel-coverage-170054/ TFW2005.com - BotCon 2010 ''Transformers: Prime'' Panel Coverage]&lt;/ref&gt; His robotic appearance and attitude is similar to his Transformers Animated character.

This emergency medical truck is the Autobots' medic. Ratchet fixes limbs and gears, and he works to make do with less and less Energon. He knows Optimus Prime best, but he doesn't want the Autobots risking their necks to protect humans, or bringing them into the secret base. Deep down, though, Ratchet admires what the humans bring to the fight.

One of the few Autobots longing to return to Cybertron, Ratchet devised a version of the Space Bridge he dubbed the "Ground Bridge," allowing him and the other Autobots to go anywhere around the world where a Decepticon is sighted. Out of the other Autobots, Ratchet appears to be the less thrilled about the three young humans. A running gag is him yelling "I needed that!" because most of his needed items get broken, mostly by Bulkhead.&lt;ref&gt;Transformers Prime episodes #1 and 2 "Darkness Rising Parts 1 and 2"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Ratchet appears as a playable Autobot character in the 2010 video game ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]''. In the Autobot campaign, Ratchet is among the first Autobots to team up with [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers: Prime|Optimus]], following the fall of [[Zeta Prime]]. Later, he is assigned to repair the liberated [[Omega Supreme#Transformers: War for Cybertron|Omega Supreme]].

Ironhide and Ratchet appear in ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron#Nintendo DS versions|Transformers: War for Cybertron - Autobots]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]]. They are unlocked as player characters upon completing the ''Retaking Iacon'' mission.

===Animated series===
Ratchet was a regularly appearing character in the ''Transformer: Prime'' animated series.

In the "Darkness Rising" opening five-parter, when one of his broken tools is animated into a primal Transformer, he and Optimus decide that Megatron has brought Dark Energon to Earth in order to conquer the planet with an army of the undead Cybertronians. He and Optimus go to an ancient battlefield on Earth, where Megatron mockingly refers to Ratchet as Optimus' "trusty watchdog", believing the old medic should've been dead a long time ago. Ratchet battles a small army of undead Cybertronians with Optimus, breaking his arm in the process as a result.

As the season goes on, Ratchet more often plays a "tech support" sort of role, minding the base and the ground bridge. Despite his earlier verbal hostility towards the humans, Ratchet clearly grows to care for the three children, as evidenced in "Scrapheap" (when he warmly pays tribute to the children's efforts in containing the swarm of Scraplets), "Convoy" (when he is adamantly against Jack and Miko going to fend off MECH), and "Out of His Head" (when he eventually relents and allows Raf to join him in finding Bumblebee). Ratchet often takes the role of leadership when Optimus isn't around ("Scrapheap", "Sick Mind"), and appears to be Optimus' best friend and second in command, declaring that he's known Optimus longer than the other members of Team Prime. By "One Shall Fall", he proves he has grown to fully care for the children as members of their team, when he is in despair he is at unable to treat the dark energon-infected Raf, furious that the Autobots have adopted the children into their lives, yet he knows so little of their science or medicine; stating he has "grown to need [Raf]." Ratchet angrily protests against not only taking the Groundbridge to the Earth's core where Unicron resides, but also allying with Megatron. Nevertheless, he obtains the necessary coordinates from Megatron, and sends Optimus, Bumblebee, Arcee, Bulkhead, and Megatron to the Earth's core, while he remains behind with Team Prime's human allies. Ratchet grimly realizes that Optimus gave the Key to Vector Sigma to Jack because he does not believe he will survive the encounter.

In the second season three-part premiere "Orion Pax", Ratchet decides that Optimus surrendered not only the wisdom of the Prime's when he defeated Unicron, but also his own memories, reverting to his Orion Pax persona. Ratchet informs the others of Optimus' contingency plan: download the wisdom of the Prime's to the Key to Vector Sigma from Vector Sigma itself, a task that falls to Jack as Optimus entrusted him with the relic. Ratchet takes leadership of the Autobots, and thanks to a tip from Starscream, the Autobots take and hold the Decepticons' space bridge, and fend off Megatron long enough for Jack to return with the restored Matrix of Leadership, and restore Orion Pax back to being Optimus Prime.

In the "Operation: Bumblebee" two-parter, Ratchet reveals to Raf that he was the field medic who saved Bumblebee's life following the scout's interrogation from Megatron, but clearly deeply regrets not being able to repair Bumblebee's voice box. In the second of two episodes, out of guilt, Ratchet decides to give his own T-cog to Bumblebee as he had no personal use for his, and to make up for not fixing Bumblebee's voice box. He chooses Arcee to perform the operation, but it is put on halt while Ratchet is in stasis, and the Autobots search for the next Iacon relic. Bumblebee also goes on a mission to attack MECH's headquarters for his T-cog, which is destroyed by Starscream. Ratchet repairs Bumblebee's T-cog as he would not accept the transplant, and to his surprise, the T-cog works, leaving Ratchet with newfound confidence in himself.

During the search for Iacon relics, Ratchet is sent with Wheeljack to search for the Resonance Blaster. Ratchet is irritated at Wheeljack's uncouth nature and lack of respect. When Wheeljack is able to shoot Laserbeak down, Ratchet decides to take advantage of the situation and plant a virus in Laserbeak, which will allow them to download the Iacon database from the ''Nemesis''. Ratchet succeeds in the endeavor, and gains Wheeljack's respect, but his joy is cut short when Bulkhead returns mortally wounded from his mission. Ratchet is able to save Bulkhead's life, but is disgusted to learn that Wheeljack took Miko along to kill Hardshell, ruining the mutual respect they had forged. Ratchet later makes it clear he considers Wheeljack a rogue after endangering Miko in the "revenge stunt". Ratchet supervises Bulkhead's recovery and is later elated to learn of the Autobots' potential restoration of Cybertron. However, Optimus is forced to destroy the Omega Lock and any hope of restoring their home with it. Ratchet has an emotional breakdown, lamenting the sheer amount of losses and sacrifices they've had. The base comes under attack by Megatron, and after evacuating the team, Ratchet sets out on his own while Optimus remains behind, believing Optimus to be sacrificing himself to save the team.

Ratchet is initially despondent over the loss of the base, Cybertron, and Optimus, but soon rallies around Raf and Bumblebee, as they use the ''Harbinger'' as a temporary base. They are soon met by [[Ultra Magnus]], the other Autobots (minus Smokescreen and Optimus), and their human allies. Ratchet coordinates Ultra Magnus' assault on Darkmount, and is elated to learn of Optimus' return. The Autobots are successful in destroying Darkmount and are given a new base by Agent Fowler. Ratchet assures Smokescreen that he made the right choice in depleting the Forge of Solus Prime's power to restore Optimus to life. With their Energon supplies at a critical low after the loss of their old base, Ratchet works to recreate synthetic Energon with little success. Ratchet is kidnapped by Soundwave and brought to Megatron, who asks for his aid in recreating synthetic Energon. Though Ratchet is vehemently against aiding the leader of the Decepticons, he is eventually convinced when Megatron is successful in taking advantage of his love of Cybertron, and agrees to help the Decepticons. Ratchet works with Knock Out and Shockwave, but is informed of the Decepticons' scheme to massacre the Predacons by Knock Out. Ratchet later attempts to sabotage the synthetic Energon and escape the ''Nemesis'', but is caught and thrown to [[Predaking]]. Ratchet is nearly killed before he reveals Megatron's treachery to Predaking, who spares him and goes after Megatron. Ratchet lets the other Autobots aboard the ''Nemesis'' and fights Shockwave over control of the new Omega Lock. Ratchet is fully prepared to die and sacrifice the Omega Lock to protect humanity, but Bumblebee kills Megatron, ensuring victory for the Autobots. Though Ratchet reveals there is no way to create more synthetic Energon, the Autobots are successful in restoring Cybertron. While the other Autobots return to Cybertron, Ratchet remains behind on Earth, having grown to love the planet, deeming it where he is needed most.

Ratchet is soon called back to Cybertron to repair Ultra Magnus, who was wounded in battle against two new Predacons, Darksteel and Skylynx. The Autobots learn of Unicron's return in Megatron's corpse, and in the absence of both Optimus and Ultra Magnus, Ratchet encourages Bumblebee to take leadership of the team. Bumblebee requests Ratchet to stay out of the final battle against Unicron. Despite his anguished protests, Ratchet later witnesses Optimus sacrifice himself to restore the Allspark to Cybertron.

Please note: Shakespeare Schools Festival became [[Shakespeare Schools Foundation]] in 2016. The Festival is the charity's flagship project. 

The Shakespeare Schools Festival is the world's largest youth drama festival. Schools who participate perform half-hour abridged versions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays in local, professional theatres all over the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Since its inception in 2000, it has worked with 250,000 young people and their teachers.

Parent charity [[Shakespeare Schools Foundation]] (SSF) aims to engage children through an active way of learning. The charity strives to bridge "the attainment gap" by boosting articulacy and confidence, as well as imparting key employability skills such as teamwork, peer leadership and critical thinking. In preparing and performing the plays participants also learn about Shakespeare's language, themes and characters.&lt;ref name="uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssf.uk.com/about-us|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927083228/http://www.ssf.uk.com/about-us|archive-date=2009-09-27|dead-url=yes|title=About Us &amp;#124; Shakespeare Schools Festival|accessdate=2014-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All schools are able to take part in the Festival.

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
The Festival began in 2000 and is now in its 17th year.

===1995 Shakespeare: The Animated Tales===

In 1995, twelve of Shakespeare’s best loved plays were abridged to half hour scripts for the [[S4C]] and [[BBC Wales]] series, [[Shakespeare: The Animated Tales]]. Ninety per cent of the UK's secondary schools now use the Tales as their introduction to the language and plays of Shakespeare for years 7-10 (11-15 year olds), making it BBC Education's most popular series. In 2009 the films were made available by the DCSF to all English primary schools. In summer 2013 all twelve episodes were re-released on DVD in the UK by Metrodome Group Plc. They are distributed by Shakespeare Schools Festival.&lt;ref name="uk5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssf.uk.com/shop|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162141/https://www.ssf.uk.com/shop |archive-date=2013-12-11 |dead-url=yes|title=Shop &amp;#124; Shakespeare Schools Festival|accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

8,500 young actors from 340 schools performed in 32 theatres across the regions. Three schools were picked to perform at a private reception for the Washington state visit in Downing Street, in front of an audience which included [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[Philip Pullman]]. They went on to perform again for the Arts &amp; Kids 'Million Kids' launch at the [[Hackney Empire]] in the presence of HRH [[Prince of Wales|the Prince of Wales]].

The cast included [[Christopher Ecclestone]] as Macbeth, [[Haydn Gwynne]] as Lady Macbeth, [[David Oakes]] as Banquo, [[Patterson Joseph]] as MacDuff and [[Pippa Bennett-Warner]] as one of the Weird Sisters. The event interrupted the events of Shakespeare's play following the death of Duncan and placed Macbeth on trial for Murder with David, Patterson and Haydn appearing as witnesses for the prosecution and Christopher and Pippa as witnesses for the defence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2617">'''Victory Theme''' ({{lang-pt|Tema da Vitória}}) is a Brazilian instrumental song composed specially for the broadcast of [[Formula One]] by [[Rede Globo]]. The music was composed by Eduardo Souto Neto.

== History ==
The song was suggested by Aloysio Legey,&lt;ref name="Tele História - O dia em que o tema da vitória tocou para Prost"&gt;[http://www.telehistoria.com.br/colunas/index.asp?id=2379 Tele História - O dia em que o tema da vitória tocou para Prost] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002303/http://www.telehistoria.com.br/colunas/index.asp?id=2379 |date=2014-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the director of Formula One transmissions for Rede Globo. The song was recorded in 1981 by the Brazilian band [[Roupa Nova]], to be used as the soundtrack of victories in the [[Brazilian Grand Prix]], regardless of the winner's nationality, transmitted by Rede Globo. The song was first performed with the victory of [[Nelson Piquet]] in the [[1983 Brazilian Grand Prix]]. The next year, the song was performed for [[Alain Prost]]'s victory in the [[1984 Brazilian Grand Prix]].

It was only in 1986 that the song started to be used for every victory by a Brazilian driver. The song marked Nelson Piquet's achievement of third championship in 1987 and [[Ayrton Senna]]'s championships in 1988, 1990 and 1991.

For seven years the song wasn't played on Rede Globo due to the lack of victories by Brazilian drivers, between the [[1993 Australian Grand Prix]] won by Ayrton Senna and the [[2000 German Grand Prix]] won by [[Rubens Barrichello]].

In 2006, the song was played the first time for [[Felipe Massa]] for his victory in the [[2006 Turkish Grand Prix]].

The Victory Theme was also played on Rede Globo after the Brazilian national team won the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], as an homage to Ayrton Senna, [[Death of Ayrton Senna|who died earlier that year.]] and again in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], where Brazil won the World Cup trophy for the 5th time in Japan.

In 2009, the victory theme was played but with a different arrangement for Rubens Barrichellos's victory in the [[2009 European Grand Prix]], which marked Brazil's 100th victory in the history of Formula One.

At [[UFC 198]], UFC Heavyweight Champion [[Fabricio Werdum]] used the song as his entrance music.

'''''The Lost World: Jurassic Park''''' is the title of several different video games released for handheld video game consoles in 1997. Four versions, each with their own gameplay variations, were developed and published by various companies for the Sega [[Game Gear]], Nintendo's [[Game Boy]], and [[Tiger Electronics]]' [[game.com]] and [[R-Zone]] consoles. Each version is based on the 1997 [[The Lost World: Jurassic Park|film of the same name]].

==Gameplay==
The [[Game Gear]], [[Game Boy]] and [[game.com]] versions feature [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platform-based]] gameplay.&lt;ref name= Sega2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nintendo/&gt;&lt;ref name=AG/&gt;

In the Game Gear version, several organizations have sent hunting teams to Isla Sorna to capture the island's dinosaurs and sell them.&lt;ref name= Sega2 /&gt; The player controls a hunter,&lt;ref name= Sega /&gt; who is sent to investigate the current state of the island, and to prevent the hunting teams from achieving their goal. Twelve levels are featured,&lt;ref name= Sega2 &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sega.com/spotlight/features/jp2/main/gg/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/19980223042434/http://www.sega.com/spotlight/features/jp2/main/gg/|title= Something has survived. |publisher= Sega of America|archivedate= February 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; each one accessed by a [[Overworld|world map]]. In two of the game's later levels, the player plays as a ''[[Compsognathus]]'' rather than the hunter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taq1uDIWa0Q |title= ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (Game Gear) gameplay |website= ''YouTube.com''|date= July 30, 2010|accessdate= January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Game Boy version, the player's unnamed character&lt;ref name=Elec/&gt; must prevent smugglers from removing the island's dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=THQ&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thq.com/games/0024.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/19980117132844/http://www.thq.com/games/0024.html|title= The Lost World: Jurassic Park|publisher= THQ|archivedate= January 17, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features eight levels, including jungles and a laboratory.&lt;ref name=Elec/&gt;&lt;ref name=Power/&gt; The player's character must collect 10 objects in each level, such as dinosaur eggs, data discs, and DNA vials.&lt;ref name=Elec/&gt;&lt;ref name=Power/&gt; The game includes a [[Password (video gaming)|password]] feature,&lt;ref name=Power/&gt; and is compatible with the [[Super Game Boy]].&lt;ref name=Nintendo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/gb/lostworld/index.html|title=The Lost World|publisher=Nintendo.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980205055254/http://www.nintendo.com/gb/lostworld/index.html|archive-date=February 5, 1998|access-date=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game.com version, the player chooses to play as either [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Sarah Harding|Sarah Harding]] or [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Roland Tembo|Roland Tembo]]. Tembo is a hunter who wants to collect dinosaur eggs and take them off the island; Harding must collect the eggs before Tembo.&lt;ref name=AG&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=457&amp;tab=overview|title=''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (Game.com) Synopsis|last=Weiss|first=Brett Alan|website=[[AllGame]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141211152539/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=457&amp;tab=overview|archivedate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features six levels, each one divided into two sections: Game Trail and Nest Area. Each level begins with a Game Trail section,&lt;ref name=AG/&gt; which is a three-dimensional driving mini-game. The player chooses a vehicle, such as a motorcycle or Humvee. The player must then avoid stampeding dinosaurs and road hazards such as bushes and rocks while driving forward on a road of either dirt, grass or gravel.&lt;ref name=AG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Youtube/&gt; Nest Area, the second portion of each level, plays as a side-scroller in which the player's character must avoid dinosaurs while searching for five eggs and attempting to reach the end of the level. At the end of each level is a mother dinosaur that must be defeated.&lt;ref name=AG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Youtube&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHcvcrJbo6w |title= ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (Game.com) gameplay |website= ''YouTube.com''|date= October 17, 2011|accessdate= January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both characters use tranquilizer darts against the dinosaurs. In addition, both characters also possess their own weapon.&lt;ref name=AG/&gt;

In the [[R-Zone]] version, the player must survive against ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', ''Triceratops'', and ''Velociraptor'' in various jungle island levels. The player can use a motorcycle and [[all-terrain vehicle]].&lt;ref name=RZ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://static.wixstatic.com/media/41f220_7587235125424bdfa414a15bc0d59925.jpg/v1/fill/w_700,h_439,al_c,q_90/41f220_7587235125424bdfa414a15bc0d59925.jpg|title=The Lost World: Jurassic Park (R-Zone) advertisement|year=1997|publisher=Tiger Electronics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618174203/https://static.wixstatic.com/media/41f220_7587235125424bdfa414a15bc0d59925.jpg/v1/fill/w_700,h_439,al_c,q_90/41f220_7587235125424bdfa414a15bc0d59925.jpg|archive-date=June 18, 2016|quote=Enter the R-Zone's "The Lost World: Jurassic Park"!

==Development and release==
In June 1997, [[THQ]] announced that it had obtained the rights to publish a video game adaptation of ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', to be released for the Game Boy handheld console in October 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THQ's Dinomite Deal|url=http://www.next-generation.com/news/060397c.chtml|work=Next Generation|date=June 4, 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970605145441/http://www.next-generation.com/news/060397c.chtml|archivedate=June 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo ]] (E3), [[Sega]] announced that a separate video game adaptation of the film would be developed for the handheld Sega Game Gear console. The Game Gear version, developed by [[Aspect Co.]] and published by Sega, was released in August 1997.&lt;ref name= Sega &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sega.com/spotlight/features/e3/lost_world.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/19980223111315/http://www.sega.com/spotlight/features/e3/lost_world.html |title= Universal Pictures and Sega bring ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' to Sega Saturn, Sega Genesis, Game Gear and the arcade |publisher= Sega of America (press release) |date= June 19, 1997|archivedate= February 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the final [[List of Game Gear games|Game Gear video game]] released in [[North America]].

''[[Nintendo Power]]'', reviewing the Game Boy version, criticized the game's dinosaur and human characters for seeming "overly small." ''Nintendo Power'' wrote that the game was unnecessarily awkward because of "poor hit detection and delayed trigger actions while using weapons." ''Nintendo Power'' criticized the "Very standard" sound effects and music, but complimented the "nice addition" of a password feature, and ultimately concluded that the game "gives players an easy-to-grasp game world for some Jurassic fun. Once you get beyond the control issue, The Lost World can provide a nice escape."&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Nintendo_Power_Issue_104_January_1998#page/n93/mode/2up|title=The Lost World: Jurassic Park|date=January 1998|work=[[Nintendo Power]]|access-date=May 13, 2016|pages=88–93, 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor Lucas of ''[[EP Daily|The Electric Playground]]'' reviewed the Game Boy version and stated that he was impressed with the game despite it being "far from the quality you'd find in a Nintendo developed platform game for the Game Boy". Lucas praised the game for its variety of dinosaurs, but criticized its simple musical score and "irritating" ''Compsognathus'' enemies. Lucas also noted that there was "slippery-slidiness involved in coming to a complete stop. There will be plenty of times that you'll overstep a nasty ledge because of this. The fact that your character can grab and hang onto these ledges is a definite plus in the control department, however."&lt;ref name=Elec&gt;{{cite web |url= http://elecplay.com/portable/lostworldgb.shtml|title= The Lost World (Game Boy) review|last= Lucas|first= Victor|date= February 10, 1998|website= [[EP Daily|The Electric Playground]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/19980521015734/http://elecplay.com/portable/lostworldgb.shtml |archive-date= May 21, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brett Alan Weiss of [[AllGame]] praised the graphical detail and design of the Game.com version, but wrote that the "over-abundance of graphical content can get in the way of the action. The foreground dinosaurs oftentimes blend in with some of the shorter trees, especially when the playfield is scrolling, and the busy backgrounds only add to the confusion.[...] Even if the graphics don't confuse you, it is hard to keep the dinosaurs from killing you." Weiss praised the game's sound effects, but criticized its "wimpy" music, calling it "lightweight for a game of this type." Weiss considered the game's action to be mediocre, and criticized the poor controls, while stating that the driving levels "are largely pointless, but they look good and they are a change of pace from the standard gameplay."&lt;ref name=AGR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=457&amp;tab=review|title=''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (Game.com) review|last=Weiss|first=Brett Alan|website=[[AllGame]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115223854/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=457&amp;tab=review|archivedate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Monkees''''' is an American [[situation comedy]] that aired on [[NBC]] from September 12, 1966 to March 25, 1968. The series follows the adventures of four young men ([[the Monkees]]) trying to make a name for themselves as a rock 'n roll band. The show introduced a number of innovative new-wave film techniques to series television and won two [[Emmy Award]]s in [[19th Primetime Emmy Awards|1967]], including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]. The program ended on [[Labor Day]] 1968 at the finish of its second season and has received a long afterlife through Saturday morning repeats (CBS and ABC) and syndication, as well as overseas broadcasts; it later enjoyed a 1980s revival, after [[MTV]] aired reruns of the program in 1986.

==Overview==
{{Main|List of The Monkees episodes}}
{{:List of The Monkees episodes}}

The series centered on the adventures of the Monkees, a struggling rock band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] consisting of Micky, Davy, Michael, and Peter. The comic elements of the storyline were provided by the strange and often [[surreal humour|surreal]] encounters that the band would have while searching for their big break.

==Production==

===Conception and casting===
In the early 1960s, aspiring filmmakers [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[Bert Schneider]] had formed [[Raybert Productions]] and were trying to get a foot in the door in Hollywood. They were inspired by the Beatles' film [[A Hard Day's Night (film)|''A Hard Day's Night'']] and decided to develop a television series about a fictional rock and roll group.&lt;ref name="LefcowitzPage7-8"&gt;Lefcowitz (1985), pp.6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Raybert sold the series idea to Screen Gems in April, 1965,&lt;ref name="SandovalPage23"&gt;Sandoval (2005), p.23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Mazursky]] and [[Larry Tucker (screenwriter)|Larry Tucker]] completed a pilot script by August entitled "The Monkeys".&lt;ref name="SandovalPage25"&gt;Sandoval (2005), p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Rafelson has said that he had the idea for a TV series about a music group as early as 1960, but had a hard time interesting anyone in it until 1965, by which time rock and roll music was firmly entrenched in pop culture.

Trade publications ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' ran an ad on September 8, 1965 seeking "Folk &amp; Roll Musicians-Singers for acting roles in new TV series." As many as 400 hopefuls showed up to be considered as one of "4 insane boys."&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"&gt;Sandoval (2005), p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen actors from the audition pool were brought back for screen tests,&lt;ref name="MonkeesVHSBox"&gt;Documents reproduced in booklet of VHS box set, Rhino Records, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and Raybert chose their final four after audience research.

[[Micky Dolenz]], son of screen actor [[George Dolenz]], had prior screen experience under the name "Mickey Braddock" as the 10-year-old star of the ''[[Circus Boy]]'' series in the 1950s. He was actively auditioning for pilots at the time and was told about the Raybert project by his agent.&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"/&gt;

Englishman [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] was a former jockey who had achieved some initial success on the musical stage, appearing with the cast of ''[[Oliver!]]'' on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' the night of the Beatles' live American debut. He was appearing in Columbia Pictures productions and recording for the [[Colpix]] record label and had been identified in advance as a potential star for the series.&lt;ref name="SandovalPage25"/&gt;

Texan [[Michael Nesmith]]'s mother [[Bette Nesmith Graham]] had invented a [[correction fluid]] and founded the company that became [[Liquid Paper]]. He had served a brief stint in the U.S. Air Force and had also recorded for Colpix under the name "Michael Blessing." He was the only one of The Monkees who had come for the audition based on seeing the trade magazine ad. He showed up to the audition with his laundry&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"/&gt; and impressed Rafelson and Schneider with his laid-back style and droll sense of humor. He also wore a woollen hat to keep his hair out of his eyes when he rode his motorcycle,&lt;ref name="BakerPage10"&gt;Baker (1986), p.10&lt;/ref&gt; leading to early promotional materials which nicknamed him "Wool Hat." The hat remained part of Nesmith's wardrobe, but the name was dropped after the pilot.&lt;ref name="BakerPage10"/&gt;

[[Peter Tork]] was recommended to Rafelson and Schneider by friend [[Stephen Stills]] at his audition.&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"/&gt; Tork was a skilled multi-instrumentalist who had performed at various Greenwich Village folk clubs before moving west, where he worked as a [[busboy]].&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"/&gt;

===Development===
[[File:The Monkees 1967.jpg|right|thumb|The Monkees in 1967]]
Rafelson and Schneider wanted the style of the series to reflect [[avant garde]] film techniques—such as improvisation, quick cuts, jump cuts, breaking the [[fourth wall]], and free-flowing, loose narratives—then being pioneered by European film directors. Each episode would contain at least one musical "romp" which might have nothing to do with the storyline. In retrospect, these vignettes now look very much like music videos: short, self-contained films of songs in ways that echoed the Beatles' recent ventures into promotional films for their singles. They also believed strongly in the program's ability to appeal to young people, intentionally framing the kids as heroes and the adults as heavies.&lt;ref name="LefcowitzPage3"&gt;Lefcowitz (1985), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafelson and Schneider hired novice director [[James Frawley]] to teach the four actors improvisational comedy. Each of the four was given a different personality to portray: Dolenz the funny one, Nesmith the smart and serious one, Tork the naive one, and Jones the cute one. Their characters were loosely based on their real selves, with the exception of Tork, who was actually a quiet intellectual. The character types also had much in common with the respective personalities of [[the Beatles]], with Dolenz representing the madcap attitude of [[John Lennon]], Nesmith affecting the deadpan seriousness of [[George Harrison]], Tork depicting the odd-man-out quality of [[Ringo Starr]], and Jones conveying the pin-up appeal of [[Paul McCartney]].

A pilot episode was shot in San Diego and Los Angeles on a shoestring budget—in many scenes the Monkees wore their own clothes. Initial audience tests (which were just then being pioneered) produced very low responses. Rafelson then re-edited the pilot and included some of the screen tests, to better introduce the band members to viewers. (Dolenz was credited in this pilot as "Micky Braddock.") The re-cut pilot tested so well that NBC placed an order for two seasons of episodes. (The edited pilot was broadcast November 14, 1966, as the tenth episode of the first season, with Dolenz credited under his real last name, as for all other episodes.)

===Filming===
''The Monkees'' debuted September 12, 1966, on the NBC television network. The series was sponsored on alternate weeks by [[Kelloggs|Kellogg's Cereals]] and [[Yardley of London]].

The series was filmed by [[Screen Gems]], and many of the same sets and props from [[The Three Stooges]] short films made by the studio were used on ''The Monkees'': A pair of [[pajamas]] with a bunny design on the front that had been worn by [[Curly Howard]] in shorts such as ''[[Cactus Makes Perfect (film)|Cactus Makes Perfect]]'' and ''[[In the Sweet Pie and Pie]]'' were the same ones worn by Peter Tork in various episodes such as "A Coffin Too Frequent" and "Monkee See, Monkee Die".&lt;ref&gt;The Three Stooges Journal, Fall 1987; published by the Three Stooges Fan Club&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce noise on the set during filming, any of the four Monkees who was not needed in front of the cameras was locked into a converted meat locker.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In DVD commentary, Tork noted that this had the added benefit of concealing any marijuana use that might be going on, although he admitted that he was the sole "serious 'head'" of the four of them. (In the 1980s, Tork gave up alcohol and marijuana use and has volunteered time to help people recovering from alcoholism.) In a studio outtake included in the 1990s re-release of ''[[Headquarters (album)|Headquarters]]'', Nesmith quips, before launching into "Nine Times Blue": "Only difference between me and Peter is I'm just ''stone'' legal."{{clarify|date=May 2015}}

Due to the loosely scripted nature of the series, some episodes would come in too short for air. The producers decided to fill time with various "extras", including the Monkees' original screen tests and candid interviews with the group (conducted by Rafelson off-camera); these interviews usually lasted one minute, hence the frequent joke, "We're a minute short as usual," though the episode "Find the Monkees" featured a three-minute epilogue interview (in which the Monkees gave their opinions on the then-recently-occurred [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]]). Although the early episodes contained a [[laugh track]], which was standard practice at the time, the show eventually did not add one, and most of the episodes from Season 2 had no canned laughter. NBC later cited that as one of the reasons for canceling the series.&lt;ref name="Iverson"&gt;Iverson, Paul: "The Advent of the Laugh Track" Hofstra University archives; February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The theme song to ''The Monkees'', "[[(Theme from) The Monkees]]" (released as the single in some countries in 1967), is one of the group's most well known songs. The line "We're the young generation, and we've got somethin' to say" reflected the new youth counterculture and their desire to give their own opinions on world events and choosing how to live their own lives instead of abiding by the traditions and beliefs of their elders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==The Monkees' "pad"==
{{original research|section|date=May 2015}}
The Monkees resided in a two-story beach house. The address varied in different episodes.
* 1334 Beechwood in “Your Friendly Neighborhood Kidnappers”
* 1424 ???, Malibu, Calif. in “Too Many Girls”
* 1438 North Beechwood according to Davy in “The Case of the Missing Monkee”
* 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, CA according to the telegram in Head
The address 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, CA was frequently given in ''[[16 (magazine)|16]]'' magazine as an address to contact [[Screen Gems]] and/or The Monkees. The front of the first floor was a combination of the living room, dining room and kitchen. In the back, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, was an alcove formed by massive floor-to-ceiling bay windows, where the Monkees kept their instruments and rehearsed songs. The walls were covered with various [[kitsch]]y signs and posters, such as the "MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL" sign near the kitchen, the "SCRUB UP" sign above the kitchen sink, and the "IN CASE OF FIRE, RUN" sign with an arrow pointing to an old-fashioned fire extinguisher near the front door. There were also two doors in the kitchen area; one led to a bathroom, the other to Davy and Peter's bedroom. The second floor (via spiral staircase near the front door) only consisted of Micky and Mike's bedroom. By the second season, the upstairs bedroom was occupied by all four Monkees. Also "residing" with the Monkees was Mr. Schneider, a mannequin who dispensed philosophical advice with the pull of his cord. Mr. Schneider was named after the show's co-producer Bert Schneider and was mostly voiced by main director James Frawley. The boys also had to contend with their bad-tempered landlord Mr. Babbit, who was always yelling at them about various infractions that he thought they were responsible for or threatening to throw them out for not paying the rent.

==Monkeemobile==
{{Main article|Monkeemobile}}
The Monkeemobile was a modified [[Pontiac GTO]] designed and built by designer [[Dean Jeffries]]. The car featured a tilted forward split two-piece [[windshield]], a touring car T-bucket-type [[convertible]] top, modified rear quarter panels and front fenders, exaggerated tail lamps, set of four bucket seats with an extra third row bench where the rear deck should have been, and a [[parachute]]. The [[grille|front grille]] sported the GTO emblem.&lt;ref name="StAntoine-MT"&gt;St. Antoine, Arthur. - [http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/c12_0511_dean_jeffries_interview/index.html "Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend"]. - ''[[Motor Trend|Motor Trend Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KeefeD-PEM-1997"&gt;Keefe, Don. - [http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM "The History of the MonkeeMobile"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031513/http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM |date=2008-05-13 }}. - ''Pontiac Enthusiast Magazine''. - (c/o monkees.net) - 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
''The Monkees'' won two Emmy Awards in [[19th Primetime Emmy Awards|1967]]: [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy]] ([[James Frawley]], for the episode "Royal Flush"). Frawley was nominated for the same award the following season (for the episode "The Devil and Peter Tork"). Its win for Comedy Series was considered somewhat of an upset, as it bested long-time favorites ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', and ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''.

==Decline and cancellation==
For the first season, in 1966, the series fared well in the ratings, bolstered by several hit records by the band. The Monkees became a huge pop culture sensation. However, the public didn't realize that the show and the band were mostly a generally manufactured television series and that the Monkees themselves did not write or perform much of their own studio music, except to provide the vocals. The only exception were their live performances. When the truth became well known, there was a large backlash by many fans and music critics. NBC responded to the backlash by retooling the show in its second season with the Monkees now writing and performing much of their own music that was much less pop-oriented. In addition, the first season's clean cut looks were replaced by more [[hippy]] looking attire. All this alienated the young fans who then deserted the group. The result was a huge decline in ratings and record sales. By 1967, NBC felt the series had run its course. Coupled with friction within the band itself, the series was cancelled in 1968. The Monkees released three more albums after the series cancellation but they did not chart well.&lt;ref&gt; [http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-monkees-final-episode/ ultimateclassicrock.com] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndication==
''The Monkees'' enjoyed a resurgence on Saturday morning/afternoon television on [[CBS]] from September 1969 to September 1972 (sponsored by [[General Foods]]' [[Kool-Aid]]), and on ABC from September 1972 to August 1973. To coincide with the releases of ''[[The Monkees Present]]'' and ''[[Changes (The Monkees album)|Changes]]'' albums during this time period, many episodes replaced the older songs with tracks from these recent releases. The 58 episodes were then sold to local markets for syndication in September 1975, where they typically appeared on independent television stations on weekday afternoons (the opening title sequence seen in the syndication package, for all 58 episodes, is from the second season of the original run).

A second, massive resurgence occurred when a ''Monkees'' marathon aired on February 23, 1986 on [[MTV]]. Within months, the 58 episodes were airing regularly throughout the United States on local stations (in edited form), [[Nickelodeon]]/MTV (uncut), as well as Canada on [[MuchMusic]]. Dolenz, Tork and Jones, already reunited for a "20th Anniversary Tour", went from playing small clubs to stadiums as the series caught on, and the tour drew critical praise. The popularity led MTV to create a "reboot" version of the franchise in 1987, ''[[New Monkees]]'', but it flopped and was cancelled after a half season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boone|first1=Brian|title=The Monkees, The Old New Monkees, and New Monkees: How to Destroy A Beloved Franchise|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/11/the-monkees-the-old-new-monkees-and-new-monkees-how-to-destroy-a-beloved-franchise/|website=SplitSider|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has aired edited versions on [[Antenna TV]], a digital subchannel network that broadcasts classic programming from the 1950s-1990s era. [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] also picked up the series for reruns in spring 2015. [[Fetv|FETV]], a cable and satellite network, began airing the series in December of 2017. In 2018, Canadian superstation [[CHCH-DT|CHCH]] began carrying the series; the station is viewable over-the-air in portions of the United States.

Although [[Rhino Records]] now serves as the underlying rights holder for this series (as they acquired the Monkees' music catalog, TV series and official logo from Raybert and Columbia Pictures in 1994), [[Sony Pictures Television]] remains the television distributor for syndication.

==Legacy==
The TV show ''[[Miami 7]]'', the debut of the British 1990s pop band [[S Club 7]], had a very similar premise. It was the second time that a manufactured band had their own TV show on American television. Likewise, the Nickelodeon sitcom ''[[Big Time Rush (TV series)|Big Time Rush]]'' followed the same basic format and premise, and producers of that show acknowledged ''The Monkees'' as their primary inspiration.&lt;ref name="Play"&gt;Martin, Denise. "Child's Play." ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolenz said in a 2007 interview on the [[Roe Conn]] radio program that, while inspiration did come from the Beatles, the band's image was not meant to be a rip-off of them. He said that the Beatles were always depicted as superstars with legions of fans, whereas the Monkees were always depicted as unsigned and struggling to make a buck. This is reflected numerous times throughout the series, such as in the pilot where Mike Nesmith is seen throwing darts at a Beatles poster, and in the episode "Find the Monkees (The Audition)" where the Monkees struggle to see a famous television producer who is looking for a rock act for use in commercial advertisements; in the episode "I Was a 99-Pound Weakling", Micky is tricked into signing onto a bogus weight-training program, but objects by noting, "Where am I gonna get that kind of money? I'm an unemployed drummer." Also in a screen test, a Monkee asks what the Beatles have that they don't have. They sing "Thirteen million dollars!"

When commenting on the death of Davy Jones on February 29, 2012, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine contributor James Poniewozik praised the show: "Even if the show never meant to be more than entertainment and a hit-single generator, we shouldn’t sell ''The Monkees'' short. It was far better TV than it had to be; during an era of formulaic domestic sitcoms and wacky comedies, it was a stylistically ambitious show, with a distinctive visual style, absurdist sense of humor and unusual story structure. Whatever Jones and The Monkees were meant to be, they became creative artists in their own right, and Jones’ chipper Brit-pop presence was a big reason they were able to produce work that was commercial, wholesome and yet impressively weird."&lt;ref name=Poniewozik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title= RIP Davy Jones, The Monkees’ Daydreamboat | journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 2012 | volume= | issue= | pages= | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/29/rip-davy-jones-the-monkees-daydreamboat/?xid=rss-topstories |accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Six two-episode VHS volumes of the television series were distributed by Musicvision/RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video between July 15, 1986 and June 25, 1987, taking advantage of the group's twentieth anniversary.

On October 17, 1995, with the Monkees' 30th anniversary looming, Rhino Home Video issued the complete series as a deluxe VHS boxed set, containing all 58 episodes, plus the pilot and the 1969 special, ''[[33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee]]'', in a total of 21 videotapes, along with a specially created full-color photo book that tells the history of the series, information of each episode and a variety of photographs from the series. First-run issues of the set also included a limited-edition wristwatch. A few months before, on May 22, Columbia House started releasing a Collector's Edition series also collecting all 58 ''Monkees'' episodes and the 1969 special; the one exception being the unaired 1965 ''Monkees'' pilot, which was available only on Rhino's Video Box Set.

Rhino later released individual two-episode VHS volumes of the TV series between March 26, 1996 and April 11, 2000; it would be the last time ''The Monkees'' television show would be distributed on videocassette.

In May and November 2003, [[WarnerMedia|AOL Time Warner Entertainment]]’s [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Home Video]] released the first two seasons of the original television series on DVD for the first time. Rhino Retrovision’s first two seasons DVD releases features the video fully restored and digitally remastered from the original 35mm interpostive film prints and the audio, restored, remastered and remixed in 5.1 Dolby Digital “Rhinophonic” surround sound for superb film quality and optimal audio vitality and for superior home entertainment theater presentation. Seasons 1 and 2 were each released separately, six DVDs for Season 1 and five DVDs for Season 2. Both seasons were re-released by Eagle Rock Entertainment on Sept. 27, 2011.

In honor of The Monkees' 50th anniversary, Rhino released the complete series on Blu-ray for the very first time on July 8, 2016.  It was originally scheduled for released on June 26, 2016 but was subsequently pushed back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Monkees-The-Complete-Series/22187|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613201157/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Monkees-The-Complete-Series/22187|archivedate=2016-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Monkees-The-Complete-Series/22362 New (and 'Final'!)

'''The Princess Who Never Smiled''' or '''The Unsmiling Tsarevna''' ({{lang-ru|Царевна Несмеяна}}) is a Russian [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Alexander Afanasyev]] in ''[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]''.

==Synopsis==
There was once a [[princess]] who never smiled or laughed. Her father promised that whoever made her smile could marry her, and many tried, but none succeeded.

Across the town, an honest worker worked hard for his master. At the end of the year, the master put a sack of money before him and told him to take as much as he wanted. To avoid sinning by taking too much, he took only one coin, and when he went to drink from a well, he dropped the coin and lost it. The next year, the same thing happened to him. The third year, the worker took the same amount of coin as before, but when he drank from the well, he did not lose his coin, and the other two coins floated up to him. He decided to see the world. A mouse asked him for alms; he gave him a coin. Then he did the same for a beetle and a catfish.  

He came to the castle and saw the princess looking at him. This astounded him, and he fell in the mud. The mouse, the beetle, and the catfish came to his aid, and at their antics, the princess laughed. She pointed him out as the man, and when he was brought into the castle, he had been turned into a handsome man. The honest worker, now a handsome man, married the princess.

==Motifs==
Making the princess laugh, or smile, is a common fairy tale motif of various uses.  The culmination of [[Golden Goose]] and [[The Magic Swan]], where the goose or swan causes other characters to stick to each other, is that the sight causes a princess to laugh for the first time, resulting, as in this story, in her marriage.  [[Peruonto]] and the frame story of [[Giambattista Basile]], however, combine it with a curse, caused by the angry person laughed at, to force the princess to marry someone.

==Retellings==
A [[Sesame Street]] Book Club book entitled The Sesame Street Alphabet Storybook (which interspersed different objects starting with subsequent letters into infamous stories as told by Sesame Street characters) included a quick telling of "The Princess who Never Laughed" using a xylophone and yo-yo's (X and Y) as props used by two people trying to make the princess laugh to no avail. It comes to end when [[Cookie Monster]], who was lurking behind them, ate both items, which the princess did think was funny.

'''''Turok: Evolution''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] released for the [[Game Boy Advance]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[GameCube]] in 2002. A port for Microsoft Windows was released in 2003 for the European market. It is a prequel to ''[[Turok: Dinosaur Hunter]]'' and was the last to follow in the series before it was rebooted by a 2008 entry in the series, called ''[[Turok (video game)|Turok]]''.

==Plot==
The game begins with the seer, Tarkeen, explaining the history of the Lost Lands which had, for years, been fought over by tyrannic warlords.

On Earth during the old west, Tal'Set faces off with his enemy, Captain Bruckner, and succeeds in cutting off his arm, but both of them are suddenly and inexplicably sucked into a wormhole. The wormhole opens in the jungle canopy of the Lost Land, and Tal'Set is nearly killed from the fall. He is found unconscious by the people of the River Village who call upon Tarkeen to heal him. Once healed, Tal'Set enters the jungle to fight reptilian humanoids known as the Sleg, aiming to keep them away from the Village. Tal'Set and River Village pilot Genn fly upon [[pterosaur]]-back to evict the Sleg from the jungle and destroy their airship.

Tal'Set reaches Tarkeen's sanctum and is told he must accept the mantle of Turok and release Tarkeen from a curse. When Tal'Set refuses, Tarkeen tells him that the Sleg had managed to reach the Village. This enrages Tal'Set which prompts him to cut through the mountains to reach the Sleg base to free the villagers and Wise Father from captivity.

Tal'Set proceeds to liberate the prisoners and destroy the base. Here, he learns of the existence of a human general who had ordered the attack on the village. It is also learned that the Sleg are planning to assault the human capitol, Galyana, but for their army to reach it, they must cross a giant chasm with only two known crossings. Tal'Set is sent through the thickly forested Shadowed Lands to destroy one of these crossings, an ancient bridge. The bridge is destroyed with Tal'Set upon it, but he is saved from falling by his pterosaur.

Tal'Set flies to the second crossing, the Suspended City, where his pterosaur is shot down. Tal'Set breaches the city and cleanses the street with his comrades, surviving the first wave of Sleg paratroopers entering the city. He breaches the Senate and saves the Senators, who tell him that the only way to stop the Slegs from cutting through the city is to destroy it. Tal'Set subsequently releases the tethers connecting the city to the Chasm walls. Tal'Set is given another pterosaur steed by the senators and escapes the falling city by flight.

The city is successfully destroyed, but the Sleg leader, Lord Tyrannus, has one more tactic to try. He unleashes the Juggernaut, an immense pair of cannons mounted upon a massive [[sauropod]], with the aim to level Galyana. Tal'Set infiltrates and destroys the Juggernaut but before escaping is confronted by Tyrannus. The Sleg leader threatens to kill Tal'Set but is held off by Tarkeen. Tal'Set escapes again on his pterosaur and destroys one last wave of Sleg troops.

With the Sleg defeated, Tal'Set learns that the general is actually Bruckner, and begins to hunt him, seeking vengeance for his people. He finds Bruckner aboard a [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] equipped with various weapons. Tal'Set kills the animal, which traps Bruckner beneath it as it falls. Tal'Set leaves the villain alive, stating "he does not deserve a warrior's death". As Tal'Set leaves, Bruckner is eaten alive by a pack of [[Compsognathus]]. In the aftermath, Lord Tyrannus furiously screams at his defeat and was not mentioned or seen again. Tal'Set tells Tarkeen that he accepts the mantle of Turok.

==Multiplayer==
Turok: Evolution features four player split screen multiplayer for Gamecube and Xbox and two player for PS2. The game features at least 13 multiplayer maps, several of which contain dinosaur AI bots.

==Game Boy Advance version==
The Game Boy Advance version of the game takes the same concept from the past Game Boy iterations.  It is side scrolling and has 2D graphics.

==Reception==
''Evolution'' received mixed reviews upon its release. The review aggregator [[Metacritic]] scored the Xbox version a 68 out of 100, the GameCube version a 70, the Game Boy Advance version a 72, and the PlayStation 2 version a 61.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/search/process?sort=relevance&amp;termType=all&amp;ts=turok+evolution&amp;ty=0 |title=''Turok: Evolution'' Metacritic scores |accessdate=2008-01-29 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications such as [[Play (U.S. magazine)|''Play'' magazine]] and [[Yahoo!

'''''VA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action''''' (also sometimes written as ''Valhalla'') is an [[indie game|indie]] [[bartender]] [[simulation video game]] with [[visual novel]] elements as well as [[cyberpunk]], [[PC-9800 series|PC-98]] and [[anime]]-inspired visuals, developed by Venezuelan studio [[Sukeban Games]] and published by Ysbryd Games for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] on June 21, 2016. The [[PlayStation Vita]] port was developed by Wolfgame and published by [[Limited Run Games]]. The game puts the player in the role of a bartender at the eponymous VA-11 HALL-A, a small bar in a dystopian downtown which is said to attract the "most fascinating" of people. The gameplay consists of players making and serving drinks to bar attendees whilst listening to the stories and experiences of these said characters.

''VA-11 HALL-A'' contains [[nonlinear gameplay]], with the game's plotline being influenced by the drinks the player makes and how the customers react to them. There are no dialogue options within the game, with making different drinks being the sole way to influence the direction of the story. ''VA-11 HALL-A'' features a diverse range of characters that have been described as "average non-heroes", with developers noting how they were based on side characters that were never truly fleshed out in movies. Over time, the player begins to know the characters well enough to infer what drinks they want, resulting in an intimate experience.

''VA-11 HALL-A'' was originally developed for the Cyberpunk Game Jam of 2014; however, [[Sukeban Games]] liked the game so much that they eventually turned it into a full game. The original planned release date of December 2014 has since been moved back multiple times due to delays, including when the developers changed the [[game engine]]. ''VA-11 HALL-A'' draws heavy influences from old [[PC-98]] games, resulting in a retro yet futuristic look, as well as the developers' own experiences of living in a poorer country. The game's original [[prototype]] is downloadable for free on the game's official website, and players who pre-order gain access to a playable yet separate prologue. ''VA-11 HALL-A'' has garnered pre-release critical acclaim, while post-game reception was mostly favourable, with positive reception directed at its premise, cast of characters, and music. However, occasional reviewers perceived the game's dialogue as unrealistic and the gameplay as repetitive. A sequel, ''N1RV Ann-A'', is scheduled for a 2020 release.&lt;ref&gt;http://sukeban.moe/index.php/2018/09/18/announcing-cyberpunk-bartender-action-n1rv-ann-a/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

=== Premise ===
[[File:VA-11 HALL-A gameplay.png|thumb|300px|left|Interacting with Dorothy, one of the characters in ''VA-11 HALL-A''. Much of the game's gameplay involves creating drinks for characters and listening to their stories, with the quality of the drink influencing the game's storyline. The five drink ingredients which players can mix are shown on the right.]]
''VA-11 HALL-A'' has been described by its developer, [[Sukeban Games]], as a "[[cyberpunk]] bartender action" game, and has been described as a "bartending simulator meets a [[visual novel]] somewhere in a cyberpunk [[dystopia]]" by [[TouchArcade]].&lt;ref name="ta"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dotson, Carter |url=http://toucharcade.com/2015/08/31/pax-prime-2015-va-11-hall-a-is-yet-another-cyberpunk-waifu-bartending-simulation/ |title=PAX Prime 2015: 'VA-11 HALL-A' is Yet Another Cyberpunk Waifu Bartending Simulation |publisher=TouchArcade |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, the player assumes the role of a bartender at "VA-11 HALL-A" (pronounced [[Valhalla]]), a small [[dive bar]]&lt;ref name="rpg"&gt;{{cite web |author=Reese, Zack |url=http://www.rpgsite.net/preview/4035-va-11-hall-a-impressions |title=Game Info VA-11 HALL-A Impressions |publisher=RPG Site |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a dystopian downtown said to attract the "most fascinating" of clientele.&lt;ref name="launch"&gt;{{cite web |author=Romano, Sal |url=http://gematsu.com/2016/06/va-11-hall-a-pc-launches-june-21 |title=VA-11 HALL-A for PC launches June 21 |publisher=Gematsu |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in the year 207X,&lt;ref name="Motherboard"/&gt; according to the game's official website, ''VA-11 HALL-A'' is described as a "a booze em' up about [[wikt:waifu|waifu]]s, technology, and post-dystopia life", in a world where "corporations reign supreme, all human life is infected with [[nanomachine]]s designed to oppress them, and the terrifying White Knights ensure that everyone obeys the laws."&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waifubartending.com/ |title=VA-11 HALLA (official site) |publisher=[[Sukeban Games]] |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption and food shortages "run rampant" in Glitch City, the city where the eponymous bar is located.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;

At the bar, the player's interaction with the game is focused on preparing drinks based on the given instructions and then serving them to characters.&lt;ref name="ta"/&gt; However, the game's experience is primarily storytelling and dialogue-driven,&lt;ref name="ta"/&gt; since as the player serves the characters they also listen to their stories and experiences.&lt;ref name="launch"/&gt; The game also includes scenes outside the bar, such as at Jill's home where players are able to have text conversations and use apps on her phone.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt; Players can also visit shops and buy items using money they earn while working at the bar to decorate Jill's home, as well as to pay the rent.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt; Keeping Jill happy at home helps her stay more focused at work as well as making her more attuned to cocktail suggestions.&lt;ref name="Motherboard"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kotzer, Zack |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/VA-11-HALL-A-review |title='Ghost in the Shell' Meets 'Cheers' in New Cyberpunk Bartending Game |publisher=Motherboard |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players find out about ''VA-11 HALL-A''{{'}}s world through the patrons of the bar and a selection of news reports on their in-game tablet computer at the outset of each day.&lt;ref name="moe"/&gt; At the start of each work day, the player creates their own music playlist for the game in the bar's [[jukebox]].&lt;ref name="VGU review"/&gt;

=== Bartending ===
There is no time limit for creating drinks.&lt;ref name="VGU review"/&gt; If a player makes a mistake whilst creating a drink, they can just reset the order and start again; thus, there is no real tension in the gameplay.&lt;ref name="VGU review"/&gt; Making flawless drinks gives the player more money through tips.&lt;ref name="VGU review"/&gt; To create a drink, there are five different ingredients that the player can mix together:
* Adelhyde (a sweet flavour)&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt;
* Bronson Extract (a bold taste)&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt;
* Powdered Delta (a former [[rat poison]])&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt;
* Flanergide (a spicy kick)&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt;
* Karmotrine (makes a drink alcoholic)&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt;
Although the ingredients are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, such as the Piledriver or [[absinthe|Blue Fairy]].&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt; To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice.&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt; Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be different from what they order. For example, a character might be feeling depressed and ask for a sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget their troubles would have a better effect.&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt; Alternately, the player may be able to make a character happy by talking to them instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism.&lt;ref name="se"&gt;{{cite web |author=Priestman, Chris |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/25/va-11-hall-cyberpunk-bartending-sim-set-post-dystopia-society/ |title=VA-11 HALL-A Is A Cyberpunk Bartending Sim Set In A Post-Dystopia Society |publisher=Siliconera |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At various points, the player can also tweak the customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic.&lt;ref name="bestfree"/&gt; In these ways, the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt;

Optional ingredients can be added to the drink, with its usage altering how much the drinker gets drunk.&lt;ref name="ta"/&gt; There are no dialogue options in ''VA-11 HALL-A'', with the only interactivity being making clients' requested drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=McCarthy, Caty |url=https://killscreen.com/articles/get-ready-play-cyberpunk-bartender-later-month/ |title=Get Ready To Play As A Cyberpunk Bartender Later This Month |publisher=Kill Screen |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time, clients tell the player exactly what they want, though some can be more cryptic, for example by asking for a certain flavour.&lt;ref name="VGU review"&gt;{{cite web |author=Foxall, Sam |url=http://videogamesuncovered.com/reviews/va-11-hall-a-review/ |title=VA-11 HALL-A Review |publisher=Video Games Uncovered |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''VA-11 HALL-A'' contains [[nonlinear gameplay]] in the form of branching storylines,&lt;ref name="ta"/&gt; though it is dependent not on traditional choices but rather through the drinks the player prepares.&lt;ref name="official"/&gt; There also exists a recipe book where the recipes to all drinks that can be made can be looked up.&lt;ref name="characters"/&gt; [[Sukeban Games]] says that they hope the book, which was a requested feature in the game's prologue, would make the bartending "feel more organic", as well as allowing players to experiment.&lt;ref name="characters"/&gt;

While the characters drink they also converse with the player. Depending on how well the player is able to recall drink recipes and create drinks to the clientele's preferences, such conversations change, as well as the overall plotline, which is relative to the player's overall competence.&lt;ref name="tend"/&gt; Designer Christopher Ortiz noted that the bartending mechanics in ''VA-11 HALL-A'' were made to deliberately "tease the player's mind into doing things out of the box", as opposed to "play[ing] through [it] like a machine, always serving what the patron want[s] and never questioning what they [are] doing."&lt;ref name="talk"/&gt; Traditional visual [[Nonlinear gameplay|dialogue options which the player could choose]], however, were deliberately avoided as they interfered with the subtlety of the game.&lt;ref name="talk"/&gt;

In the process of worldbuilding, much of the details of ''VA-11 HALL-A''{{'}}s world are not found out by the player directly but instead through interacting with the characters.&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; This is so the world is introduced in a "readably human way" and also more naturally, with each character contributing their own perspectives, "providing details that are just random or obscure enough to paint a believable picture."&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; The characters have their own personal story routes in the game.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; The [[player character]] of the game is Jill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Savage, Phil |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/va-11-hall-a-has-a-new-trailer-and-demo/ |title=VA-11 HALL-A has a new trailer and demo |publisher=PC Gamer |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly named Gillian during development),&lt;ref name="tend"/&gt; the bartender at the eponymous VA-11 HALL-A dive bar in Glitch City.&lt;ref name="tend"&gt;{{cite web |author=James, Thomas |url=http://gematsu.com/2014/08/tend-future-bar-va-11-hall |title=Tend future bar in VA-11 HALL-A |publisher=Gematsu |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite web |author=Priestman, Chris |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/02/new-trailer-and-demo-appears-for-cyberpunk-bartending-action-game-va-11-hall-a/ |title=New Trailer And Demo Appears For "Cyberpunk Bartending Action" Game VA-11 HALL-A |publisher=Siliconera |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jill is a young female bartender who chose to forego an offer to work at a [[research institute]], instead finding herself to be better suited to the "field of [[alchemy]]" in mixing drinks for customers at a dive bar.&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt; The game eases the player into its gameplay by letting Jill practice making drinks every morning before she heads to work.&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt; The game contains a "colorful cast" of regulars at the bar, including "sex working robots, assassins, private detectives, and pop stars", with how the player serves them having "subtle but important effects on their lives".&lt;ref name="Gamasutra review"/&gt;
* Alma, described as a "[[Christmas cake#Japan|Christmas Cake]]" by developer Ortiz, is a female hacker&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; who is full of "all kinds of stories" on "bad relationships and how pursuing your dreams can harm the ones you love."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;
* Dorothy, a robot [[sex worker]]. An "odd character", Ortiz described the "range of reactions people get from her" as "fun", since some were creeped out and others praised her characterization in the game's prototype.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; 
* Ingram McDougal, the "kind of guy who likes complaining simply for the sake of it."&lt;ref name="characters"&gt;{{cite web |author=Priestman, Chris |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/12/16/meet-cyberpunk-bartending-sim-va-11-hall-livestreaming-girl-characters/ |title=Meet Cyberpunk Bartending Sim VA-11 HALL-A's Livestreaming Girl, And Other Characters |publisher=Siliconera |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
{{quote box |quote=I was like: "Hey, you know what would be cool? A game where you're the bartender in a cyberpunk society, and you're not the hard boiled hero or stuff like that. You just do your work while classic characters from cyberpunk tales tell you stories about life in dystopia." Funnily enough, the game had to be based on some artwork but we ignored that and made this weird visual novel adventure thingy. [...] The coolest thing about this approach to storytelling is that it can only be achieved in video games. Our main focus as developers is blending mechanics and story in a way that one could not exist with the other so the gameplay in ''VA-11 HALL-A'', albeit simple, does have a strong impact on what you see on screen.

=== Design and influences ===
{{quote box |quote=[The game's premise] is based in our experience of living in a third world country, where it's natural to look for a place where you can be happy without the constant bad news [...] a really depressing society, where everyone's always sad and worried about their future in a country with no hope of recovering. So we came up with a set of characters who, in the middle of this disaster, try to go on with their lives and be as happy as they can with what they have. |source=Christopher Ortiz, game designer&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; |align=left |width=30%}}

Ortiz said that [[Sukeban Games]] was founded when he and Damas started a blog to write about anime and video games.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; They eventually managed to grow a "small but awesome" community, which lead them to create a short [[dating sim]] for the blog's first anniversary.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; After enjoying the video game creation process, they decided to continue following that path.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; The majority of influences for ''VA-11 HALL-A'' come from old [[PC-98]] games, because they are "retro" yet also "look futuristic";&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; especially ''X-Girl Cyber Punk Adventure'' which served as the blueprint for the game's aesthetic.&lt;ref name="talk"/&gt; According to Ortiz, in the 70s–90s, "the world was under the impression that Japan was going to take over with its superior technology." As such, the game is set in a parallel universe where Japan did conquer the world through technology, leading to the game's strong Japanese influences.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Neuromancer]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', and ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'' were also sources of inspiration.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; Anime influence has also resulted in the game's female protagonist and mostly female character list. Ortiz says that they focus their games on anime fans rather than mainstream appeal, as "the bigger your audience is the more creative troubles you have. Too many opinions and it's hard to see one that will truly help your creative process."&lt;ref name="interview3"/&gt;

''VA-11 HALL-A'' is also partly inspired by ''[[Snatcher (video game)|Snatcher]]'' and ''[[Policenauts]]''.&lt;ref name="talk"/&gt; The game's music has [[vaporwave]] influences, as well as influences from [[Kenji Kawai]]'s work. Ortiz described ''VA-11 HALL-A''{{'}}s composer Michael Kelly as "a big, BIG ''[[Shin Megami Tensei]]'' fan."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; The game's developers grew up playing [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Super Famicom]] games as well as watching anime; ''VA-11 HALL-A'' tries to "make players feel what we felt when playing our favourite titles back then", says Ortiz.&lt;ref name="interview3"&gt;{{cite web |author=McCoy, Fred |url=http://www.creativefluff.com/interviews-2/sukeban-games-va-11-hall-a/ |title=An Interview with VA-11 HALL-A Creator: Sukeban Games |publisher=Creative Fluff Magazine |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernando Damas, writer and programmer of ''VA-11 HALL-A'', added in an interview that the game tries to make the player "feel small", and rather than guiding them through the basics of the plotline, the player is instead thrown into the middle of everything and only given the means of piecing together what is going on.&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; He also remarked how the game is set in an "ever-moving world" where things do not wait for the player to happen, with the characters existing long before the player meeting them and their lives happen mostly off-screen.&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; As such, the developers hoped to create a world in which the player is compelled, rather than obligated, to understand.&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; Details of the world are not given directly to the player, and instead are revealed through intimate exchanges and conversations with the characters.&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; Thus, according Ortiz and Damas, ''VA-11 HALLA''{{'}}s setting therefore seeks to "humaniz[e] cyberpunk/sci-fi".&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;

''VA-11 HALL-A''{{'}}s developers come from [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; As such, according to Ortiz, their visions of a dystopian bar scene are based on their own experiences of living in a third world country, leading them to create a cast of characters that, in the middle of a "depressing society", try to go on with their lives and be as happy as they can with what they already have.&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; Tenacity in the face of difficulty can be found in every character the player interacts with in the game, where despite "each one surviving through varying degrees of hardship, they describe their problems not with bitterness but with an undertone of perseverance"&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; and a certain "burning desire to be happy" notwithstanding their deteriorating surroundings.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; Damas describes [[Sukeban Games]]' titles as "dramedies", or a fusion of drama and comedy, as they feel it is something the game industry lacks and "laughter in the middle of despair" sums up their experiences of living in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="interview3"/&gt; Ortiz and Damas noted that, compared to these real-life experiences, such as when a friend had to jump from rooftop to rooftop to escape [[2014 Venezuelan protests|the protests]] in [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristóbal]], "''VA-11 HALL-A'' is kind of tame in comparison".&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; Two in-game apps, the "danger/u/" [[textboard]] and the "Augmented Eye" news site, mirrors much of Venezuela's problems into the game's world.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; Damas explained how they wished to create a more "optimistic kind of dystopia", where the player is just "a normal person living in an interesting future".&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; Additionally, since ''VA-11 HALL-A'' is primarily about interaction with characters, the objective of the game is not to save the world but rather to become a part of it.&lt;ref name="interview3"/&gt;

=== Character development ===
{{quote box |quote=[[Worldbuilding]] requires exposition, and I find it easier to remember things when they're brought up in a casual manner and told in a readably human way [...] Aside from making the whole world building a lot easier to swallow, creating it through the characters gives each character the opportunity to present a different stance or opinion on the matter. All in all, world building through characters makes finding out about the world more natural, and a lot less like sitting through a lecture. |source=Fernando Damas, game designer&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; |align=right |width=30%}}

According to the game's developers, they make an effort to create and fully explore their characters before placing them into the game. After thinking of a "cool trait or occupation" of the character, their detailed profile is made, "span[ning] from imagining their family life to sleeping habits to what kind of pizza toppings they might prefer." Although 70% of these traits are not mentioned in the game, they allow the developers to build up a mental image of the character which helps when writing about them, says ''VA-11 HALL-A''{{'}}s programmer, Fernando Damas.&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; Before adding individual depth, the developers sought to first create a "base", consisting of an easily identifiable trait, for each character to curb redundancy and keep them unique.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; For example, "Alma started originally as 'Christmas Cake', Stella started as 'Ojou-sama' (a young, upper-class anime [[stock character]]), and Betty as 'Grumpy Granola Girl'".&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; "Non-conformity" compared to traditional archetypes was a major factor in how [[Sukeban Games]] designed its characters, to be complex and "not defined by one way".&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; [[Trope (literature)|Tropes]] were avoided; for example, Dorothy, an android sex worker, is portrayed with "a unique kind of independence" as opposed to "an edgy character to make things feel more 'mature{{' "}}, which is the case with most other sex worker characters, according to Ortiz.&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; 

TouchArcade noted that ''VA-11 HALL-A'' also has a more "salacious side", due to the presence of sexually suggestive character interactions that was present in the game's demo.&lt;ref name="ta"/&gt; In an interview between Ortiz and [[Siliconera]], Ortiz said that the game also has "[[waifu]]" elements, inspired by the "classic [[otaku]] getting strongly attached to a character"; the developers sought to recreate these relationships through characterization and not so much through looks, though there are "a fair share of [[Bishōjo|beautiful people]]."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; In another interview between Christopher Oritz and [[Kill Screen]], Ortiz remarked how "this game is all about exploring what's up with the characters that you always see in the background who are never fleshed out [in movies]", and due to this, the characters were designed to be average non-heroes;&lt;ref name="interview2"&gt;{{cite web |author=Joho, Jess |url=https://killscreen.com/articles/va-11-ha-ll-where-everyday-people-cyberpunk-dystopia-go-be-heard/ |title=VA-11 HA-LL-A, Where The Everyday People Of Cyberpunk Dystopia Go To Be Heard |publisher=Kill Screen |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jill, for example, was described by Ortiz as the cliche "bartender who's always there in the background" as opposed to a "hero" who is always at "the center of the universe, with everyone else with a supporting role."&lt;ref name="talk"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robertson, Adi |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/12/12159480/va-11-hall-a-cyberpunk-bartender-simulator-sukeban-games-interview |title=A talk with the creators of cyberpunk bartending simulator VA-11 Hall-A |publisher=The Verge |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding that "you can see it as early as the premise: [the player is] not a hero, but the bartender", Ortiz further explains that all the game's characters, from the "[science fiction] staples like mercenaries and hackers" to "common folk like veterinarians, journalists, or couriers", were deliberately made to be everyday "people, each with their opinion and lives", making them relatable to the player despite the futuristic setting.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; To help with this relatability, many of the characters and subplots in ''VA-11 HALL-A'' were based on the experiences of the developers themselves or people they know, since "We want the characters to feel as real as possible, and what better reference for real things than reality itself?".&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;

Additionally, through its characters, ''VA-11 HALL-A'' challenges traditional viewpoints on affection, relationships, and friendships in video games, writes Ana Valens of [[Den of Geek]].&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; As such, the game's cast "is open, honest, and affectionate towards one another", out of necessity in getting by and surviving in a dystopian world.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; Ortiz and Damas attempted to infuse political allegories and social commentary into the characters and their stories without overburdening or taking focus away from the main plotline.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; They noted that, in most video games, "it feels like affection is something that must be earned from scratch or something that must be justified in some way", as well as being "painfully underrated and deemed unnecessary in some cases".&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt; To avoid the player feeling this way in ''VA-11 HALL-A'', [[Sukeban Games]] made the friendships between Jill and the other characters "[something that's] come to be", instead of something that has to be earned.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Pre-release ===
{{quote box |quote=Although there aren't dialogue options, ''VA-11 HALL-A'' creates a storytelling experience that's grippingly personal. [...] There were many instances when story and gameplay worked seamlessly in tandem during my playthrough. Like when a conversation became so engaging that, when a customer interrupted it to order a drink, I sighed heavily and rushed through the order, not caring if I made the drink well or not. With such spectacular writing and worldbuilding, ''VA-11 HALL-A'' is a game that makes you ignore all your game instincts. |source=Jess Joho, [[Kill Screen]]&lt;ref name="interview2"/&gt; |align=right |width=30%}}

''VA-11 HALL-A'' has received very positive pre-release reception. Carter Dotson of [[TouchArcade]] found ''VA-11 HALL-A'' to be "kind of an odd one" and "certainly something unique", writing that "I'm not completely sure what to make of it, and I'm interested to see how it works out when completed. After all, a game that's story-driven lives and dies on the quality of said story." He compared it to ''[[Her Story (video game)|Her Story]]'' as something that could "prove to be [...] very cool."&lt;ref name="ta"/&gt; This sentiment was echoed by Kyle LeClair of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'', writing that "''VA-11 Hall-A'' sure looks great and has quite a unique hook to it, so we'll be sure to try and wet our whistles with it when it comes out on the PC".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=LeClair, Kyle |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/06/10/cyberpunk-bartender-simulator-va-11-hall-a-to-be-released-on-june-21/211085/ |title=Cyberpunk Bartender Simulator VA-11 Hall-A to be Released on June 21 |publisher=Hardcore Gamer |access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Smith of [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] claimed that although "''VA-11 Hall-A'', whose punctuation I already resent having to type, is skirting with genres I don't care about: anime-styled visual novels", he found ''VA-11 HALL-A''{{'}}s branching-style plotline to be more engaging that an average "linear and relatively uninteractive" visual novel.&lt;ref name="rps"&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Graham |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/06/va-11-hall-trailer/ |title=VA-11 Hall-A's Cyberpunk Bartending Lands June 21st |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock, Paper, Shotgun also chose ''VA-11 HALL-A'' to be one of the best games shown at EGX Rezzed 2016.&lt;ref name="rps"/&gt;

Zack Reese of RPG Site had a "great time" with the game's prologue, critiquing that "there were a lot of great touches to be had here, whether it's the anime-inspired character portraits, the fitting soundtrack that is nice to listen to even outside of context, or simply getting a permanent look of the cityscape", though he was "especially fascinated" by the "very intriguing cast of characters."&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt; Following ''VA-11 HALL-A''{{'}}s announcement, Brandon Orselli of Niche Gamer expressed optimism, writing "I'm a huge fan of cyberpunk fiction, and I feel like the genre is severely neglected if not mishandled in the gaming industry. The team at [[Sukeban Games]] seem to really be paying close attention to everything they possibly can within their game's fiction, and it shines through even in this early form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Orselli, Brandon |url=http://nichegamer.com/2014/08/21/get-your-fill-as-a-cyberpunk-bartender-in-va-11-hall-a/ |title=Get Your Fill as a Cyberpunk Bartender in VA-11 HALL-A |publisher=Niche Gamer |access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Hansen of [[Destructoid]], whilst commenting on ''VA-11 HALL-A'', found that "games don't always need to be bombastic save-the-world-'em-ups", and also the game "should be the best anime-inspired bartending sim of the year. And I don't say that lightly." He also added that he was "sold" and compared the game to ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hansen, Steven |url=https://www.destructoid.com/waifu-bartending-va-11-hall-a-seems-like-the-best-dive-this-side-of-catherine-284604.phtml |title=Waifu bartending: VA-11 HALL-A seems like the best dive this side of Catherine |publisher=Destructoid |access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |author=Hansen, Steven |url=https://www.destructoid.com/va-11-hall-a-s-got-cat-girls-booze-and-an-oppressive-state-295465.phtml |title=VA-11 HALL-A's got cat girls, booze, and an oppressive state |publisher=Destructoid |access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salvador GRodiles of [[Japanator]] joked that he looked forward to the "glorious date" and "special joyous day" that is ''VA-11 HALL-A''{{'}}s release date.&lt;ref name="japanator"/&gt;

''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Phil Savage praised the game's character interactions, noting that "it's through these brief, unguarded conversations that the cyberpunk bartending sim slowly unfolds its story; not of a dystopian world, but of the people living in it." Reviewing the game's prologue trailer, he added that "it's an interesting concept, and well executed in what is—at this stage—a somewhat limited capacity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Savage, Phil |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/va-11-hall-a-trailer-shows-cyberpunk-bartending-in-a-dark-dystopia/ |title=VA-11 HALL-A trailer shows cyberpunk bartending in a dark dystopia |publisher=PC Gamer |access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Benson of [[Kotaku]] wrote that "''Valhalla'' is a cocktail of game genres. It draws from visual novels, with each customer who visits your bar having a different story to tell. There's a healthy measure of ''[[Papers, Please]]'', too, with you having to perform a mundane job (drink mixing) by following a complicated list of tasks. [...] And, on top of that you also get to manage and decorate your bar, so there's a dash of ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' for flavour." He also quipped that "year after year, nothing seems to slow the pace of successful cyberpunk bartender simulators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Benson, Julian |url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/06/06/a-game-for-anyone-who-has-ever-wanted-to-tend-the-bar-in-a-cyberpunk-city |title=A Game for Anyone Who Has Ever Wanted to Tend the Bar in a Cyberpunk City |publisher=Kotaku UK |access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Push Square's Nicola Hayden added that "gaining cult success around the more niche areas of the Internet, ''VA-11 HALL-A'', a cyberpunk bartending simulator, has managed to stir up quite a fuss."&lt;ref name="psquare"&gt;{{cite web |author=Hayden, Nicola |url=http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2015/03/cyberpunk_bartending_action_hits_the_vita_with_va-11_hall-a |title=Cyberpunk Bartending Action Hits the Vita with VA-11 HALL-A |publisher=Push Square |access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Davison of MoeGamer praised the prologue's characters, dialogue, as well as cohesion between the gameplay and storytelling, finding it to be an "enormously interesting prospect".&lt;ref name="moe"&gt;{{cite web |author=Davison, Pete |url=https://moegamer.net/2014/08/20/where-everybody-knows-your-name-is-bartender/ |title=Where everybody knows your name is "bartender" |publisher=MoeGamer |access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katherine Cross of [[Gamasutra]], whilst not giving a final score, praised Jill's character as not being a traditional protagonist or "in control of much" in her world, the setting, as well as the "delightfully colorful" cast; and that ''VA-11 HALL-A'' successfully "make[s] magic out of the mundane."

Roberts summarized it as a game "you should be playing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Roberts, David |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/good-libations-and-frank-conversations-you-should-be-playing-va-11-hall-a/ |title=Good libations and frank conversations: You should be playing VA-11 HALL-A |publisher=GamesRadar |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sin Vega of Rock, Paper, Shotgun received ''VA-11 HALL-A'' generally positively. He found the writing to be "decent" and the characters "generally enjoyable, even when they're not exactly likeable", and praised the game's references to current pop-culture issues and internet climate, for example [[4chan]], human augmentation and manufactured pop stars. The music and gameplay were also complimented, but the game's presentation was criticised&amp;nbsp;– especially the presentation of the dialogue, which only takes up a few lines per page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vega, Sin |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/21/va-11-hall-a-review/ |title=Wot I Think: VA-11 Hall-A |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caty McCarthy of [[Kill Screen]] wrote that ''VA-11 HALL-A'' "flips the atypical ways of cyberpunk", and lauded the game's story, which "has heart" as a "story of its people, its liliths, its sentient preserved-brains, its talking dogs. It's the story of Jill and her customers, all being lost, and eventually finding their way." She compared it also to a good book, where "we, the player, take[s] the backseat, and soak[s] it all in." A final score of 80/100 was awarded.&lt;ref name="Kill Screen review"&gt;{{cite web |author=McCarthy, Caty |url=https://killscreen.com/articles/va-11-hall-modern-cyberpunk/ |title=VA-11 HALL-A is how you do modern cyberpunk |publisher=Kill Screen |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Kotzer, writing for [[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]], compared ''VA-11 HALL-A'' to "''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' meets ''[[Cheers]]''", and added that what makes the game engaging is that it chooses to focus on "one very specific corner" of a complex world, writing "sure, there's an urban war brewing outside, but inside this [bar] is just people. Chatter about current events and politics, morality, and sex."&lt;ref name="Motherboard"/&gt;

{{quote box |quote=What truly fascinates me about games like ''VA-11 Hall-A'' is that they make magic out of the mundane. In most games, the bartender is a background NPC with a few throwaway lines and maybe a quest or two. Here, as the bartender, you find her relatively normal life to be quite intriguing; games like this are digital page-turners and Fernando Damas' superb writing just makes you want to go even faster. As you go through more dialogue screens with Jill you discover she's quite eloquent and scientifically educated to no small degree [...] Her back story unfolds along with the tragedies of her clients&amp;nbsp;– and it's heartbreakingly relatable. |source=Katherine Cross, [[Gamasutra]]&lt;ref name="Gamasutra review"/&gt; |align=right |width=30%}}

However, PC Gamer's review was more nuanced, opining that although "what ''Valhalla'' is trying to do is interesting", "playing it is boring", with criticism directed at the repetitive nature of gameplay as well as the game's tone, which leaves a "strange, unpleasant lingering taste in your mouth" due to the oftentimes unrealistic dialogue, for a rating of 60/100.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/va-11-hall-a-review/ |title=VA-11 HALL-A review |publisher=PC Gamer |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of these sentiments where echoed by Kate Gray of [[Eurogamer]]; she also praised the premise as interesting, but lamented that "''Valhalla''{{'}}s bartending is just boring", with not enough player control to make the game feel creative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gray, Kate |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-06-does-va-11-hall-a-capture-the-joy-of-a-menial-job-well-done |title=Does VA-11 HALL-A capture the joy of a menial job well done? |publisher=Eurogamer |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adi Robertson of ''The Verge'' alleged that some reviewers found the game's sexualized dialogue from the female characters to be unrealistic. Ortiz responded that interactions were based upon their own interactions, including that "females have always been more open about those topics than males", but he did concede that "we wrote ourselves into a corner by making the cast predominantly female".&lt;ref name="talk"/&gt;

=== Accolades ===

''VA-11 HALL-A''  made appearances on lists of the most anticipated video games multiple times before its release. An article by [[GamesRadar]] staff of the "12 PAX East games we wish we were still playing" included ''VA-11 HALL-A''; praise was directed at the game's complexity, and how "you can decide to give the customer the drink they ordered, flipping through the recipe book and dragging ingredients into the mixer in a simple minigame, or you can screw it up, and give them something totally different", as well as the "wildly different directions" the narrative takes as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/13-pax-east-games-we-wish-we-were-still-playing/ |title=12 PAX East games we wish we were still playing |publisher=GamesRadar |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Twinfinite's Matthew Byrd ranked ''VA-11 HALL-A'' first on the "10 Anticipated Indie Games You Have to Check Out in 2016", writing that: "While I can honestly say that I've never specifically wished for a cyberpunk bartending game before, now that I know such a thing exists, it is all that I can think of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Byrd, Matthew |url=https://twinfinite.net/2016/04/10-anticipated-indie-games/ |title=10 Anticipated Indie Games You Have to Check Out in 2016 |publisher=Twinfinite |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zach Budgor of Kill Screen described ''VA-11 HALL-A'' as one of their favourite titles at Cyberpunk Game Jam 2014, describing it as "self-styled 'cyberpunk bartender action' with detailed art and an [[LP record|LP]]'s worth of bass-heavy future bangers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Budgor, Zach |url=https://killscreen.com/articles/jack-into-these-cyberpunk-game-jam-entries/ |title=Cyberpunk Game Jam Yields Rad Cyberpunk Games; Here Are Our Favs |publisher=Kill Screen |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''PC Gamer'' added ''VA-11 HALL-A''{{'}}s playable prologue to their list of "The best free PC games".&lt;ref name="bestfree"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-free-pc-games/3/ |title=The best free PC games |publisher=PC Gamer |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, Thomas Faust of [[IndieGames.com]] labelled ''VA-11 HALL-A'' the best game of the year, adding "as far as I'm concerned, the rest of 2016 can go home now. Game of the year right there, bam." Faust also noted that the [[slice of life]] setting of ''VA-11 HALL-A'', as well as its characters, are a departure from more conventional video game settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Faust, Thomas |url=http://indiegames.com/2016/06/have_some_cyberpunk_bartender_.html |title=VA-11 Hall-A Is The Best Game Of 207X |publisher=IndieGames.com |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[Gizmodo]] UK'' on June 25 listed ''VA-11 HALL-A'' as their top recommended video game for the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sulleyman, Aatif |url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2016/06/films-games-events-what-to-get-up-to-this-weekend-7/ |title=Films, Games, Events: What to Get up to This Weekend |publisher=Gizmodo UK |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ana Valens of Den of Geek also listed ''VA-11 HALL-A'' as "one of the great visual novels of 2016", again praising the game's characters and "powerful" writing.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is a collection of ancedotal essays written by Kaling about her experiences and observations about Hollywood.&lt;ref name="pub" /&gt; Carina Chocano of ''The New York Times'' noted that the book was "loosely fashioned around themes of approval and entitlement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Chocano|first=Carina |date=16 November 2015 |title= Mindy Kaling’s ‘Why Not Me?’|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/books/review/mindy-kalings-why-not-me.html?mtrref=www.google.es&amp;gwh=B3B49854C935C6272DB911C9D0C716B3&amp;gwt=pay|work= The New York Times |access-date= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also contains a chapter that is a work of fiction about an alternative world where Kaling is a Latin teacher in a prep school on the Upper East Side of New York City.&lt;ref name="entertainment weekly" /&gt;

The final chapter of the book is a transcript of Kaling's 2014 speech at [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref name="entertainment weekly" /&gt;

==Reception==
The book received mostly positive reviews. ''The Atlantic'' called the book "a defense of hard work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Garber |first=Megan |date= |title= Mindy Kaling Is Thirsty|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/09/mindy-kaling-is-thirsty/405160/ |work= The Atlantic |location= |access-date=24 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers Weekly criticized the book for skirting major issues such as her mother's death and relationship with [[B.

'''Wound licking''' is an instinctive response in humans and many other animals to [[licking|lick]] an [[injury]]. Dogs, cats, small rodents, horses, and primates all lick wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Engel| first = Cindy | title = Wild Health: Lessons in Natural Wellness from the Animal Kingdom | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year = 2003| location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=8FwqLh2a2ckC | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780618340682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saliva]] contains [[tissue factor]] which promotes the [[blood coagulation|blood clotting mechanism]]. The enzyme [[lysozyme]] is found in many tissues and is known to attack the cell walls of many [[gram-positive bacteria]], aiding in defense against infection. Tears are also beneficial to wounds due to the lysozyme enzyme. However, there are also infection risks due to bacteria in the human mouth.

==In animals==
[[File:Cat with Elizabethan collar.jpg|left|thumb|A cat with an [[Elizabethan collar]]]]
[[File:Canine lick granuloma.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lick granuloma]] from excessive licking]]

It has been long observed that the licking of their wounds by dogs might be beneficial. Indeed, a dog's saliva is [[bactericidal]] against the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus|Streptococcus canis]]'', although not against coagulase positive ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hart BL, Powell KL |title=Antibacterial properties of saliva: role in maternal periparturient grooming and in licking wounds |journal=Physiol.

Wound licking is also important in other animals. Removal of the salivary glands of mice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bodner L, Knyszynski A, Adler-Kunin S, Danon D |title=The effect of selective desalivation on wound healing in mice |journal=Exp.

In [[macaques]], hair surrounding a wound and any dirt is removed, and the wound is licked, healing without infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dittus WP, Ratnayeke SM |title=Individual and social behavioral responses to injury in wild toque macaques (''Macaca Sinica'') |journal=International Journal of Primatology |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=215–34 |year=1989  |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/b61609g7563023p5/ |doi=10.1007/BF02735201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks===
Wound licking is beneficial but too much licking can be harmful. An [[Elizabethan collar]] may be used on pet animals to prevent them from biting an injury or excessively licking it, which can cause a [[lick granuloma]]. These lesions are often infected by pathogenic bacteria such as ''Staphylococcus intermedius''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shumaker AK, Angus JC, Coyner KS, Loeffler DG, Rankin SC, Lewis TP |title=Microbiological and histopathological features of canine acral lick dermatitis |journal=Vet. Dermatol. |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=288–98 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18699812 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3164.2008.00693.x |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/vderm/2008/00000019/00000005/art00007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection is another risk. Horses that lick wounds may become infected by a stomach [[parasite]], ''[[Habronema]]'', a type of [[nematode]] worm. The [[rabies]] virus may be transmitted between animals, such as the [[Greater Kudu|kudu antelopes]] by wound licking of wounds with residual infectious saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mansfield K, McElhinney L, Hübschle O, etal |title=A molecular epidemiological study of rabies epizootics in kudu (''Tragelaphus strepsiceros'') in Namibia |journal=BMC Vet.

==In humans==

===Legend===
There are many legends involving healing wounds by licking them or applying saliva. Saint [[Magdalena de Pazzi]] is said to have cured a nun of [[Skin lesion|sores]] and scabs in 1589 by licking her limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fabrini | first = Placido | authorlink = |author2=Isoleri, Antonio  | title = The life of St. Mary Magdalen De-Pazzi : Florentine noble, sacred Carmelite virgin| publisher =  | year = 1900 | location = Philadelphia | pages =  | url = https://archive.org/details/thelifeofstmarym00fabruoft | doi = | id = | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]] is said to have performed a healing of a blind man using his saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eve E |title=Spit in Your Eye: The Blind Man of Bethsaida and the Blind Man of Alexandria |journal=New Testament Studies |volume=54 |pages=1–17 |year=2008 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1683000 |doi=10.1017/S0028688508000015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] reported that a fasting woman's saliva is an effective cure for bloodshot eyes.

===Risks===

There are potential health hazards in wound licking due to infection risk, especially in [[immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] patients. Human saliva contains a wide variety of bacteria that are harmless in the mouth, but that may cause significant infection if introduced into a wound. A notable case was a [[diabetes|diabetic]] man who licked his bleeding [[thumb]] following a minor [[bicycle accident]], and subsequently had to have the thumb amputated after it became infected with ''[[Eikenella corrodens]]'' from his saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weil HP, Fischer-Brügge U, Koch P |title=Potential hazard of wound licking |journal=N.

===Modern cases===
There are contemporary reports of the healing properties of dog saliva.

'''Yellowjacket''' is a fictional [[super-hero]], and the first to be published by the company that would become [[Charlton Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Yellowjacket Comics'' #1 (September 1944)

== Publication history ==
Yellowjacket starred in his own title, ''Yellowjacket Comics'', which was published for ten issues from 1944 to 1946. There was no artist or writer credited for the stories. These ten issues were published by "E. Levy/Frank Comunale", which later became Charlton. When the title was renamed ''Jack in the Box'', Yellowjacket appeared in the first issue, #11. He also appeared in ''TNT Comics'' #1, which was published by "Charles Publications".

Due to copyright laws at the time of his inception, Yellowjacket lapsed into the public domain on the 28th anniversary of his initial published appearance.

Yellowjacket finally makes his [[DC Comics]] debut in [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[The Multiversity]] series. He is the first superhero on Earth 4, as well as the father of the [[President of the United States]] on that Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/morrison-and-quitely-tackle-watchmen-and-modern-su-212146|title=Morrison and Quitely tackle Watchmen and modern superheroes in Pax Americana|date=21 November 2014|work=avclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional character biography ==
Yellowjacket's secret identity is crime writer, Vince Harley. After a group of jewel robbers attempted to kill him by pouring a box of [[yellowjacket]]s on him, he found that he had gained the ability to control the insects, and used that ability to fight crime while wearing a yellow costume with a black and yellow striped cape resembling the markings of said insect.
