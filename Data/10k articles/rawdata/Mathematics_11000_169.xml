{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}
In [[mathematics]], '''Abel's theorem''' for [[power series]] relates a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a power series to the sum of its [[coefficient]]s.  It is named after Norwegian mathematician [[Niels Henrik Abel]].

==Theorem==

Let

:&lt;math&gt;G (x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k&lt;/math&gt;

be a power series with real coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; with radius of convergence&amp;nbsp;1.  Suppose that the series 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k&lt;/math&gt; 

converges.  Then ''G''(''x'') is continuous from the left at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 1^-} G(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k. &lt;/math&gt;

The same theorem holds for complex power series 

:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k z^k,&lt;/math&gt; 

provided that &lt;math&gt;z \to 1&lt;/math&gt; within a ''Stolz sector'', that is, a region of the open unit disk where

: &lt;math&gt; |1-z|\leq M(1-|z|)&lt;/math&gt;

for some&amp;nbsp;''M''.  Without this restriction, the limit may fail to exist: for example, the power series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n&gt;0} \frac{z^{3^n}-z^{2\times 3^n}} n &lt;/math&gt;

converges to 0 at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, but is unbounded near any point of the form ''e''&lt;sup&gt;{{pi}}i/3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so the value at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is not the limit as ''z'' tends to 1 in the whole open disk.

Note that ''G''(''z'') is continuous on the real closed interval [0,&amp;nbsp;''t''] for ''t''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1, by virtue of the uniform convergence of the series on compact subsets of the disk of convergence.  Abel's theorem allows us to say more, namely that ''G''(''z'') is continuous on&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].

==Remarks==
As an immediate consequence of this theorem, if ''z'' is any nonzero complex number for which the series 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k z^k&lt;/math&gt; 

converges, then it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to 1^{-}} G(tz) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kz^k&lt;/math&gt;

in which the limit is taken [[one-sided limit|from below]].

The theorem can also be generalized to account for infinite sums.{{cn|date=May 2015}} If

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

then 

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\to 1^{-}} G(z) \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt; 

However, if the series is only known to be divergent, the theorem fails; take for example, the power series for 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+z}.&lt;/math&gt;

At &lt;math&gt;z=1&lt;/math&gt; the series is equal to &lt;math&gt;1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \cdots, &lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{1+1}=\tfrac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

We also remark the theorem holds for radii of convergence other than &lt;math&gt;R=1&lt;/math&gt;: let 

:&lt;math&gt;G(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kx^k&lt;/math&gt; 

be a power series with radius of convergence &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose the series converges at &lt;math&gt;x=R&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;G(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous from the left at &lt;math&gt;x=R&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to R^-}G(x)=G(R)&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

The utility of Abel's theorem is that it allows us to find the limit of a power series as its argument (i.e. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) approaches 1 from below, even in cases where the [[radius of convergence]], &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, of the power series is equal to 1 and we cannot be sure whether the limit should be finite or not. See e.g. the [[binomial series]]. Abel's theorem allows us to evaluate many series in closed form. For example, when 

:&lt;math&gt; a_k = \frac{(-1)^k}{k+1},&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain 

:&lt;math&gt;G_a(z) = \frac{\ln(1+z)}{z}, \qquad 0 &lt; z &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt; 

by integrating the uniformly convergent geometric power series term by term on &lt;math&gt;[-z, 0]&lt;/math&gt;; thus the series 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; 

converges to &lt;math&gt;\ln(2)&lt;/math&gt; by Abel's theorem. Similarly, 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}&lt;/math&gt; 

converges to  &lt;math&gt;\arctan(1) = \tfrac{\pi}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;G_a(z)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[generating function]] of the sequence &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Abel's theorem is frequently useful in dealing with generating functions of real-valued and non-negative [[sequence]]s, such as [[probability-generating function]]s. In particular, it is useful in the theory of [[Galton&amp;ndash;Watson process]]es.

==Outline of proof==

After subtracting a constant from &lt;math&gt;a_0 &lt;/math&gt;, we may assume that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k=0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;s_n=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then substituting &lt;math&gt;a_k=s_k-s_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; and performing a simple manipulation of the series results in

:&lt;math&gt;G_a(z) = (1-z)\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} s_k z^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Given &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt; pick ''n'' large enough so that &lt;math&gt;|s_k| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;k\ge n&lt;/math&gt; and note that

:&lt;math&gt;\left|(1-z)\sum_{k=n}^\infty s_kz^k \right| \le \varepsilon |1-z|\sum_{k=n}^\infty |z|^k = \varepsilon|1-z|\frac{|z|^n}{1-|z|} &lt; \varepsilon M &lt;/math&gt;

when ''z'' lies within the given Stolz angle. Whenever ''z'' is sufficiently close to 1 we have

:&lt;math&gt;\left|(1-z)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} s_kz^k \right| &lt; \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt;|G_a(z)| &lt; (M+1)\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; when ''z'' is both sufficiently close to 1 and within the Stolz angle.

==Related concepts==

Converses to a theorem like Abel's are called [[Tauberian theorem]]s: There is no exact converse, but results conditional on some hypothesis. The field of [[divergent series]], and their summation methods, contains many theorems ''of abelian type'' and ''of tauberian type''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6908">In [[mathematics]], an '''algebraic expression''' is an [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]] built up from integer [[constant (mathematics)|constants]], [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], and the [[algebraic operation]]s ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[Division (mathematics)|division]] and [[exponentiation]] by an exponent that is a [[rational number]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Christopher G. |title=Academic Press dictionary of science and technology |page=74 |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nauWlPTBcjIC&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=algebraic%20expression%20over%20a%20field&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{math|1=3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''xy'' + ''c''}} is an algebraic expression. Since taking the [[square root]] is the same as raising to the power {{sfrac|1|2}},
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
is also an algebraic expression.  By contrast, [[transcendental number]]s like [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[E (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]] are not algebraic.

A '''rational expression''' is an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] that may be rewritten to a [[rational fraction]] by using the properties of the arithmetic operations ([[commutative property|commutative properties]] and [[associative property|associative properties]] of addition and multiplication, [[distributive property]] and rules for the operations on the fractions). In other words, a rational expression is an expression which may be constructed from the variables and the constants by using only the four operations of [[arithmetic]]. Thus, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3x^2 - 2xy + c}{y^3-1}&lt;/math&gt;
is a rational expression, whereas 
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
is not.

A '''rational equation''' is an equation in which two rational fractions (or rational expressions) of the form 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
are set equal to each other. These expressions obey the same rules as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]. The equations can be solved by [[cross-multiplication|cross-multiplying]]. [[Division by zero]] is undefined, so that a solution causing formal division by zero is rejected.

==Terminology==

[[Algebra]] has its own terminology to describe parts of an expression:
&lt;center&gt;
[[File:algebraic equation notation.svg|256px]]&lt;br&gt;
1 – Exponent (power), 2 – coefficient, 3 – term, 4 – operator, 5 – constant, &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; - variables
&lt;/center&gt;

==In roots of polynomials==

The [[root of a function|roots]] of a polynomial expression of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] ''n'', or equivalently the solutions of a [[polynomial equation]], can always be written as algebraic expressions if ''n'' &lt; 5 (see [[quadratic formula]], [[cubic function]], and [[quartic equation]]). Such a solution of an equation is called an [[algebraic solution]]. But the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] states that algebraic solutions do not exist for all such equations (just for some of them) if ''n'' &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; 5.

==Conventions==

===Variables===
By convention, letters at the beginning of the alphabet (e.g. &lt;math&gt;a, b, c&lt;/math&gt;) are typically used to represent [[Mathematical constant|constants]], and those toward the end of the alphabet (e.g. &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) are used to represent [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]].&lt;ref&gt;William L. Hosch (editor), ''The Britannica Guide to Algebra and Trigonometry'', Britannica Educational Publishing, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2010, {{ISBN|1615302190}}, 9781615302192, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ad0P0elU1_0C&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=elementary%20algebra%20letters%20alphabet%20constants%20variables&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=letters&amp;f=false page 71]&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually written in italics.&lt;ref&gt;James E.

===Exponents===
By convention, terms with the highest power ([[Exponentiation|exponent]]), are written on the left, for example, &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is written to the left of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. When a coefficient is one, it is usually omitted (e.g. &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;1x^2&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;David Alan Herzog, ''Teach Yourself Visually Algebra'', Publisher John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{ISBN|0470185597}}, 9780470185599, 304 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Igs6t_clf0oC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;ots=Excnhf1AgW&amp;dq=algebra%20coefficient%20one&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q=coefficient%20of%201&amp;f=false page 72]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise when the exponent (power) is one, (e.g. &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;3x^1&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math style="margin-bottom:8px"&gt;3x&lt;/math&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;John C.

==Algebraic vs. other mathematical expressions==
The table below summarizes how algebraic expressions compare with several other types of mathematical expressions by the type of elements they may contain, according to common but not universal conventions.

{{Mathematical expressions}}

A ''rational algebraic expression'' (or ''rational expression'') is an algebraic expression that can be written as a [[quotient]] of [[polynomial]]s, such as {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4''x'' + 4}}. An ''irrational algebraic expression'' is one that is not rational, such as {{math|{{radical|''x'' + 4}}}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5719">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], the '''BIT predicate''' or '''Ackermann coding''', sometimes written BIT(''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j''), is a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] which tests whether the ''j''th [[bit]] of the number ''i'' is 1, when ''i'' is written in binary.

==History==
The BIT predicate was first introduced as the encoding of [[hereditarily finite set]]s as [[natural number]]s by [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in his 1937 paper&lt;ref name=ackermann&gt;{{cite journal|

(''The Consistency of General Set Theory'').

Each natural number encodes a finite set and
each finite set is represented by a natural number.
This mapping uses the [[binary numeral system]].
If the number ''n'' encodes a finite set ''A'' and the ''i''th binary digit of ''n'' is 1, then the set encoded by ''i'' is an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of ''A''.

The Ackermann coding is a [[primitive recursive function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=261|last=Rautenberg|first=Wolfgang|authorlink=Wolfgang Rautenberg|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1221-3|title=A Concise Introduction to Mathematical Logic|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-1-4419-1220-6/|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|edition=3rd|isbn=978-1-4419-1220-6|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In programming languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] that provide a [[Bitwise operation#Bit shifts|right shift operator]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a [[Bitwise operation|bitwise Boolean and operator]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, the BIT predicate BIT(''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') can be implemented by the expression
&lt;code&gt;(i&gt;&gt;j)&amp;1&lt;/code&gt;. Here the bits of ''i'' are numbered from the low order bits to high order bits in the [[binary representation]] of ''i'', with the ones bit being numbered as bit&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mastering C++|first=K.

==Private information retrieval==
In the mathematical study of computer security, the [[private information retrieval]] problem can be modeled as one in which a client, communicating with a collection of servers that store a binary number ''i'', wishes to determine the result of a BIT predicate BIT(''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') without divulging the value of ''j'' to the servers. {{harvtxt|Chor|Kushilevitz|Goldreich|Sudan|1998}} describe a method for replicating ''i'' across two servers in such a way that the client can solve the private information retrieval problem using a substantially smaller amount of communication than would be necessary to recover the complete value of&amp;nbsp;''i''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Mathematical logic==
The BIT predicate is often examined in the context of [[first-order logic]], where we can examine the system resulting from adding the BIT predicate to first-order logic.  In [[descriptive complexity]], the complexity class FO&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;BIT resulting from adding the BIT predicate to [[FO (complexity)|FO]] results in a more robust complexity class.&lt;ref name="Immerman book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Immerman | first = Neil | authorlink = Neil Immerman | title = Descriptive Complexity | year = 1999 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | isbn = 0-387-98600-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The class FO&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;BIT, of first-order logic with the BIT predicate, is the same as the class FO&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;PLUS&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;TIMES, of first-order logic with addition and multiplication predicates.&lt;ref name="Immerman BIT predicate"&gt;{{cite book | last = Immerman | first = Neil | authorlink = Neil Immerman | title = Descriptive Complexity | year = 1999 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | isbn = 0-387-98600-6 | pages = 14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction of the Rado graph==
[[File:Rado graph.svg|thumb|316x316px|The Rado graph: for instance there is an edge from 0 to 3 because the 0th bit of 3 is non zero.]]
Ackermann in 1937 and [[Richard Rado]] in 1964 used this predicate to construct the infinite [[Rado graph]]. In their construction, the vertices of this graph correspond to the non-negative integers, written in binary, and there is an undirected edge from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'', for ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''j'', when BIT(''j'',''i'') is nonzero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Richard|last=Rado|authorlink=Richard Rado|url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa9/aa9133.pdf|title=Universal graphs and universal functions|journal=Acta Arith.|year=1964|volume=9|pages=331–340}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">'''Banach's match problem''' is a classic problem in [[probability]] attributed to [[Stefan Banach]]. Feller &lt;ref&gt; Feller, William, An Introduction to Probability Theory And Its Applications, Third Edition, Wiley, 1968, Chapter VI, section 8 &lt;/ref&gt; says that the problem was inspired by a humorous reference to Banach's smoking habit in a speech honouring him by H. Steinhaus, but that it was not Banach who set the problem or provided an answer. 

Suppose a mathematician carries two matchboxes at all times: one in his left pocket and one in his right. Each time he needs a match, he is equally likely to take it from either pocket. Suppose he reaches into his pocket and discovers for the first time that the box picked is empty. If it is assumed that each of the matchboxes originally contained &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; matches, what is the probability that there are exactly &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; matches in the other box?

==Solution==

Without loss of generality consider the case where the matchbox in his right pocket has an unlimited number of matches and let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be the number of matches removed from this one before the left one is found to be empty.  When the left pocket is found to be empty, the man has chosen that pocket &lt;math&gt;(N+1)&lt;/math&gt; times.  Then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the number of successes before &lt;math&gt;(N+1)&lt;/math&gt; failures in Bernoulli trials with &lt;math&gt;p=1/2&lt;/math&gt;, which has the [[negative binomial distribution]] and thus

:&lt;math&gt;P[M=m] = \binom{N+m}{m}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{N+1+m}&lt;/math&gt;.

Returning to the original problem, we see that the probability that the left pocket is found to be empty first is &lt;math&gt;P[M&lt;N+1]&lt;/math&gt; which equals &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; because both are equally likely.  We see that the number &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of matches remaining in the other pocket is

:&lt;math&gt;P[K=k] = P[M=N-k|M&lt;N+1] = 2P[M=N-k] = \binom{2N-k}{N-k}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2N-k}&lt;/math&gt;.

The expectation of the distribution is approximately &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{N/\pi}-1&lt;/math&gt;. (This is shown using [[Stirling's approximation]].&lt;ref&gt;Feller, page 238.&lt;/ref&gt;) So starting with boxes with &lt;math&gt;N=40&lt;/math&gt; matches, the expected number of matches in the second box is &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7394">In the [[mathematical analysis]], and especially in [[real analysis|real]] and [[harmonic analysis]], a '''Birnbaum–Orlicz space''' is a type of function space which generalizes the [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]].  Like the L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces, they are [[Banach space]]s.  The spaces are named for [[Władysław Orlicz]] and [[Zygmunt William Birnbaum]], who first defined them in 1931.

Besides the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces, a variety of function spaces arising naturally in analysis are Birnbaum–Orlicz spaces.  One such space ''L''&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''L'', which arises in the study of [[Hardy–Littlewood maximal function]]s, consists of measurable functions ''f'' such that the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |f(x)|\log^+ |f(x)|\,dx &lt; \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Here log&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[positive part]] of the logarithm.  Also included in the class of Birnbaum–Orlicz spaces are many of the most important [[Sobolev space]]s.

==Formal definition==

Suppose that &amp;mu; is a [[&amp;sigma;-finite measure]] on a set ''X'', and &amp;Phi;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;∞)&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;∞) is a [[Young function]], i.e., a [[convex function]] such that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Phi(x)} x \to \infty,\quad\text{as }x\to \infty,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Phi(x)} x \to 0,\quad\text{as }x\to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;L^\dagger_\Phi&lt;/math&gt; be the set of measurable functions ''f'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; '''R''' such that the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \Phi(|f|)\, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

is finite, where, as usual, functions that agree [[almost everywhere]] are identified.

This ''may not be'' a vector space (it may fail to be closed under scalar multiplication).  The vector space of functions spanned by &lt;math&gt;L^\dagger_\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the Birnbaum–Orlicz space, denoted &lt;math&gt;L_\Phi&lt;/math&gt;.

To define a norm on &lt;math&gt;L_\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, let &amp;Psi; be the Young complement of &amp;Phi;; that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x) = \int_0^x (\Phi')^{-1}(t)\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that [[Young's inequality for products]] holds:

:&lt;math&gt;ab\le \Phi(a) + \Psi(b).&lt;/math&gt;

The norm is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_\Phi = \sup\left\{\|fg\|_1\mid \int \Psi\circ |g|\, d\mu \le 1\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the space &lt;math&gt;L_\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is precisely the space of measurable functions for which this norm is finite.

An equivalent norm {{harv|Rao|Ren|1991|loc=§3.3}} is defined on L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Phi;&lt;/sub&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|'_\Phi = \inf\left\{k\in (0,\infty)\mid\int_X \Phi(|f|/k)\,d\mu\le 1 \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

and likewise L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Phi;&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;mu;) is the space of all measurable functions for which this norm is finite.

===Example===

Here is an example where &lt;math&gt;L^\dagger_\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is not a vector space and is strictly smaller than &lt;math&gt;L_\Phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Suppose that ''X'' is the open unit interval (0,1), &amp;Phi;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;exp(''x'')&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''x'', and ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log(''x''). Then ''af'' is in the space &lt;math&gt;L_\Phi&lt;/math&gt; but is only in the set &lt;math&gt;L^\dagger_\Phi&lt;/math&gt; if&amp;nbsp;|''a''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.

==Properties==

* Orlicz spaces generalize ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces (for &lt;math&gt;1&lt;p&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;) in the sense that if &lt;math&gt;\varphi (t) = t^p&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\| u \|_{L^\varphi (X)} = \| u \|_{L^p (X)}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;L^\varphi (X) = L^p (X)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The Orlicz space &lt;math&gt;L^\varphi (X)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Banach space]] &amp;mdash; a [[complete space|complete]] [[norm (mathematics)|normed]] [[vector space]].

==Relations to Sobolev spaces==

Certain [[Sobolev space]]s are embedded in Orlicz spaces: for &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; [[open set|open]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] with [[Lipschitz domain|Lipschitz boundary]] &lt;math&gt;\partial X&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;W_0^{1, p} (X) \subseteq L^\varphi (X)&lt;/math&gt;

for

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi (t) := \exp \left( | t |^{p / (p - 1)} \right) - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the analytical content of the [[Trudinger inequality]]:  For &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; open and bounded with Lipschitz boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial X&lt;/math&gt;, consider the space &lt;math&gt;W_0^{k, p} (X)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k p = n&lt;/math&gt;. There exist constants &lt;math&gt;C_1, C_2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt;\int_X \exp \left( \left( \frac{| u(x) |}{C_1 \| \mathrm{D}^k u \|_{L^p (X)}} \right)^{p / (p - 1)} \right) \, \mathrm{d} x \leq C_2 | X |.&lt;/math&gt;

==Orlicz norm of a random variable==
Similarly, the Orlicz norm of a [[random variable]] characterizes it as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\|X\|_\Psi \triangleq  \inf\left\{k\in (0,\infty)\mid \operatorname{E}[ \Psi(|X|/k)] \le 1 \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

This norm is [[Homogeneous function#Positive homogeneity|homogeneous]] and is defined only when this set is non-empty.

When &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x) = x^p&lt;/math&gt;, this coincides with the ''p''-th [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]] of the random variable. Other special cases in the exponential family are taken with respect to the functions &lt;math&gt;\Psi_q(x) = \exp(x^q)-1 &lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;q \geq 1 &lt;/math&gt;). A random variable with finite &lt;math&gt;\Psi_2&lt;/math&gt; norm is said to be "[[Sub-Gaussian distribution|sub-Gaussian]]" and a random variable with finite &lt;math&gt;\Psi_1&lt;/math&gt; norm is said to be "sub-exponential". Indeed, the boundedness of the &lt;math&gt;\Psi_p&lt;/math&gt; norm characterizes the limiting behavior of the probability density function:

:&lt;math&gt;\|X\|_{\Psi_p} = c \rightarrow \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f_X(x) \exp(|x/c|^p) = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

so that the tail of this probability density function asymptotically resembles, and is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;\exp(-|x/c|^p)&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;math&gt;\Psi_1&lt;/math&gt; norm may be easily computed from a strictly monotonic [[moment-generating function]]. For example, the moment-generating function of a [[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]] random variable X with K degrees of freedom is &lt;math&gt;M_X(t) = (1-2t)^{-K/2}&lt;/math&gt;, so that the inverse of the &lt;math&gt;\Psi_1&lt;/math&gt; norm is related to the functional inverse of the moment-generating function:

:&lt;math&gt;\|X\|_{\Psi_1} ^{-1} = M_X^{-1}(2) = (1-4^{-1/K})/2.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''codebook''' is a type of document used for gathering and storing codes. Originally codebooks were often literally [[books|&lt;span lang="en-us" dir="ltr"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;]], but today codebook is a byword for the complete record of a series of codes, regardless of physical format.

==Cryptography==
In [[cryptography]], a codebook is a document used for implementing a [[code (cryptography)|code]]. A codebook contains a [[lookup table]] for coding and decoding; each word or phrase has one or more strings which replace it. To decipher messages written in code, corresponding copies of the codebook must be available at either end. The distribution and [[physical security]] of codebooks presents a special difficulty in the use of codes, compared to the secret information used in [[cipher]]s, the [[cryptographic key|key]], which is typically much shorter.

The United States [[National Security Agency]] documents sometimes use ''codebook'' to refer to [[block cipher]]s; compare their use of ''combiner-type algorithm'' to refer to [[stream cipher]]s.

A codebook is usually made in two parts, one part being for converting plaintext to ciphertext, the other for the opposite purpose. Both are usually organized similar to a standard dictionary, with plaintext words (in the first part) and ciphertext words (in the second part) presented like dictionary headwords.

The book used in a [[book cipher]] or the book used in a [[running key cipher]] is generally not a cryptographic codebook.

==Social sciences==
In social sciences, a codebook is a document containing list of codes used in research.

==Data compression==
Codebooks were also used in 19th- and 20th-century [[Commercial code (communications)|commercial codes]] for the non-cryptographic purpose of data compression.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4030">'''Arthur Cohn's irreducibility criterion''' is a sufficient condition for a [[polynomial]] to be [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in [[polynomial ring|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;]]—that is, for it to be unfactorable into the product of lower-degree polynomials with integer coefficients.

The criterion is often stated as follows:
:If a [[prime number]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is expressed in [[base (exponentiation)|base]] 10 as &lt;math&gt;p=a_m10^m+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\cdots+a_110+a_0&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;0\leq a_i\leq 9&lt;/math&gt;) then the polynomial
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=a_mx^m+a_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0&lt;/math&gt;
:is irreducible in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem can be generalized to other bases as follows:

The converse of this criterion is that, if ''p'' is an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients that have greatest common divisor 1, then there exists a base such that the coefficients of ''p'' form the representation of a prime number in that base; this is the [[Bunyakovsky conjecture]] and its truth or falsity remains an open question.

==Historical notes==
*Polya and Szegő gave their own generalization but it has many side conditions (on the locations of the roots, for instance){{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} so it lacks the elegance of Brillhart's, Filaseta's, and Odlyzko's generalization.
*It is clear from context that the "A. Cohn" mentioned by Polya and Szegő is Arthur Cohn (1894–1940), a student of [[Issai Schur]] who was awarded his doctorate from [[Frederick William University]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=17963 Arthur Cohn's entry at the Mathematics Genealogy Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegmund-Schultze|first1=Reinhard|title=Mathematicians Fleeing from Nazi Germany: Individual Fates and Global Impact|date=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=9781400831401|page=346}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7439">In [[mathematics]], '''conformal welding''' ('''sewing''' or '''gluing''') is a process in [[geometric function theory]] for producing a [[Riemann surface]] by joining together two Riemann surfaces, each with a disk removed, along their boundary circles. This problem can be reduced to that of finding univalent holomorphic maps ''f'', ''g'' of the unit disk and its complement into the extended complex plane, both admitting continuous extensions to the closure of their domains, such that the images are complementary Jordan domains and such that on the unit circle they differ by a given [[quasisymmetric map|quasisymmetric homeomorphism]]. Several proofs are known using a variety of techniques, including the [[Beltrami equation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehto|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Singular integral operators of convolution type#Hilbert transform on the circle|Hilbert transform on the circle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharon|Mumford|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elementary approximation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehto|Virtanen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Sharon|Mumford|2006}} describe the first two methods of conformal welding as well as providing numerical computations and applications to the analysis of shapes in the plane.

==Welding using the Beltrami equation==
This method was first proposed by {{harvtxt|Pfluger|1960}}.

If ''f'' is a diffeomorphism of the circle, the [[Alexander trick|Alexander extension]] gives a way of extending ''f'' to a diffeomorphism of the unit disk ''D'':

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F(r,\theta)=r \exp [i\psi(r)g(\theta) + i(1-\psi(r))\theta] ,}&lt;/math&gt;

where ψ is a smooth function with values in [0,1], equal to 0 near 0 and 1 near 1, and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f(e^{i\theta})=e^{ig(\theta)},}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''g''(θ + 2π) = ''g''(θ) + 2π.

The extension ''F'' can be continued to any larger disk |''z''| &lt; ''R'' with ''R'' &gt; 1. Accordingly in the unit disc

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|\mu\|_\infty &lt; 1, \,\,\, \mu(z)=F_{\overline{z}}/F_z.}&lt;/math&gt;

Now extend μ to a Beltrami coefficient on the whole of '''C''' by setting it equal to 0 for |''z''| ≥ 1. Let ''G'' be the corresponding solution of the Beltrami equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{G_{\overline{z}}=\mu G_z.}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = ''G'' ∘ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''z'') for |''z''| ≤ 1 and
''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = ''G'' (''z'') for |''z''| ≥ 1. Thus ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are univalent holomorphic maps of |''z''| &lt; 1 and |''z''| &gt; 1 onto the inside and outside of a Jordan curve. They extend continuously to homeomorphisms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the unit circle onto the Jordan curve on the boundary. By construction they satisfy the
'''conformal welding''' condition:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f=f_1^{-1}\circ f_2.}&lt;/math&gt;

==Welding using the Hilbert transform on the circle==
The use of the Hilbert transform to establish conformal welding was first suggested by the Georgian mathematicians D.G. Mandzhavidze and B.V. Khvedelidze in 1958. A detailed account was given at the same time by F.D. Gakhov and presented in his classic monograph ({{harvtxt|Gakhov|1990}}).

Let ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(θ) = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''in''θ&lt;/sup&gt; be the standard orthonormal basis of L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''). Let H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') be [[Hardy space]], the closed subspace spanned by the ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''n'' ≥ 0. Let ''P'' be the orthogonal projection onto Hardy space and set ''T'' = 2''P'' - ''I''. The operator ''H'' = ''iT'' is the '''Hilbert transform on the circle''' and can be written as a [[Singular integral operators of convolution type#Hilbert transform on the circle|singular integral operator]].

Given a diffeomorphism ''f'' of the unit circle, the task is to determine two univalent holomorphic functions

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_-(z)=a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + \cdots,\,\,\,\,\, f_+(z) =z + b_1z^{-1} +b_2z^{-2}+\cdots,} &lt;/math&gt;

defined in |z| &lt; 1 and |z| &gt; 1 and both extending smoothly to the unit circle, mapping onto a Jordan domain and its complement, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_-(e^{i\theta})=f_+(f(e^{i\theta})).}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''F'' be the restriction of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; to the unit circle. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{TF=-F + 2e^{i\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{TF\circ f= F\circ f.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{T(F\circ f)\circ f^{-1} - T(F)= 2F-2e^{i\theta}.}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''V''(''f'') denotes the bounded invertible operator on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; induced by the diffeomorphism ''f'', then the operator

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{K_f=V(f)PV(f)^{-1} - P}&lt;/math&gt;

is compact, indeed it is given by an operator with smooth kernel because ''P'' and ''T'' are given by singular integral operators. The equation above then reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(I-K_f)F=e^{i\theta}.}&lt;/math&gt;

The operator ''I'' − ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Fredholm operator]] of index zero. It has zero kernel and is therefore invertible. 
In fact an element in the kernel would consist of a pair of holomorphic functions on ''D'' and ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; which have smooth boundary values on the circle related by ''f''. Since the holomorphic function on ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; vanishes at ∞, the positive powers of this pair also provide solutions, which are linearly independent, contradicting the fact that ''I'' − ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is a Fredholm operator. The above equation therefore has a unique solution ''F'' which is smooth and from which ''f''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; can be reconstructed by reversing the steps above. Indeed, by looking at the equation satisfied by the logarithm of the derivative of ''F'', it follows that ''F'' has nowhere vanishing derivative on the unit circle. Moreover ''F'' is one-to-one on the circle since if it assumes the value ''a'' at different points ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; then the logarithm of ''R''(''z'') = (''F''(''z'') − ''a'')/(''z'' - ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''z'' − ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) would satisfy an integral equation known to have no non-zero solutions. Given these properties on the unit circle, the required properties of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; then follow from the [[argument principle]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

'''Demetrios Christodoulou''' ({{lang-el|Δημήτριος Χριστοδούλου}}; born  October 19, 1951&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ethz.ch/~demetri/CV.pdf|title=Demetrios Christodoulou Curriculum Vitae|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich|accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Greek [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]], who first became well known for his proof, together with [[Sergiu Klainerman]], of the nonlinear stability of the [[Minkowski spacetime]]
of [[special relativity]] in the framework of [[general relativity]].

== Early life and education ==
Christodoulou was born in [[Athens]] and received his doctorate in physics from [[Princeton University]] in 1971 under the direction of [[John Archibald Wheeler]].&lt;ref name=genealogy&gt;{{MathGenealogy|26891}}&lt;/ref&gt; After temporary positions at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], [[CERN]], and the [[Max Planck Institute]] for Physics,  he became Professor of Mathematics, first at [[Syracuse University]], then at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|Courant Institute]], and at [[Princeton University]], before taking up his last  position as Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the [[ETH Zurich]] in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; He is Emeritus Professor since January 2017.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He holds dual Greek and U.S. citizenship.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Achievements ==
In 1993, he published a book coauthored with Klainerman in which the extraordinarily difficult proof of the stability result is laid out in detail. In that year, he was named a [[MacArthur Fellow]]. In 1991, he published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Christodoulou|title=Nonlinear nature of gravitation and gravitational-wave experiments|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=67|pages=1486–1489|year=1991|bibcode=1991PhRvL..67.1486C|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.1486|issue=12|pmid=10044168}}&lt;/ref&gt; which shows that the test masses of a gravitational wave detector suffer permanent relative displacements after the passage of a gravitational wave train, an effect which has been named "nonlinear memory effect". In the period 1987–1999 he published a series of papers on the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric self-gravitating scalar field and the formation of black holes and associated spacetime singularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Christodoulou|title=A mathematical theory of gravitational collapse|journal=Commun. Math. Phys.|volume=109|pages=613–647|year=1987|bibcode=1987CMaPh.109..613C|doi=10.1007/BF01208960|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Christodoulou|title=The formation of black holes and singularities in spherically symmetric gravitational collapse|journal=Commun. Pure &amp; Appl.

Math.|volume=46|pages=1131–1220|year=1993|doi=10.1002/cpa.3160460803|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also showed that, contrary to what had been expected, singularities which are not hidden in a black hole also occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D.Christodoulou|title=Examples of naked singularity formation in the gravitational collapse of a scalar field|journal=Ann. Math.|volume=140|pages=607–653|year=1994|doi=10.2307/2118619|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he then showed that such "naked singularities" are unstable.&lt;ref name=instability&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Christodoulou|title=The instability of naked singularities in the gravitational collapse of a scalar field|journal=Ann. Math.|volume=149|pages=183–217| year=1999|doi=10.2307/121023|issue=1|arxiv=math/9901147}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2000, Christodoulou published a book on general systems of [[partial differential equations]] deriving from a [[variational principle]] (or "action principle"). In 2007, he published a book on the formation of [[shock waves]] in 3-dimensional [[fluids]]. In 2009 he published a book where a result which complements the stability result is proved. Namely, that a sufficiently strong flux of incoming gravitational waves leads to the formation of a black hole.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Awards ==
Christodoulou is a recipient of the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1999 Maxime Bôcher Memorial Prize|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199904/comm-bocher-prz.pdf|accessdate=August 8, 2005|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prestigious award of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. The Bôcher Prize citation mentions his work on the spherically symmetric scalar field as well as his work on the stability of Minkowski spacetime. In 2008 he was awarded the [[Tomalla Foundation|Tomalla prize in gravitation]].&lt;ref name=tomalla&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tomalla Foundation|work=Tomalla Foundation|url=http://www.tomalla.ch/docs/speechChris.pdf|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, he and [[Richard S. Hamilton]] won the [[Shaw Prize]] in the Mathematical Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Shaw Laureates - 2011 - Mathematical Sciences|publisher=[[Shaw Prize]]|url=http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=3&amp;twoid=90&amp;threeid=181&amp;fourid=303|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "for their highly innovative works on nonlinear partial differential equations in Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry and their applications to general relativity and topology". The citation for Christodoulou mentions his work on the formation of black holes by gravitational waves as well as his earlier work on the spherically symmetric self-gravitating scalar field and his work with Klainerman on the stability of Minkowski spacetime.

In [[computer science]], in [[control flow graph]]s, a [[basic block|node]] '''d''' ''dominates'' a node '''n''' if every path from the ''entry node'' to '''n''' must go through '''d'''. Notationally, this is written as '''d''' dom '''n''' (or sometimes '''d''' &lt;math&gt;\gg&lt;/math&gt; '''n'''). By definition, every node dominates itself.

There are a number of related concepts:

* A node d ''strictly dominates'' a node n if d dominates n and d does not equal n.
* The ''immediate dominator'' or '''idom''' of a node ''n'' is the unique node that strictly dominates ''n'' but does not strictly dominate any other node that strictly dominates ''n''. Every node, except the entry node, has an immediate dominator.&lt;ref name="fastdom"/&gt;
* The ''dominance frontier'' of a node d is the set of all nodes n such that d dominates an immediate predecessor of n, but d does not strictly dominate n. It is the set of nodes where d's dominance stops.
* A ''dominator tree'' is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] where each node's children are those nodes it immediately dominates. Because the immediate dominator is unique, it is a tree. The start node is the root of the tree.

== History ==
Dominance was first introduced by Reese T. Prosser in a 1959 paper on analysis of flow diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
|last=Prosser 
|first=Reese T. 
|title=Applications of Boolean matrices to the analysis of flow diagrams

|publisher=ACM 
|location=Boston, MA
|pages=133–138 
|year=1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosser did not present an algorithm for computing dominance, which had to wait ten years for Edward S. Lowry and C. W. Medlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Applications ==
Dominators, and dominance frontiers particularly, have applications in [[compiler]]s for computing [[static single assignment form]]. A number of compiler optimizations can also benefit from dominators. The flow graph in this case comprises [[basic block]]s.

Automatic parallelization benefits from postdominance frontiers. This is an efficient method of computing control dependence, which is critical to the analysis.

Memory usage analysis can benefit from the dominator tree to easily find leaks and identify high memory usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.mat.ui.help%2Fconcepts%2Fdominatortree.html |title=Dominator Tree |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |origyear=2008|year=2012 |website=eclipse.org  |publisher=SAP AG and IBM Corporation |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hardware systems, dominators are used for computing signal probabilities for test generation, estimating switching activities for power and noise analysis, and selecting cut points in equivalence checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|pages=406–411 
|year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In software systems, they are used for reducing the size of the test set in structural testing techniques such as statement and branch coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|first=Elena

|pages=1168–1173  
|year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algorithms ==
The dominators of a node n are given by the maximal solution to the following data-flow equations:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Dom}(n_o) = \left \{ n_o \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Dom}(n) = \left ( \bigcap_{p \in \text{preds}(n)}^{} \operatorname{Dom}(p) \right ) \bigcup^{} \left \{ n \right \} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_o&lt;/math&gt; is the start node.

The dominator of the start node is the start node itself. The set of dominators for any other node n is the intersection of the set of dominators for all predecessors p of n. The node n is also in the set of dominators for n.

An algorithm for direct solution is:

  // dominator of the start node is the start itself
  Dom(n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = {n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}
  // for all other nodes, set all nodes as the dominators
  '''for each''' n '''in''' N - {n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}
      Dom(n) = N;
  // iteratively eliminate nodes that are not dominators
  '''while''' changes in any Dom(n)
      '''for each''' n '''in''' N - {n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}:
          Dom(n) = {n} union with intersection over Dom(p) for all p in pred(n)

Direct solution is [[quadratic growth|quadratic]] in the number of nodes, or O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). [[Thomas Lengauer|Lengauer]] and [[Robert Endre Tarjan|Tarjan]] developed an algorithm which is almost linear,&lt;ref name="fastdom"&gt;{{cite journal 
|title=A fast algorithm for finding dominators in a flowgraph 
|url=http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=357071&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=79528182&amp;CFTOKEN=33765747

|first=Thomas 
|last=Lengauer 
|author2=and Tarjan |author3=Robert Endre
 |doi=10.1145/357062.357071}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in practice, except for a few artificial graphs, the algorithm and a simplified version of it are as fast or faster than any other known algorithm for graphs of all sizes and its advantage increases with graph size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=Finding Dominators in Practice

|author1=Georgiadis, Loukas |author2=Tarjan, Robert E., |author3=Werneck, Renato F. |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith D. Cooper, Timothy J. Harvey, and Ken Kennedy of [[Rice University]] describe an algorithm that essentially solves the above data flow equations but uses well engineered data structures to improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=A Simple, Fast Dominance Algorithm

== Postdominance ==
Analogous to the definition of dominance above, a node ''z'' is said to '''post-dominate''' a node ''n'' if all paths to the exit node of the graph starting at ''n'' must go through ''z''. Similarly, the '''immediate post-dominator''' of a node ''n'' is the postdominator of ''n'' that doesn't strictly postdominate any other strict postdominators of ''n''.

'''Duck typing''' in computer programming is an application of the [[duck test]]&amp;mdash;"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"&amp;mdash;to determine if an [[object (computer science)|object]] can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing, suitability is determined by an object's type. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] and properties, rather than the type of the object itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-duck-typing|title=Glossary — Python 3.7.1 documentation|website=docs.python.org|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Example==
This is a simple example in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] 3 that demonstrates how any object may be used in any context, up until it is used in a way that it does not support.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=Python&gt;
class Duck:
    def fly(self):
        print("Duck flying")

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        print("Airplane flying")

class Whale:
    def swim(self):
        print("Whale swimming")

def lift_off(entity):
    entity.fly()

duck = Duck()
airplane = Airplane()
whale = Whale()

lift_off(duck) # prints `Duck flying`
lift_off(airplane) # prints `Airplane flying`
lift_off(whale) # Throws the error `'Whale' object has no attribute 'fly'`
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==In statically typed languages==
Certain usually [[Type system#Static typing|statically typed]] languages such as [[Boo (programming language)|Boo]] and the version 4 release of [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have extra type annotations&lt;ref&gt;[http://boo.codehaus.org/Duck+Typing Boo: Duck Typing] {{webarchive |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081006075246/http://boo.codehaus.org/Duck+Typing |date=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ericwhite/archive/2008/10/29/anders-hejlsberg-introduces-c-4-0-at-pdc-2008.aspx|title=Anders Hejlsberg Introduces C# 4.0 at PDC 2008|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that instruct the compiler to arrange for type checking of classes to occur at run-time rather than compile time, and include run-time type checking code in the compiled output.

Templates in C++ allow the language to use compile-time duck typing. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/templates-and-duck-typing/184401971|title=Templates and Duck Typing|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other type systems==

===Structural type systems===
Duck typing is similar to, but distinct from [[Structural type system|structural typing]]. Structural typing is a [[Type system#Static typing|static typing]] system that determines type compatibility and equivalence by a type's structure, whereas duck typing is [[Type system#Dynamic typing|dynamic]] and determines type compatibility by only that part of a type's structure that is accessed during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].

The [[OCaml]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Elm (programming language)|Elm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.elm-lang.org/core_language.html|title=Core Language · An Introduction to Elm|first=Evan|last=Czaplicki|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Gosu (programming language)|Gosu]] and PureScript languages support structural typing to varying degrees.

===Protocols and Interfaces===
[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|Protocols and interfaces]] can provide some of the benefits of duck typing, but duck typing is distinct in that no explicit interface is defined. For example, if a third party library implements a class that cannot be modified, a client cannot use an instance of it with an interface unknown to that library even if the class does in fact satisfy the interface requirements. (A common solution to this problem is the [[Adapter pattern]].) Duck typing would allow this. Again, all of an interface must be satisfied for compatibility.

===Templates or generic types===
[[Template metaprogramming|Template]], or [[Generic programming|generic]] functions or methods apply the duck test in a [[Type system#Static typing|static typing]] context; this brings all the advantages and disadvantages of [[Type system#Static and dynamic type checking in practice|static versus dynamic type checking]] in general. Duck typing can also be more flexible in that only the methods ''actually called at run time'' need to be implemented, while templates require implementation of all methods that ''cannot be proven [[Unreachable code|unreachable]] at compile time''.

Examples include the languages [[C++]] and [[D (programming language)|D]] with templates, which developed from [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] generics.

== Duck Typing in scikit-learn project ==
A possible advantage of duck typing over inheritance is used in the API design for scikit-learn. There the interface dictates how the estimator functions are defined and for adding new functions you do not have to inherit any classes. There duck typing helps in decoupling the code from the API design hence making it easier for others to contribute to and extend the existing library. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buitinck|first=Lars|last2=Louppe|first2=Gilles|last3=Blondel|first3=Mathieu|last4=Pedregosa|first4=Fabian|last5=Mueller|first5=Andreas|last6=Grisel|first6=Olivier|last7=Niculae|first7=Vlad|last8=Prettenhofer|first8=Peter|last9=Gramfort|first9=Alexandre|date=2013-09-23|title=API design for machine learning software: experiences from the scikit-learn project|url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00856511|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Criticism of the term itself ===
Use of the term "duck typing" has been considered superfluous in light of the fact that other terms, such as [[Late binding|dynamic binding]], express the concept more clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ericlippert.com/2014/01/02/what-is-duck-typing/comment-page-1/ |title=What is "duck typing"?
 |last=Lippert |first=Eric |date=2 Jan 2014 |website=Fabulous adventures in coding |access-date=25 May 2016 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;the whole idea of duck typing is fundamentally incoherent&amp;nbsp;...'}}&lt;/ref&gt; To proponents of [[static type checking]], duck typing suggests the ''absence'' of typing, making its incorporation of the term ''typing'' appear incoherent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2706">In [[chemical graph theory]], the '''Estrada index''' is a [[topological index]] of [[protein folding]]. The index was first defined by [[Ernesto Estrada]] as a measure of the degree of folding of a protein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=E. |last1=Estrada| journal=Chem. Phys. Lett. |number=319 |page=713 |year=2000|doi=10.1016/S0009-2614(00)00158-5|title=Characterization of 3D molecular structure |bibcode=2000CPL...319..713E}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is represented as a path-graph weighted by the dihedral or [[torsional angle]]s of the protein backbone. This index of degree of folding has found multiple applications in the study of protein functions and [[protein-ligand interaction]]s.

The name of this index as the “Estrada index” was proposed by de la Peña et al. in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J. A.|last1= de la Peña|first2=I.|last2=Gutman|first3=J. |last3=Rada| title=Estimating the Estrada index|journal=Linear Algebra Appl. |volume=427|year=2007|pages=70–76|doi=10.1016/j.laa.2007.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==

Let &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; be a graph of size &lt;math&gt;|V|=n&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; be a non-increasing ordering of the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The Estrada index is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{EE}(G)=\sum_{j=1}^n e^{\lambda_j}&lt;/math&gt;
 
For a general graph, the index can be obtained as the sum of the subgraph centralities of all nodes in the graph. The subgraph centrality of node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;ref name="Estrada"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=E. |last1=Estrada |first2=J.A. |last2= Rodríguez-Velázquez |journal=Phys. Rev. E |volume= 71 |number=5 |page= 056103 |year=2005|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.71.056103|title=Subgraph centrality in complex networks|arxiv = cond-mat/0504730 |bibcode = 2005PhRvE..71e6103E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{EE}(i)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(A^k)_{ii}} {k!}&lt;/math&gt;
 
The subgraph centrality has the following closed form&lt;ref name="Estrada"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{EE}(i)=(e^A)_{ii}=\sum_{j=1}^n[\varphi(i)]^2 e^{\lambda _j}&lt;/math&gt;
 
where  &lt;math&gt;\varphi _j (i)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; th entry of the  &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda _j&lt;/math&gt;. It is straightforward to realise that&lt;ref name="Estrada"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{EE}(G)=\operatorname{tr}(e^A) &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6806">The '''Gell-Mann and Low theorem''' is a theorem in [[quantum field theory]] that allows one to relate the ground (or vacuum) state of an interacting system to the ground state of the corresponding non-interacting theory. It was proved in 1951 by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Francis E. Low]]. The theorem is useful because, among other things, by relating the ground state of the interacting theory to its non-interacting ground state, it allows one to express [[Propagator (Quantum Theory)|Green's functions]] (which are defined as expectation values of Heisenberg-picture fields in the interacting vacuum) as expectation values of [[interaction picture]] fields in the non-interacting vacuum. While typically applied to the ground state, the Gell-Mann and Low theorem applies to any eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Its proof relies on the concept of starting with a non-interacting Hamiltonian and adiabatically switching on the interactions.

== History ==

The theorem was proved first by [[Gell-Mann]] and [[Francis E. Low|Low]] in 1951, making use of the [[Dyson series]]. In 1969 [[Klaus Hepp]] provided an alternative derivation for the case where the original Hamiltonian describes free particles and the interaction is norm bounded. In 1989 Nenciu and Rasche proved it using the [[adiabatic theorem]]. A proof that does not rely on the Dyson expansion was given in 2007 by Molinari.

== Statement of the theorem ==
Let &lt;math&gt;|\Psi_0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; with energy &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; and let the 'interacting' Hamiltonian be &lt;math&gt;H=H_0 + gV&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a coupling constant and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; the interaction term. We define a Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H_\epsilon=H_0 + e^{-\epsilon |t|}gV&lt;/math&gt; which effectively interpolates between &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; in the limit &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|t|\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;U_{\epsilon I}&lt;/math&gt; denote the evolution operator in the [[interaction picture]]. The Gell-Mann and Low theorem asserts that if the limit as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\rightarrow 0^+&lt;/math&gt; of 

: &lt;math&gt; |\Psi^{(\pm)}_\epsilon \rangle = \frac{ U_{\epsilon I} (0,\pm\infty)  |\Psi_0 \rangle}{\langle \Psi_0 | U_{\epsilon I}(0,\pm\infty)|\Psi_0\rangle} &lt;/math&gt;

exists, then &lt;math&gt;|\Psi^{(\pm)}_\epsilon \rangle&lt;/math&gt; are eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that when applied to, say, the ground-state, the theorem does not guarantee that the evolved state will be a ground state. In other words, level crossing is not excluded.

== Proof ==

As in the original paper, the theorem is typically proved making use of Dyson's expansion of the evolution operator. Its validity however extends beyond the scope of perturbation theory as has been demonstrated by Molinari. We follow Molinari's method here. Focus on &lt;math&gt;H_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;g=e^{\epsilon \theta}&lt;/math&gt;. From Schrödinger's equation for the time-evolution operator 

: &lt;math&gt; i\hbar \partial_{t_1} U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2) = H_\epsilon(t_1) U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2)&lt;/math&gt;

and the boundary condition &lt;math&gt;U_\epsilon(t_2,t_2)=1&lt;/math&gt; we can formally write

: &lt;math&gt;
U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2) = 1+ \frac{1}{i\hbar} \int_{t_2}^{t_1} dt' (H_0 + e^{\epsilon(\theta -|t'|)} V) U_\epsilon(t',t_2).
&lt;/math&gt;

Focus for the moment on the case &lt;math&gt;0\geq t_1\geq t_2&lt;/math&gt;. Through a change of variables &lt;math&gt;\tau=t'+\theta&lt;/math&gt; we can write 

: &lt;math&gt;
U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2) = 1+ \frac{1}{i\hbar} \int_{\theta +t_2}^{\theta+t_1} d\tau (H_0 + e^{\epsilon \tau} V) U_\epsilon(\tau-\theta,t_2).
&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore have that

: &lt;math&gt;
\partial_\theta U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2) = \epsilon g \partial_g U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2) = \partial_{t_1} U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2) + \partial_{t_2} U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2). 
&lt;/math&gt;

This result can be combined with the Schrödinger equation and its adjoint

: &lt;math&gt; -i\hbar \partial_{t_1} U_\epsilon(t_2,t_1) =  U_\epsilon(t_2,t_1) H_\epsilon(t_1) &lt;/math&gt;

to obtain 

: &lt;math&gt;
i\hbar \epsilon g \partial_g U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2) = H_\epsilon(t_1)U_\epsilon(t_1,t_2)- U_\epsilon (t_1,t_2)H_\epsilon (t_2).
&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding equation between &lt;math&gt;H_{\epsilon I}, U_{\epsilon I}&lt;/math&gt; is the same. It can be obtained by pre-multiplying both sides with &lt;math&gt;e^{i H_0 t_1/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;, post-multiplying with &lt;math&gt;e^{i H_0 t_2/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt; and making use of 

: &lt;math&gt;
U_{\epsilon I} (t_1,t_2) = e^{i H_0 t_1/\hbar} U_{\epsilon}(t_1,t_2) e^{-i H_0 t_2 /\hbar}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The other case we are interested in, namely &lt;math&gt;t_2\geq t_1 \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; can be treated in an analogous fashion
and yields an additional minus sign in front of the commutator (we are not concerned here with the case where
&lt;math&gt;t_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; have mixed signs). In summary, we obtain

: &lt;math&gt;
\left(H_{\epsilon, t=0}-E_0 \pm i \hbar \epsilon g \partial_g\right) U_{\epsilon I}(0,\pm\infty) |\Psi_0\rangle = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

We proceed for the negative-times case. Abbreviating the various operators for clarity 

: &lt;math&gt;i \hbar \epsilon g \partial_g \left(U|\Psi_0\rangle\right) = (H_\epsilon-E_0)U|\Psi_0\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Now using the definition of &lt;math&gt;\Psi_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; we differentiate and eliminate derivatives &lt;math&gt;\partial_g(U|\Psi_0\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; using the above expression, finding

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
i \hbar \epsilon g \partial_g | \Psi_\epsilon \rangle &amp;= 
\frac{1}{\langle\Psi_0| U |\Psi_0 \rangle} (H_\epsilon-E_0) U|\Psi_0\rangle 
- \frac{U|\Psi_0\rangle }{{\langle\Psi_0 |U| \Psi_0 \rangle}^2} \langle \Psi_0 | ( H_\epsilon-E_0 ) U | \Psi_0\rangle \\

&amp;= (H_\epsilon-E_0)|\Psi_\epsilon\rangle - |\Psi_\epsilon\rangle \langle \Psi_0 |H_\epsilon-E_0|\Psi_\epsilon\rangle \\

&amp; = \left[ H_\epsilon - E \right] |\Psi_\epsilon\rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E = E_0 + \langle\Psi_0 | H_\epsilon-H_0 | \Psi_\epsilon\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. We can now let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\rightarrow 0^+&lt;/math&gt; as by assumption the &lt;math&gt;g \partial_g | \Psi_\epsilon \rangle&lt;/math&gt; in left hand side is finite. We then clearly see that &lt;math&gt;|\Psi_\epsilon\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and the proof is complete.

'''James Franklin''' (born 1953 in [[Sydney]]) is an [[Australian]] [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and [[history of ideas|historian of ideas]].

==Life and career==
Franklin was educated at [[St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill]], [[New South Wales]]. His undergraduate work was at the [[University of Sydney]] (1971&amp;ndash;74), where he attended [[St John's College, University of Sydney|St John's College]] and he was influenced by philosophers [[David Stove]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]]. He completed his PhD in 1981 at the [[University of Warwick]], on [[algebraic groups]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=59372 J.W. Franklin in Mathematics Genealogy Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981 he has taught in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the [[University of New South Wales]].

His research areas include the philosophy of mathematics and the '[[formal science]]s', the [[history of probability]], [[Australian Catholic]] history, the parallel between ethics and mathematics&lt;ref name="Mathematics and Morals"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/matheth.pdf | title=On the Parallel Between Mathematics and Morals | author=James Franklin | journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] | year=2004 | volume=79 | pages=97–119 | doi=10.1017/S0031819104000075| publisher=[[The Royal Institute of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (work for which he received the 2005 [[Eureka Prize]] for Research in Ethics), restraint, the quantification of rights in [[applied ethics]], and the analysis of [[extreme risk]]. Franklin is the literary executor of David Stove.

His 2001 book, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'', covered the development of thinking about uncertain evidence over many centuries up to 1650. Its central theme was ancient and medieval work on the law of evidence, which developed concepts like [[half-proof]], similar to modern [[proof beyond reasonable doubt]], as well as analyses of [[aleatory contracts]] like [[insurance]] and [[gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Hawkins, [http://www.unc.edu/math/Faculty/jhawkins/papers/science.pdf Casting light on the shadow of doubt], review of ''Science of Conjecture'', ''Science'' 294, 19 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

His polemical history of [[Australian philosophy]], ''Corrupting the Youth'' (2003), praised the [[Australian realism|Australian realist]] tradition in philosophy and attacked [[postmodernist]] and [[relativist]] trends.&lt;ref&gt;D. Oderberg, [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7SKlRTfkUieSXFaRGQ5MldMTlk/view Hegel hits the beach], review of ''Corrupting the Youth'', ''Times Literary Supplement'', 11 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the philosophy of mathematics, he defends an [[Aristotle's theory of universals|Aristotelian realist]] theory, according to which mathematics is about certain real features of the world, namely the quantitative and structural features (such as ratios and symmetry).&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, [http://aeon.co/magazine/science/what-is-left-for-mathematics-to-be-about/ The mathematical world], ''Aeon'' 7 Apr 2014; M. Jones, [http://philmat.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/15/philmat.nkv011.extract Review of ''An Aristotelian Realist Philosophy of Mathematics''], ''[[Philosophia Mathematica]]'' 23 (2) (2015), 281-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory stands in opposition to both [[Platonism]] and [[nominalism]], and emphasises applied mathematics and mathematical modelling as the most philosophically central parts of mathematics. He is the founder of the Sydney School in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

In 2008 he set up the Australian Database of Indigenous Violence.

He is the editor of the ''Journal of the [[Australian Catholic Historical Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australiancatholichistoricalsociety.com.au/journal/ Australian Catholic Historical Society website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joachim Schwermer.jpg|thumb|Joachim Schwermer in Oberwolfach 2010]]
Schwermer received his ''[[Abitur]]'' in 1969 at [[Aloisiuskolleg]] in [[Bad Godesberg]] and then studied mathematics at the [[University of Bonn]]. After graduating in 1974 with his ''[[Diplom]]'', he received in 1977 his [[Promotion (Germany)|''Promotion'']] (Ph.D.) underi [[Günter Harder]] with thesis ''Eisensteinreihen und die Kohomologie von Kongruenzuntergruppen von &lt;math&gt;SL_n(\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogyProject|id=23445|name=Joachim Schwermer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 he received his ''[[Habilitation]]'' from the [[University of Bonn]]. From 1986 he was a professor at the [[Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt]], then at the [[University of Düsseldorf]],&lt;ref&gt;See the author addresses in ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/y805154075182450/ On the concept of level for subgroups of SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over arithmetic rings]'' (May 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and finally in the 2000s at the [[University of Vienna]]. During the academic year 1980–1981 Schwermer was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In 1987 he was awarded the [[Gay-Lussac-Humboldt-Prize]].

Schwermer's research deals with algebraic groups in number theory, arithmetic geometry, Lie groups, and L-functions. He has written essays on the history of mathematics, for example, about [[Helmut Hasse]], [[Hermann Minkowski]], and [[Emil Artin]].

He is now a professor at the University of Vienna as well as the scientific director at the [[Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics]].

In June 2016, the [[Max Planck Institute for Mathematics]] held a Conference on the Cohomology of Arithmetic Groups on the occasion of Joachim Schwermer's 66th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conference on the Cohomology of Arithmetic Groups on the occasion of Joachim Schwermer's 66th birthday|website=Max Planck Institute for Mathemarics|year=2016|url=https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/6370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Leo "Joe" Doob''' (February 27, 1910 – June 7, 2004) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[mathematician]], specializing in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[probability]] theory.

The theory of [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]]s was developed by Doob.

==Early life and education==
Doob  was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], February 27, 1910, the son of Leo Doob and Mollie Doerfler Doob. The family moved to [[New York City]] before he was three years old. The parents felt that he was underachieving in grade school and placed him in the [[Ethical Culture School]], from which he graduated in 1926. He then went on to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he received a BA in 1930, an MA in 1931, and a PhD (''Boundary Values of Analytic Functions'', advisor [[Joseph L. Walsh]]) in 1932. After postdoctoral research at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], he joined the Department of Mathematics of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] in 1935 and served until his retirement in 1978. He was a member of the Urbana campus's Center for Advanced Study from its beginning in 1959. During the Second World War, he worked in Washington, D. C. and Guam as a civilian consultant to the Navy from 1942 to 1945; he was at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] for the academic year 1941–1942 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/jdoob01 Doob, Joseph Leo, Community of Scholars Profile, IAS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010212738/http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/jdoob01 |date=2013-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Oswald Veblen]] approached him to work on mine warfare for the Navy.

==Work==
Doob's thesis was on boundary values of analytic functions. He published two papers based on this thesis, which appeared in 1932 and 1933 in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. Doob returned to this subject many years later when he proved a probabilistic version of [[Pierre Fatou|Fatou]]'s boundary limit theorem for harmonic functions.

The [[Great Depression]] of 1929 was still going strong in the thirties and Doob could not find a job. [[B.O. Koopman]] at Columbia University suggested that statistician [[Harold Hotelling]] might have a grant that would permit Doob to work with him. Hotelling did, so the Depression led Doob to probability.

In 1933 [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]] provided the first axiomatic foundation for the theory of probability. Thus a subject that had originated from intuitive ideas suggested by real life experiences and studied informally, suddenly became mathematics. Probability theory became [[measure theory]] with its own problems and terminology.  Doob recognized that this would make it possible to give rigorous proofs for existing probability results, and he felt that the tools of measure theory would lead to new probability results.

Doob's approach to probability was evident in his first probability paper,&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Doob ''Probability and statistics''&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proved theorems related to the [[law of large numbers]], using a probabilistic interpretation of [[Birkhoff's ergodic theorem]]. Then he used these theorems to give rigorous proofs of theorems proven by [[R.A. Fisher|Fisher]] and Hotelling related to Fisher's [[maximum likelihood estimator]] for estimating a parameter of a distribution.

After writing a series of papers on the foundations of probability and stochastic processes including [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]], [[Markov process]]es, and [[stationary process]]es, Doob realized that there was a real need for a book showing what is known about the various types of [[stochastic process]]es, so he wrote the book ''Stochastic Processes''.&lt;ref&gt;Doob J.L., ''Stochastic Processes''&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 1953 and soon became one of the most influential books in the development of modern probability theory.

Beyond this book, Doob is best known for his work on [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]] and probabilistic [[potential theory]].  After he retired, Doob wrote a book of over 800 pages: ''Classical Potential Theory and Its Probabilistic Counterpart''.&lt;ref&gt;Doob J.L., ''Classical Potential Theory and Its Probabilistic Counterpart''&lt;/ref&gt; The first half of this book deals with classical potential theory and the second half with [[probability theory]], especially martingale theory. In writing this book, Doob shows that his two favorite subjects, martingales and potential theory, can be studied by the same mathematical tools.

The [[American Mathematical Society]]'s '''Joseph L. Doob Prize''', endowed in 2005 and awarded every three years for an outstanding mathematical book, is named in Doob's honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/prizes/doob-prize.html Joseph L. Doob Prize.] [[American Mathematical Society]]. Accessed September 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[discrete geometry]], a ''k''-set of a finite point set ''S'' in the [[Euclidean plane]] is a [[subset]] of ''k'' elements of ''S'' that can be strictly separated from the remaining points by a [[line (geometry)|line]]. More generally, in [[Euclidean space]] of higher dimensions, a ''k''-set of a finite point set is a subset of ''k'' elements that can be separated from the remaining points by a [[hyperplane]]. In particular, when ''k'' = ''n''/2 (where ''n'' is the size of ''S''), the line or hyperplane that separates a ''k''-set from the rest of ''S'' is a '''halving line''' or '''halving plane'''.

''K''-sets are related by [[projective duality]] to ''k''-levels in [[arrangement of lines|line arrangements]]; the ''k''-level in an arrangement of ''n'' lines in the plane is the curve consisting of the points that lie on one of the lines and have exactly ''k'' lines below them. Discrete and computational geometers have also studied levels in arrangements of more general kinds of curves and surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal et al. (1997); Chan (2003; 2005a,b).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsolved|mathematics|What is the largest possible number of halving lines for a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points in the plane?}}
It is of importance in the analysis of geometric algorithms to bound the number of ''k''-sets of a planar point set,&lt;ref&gt;Chazelle and Preparata (1986); Cole et al. (1987); Edelsbrunner and Welzl (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; or equivalently the number of ''k''-levels of a planar line arrangement, a problem first studied by [[László Lovász|Lovász]] (1971) and [[Paul Erdős|Erdős]] et al. (1973). The best known upper bound for this problem is ''O''(''nk''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;), as was shown by Tamal Dey (1998) using the [[crossing number inequality]] of Ajtai, [[Václav Chvátal|Chvátal]], Newborn, and [[Endre Szemerédi|Szemerédi]]. However, the best known lower bound is far from Dey's upper bound: it is &amp;Omega;(''n'' exp(''c'' (log''k'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;)) for some constant ''c'', as shown by Toth (2001).

In three dimensions, the best upper bound known is ''O''(''nk''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the best lower bound known is &amp;Omega;(''nk'' exp(''c'' (log''k'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;)).&lt;ref&gt;Sharir et al. (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
For points in three dimensions that are in [[convex position]], that is, are the vertices of some convex polytope, the number of k-sets is 
&amp;Theta;(''(n-k)k''), which follows from arguments used for bounding the complexity of k-th order Voronoi diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1982); Clarkson and Shor (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the case when ''k'' = ''n''/2 (halving lines), the maximum number of combinatorially distinct lines through two points of ''S'' that bisect the remaining points when ''k'' = 1, 2, ... is
:1,3,6,9,13,18,22... {{OEIS|id=A076523}}.

Bounds have also been proven on the number of ≤''k''-sets, where a ≤''k''-set is a ''j''-set for some ''j'' ≤ ''k''. In two dimensions, the maximum number of ≤''k''-sets is exactly ''nk'',&lt;ref&gt;Alon and Győri (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''d'' dimensions the bound is &lt;math&gt;O(n^{\lfloor d/2\rfloor}k^{\lceil d/2\rceil})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson and Shor (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction algorithms ==
Edelsbrunner and Welzl (1986) first studied the problem of constructing all ''k''-sets of an input point set, or dually of constructing the ''k''-level of an arrangement. The ''k''-level version of their algorithm can be viewed as a [[plane sweep]] algorithm that constructs the level in left-to-right order. Viewed in terms of ''k''-sets of point sets, their algorithm maintains a [[dynamic convex hull]] for the points on each side of a separating line, repeatedly finds a [[bitangent]] of these two hulls, and moves each of the two points of tangency to the opposite hull. Chan (1999) surveys subsequent results on this problem, and shows that it can be solved in time proportional to Dey's ''O''(''nk''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;) bound on the complexity of the ''k''-level.

Agarwal and [[Jiří Matoušek (mathematician)|Matoušek]] describe algorithms for efficiently constructing an approximate level; that is, a curve that passes between the (''k'' - ''d'')-level and the (''k'' + ''d'')-level for some small approximation parameter ''d''. They show that such an approximation can be found, consisting of a number of line segments that depends only on ''n''/''d'' and not on ''n'' or ''k''.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal (1990); Matoušek (1990,1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matroid generalizations ==
The planar ''k''-level problem can be generalized to one of parametric optimization in a [[matroid]]: one is given a matroid in which each element is weighted by a linear function of a parameter &amp;lambda;, and must find the minimum weight basis of the matroid for each possible value of &amp;lambda;. If one graphs the weight functions as lines in a plane, the ''k''-level of the arrangement of these lines graphs as a function of &amp;lambda; the weight of the largest element in an optimal basis in a [[uniform matroid]], and Dey showed that his  ''O''(''nk''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;) bound on the complexity of the ''k''-level could be generalized to count the number of distinct optimal bases of any matroid with ''n'' elements and rank ''k''.

For instance, the same ''O''(''nk''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;) upper bound holds for counting the number of different [[minimum spanning tree]]s formed in a graph with ''n'' edges and ''k'' vertices, when the edges have weights that vary linearly with a parameter &amp;lambda;. This parametric minimum spanning tree problem has been studied by various authors and can be used to solve other bicriterion spanning tree optimization problems.&lt;ref&gt;Gusfield (1980); Ishii et al. (1981); Katoh and Ibaraki (1983); Hassin and Tamir (1989); Fernández-Baca et al. (1996); Chan (2005c).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the best known lower bound for the parametric minimum spanning tree problem is &amp;Omega;(''n'' &amp;alpha;(''k'')), where &amp;alpha; is the [[inverse Ackermann function]], an even weaker bound than that for the ''k''-set problem. For more general matroids, Dey's ''O''(''nk''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;) upper bound has a matching lower bound.&lt;ref&gt;Eppstein (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2627">In [[measure theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''Kakutani's theorem''' is a fundamental result on the [[equivalence (measure theory)|equivalence]] or [[singular measure|mutual singularity]] of countable [[product measure]]s.  It gives an &amp;ldquo;[[if and only if]]&amp;rdquo; characterisation of when two such measures are equivalent, and hence it is extremely useful when trying to establish change-of-measure formulae for measures on [[function space]]s.  The result is due to the [[Japan|Japanese]] [[mathematician]] [[Shizuo Kakutani]].  Kakutani's theorem can be used, for example, to determine whether a translate of a [[Gaussian measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; (only when the translation vector lies in the [[Cameron–Martin theorem|Cameron–Martin space]] of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;), or whether a dilation of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; (only when the absolute value of the dilation factor is 1, which is part of the [[Feldman–Hájek theorem]]).

==Statement of the theorem==

For each &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mu_{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_{n}&lt;/math&gt; be measures on the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\mu = \bigotimes_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mu_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu = \bigotimes_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \nu_n&lt;/math&gt; be the corresponding product measures on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Suppose also that, for each &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_n&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent (i.e. have the same null sets).  Then either &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent, or else they are mutually singular.  Furthermore, equivalence holds precisely when the infinite product

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \sqrt{ \frac{\mathrm{d} \mu_n} {\mathrm{d} \nu_n} } \, \mathrm{d} \nu_n&lt;/math&gt;

converges;  or, equivalently, when the infinite series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \log \int_{\mathbb{R}} \sqrt{ \frac{\mathrm{d} \mu_n}{\mathrm{d} \nu_n} } \, \mathrm{d} \nu_n&lt;/math&gt;

converges.

'''Logicism''' is a programme in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], comprising one or more of the theses that — for some coherent meaning of '[[logic]]' — [[mathematics]] is an extension of logic, some or all of mathematics is [[reduction (philosophy)|reducible]] to logic, or some or all of mathematics may be [[model theory|modelled]] in logic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/logicism.php Logicism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220075703/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/logicism.php |date=2008-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] championed this programme, initiated by [[Gottlob Frege]] and subsequently developed by [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Giuseppe Peano]] and Russell.

== Overview ==
Dedekind's path to logicism had a turning point when he was able to construct a model satisfying the axioms defining the [[real number]]s using certain sets of rational numbers. This and related ideas convinced him that arithmetic, algebra and analysis were reducible to the natural numbers plus a "logic" of sets. Furthermore by 1872 he had concluded that the naturals themselves were reducible to sets and mappings. It is likely that other logicists, most importantly Frege, were also guided by the new theories of the real numbers published in the year 1872. 

The philosophical impetus behind Frege's logicist programme from the Grundlagen der Arithmetik onwards was in part his dissatisfaction with the epistemological and ontological commitments of then-extant accounts of the natural numbers, and his conviction that Kant's use of truths about the natural numbers as examples of synthetic a priori truth was incorrect.

This started a period of expansion for logicism, with Dedekind and Frege as its main exponents. However, this initial phase of the logicist programme was brought into crisis with the discovery of the classical paradoxes of set theory (Cantor 1896, Zermelo and Russell 1900–1901). Frege gave up on the project after Russell recognized and communicated [[Russell's paradox|his paradox]] identifying an inconsistency in Frege's system set out in the Grundgesetze der Arithmetik. Note that [[naive set theory]] also suffers from this difficulty. 

On the other hand, Russell wrote ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' in 1903 using the paradox and developments of [[Giuseppe Peano]]'s school of geometry. Since he treated the subject of [[primitive notion]]s in geometry and [[set theory]], this text is a watershed in the development of logicism. Evidence of the assertion of logicism was collected by Russell and Whitehead in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=principia-mathematica |title=Principia Mathematica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the bulk of extant mathematics is believed to be derivable logically from a small number of extralogical axioms, such as the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (or its extension [[ZFC]]), from which no inconsistencies have as yet been derived. Thus, elements of the logicist programmes have proved viable, but in the process theories of classes, sets and mappings, and higher-order logics other than with Henkin semantics, have come to be regarded as extralogical in nature, in part under the influence of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s later thought.

[[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorems]] show that no formal system from which the Peano axioms for the natural numbers may be derived — such as Russell's systems in PM — can decide all the well-formed sentences of that system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philpapers.org/rec/RAAOTP "On the philosophical relevance of Gödel's incompleteness theorems"]&lt;/ref&gt;.  This result damaged Hilbert's programme for foundations of mathematics whereby 'infinitary' theories — such as that of PM — were to be proved consistent from finitary theories, with the aim that those uneasy about 'infinitary methods' could be reassurred that their use should provably not result in the derivation of a contradiction.   Gödel's result suggests that in order to maintain a logicist position, while still retaining as much as possible of classical mathematics, one must accept some axiom of infinity as part of logic. On the face of it, this damages the logicist programme also, albeit only for those already doubtful concerning 'infinitary methods'. Nonetheless, positions deriving from both logicism and from Hilbertian finitism have continued to be propounded since the publication of Gödel's result.

Some believe programmes derived from logicism remain valid because the incompleteness theorems are proved with logic just like any other theorems.  However, that conclusion fails to acknowledge any distinction between theorems of [[first-order logic]] and those of [[higher-order logic]]. The former can be proven using the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] (see [[Gödel numbering]]), while the latter must rely on human-provided models.  [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]] shows that Gödel numbering can be used to prove syntactical constructs, but not semantic assertions.  Therefore, the claim that logicism remains a valid programme may commit one to holding that a system of proof based on the existence and properties of the natural numbers is less convincing than one based on some particular formal system.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Logicism — especially through the influence of Frege on Russell and Wittgenstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Reck|first=Erich|year=1997|title=''Frege's Influence on Wittgenstein: Reversing Metaphysics via the Context Principle''|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a5e1/f41223452caf0775fe03ed08417e3530a9b8.pdf}}&lt;/ref &gt;and later Dummett — was a significant contributor to the development of [[analytic philosophy]] during the twentieth century.

== Origin of the name 'logicism' ==
[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] states that the French word 'Logistique' was "introduced by [[Louis Couturat|Couturat]] and others at the 1904 [[World Congress of Philosophy|International Congress of Philosophy]]', and was used by Russell and others from then on, in versions appropriate for various languages." (G-G 2000:501).

Apparently the first (and only) usage by Russell appeared in his 1919: "Russell referred several time [sic] to Frege, introducing him as one 'who first succeeded in "logicising" mathematics' (p.&amp;nbsp;7). Apart from the mis-representation (which Russell partly rectified by explaining his own view of the role of arithmetic in mathematics), the passage is notable for the word which he put in quotation marks, but their presence suggests nervousness, and he never used the word again, so that 'logicism' did not emerge until the later 1920s" (G-G 2002:434).&lt;ref&gt;The exact quote from Russell 1919 is the following: "It is time now to turn to the considerations which make it necessary to advance beyond the standpoint of Peano, who represents the last perfection of the "arithmetisation" of mathematics, to that of Frege, who first succeeded in "logicising" mathematics, i.e. in reducing to logic the arithmetical notions which his predecessors had shown to be sufficient for mathematics." (Russell 1919/2005:17).&lt;/ref&gt;

About the same time as Carnap (1929), but apparently independently, Fraenkel (1928) used the word: "Without comment he used the name 'logicism' to characterise the Whitehead/Russell position (in the title of the section on p. 244, explanation on p. 263)" (G-G 2002:269). Carnap used a slightly different word 'Logistik'; Behmann complained about its use in Carnap's manuscript so Carnap proposed the word 'Logizismus', but he finally stuck to his word-choice 'Logistik' (G-G 2002:501). Ultimately "the spread was mainly due to Carnap, from 1930 onwards." (G-G 2000:502).

==Intent, or goal, of logicism==
'''Symbolic logic''': The overt intent of Logicism is to derive all of mathematics from symbolic logic (Frege, Dedekind, Peano, Russell.) As contrasted with [[algebraic logic]] ([[Boolean logic]]) that employs arithmetic concepts, [[symbolic logic]] begins with a very reduced set of marks (non-arithmetic symbols), a few "logical" axioms that embody the "laws of thought", and rules of inference that dictate how the marks are to be assembled and manipulated — for instance substitution and ''[[modus ponens]]'' (ie from [1] A materially implies B and [2] A, one may derive B). Logicism also adopts from Frege's groundwork the reduction of natural language statements from "subject|predicate" into either propositional "atoms" or the "argument|function" of "generalization"—the notions "all", "some", "class" (collection, aggregate) and "relation".

In a logicist derivation of the natural numbers and their properties, no "intuition" of number should "sneak in" either as an axiom or by accident. The goal is to derive all of mathematics, starting with the counting numbers and then the real numbers, from some chosen "laws of thought" alone, without any tacit (hidden) assumptions of "before" and "after" or "less" and "more" or to the point: "successor" and "predecessor". Gödel 1944 summarized Russell's logicistic "constructions", when compared to "constructions" in the foundational systems of Intuitionism and Formalism ("the Hilbert School") as follows: "Both of these schools base their constructions on a mathematical intuition whose avoidance is exactly one of the principal aims of Russell's [[Constructivism (philosophy of mathematics)|constructivism]]" (Gödel 1944 in ''Collected Works'' 1990:119).

'''History''': Gödel 1944 summarized the historical background from Leibniz's in ''Characteristica universalis'', through Frege and Peano to Russell: "Frege was chiefly interested in the analysis of thought and used his calculus in the first place for deriving arithmetic from pure logic", whereas Peano "was more interested in its applications within mathematics". But "It was only [Russell's] ''Principia Mathematica'' that full use was made of the new method for actually deriving large parts of mathematics from a very few logical concepts and axioms. In addition, the young science was enriched by a new instrument, the abstract theory of relations" (p.&amp;nbsp;120-121).

Kleene 1952 states it this way: "Leibniz (1666) first conceived of logic as a science containing the ideas and principles underlying all other sciences. Dedekind (1888) and Frege (1884, 1893, 1903) were engaged in defining mathematical notions in terms of logical ones, and Peano (1889, 1894–1908) in expressing mathematical theorems in a logical symbolism" (p.&amp;nbsp;43); in the previous paragraph he includes Russell and Whitehead as exemplars of the "logicistic school", the other two "foundational" schools being the intuitionistic and the "formalistic or axiomatic school" (p.&amp;nbsp;43).

'''Frege 1879''' describes his intent in the Preface to his 1879 ''Begriffsschrift'': He started with a consideration of arithmetic: did it derive from "logic" or from "facts of experience"?
:"I first had to ascertain how far one could proceed in arithmetic by means of inferences alone, with the sole support of those laws of thought that transcend all particulars. My initial step was to attempt to reduce the concept of ordering in a sequence to that of ''logical'' consequence, so as to proceed from there to the concept of number. To prevent anything intuitive from penetrating here unnoticed I had to bend every effort to keep the chain of inferences free of gaps . . . I found the inadequacy of language to be an obstacle; no matter how unwieldy the expressions I was ready to accept, I was less and less able, as the relations became more and more complex, to attain the precision that my purpose required. This deficiency led me to the idea of the present ideography. Its first purpose, therefore, is to provide us with the most reliable test of the validity of a chain of inferences and to point out every presupposition that tries to sneak in unnoticed" (Frege 1879 in van Heijenoort 1967:5).

'''Dedekind 1887''' describes his intent in the 1887 Preface to the First Edition of his ''The Nature and Meaning of Numbers''. He believed that in the "foundations of the simplest science; viz., that part of logic which deals with the theory of numbers" had not been properly argued -- "nothing capable of proof ought to be accepted without proof":
:In speaking of arithmetic (algebra, analysis) as a part of logic I mean to imply that I consider the number-concept entirely independent of the notions of intuitions of space and time, that I consider it an immediate result from the laws of thought . . . numbers are free creations of the human mind . . . [and] only through the purely logical process of building up the science of numbers . . . are we prepared accurately to investigate our notions of space and time by bringing them into relation with this number-domain created in our mind" (Dedekind 1887 Dover republication 1963 :31).

'''Peano 1889''' states his intent in his Preface to his 1889 ''Principles of Arithmetic'':
:Questions that pertain to the foundations of mathematics, although treated by many in recent times, still lack a satisfactory solution. The difficulty has its main source in the ambiguity of language. ¶ That is why it is of the utmost importance to examine attentively the very words we use. My goal has been to undertake this examination" (Peano 1889 in van Heijenoort 1967:85).

'''Russell 1903''' describes his intent in the Preface to his 1903 ''Principles of Mathematics'':
:"THE present work has two main objects. One of these, the ''proof'' that all pure mathematics deals exclusively with concepts definable in terms of a very small number of fundamental logical concepts, and that all its propositions are deducible from a very small number of fundamental logical principles" (Preface 1903:vi).

:"A few words as to the origin of the present work may serve to show the importance of the questions discussed. About six years ago, I began an investigation into the philosophy of Dynamics. . . . [From two questions -- acceleration and absolute motion in a "relational theory of space"] I was led to a re-examination of the principles of Geometry, thence to the philosophy of continuity and infinity, and then, with a view to discovering the meaning of the word ''any'', to Symbolic Logic" (Preface 1903:vi-vii).

==Epistemology behind logicism==
'''Dedekind and Frege''': The epistemology of Dedekind and Frege is not as well-defined as that of the philosopher Russell, but both seem accepting as ''a priori'' the customary "laws of thought" concerning simple propositional statements (usually of belief); these laws would be sufficient in themselves if augmented with theory of classes and relations (e.g. ''x'' R ''y'') between individuals ''x'' and ''y'' linked by the generalization R.

'''Dedekind's "free formations of the human mind" rebels against the strictures of Kronecker''': Dedekind's argument begins with "1. In what follows I understand by ''thing'' every object of our thought"; we humans use symbols to discuss these "things" of our minds; "A thing is completely determined by all that can be affirmed or thought concerning it" (p.&amp;nbsp;44). In a subsequent paragraph Dedekind discusses what a "system ''S'' is: it is an aggregate, a manifold, a totality of associated elements (things) ''a'', ''b'', ''c''"; he asserts that "such a system ''S'' . . . ''as an object of our thought is likewise a thing'' (1); it is completely determined when with respect to every thing it is determined whether it is an element of ''S'' or not.*" (p.&amp;nbsp;45, italics added). The * indicates a footnote where he states that:
:"Kronecker not long ago (''Crelle's Journal'', Vol. 99, pp. 334-336) has endeavored to impose certain limitations upon the free formation of concepts in mathematics which I do not believe to be justified" (p. 45).
Indeed he awaits Kronecker's "publishing his reasons for the necessity or merely the expediency of these limitations" (p.&amp;nbsp;45).

[[Leopold Kronecker]], famous for his assertion that "God made the integers, all else is the work of man"&lt;ref&gt;For example, von Neumann 1925 would cite Kronecker as follows: "The denumerable infinite  . . . is nothing more the general notion of the positive integer, on which mathematics rests and of which even Kronecker and Brouwer admit that it was "created by God"" (von Neumann 1925 ''An axiomatization of set theory'' in van Heijenoort 1967:413).&lt;/ref&gt; had his foes, among them Hilbert. Hilbert called Kronecker a "''dogmatist'', to the extent that he accepts the integer with its essential properties as a dogma and does not look back"&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1904 ''On the foundations of logic and arithmetic'' in van Heijenoort 1967:130.&lt;/ref&gt; and equated his extreme constructivist stance with that of Brouwer's [[intuitionism]], accusing both of "subjectivism": "It is part of the task of science to liberate us from arbitrariness, sentiment and habit and to protect us from the subjectivism that already made itself felt in Kronecker's views and, it seems to me, finds its culmination in intuitionism".&lt;ref&gt;Pages 474–5 in Hilbert 1927, ''The Foundations of Mathematics'' in: van Heijenoort 1967:475.&lt;/ref&gt; Hilbert then states that "mathematics is a presuppositionless science. To found it I do not need God, as does Kronecker . . ." (p.&amp;nbsp;479).

'''Russell as realist''': Russell's [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] served him as an antidote to British [[Idealism]],&lt;ref&gt;Perry in his 1997 Introduction to Russell 1912:ix)&lt;/ref&gt; with portions borrowed from European [[Rationalism]] and British [[empiricism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Russell 1912:74.&lt;/ref&gt; To begin with, "Russell was a realist about two key issues: universals and material objects" (Russell 1912:xi). For Russell, tables are real things that exist independent of Russell the observer. Rationalism would contribute the notion of ''a priori'' knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;"It must be admitted . . . that logical principles are known to us, and cannot be themselves proved by experience, since all proof presupposes them. In this, therefore . . . the rationalists were in the right" (Russell 1912:74).&lt;/ref&gt; while empiricism would contribute the role of experiential knowledge (induction from experience).&lt;ref&gt;"Nothing can be known to ''exist'' except by the help of experience" (Russell 1912:74).&lt;/ref&gt; Russell would credit Kant with the idea of "a priori" knowledge, but he offers an objection to Kant he deems "fatal": "The facts [of the world] must always conform to logic and arithmetic. To say that logic and arithmetic are contributed by us does not account for  this" (1912:87); Russell concludes that the ''a priori'' knowledge that we possess is "about things, and not merely about thoughts" (1912:89). And in this Russell's epistemology seems different from that of Dedekind's belief that "numbers are free creations of the human mind" (Dedekind 1887:31)&lt;ref&gt;He drives the point home (pages 67-68) where he defines four conditions that determine what we call "the numbers" (cf. (71)). Definition, page 67: the successor set N' is a part of the collection N, there is a starting-point "1&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;" [base number of the number-series ''N''], this "1" is not contained in any successor, for any ''n'' in the collection there exists a transformation φ(''n'') to a ''unique'' (distinguishable) ''n'' (cf. (26). Definition)). He observes that by establishing these conditions "we entirely neglect the special character of the elements; simply retaining their distinguishability and taking into account only the relation to one another . . . by the order-setting transformation φ. . . . With reference to this freeing the elements from every other content (abstraction) we are justified in calling numbers a free creation of the human mind." (p. 68)&lt;/ref&gt;

But his epistemology about the innate (he prefers the word ''a priori'' when applied to logical principles, cf. 1912:74) is intricate. He would strongly, unambiguously express support for the [[Platonism|Platonic]] "universals" (cf. 1912:91-118) and he would conclude that truth and falsity are "out there"; minds create ''beliefs'' and what makes a belief true is a fact, "and this fact does not (except in exceptional cases) involve the mind of the person who has the belief" (1912:130).

Where did Russell derive these epistemic notions? He tells us in the Preface to his 1903 ''Principles of Mathematics''. Note that he asserts that the belief: "Emily is a rabbit" is non-existent, and yet the truth of this non-existent proposition is independent of any knowing mind; if Emily really is a rabbit, the fact of this truth exists whether or not Russell or any other mind is alive or dead, and the relation of Emily to rabbit-hood is "ultimate" :
:"On fundamental questions of philosophy, my position, in all its chief features, is derived from Mr G. E. Moore. I have accepted from him the non-existential nature of propositions (except such as happen to assert existence) and their independence of any knowing mind; also the pluralism which regards the world, both that of existents and that of entities, as composed of an infinite number of mutually independent entities, with relations which are ultimate, and not reducible to adjectives of their terms or of the whole which these compose. . . . The doctrines just mentioned are, in my opinion, quite indispensable to any even tolerably satisfactory philosophy of mathematics, as I hope the following pages will show. . . . Formally, my premisses are simply assumed; but the fact that they allow mathematics to be true, which most current philosophies do not, is surely a powerful argument in their favour." (Preface 1903:viii)

'''Russell's paradox''': In 1902 Russell discovered a "vicious circle" ([[Russell's paradox]]) in Frege's ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'', derived from Frege's Basic Law V and he was determined not to repeat it in his 1903 ''Principles of Mathematics''. In two Appendices added at the last minute he devoted 28 pages to both a detailed analysis of Frege's theory contrasted against his own, and a fix for the paradox. But he was not optimistic about the outcome:

:"In the case of classes, I must confess, I have failed to perceive any concept fulfilling the conditions requisite for the notion of class. And the contradiction discussed in Chapter x. proves that something is amiss, but what this is I have hitherto failed to discover. (Preface to Russell 1903:vi)"

'''"Fictionalism" and Russell's no-class theory''': Gödel in his 1944 would disagree with the young Russell of 1903 ("[my premisses] allow mathematics to be true") but would probably agree with Russell's statement quoted above ("something is amiss"); Russell's theory had failed to arrive at a satisfactory foundation of mathematics: the result was "essentially negative; i.e. the classes and concepts introduced this way do not have all the properties required for the use of mathematics" (Gödel 1944:132).

How did Russell arrive in this situation? Gödel observes that Russell is a surprising "realist" with a twist: he cites Russell's 1919:169 "Logic is concerned with the real world just as truly as zoology" (Gödel 1944:120). But he observes that "when he started on a concrete problem, the objects to be analyzed (e.g. the classes or propositions) soon for the most part turned into "logical fictions" . . . [meaning] only that we have no direct perception of them." (Gödel 1944:120)

In an observation pertinent to Russell's brand of logicism, Perry remarks that Russell went through three phases of realism -- extreme, moderate and constructive (Perry 1997:xxv). In 1903 he was in his extreme phase; by 1905 he would be in his moderate phase. In a few years he would "dispense with physical or material objects as basic bits of the furniture of the world. He would attempt to construct them out of sense-data" in his next book ''Our knowledge of the External World'' [1914]" (Perry 1997:xxvi).

These constructions in what Gödel 1944 would call "[[nominalistic]] constructivism . . . which might better be called [[fictionalism]]" derived from Russell's "more radical idea, the no-class theory" (p.&amp;nbsp;125):
:"according to which classes or concepts ''never'' exist as real objects, and sentences containing these terms are meaningful only as they can be interpreted as  . . . a manner of speaking about other things" (p. 125).

==An example of a logicist construction of the natural numbers: Russell's construction in the ''Principia''==

The logicism of Frege and Dedekind is similar to that of Russell, but with differences in the particulars (see Criticisms, below). Overall, the logicist derivations of the natural numbers are different from derivations from - for example - Zermelo's axioms for set theory ('Z'). Whereas, in derivations from Z, one definition of "number" uses an axiom of that system — the [[axiom of pairing]] - that leads to the definition of "ordered pair" - no ''overt'' number axiom exists in the various logicist axiom systems allowing the derivation of the natural numbers.  Note that the axioms needed to derive the definition of a number may differ between axiom systems for set theory in any case.  For instance, in ZF and ZFC, the axiom of pairing, and hence ultimately the notion of an ordered pair is derivable from the Axiom of Infinity and the Axiom of Replacement and is required in the definition of the Von Neumann numerals (but not the Zermelo numerals), whereas in NFU the Frege numerals may be derived in an analogous way to their derivation in the Grundgesetze.

Rather, logicism begins its ''construction'' of the numbers from "primitive propositions" that include "class", "propositional function", and ''in particular'', "relations" of "similarity" ("equinumerosity": placing the elements of collections in one-to-one correspondence) and "ordering" (using "the successor of" relation to order the collections of the equinumerous classes)".&lt;ref&gt;In his 1903 and in ''PM'' Russell refers to such assumptions (there are others) as "primitive propositions" ("pp" as opposed to "axioms" (there are some of those, too). But the reader is never certain whether these pp are axioms/axiom-schemas or construction-devices (like substitution or ''modus ponens''), or what, exactly. Gödel 1944:120 comments on this absence of formal syntax and the absence of a clearly specified substitution process.&lt;/ref&gt; The logicistic derivation equates the [[cardinal numbers]] ''constructed'' this way to the natural numbers, and these numbers end up all of the same "type"—as equivalence classes of classes—whereas in set theory each number is of a higher class than its predecessor (thus each successor contains its predecessor as a subset). Kleene observes the following. (Kleene's assumptions (1) and (2) state that 0 has property ''P'' and ''n''+1 has property ''P'' whenever ''n'' has property ''P''.)
:"The viewpoint here is very different from that of [Kronecker]'s maxim that 'God made the integers' plus [[Peano's axioms]] of number and mathematical induction], where we presupposed an intuitive conception of the natural number sequence, and elicited from it the principle that, whenever a particular property ''P'' of natural numbers is given such that (1) and (2), then any given natural number must have the property ''P''." (Kleene 1952:44).

The importance to the logicist programme of the construction of the natural numbers derives from Russell's contention that "That all traditional pure mathematics can be derived from the natural numbers is a fairly recent discovery, though it had long been suspected" (1919:4). One derivation of the ''real'' numbers derives from the theory of [[Dedekind cut]]s on the rational numbers, rational numbers in turn being derived from the naturals. While an example of how this is done is useful, it relies first on the derivation of the natural numbers. So, if philosophical difficulties appear in a logicist derivation of the natural numbers, these problems should be sufficient to stop the program until these are resolved (see Criticisms, below).

One attempt to construct the natural numbers is summarized by Bernays 1930–1931.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''The Philosophy of Mathematics and Hilbert's Proof Theory'' 1930:1931 in Mancosu, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  But rather than use Bernays' précis, which is incomplete in some details, the construction is best given as a simple finite example together with the details to be found in Russell 1919.

An attempt at this is set out below:

===Preliminaries===
For Dedekind, Frege and Russell, collections (classes) are aggregates of "things" specified by proper names, that come about as the result of propositions (utterances about one or more things that assert a fact about that thing or things). Russell analysed this general notion. He begins with "terms" in sentences - which he analyses as follows:

'''Terms''': For Russell, "terms" are either "things" or "concepts": "Whatever may be an object of thought, or may occur in any true or false proposition, or can be counted as one, I call a ''term''. This, then, is the widest word in the philosophical vocabulary. I shall use as synonymous with it the words, unit, individual, and entity. The first two emphasize the fact that every term is one, while the third is derived from the fact that every term has being, i.e. is in some sense. A man, a moment, a number, a class, a relation, a chimaera, or anything else that can be mentioned, is sure to be a term; and to deny that such and such a thing is a term must always be false" (Russell 1903:43)

'''Things are indicated by proper names; concepts are indicated by adjectives or verbs''': "Among terms, it is possible to distinguish two kinds, which I shall call respectively ''things'' and ''concepts''; the former are the terms indicated by proper names, the latter those indicated by all other words . . . Among concepts, again, two kinds at least must be distinguished, namely those indicated by adjectives and those indicated by verbs" (1903:44).

'''Concept-adjectives are "predicates"; concept-verbs are "relations"''': "The former kind will often be called predicates or class-concepts; the latter are always or almost always relations." (1903:44)

'''The notion of a "variable" subject appearing in a proposition''': "I shall speak of the ''terms'' of a proposition as those terms, however numerous, which occur in a proposition and may be regarded as subjects about which the proposition is. It is a characteristic of the terms of a proposition that anyone of them may be replaced by any other entity without our ceasing to have a proposition. Thus we shall say that "Socrates is human" is a proposition having only one term; of the remaining component of the proposition, one is the verb, the other is a predicate.. . . Predicates, then, are concepts, other than verbs, which occur in propositions having only one term or subject." (1903:45)

In other words, a "term" can be  place-holder that indicates (denotes) one or more things that can be put into the placeholder. (1903:45).

'''Truth and falsehood''': Suppose Russell were to point to an object and utter: "This object in front of me named "Emily" is a woman." This is a proposition, an assertion of Russell's belief to be tested against the "facts" of the outer world: "Minds do not ''create'' truth or falsehood. They create beliefs . . . what makes a belief true is a ''fact'', and this fact does not (except in exceptional cases) in any way involve the mind of the person who has the belief" (1912:130). If by investigation of the utterance and correspondence with "fact", Russell discovers that Emily is a rabbit, then his utterance is considered "false"; if Emily is a female human (a female "featherless biped" as Russell likes to call humans, following [[Diogenes Laertius]]'s anecdote about Plato), then his utterance is considered "true".

If Russell were to utter a ''generalization'' about all Emilys then these object/s (entity/ies) must be examined, one after another in order to verify the truth of the generalization. Thus if Russell were to assert  "All Emilys are women", then the "All" is a tipoff that the utterance is about all entities "Emily" in correspondence with a concept labeled "woman" and a methodical examination of all creatures with human names would have to commence. {{or|date=August 2018}}

'''Classes (aggregates, complexes)''': "The class, as opposed to the class-concept, is the sum or conjunction of all the terms which have the given predicate" (1903 p.&amp;nbsp;55). Classes can be specified by extension (listing their members) or by intension, i.e. by a "propositional function" such as "x is a u" or "x is v". But "if we take extension pure, our class is defined by enumeration of its terms, and this method will not allow us to deal, as Symbolic Logic does, with infinite classes. Thus our classes must in general be regarded as objects denoted by concepts, and to this extent the point of view of intension is essential." (1909 p.&amp;nbsp;66)

'''Propositional functions''': "The characteristic of a class concept, as distinguished from terms in general, is that "x is a u" is a propositional function when, and only when, u is a class-concept." (1903:56)

'''Extensional versus intensional definition of a class''': "71. Class may be defined either extensionally or intensionally. That is to say, we may define the kind of object which is a class, or the kind of concept which denotes a class: this is the precise meaning of the opposition of extension and intension in this connection. But although the general notion can be defined in this two-fold manner, particular classes, except when they happen to be finite, can only be defined intensionally, i.e. as the objects denoted by such and such concepts. . . logically; the extensional definition appears to be equally applicable to infinite classes, but practically, if we were to attempt it, Death would cut short our laudable endeavour before it had attained its goal.(1903:69)

===The definition of the natural numbers===
The natural numbers derive from ''ALL'' propositions (i.e. completely unrestricted) in this and all other possible worlds, that can be uttered about ''ANY'' collection of entities whatsoever. Russell makes this clear in the second (italicized) sentence below.

:"In the first place, numbers themselves form an infinite collection, and cannot therefore be defined by enumeration. ''In the second place, the collections having a given number of terms themselves presumably form an infinite collection: it is to be presumed, for example, that there are an infinite collection of trios in the world'', for if this were not the case the total number of things in the world would be finite, which, though possible, seems unlikely. In the third place, we wish to define "number" in such a way that infinite numbers may be possible; thus we must be able to speak of the number of terms in an infinite collection, and such a collection must be defined by intension, i.e. by a property common to all its members and peculiar to them." (1919:13)

To begin, devise a finite example. Suppose there are 12 families on a street. Some have children, some do not. To discuss the names of the children in these households requires 12 propositions asserting " ''childname'' is the name of a child in family Fn" applied this collection of households on the particular street of families with names F1, F2, . . . F12. Each of the 12 propositions regards whether or not the "argument" ''childname'' applies to a child in a particular household. The children's names (''childname'') can be thought of as the x in a propositional function f(x), where the function is "name of a child in the family with name Fn".&lt;ref&gt;To be precise both ''childname'' = variable ''x'' and family name ''Fn'' are variables. ''Childname'' 's domain is "all childnames in this and every other possible world", and family name ''Fn'' has a domain over the 12 families on the street.&lt;/ref&gt; {{or|date=August 2018}}

Notice that, in the Russellian view these collections are not sets, but rather "aggregates" or "collections" or "classes"—listings of names that satisfy the predicates F1, F2,  . . .. As noted in Step 1, for Russell, these "classes" are "symbolic fictions" that exist only as their aggregate members, i.e. as the ''extensions of their propositional functions'', and not as unit-things in themselves. 

'''Step 1: Assemble ''ALL'' the classes''': Whereas the following example is finite over the very-finite propositional function " ''childnames'' of the children in family Fn'" on the very-finite street of a finite number of (12) families, Russell intended the following to extend to ''ALL'' propositional functions extending over an infinity of this and all other possible worlds; this would allow him to create ''ALL'' the numbers (to infinity). 

Kleene observes that Russell has set out an [[impredicativity|impredicative]] definition that he will have to resolve, or otherwise risk deriving the [[Russell paradox]]. "Here instead we presuppose the totality of all properties of cardinal numbers, as existing in logic, prior to the definition of the natural number sequence" (Kleene 1952:44). The problem will appear, even in the finite example presented here, when Russell confronts the unit class (cf. Russell 1903:517).

The matter of debate comes down to this: what exactly ''is'' a "class"? For Dedekind and Frege, a class is a distinct entity all of its own, a "unity" that can be identified with all those entities ''x'' that satisfy the propositional function F( ). (This symbolism appears in Russell, attributing it to Frege: "The essence of a function is what is left when the ''x'' is taken away, i.e in the above instance, 2( )&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ( ). The argument ''x'' does not belong to the function, but the two together make a whole (ib. p. 6 [i.e. Frege's 1891 ''Function und Begriff'']" (Russell 1903:505).) For example, a particular "unity" could be given a name; suppose a family Fα has the children with the names Annie, Barbie and Charles:
:[ a, b, c ]&lt;sub&gt;Fα&lt;/sub&gt;

This notion of collection-or or class-as-object, when used without restriction, results in [[Russell's paradox]]; see more below about [[impredicativity|impredicative definitions]]. Russell's solution was to define the notion of a class to be only those elements that satisfy the proposition, his argument being that, indeed, the arguments ''x'' do not belong to the propositional function aka "class" created by the function. The class itself is not to be regarded as a unitary object in its own right, it exists only as a kind of useful fiction: "We have avoided the decision as to whether a class of things has in any sense an existence as one object. A decision of this question in either way is indifferent to our logic" (First edition of ''Principia Mathematica'' 1927:24).

Russell continues to hold this opinion in his 1919; observe the words "symbolic fictions": {{or|date=August 2018}}
:"When we have decided that classes cannot be things of the same sort as their members, that they cannot be just heaps or aggregates, and also that they cannot be identified with propositional functions, it becomes very difficult to see what they can be, if they are to be more than ''symbolic fictions''. And if we can find any way of dealing with them as ''symbolic fictions'', we increase the logical security of our position, since we avoid the need of assuming that there are classes without being compelled to make the opposite assumption that there are no classes. We merely abstain from both assumptions.  . . . But when we refuse to assert that there are classes, we must not be supposed to be asserting dogmatically that there are none. We are merely agnostic as regards them . . .." (1919:184)

And in the second edition of ''PM'' (1927) Russell holds that "functions occur only through their values, . . . all functions of functions are extensional, . . . [and] consequently there is no reason to distinguish between functions and classes . . . Thus classes, as distinct from functions, lose even that shadowy being which they retain in *20" (p. xxxix). In other words, classes as a separate notion have vanished altogether.

'''Step 2: Collect "similar" classes into bundles (equivalence classes)''': These above collections can be put into a "binary relation" (comparing for) similarity by "equinumerosity", symbolized here by '''≈''', i.e. one-one correspondence of the elements,&lt;ref&gt;"If the predicates are partitioned into classes with respect to equinumerosity in such a way that all predicates of a class are equinumerous to one another and predicates of different classes are not equinumerous, then each such class represents the ''Number'', which applies to the predicates that belong to it" (Bernays 1930-1 in Mancosu 1998:240.&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby create Russellian classes of classes or what Russell called "bundles". "We can suppose all couples in one bundle, all trios in another, and  so on. In this way we obtain various bundles of collections, each bundle consisting of all the collections that have a certain number of terms. Each bundle is a class whose members are collections, i.e. classes; thus each is a class of classes" (Russell 1919:14).

'''Step 3: Define the null-class''': Notice that a certain class-of-classes is special because its classes contain no elements, i.e. no elements satisfy the predicates that created this particular class/collection. 

The resulting entity may be called "the null class" or "the empty class". This is not the same as the class of all null classes: the class of all null classes is destined to become "0"; see below. Russell symbolized the null/empty class with Λ. So what exactly is the Russellian null class? In ''PM'' Russell says that "A class is said to ''exist'' when it has at least one member . . . the class which has no members is called the "null class"  . . . "α is the null-class" is equivalent to "α does not exist". One is left uneasy: ''Does the null class itself "exist"?'' This problem bedevilled Russell throughout his writing of 1903.&lt;ref&gt;section 487ff (pages 513ff in the Appendix A).&lt;/ref&gt; After he discovered the paradox in Frege's ''Grundgesetze'' he added Appendix A to his 1903 where through the analysis of the nature of the null and unit classes, he discovered the need for a "doctrine of types"; see more about the unit class, the problem of [[impredicativity|impredicative definitions]] and Russell's "vicious circle principle" below.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. sections 487ff (pages 513ff in the Appendix A).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Step 4: Assign a "numeral" to each bundle''': For purposes of abbreviation and identification, to each bundle assign a unique symbol (aka a "numeral"). These symbols are arbitrary. 

'''Step 5: Define "0"''': In order to "order" the bundles into the familiar number-line a starting point traditionally called "zero", is required. Russell picked the empty or ''null'' class of classes to fill this role.  This null class of classes may be labeled "0" 

'''Step 6: Define the notion of "successor"''': Russell defined a new characteristic "hereditary" (cf Frege's 'ancestral'), a property of certain classes with the ability to "inherit" a characteristic from another class (or class-of-classes) i.e. "A property is said to be "hereditary" in the natural-number series if, whenever it belongs to a number ''n'', it also belongs to ''n''+1, the successor of ''n''". (1903:21). He asserts that "the natural numbers are the ''posterity'' -- the "children", the inheritors of the "successor"—of 0 with respect to the relation "the immediate predecessor of (which is the converse of "successor") (1919:23).

Note Russell has used a few words here without definition, in particular "number series", "number n", and "successor". He will define these in due course. ''Observe in particular that Russell does not use the unit class-of-classes "1" to construct the successor''. The reason is that, in Russell's detailed analysis,&lt;ref&gt;1909 Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt; if a unit class becomes an entity in its own right, then it too can be an element in its own proposition; this causes the proposition to become "impredicative" and result in a "vicious circle". Rather, he states: "We saw in Chapter II that a cardinal number is to be defined as a class of classes, and in Chapter III that the number 1 is to be defined as the class of all unit classes, of all that have just one member, as we should say but for the vicious circle. Of course, when the number 1 is defined as the class of all unit classes, ''unit classes'' must be defined so as not to assume that we know what is meant by ''one'' (1919:181).

For his definition of successor,  Russell will use for his "unit" a single entity or "term" as follows:
: "It remains to define "successor". Given any number ''n'' let ''α'' be a class which has ''n'' members, and let ''x'' be a term which is not a member of ''α''. Then the class consisting of ''α'' with ''x'' added on will have ''+1'' members. Thus we have the following definition:
:''the successor of the number of terms in the class α is the number of terms in the class consisting of α together with x where x is not any term belonging to the class''." (1919:23)

Russell's definition requires a new "term" which is "added into" the collections inside the bundles.

'''Step 7: Construct the successor of the null class''': From the above it is not obvious how to do this. The predicate:
: "For all ''childnames'': "''childname'' is the name of a child in family F&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;" has to be modified to creating a predicate that contains a term that is always true:
'''Step 8: For every equivalence class, create its successor''':

'''Step 9: Order the numbers''': The process of creating a successor requires the relation " . . . is the successor of . . .", which may be denoted "S", between the various "numerals". "We must now consider the ''serial'' character of the natural numbers in the order 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . We ordinarily think of the numbers as in this order, and it is an essential part of the work of analysing our data to seek a definition of "order" or "series " in logical terms. . . . The order lies, not in the ''class'' of terms, but in a relation among the members of the class, in respect of which some appear as earlier and some as later." (1919:31)

Russell applies to the notion of "ordering relation" three criteria: First, he defines the notion of "asymmetry" i.e. given the relation such as S (" . . . is the successor of  . . . ") between two terms x, and y: x S y ≠ y S x. Second, he defines the notion of "transitivity" for three numerals x, y and z: if x S y and y S z then x S z. Third, he defines the notion of "connected": "Given any two terms of the class which is to be ordered, there must be one which precedes and the other which follows. . . . A relation is connected when, given any two different terms of its field [both domain and converse domain of a relation e.g. husbands versus wives in the relation of married] the relation holds between the first and the second or between the second and the first (not excluding the possibility that both may happen, though both cannot happen if the relation is asymmetrical).(1919:32)

He concludes: ". . . [natural] number ''m'' is said to be less than another number ''n'' when n possesses every hereditary property possessed by the successor of ''m''. It is easy to see, and not difficult to prove, that the relation "less than", so defined, is asymmetrical, transitive, and connected, and has the [natural] numbers for its field [i.e. both domain and converse domain are the numbers]." (1919:35)

===Criticism===
'''The presumption of the 'extralogical' notion of iteration''': Kleene points out that, "the logicistic thesis can be questioned finally on the ground that logic already presupposes mathematical ideas in its formulation. In the Intuitionistic view, an essential mathematical kernel is contained in the idea of iteration" (Kleene 1952:46)

Bernays 1930–1931 observes that this notion "two things" already presupposes something, even without the claim of existence of two things, and also without reference to a predicate, which applies to the two things; it means, simply, "a thing and one more thing. . . . With respect to this simple definition, the Number concept turns out to be an elementary ''structural concept''  . . . the claim of the logicists that mathematics is purely logical knowledge turns out to be blurred and misleading upon closer observation of theoretical logic. . . . [one can extend the definition of "logical"] however, through this definition what is epistemologically essential is concealed, and what is peculiar to mathematics is overlooked" (in Mancosu 1998:243).

Hilbert 1931:266-7, like Bernays, considers there is "something extra-logical" in mathematics: "Besides experience and thought, there is yet a third source of knowledge. Even if today we can no longer agree with Kant in the details, nevertheless the most general and fundamental idea of the Kantian epistemology retains its significance: to ascertain the intuitive ''a priori'' mode of thought, and thereby to investigate the condition of the possibility of all knowledge. In my opinion this is essentially what happens in my investigations of the principles of mathematics. The ''a priori'' is here nothing more and nothing less than a fundamental mode of thought, which I also call the finite mode of thought: something is already given to us in advance in our faculty of representation: certain ''extra-logical concrete objects'' that exist intuitively as an immediate experience before all thought. If logical inference is to be certain, then these objects must be completely surveyable in all their parts, and their presentation, their differences, their succeeding one another or their being arrayed next to one another is immediately and intuitively given to us, along with the objects, as something that neither can be reduced to anything else, nor needs such a reduction." (Hilbert 1931 in Mancosu 1998: 266, 267).

In brief - according to Hilbert and Bernays - the notion of "sequence" or "successor" is an ''a priori'' notion that lies outside symbolic logic.

Hilbert dismissed logicism as a "false path": "Some tried to define the  numbers purely logically; others simply took the usual number-theoretic modes of inference to be self-evident. On both paths they encountered obstacles that proved to be insuperable." (Hilbert 1931 in Mancoso 1998:267).  The incompleteness theorems arguably constituted a similar obstacle for Hilbertian finitism.

Mancosu states that Brouwer concluded that: "the classical laws or principles of logic are part of [the] perceived regularity [in the symbolic representation]; they are derived from the post factum record of mathematical constructions . . . Theoretical logic  . . . [is] an empirical science and an application of mathematics" (Brouwer quoted by Mancosu 1998:9).

'''Gödel 1944''': With respect to the ''technical'' aspects of Russellian logicism as it appears in ''Principia Mathematic'' (either edition), Gödel was disappointed:
:"It is to be regretted that this first comprehensive and thorough-going presentation of a mathematical logic and the derivation of mathematics from it [is?] so greatly lacking in formal precision in the foundations (contained in *1 - *21 of ''Principia'') that it presents in this respect a considerable step backwards as compared with Frege. What is missing, above all, is a precise statement of the syntax of the formalism" (cf. footnote 1 in Gödel 1944 ''Collected Works'' 1990:120).
In particular he pointed out that "The matter is especially doubtful for the rule of substitution and of replacing defined symbols by their ''definiens''" (Russell 1944:120)

With respect to the philosophy that might underlie these foundations, Gödel considered Russell's "no-class theory" - his "nominalistic kind of constructivism, such as that embodied in Russell's "no class theory" . . . which might better be called fictionalism" (cf. footnote 1 in Gödel 1944:119) - to be faulty. See more in "Gödel's criticism and suggestions" below.

'''Grattan-Guinness''': A complicated theory of relations continued to strangle Russell's explanatory 1919 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'' and his 1927 second edition of ''Principia''. Set theory, meanwhile had moved on with its reduction of relation to the ordered pair of sets. Grattan-Guinness observes that in the second edition of ''Principia'' Russell ignored this reduction that had been achieved by his own student Norbert Wiener (1914). Perhaps because of "residual annoyance, Russell did not react at all".&lt;ref&gt;Russell deemed Wiener "the infant phenomenon . . . more infant than phenomenon"; see ''Russell's confrontation with Wiener'' in Grattan-Guinness 2000:419ff.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914 Hausdorff would provide another, equivalent definition, and Kuratowski in 1921 would provide the one in use today.&lt;ref&gt;See van Heijenoort's commentary and Norbert Wiener's 1914 ''A simplification of the logic of relations'' in van Heijenoort 1967:224ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The unit class, impredicativity, and the vicious circle principle ==
'''A benign impredicative definition''': Suppose the local librarian wants to catalog (index) her collection into a single book (call it Ι for "index"). Her index must list ALL the books and their locations in the library. As it turns out, there are only three books, and these have titles Ά, β, and Γ. To form her index-book I, she goes out and buys a book of 200 blank pages and labels it "I". Now she has four books: I, Ά, β, and Γ. Her task is not difficult. When completed, the contents of her index I is 4 pages, each with a unique title and unique location (each entry abbreviated as Title.Location&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;):
: I ← { I.L&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;, Ά.L&lt;sub&gt;Ά&lt;/sub&gt;, β.L&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;, Γ.L&lt;sub&gt;Γ&lt;/sub&gt;}.

This sort of definition of I was deemed by Poincaré to be "impredicative". He opined that only predicative definitions can be allowed in mathematics:
:"a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it".&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:190. See the discussion of this very quotation in Mancosu 1998:68.&lt;/ref&gt;

By Poincaré's definition, the librarian's index book is "impredicative" because the definition of I is dependent upon the definition of the totality I, Ά, β, and Γ. As noted below, some commentators insist that [[impredicativity]] in commonsense versions is harmless, but as the examples show below there are versions which are not harmless. In the teeth of these, Russell would enunciate a strict prohibition—his "vicious circle principle":
:"No totality can contain members definable only in terms of this totality, or members involving or presupposing this totality" (vicious circle principle)" (Gödel 1944 appearing in ''Collected Works Vol. II'' 1990:125).&lt;ref&gt;This same definition appears also in Kleene 1952:42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A pernicious impredicativity: α = NOT-α''': To create a pernicious paradox, apply input α to the simple [[function(mathematics)|function box]] F(x) with output ω = 1 - α. This is the [[Boolean logic|algebraic-logic]] equivalent of the symbolic-logical ω = NOT-α for truth values 1 and 0 rather than "true" and "false". In either case, when input α = 0, output ω = 1; when input α = 1, output ω = 0.

To make the function "impredicative", wrap around output ω to input α, i.e. identify (equate) the input with (to) the output (at either the output or input, it does not matter):
:α = 1-α
''Algebraically'' the equation is satisfied only when α = 0.5. But ''logically'', when only "truth values" 0 and 1 are permitted, then the equality ''cannot'' be satisfied. To see what is happening, employ an illustrative crutch: assume (i) the starting value of α = α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and (ii) observe the input-output propagation in discrete time-instants that proceed left to right in sequence across the page:
:α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → F(x) → 1-α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  → F(x) → (1 -(1-α&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;)) → F(x) → (1-(1-(1-α&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;))) → F(x) → ''ad nauseam''
Start with α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0:
:α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = '''0''' → F(x) → '''1''' → F(x) → '''0''' → F(x) → '''1''' → F(x) → ''ad nauseam''

Observe that output ω oscillates between '''0''' and '''1'''. If the "discrete time-instant" crutch (ii) is dropped, the function-box's output (and input) is both 1 and 0 ''simultaneously''.

'''Fatal impredicativity in the definition of the unit class''': The problem that bedeviled the logicists (and set theorists too, but with a different resolution) derives from the α = NOT-α paradox&lt;ref&gt;An excellent source for details is Fairouz Kamareddine, Twan Laan and Rob Nderpelt, 2004, ''A Modern Perspective on Type Theory, From its Origins Until Today'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, ISBN. They give a demonstration of how to create the paradox (pages 1–2), as follows: Define an aggregate/class/set y this way: ∃y∀x[ x ε y ↔ Φ(x)]. (This says: There exists a class y such that for ''ANY'' input x, x is an element of set y if and only if x satisfies the given function Φ.) Note that (i) input x is unrestricted as to the "type" of thing that it can be (it can be a thing, or a class), and (ii) function Φ is unrestricted as well. Pick the following tricky function Φ(x) = ¬(x ε x). (This says: Φ(x) is satisfied when x is NOT an element of x)). Because y (a class) is also "unrestricted" we can plug "y" in as input: ∃y[ y ε y ↔ ¬(y ε y)]. This says that "there exists a class y that is an element of itself only if it is NOT and element of itself. That is the paradox.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell discovered in Frege's 1879 ''Begriffsschrift''&lt;ref&gt;Russell's letter to Frege announcing the "discovery", and Frege's letter back to Russell in sad response, together with commentary, can be found in van Heijenoort 1967:124-128. Zermelo in his 1908 claimed priority to the discovery; cf. footnote 9 on page 191 in van Heijenoort.&lt;/ref&gt; that Frege had allowed a function to derive its input "functional" (value of its variable) not only from an object (thing, term), but from the function's own output as well.&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:3 and pages 124-128&lt;/ref&gt;

As described above, Both Frege's and Russell's construction of natural numbers begins with the formation of equinumerous classes-of-classes (bundles), then with an assignment of a unique "numeral" to each bundle, and then placing the bundles into an order via a relation S that is asymmetric: ''x'' S ''y'' ≠ ''y'' S ''x''. But Frege, unlike Russell, allowed the class of unit classes (in the example above &lt;nowiki&gt;[[d]], [[s]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to be identified as a unit itself:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[d]], [[s]] ≡ ■ ≡ 1&lt;/nowiki&gt;
But, since the class ■ or 1 is a single object (unit) in its own right, it too must be included in the class-of-unit-classes as an additional class [■]. And this inclusion results in an "infinite regress" (as Godel called it) of increasing "type" and increasing content:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[d]], [s], [[■]] ≡ ■&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[d]], [s], [[d]], [s], [■]]]] ≡ ■&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[d]], [s], [[d]], [s], [[[d]], [s], [[d]], [s], [■]]]]]]]] ≡ ■&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ad nauseam

Russell would make this problem go away by declaring a class to be a "fiction" (more or less). By this he meant that the class would designate only the elements that satisfied the propositional function (e.g. d and s) and nothing else. As a "fiction" a class cannot be considered to be a thing: an entity, a "term", a singularity, a "unit". It is an ''assemblage'' e.g. d,s but it is not (in Russell's view) worthy of thing-hood:
:"The class as many . . . is unobjectionable, but is many and not one. We may, if we choose, represent this by a single symbol: thus ''x'' ε ''u'' will mean " ''x'' is one of the ''u'' 's." This must not be taken as a relation of two terms, ''x'' and ''u'', because ''u'' as the numerical conjunction is not a single term . . . Thus a class of classes will be many many's; its constituents will each be only many, and cannot therefore in any sense, one might suppose, be single constituents.[etc]" (1903:516).

This supposes that "at the bottom" every single solitary "term" can be listed (specified by a "predicative" predicate) for any class, for any class of classes, for class of classes of classes, etc, but it introduces a new problem—a hierarchy of "types" of classes.

===A solution to impredicativity: a hierarchy of types===
'''Classes as non-objects, as useful fictions''': Gödel 1944:131 observes that "Russell adduces two reasons against the extensional view of classes, namely the existence of (1) the null class, which cannot very well be a collection, and (2) the unit classes, which would have to be identical with their single elements." He suggests that Russell should have regarded these as fictitious, but not derive the further conclusion that ''all'' classes (such as the class-of-classes that define the numbers 2, 3, etc) are fictions.

But Russell did not do this. After a detailed analysis in Appendix A: ''The Logical and Arithmetical Doctrines of Frege'' in his 1903, Russell concludes:
:"The logical doctrine which is thus forced upon us is this: The subject of a proposition may be not a single term, but essentially many terms; this is the case with all propositions asserting numbers other than 0 and 1" (1903:516).

In the following notice the wording "the class as many"—a class is an aggregate of those terms (things) that satisfy the propositional function, but a class is not a thing-in-itself:
:"Thus the final conclusion is, that the correct theory of classes is even more extensional than that of Chapter VI; that the class as many is the only object always defined by a propositional function, and that this is adequate for formal purposes" (1903:518).

It is as if Russell-as-rancher were to round up all his critters (sheep, cows and horses) into three fictitious corrals (one for the sheep, one for the cows, and one for the horses) that are located in his fictitious ranch. What actually exists are the sheep, the cows and the horses (the extensions), but not the fictitious "concepts" corrals and ranch.

'''Ramified theory of types: function-orders and argument-types, predicative functions''': When Russell proclaimed ''all'' classes are useful fictions he solved the problem of the "unit" class, but the ''overall'' problem did not go away; rather, it arrived in a new form: "It will now be necessary to distinguish (1) terms, (2) classes, (3) classes of classes, and so on ''ad infinitum''; we shall have to hold that no member of one set is a member of any other set, and that ''x'' ε ''u'' requires that ''x'' should be of a set of a degree lower by one than the set to which ''u'' belongs. Thus ''x'' ε ''x''  will become a meaningless proposition; and in this way the contradiction is avoided" (1903:517).

This is Russell's "doctrine of types". To guarantee that impredicative expressions such as ''x'' ε ''x'' can be treated in his logic, Russell proposed, as a kind of working hypothesis, that all such impredicative definitions have predicative definitions. This supposition requires the notions of function-"orders" and argument-"types". First, functions (and their classes-as-extensions, i.e. "matrices") are to be classified by their "order", where functions of individuals are of order 1, functions of functions (classes of classes) are of order 2, and so forth. Next, he defines the "type" of a function's arguments (the function's "inputs") to be their "range of significance", i.e. what are those inputs ''α'' (individuals? classes? classes-of-classes? etc.) that, when plugged into f(x), yield a meaningful output ω. Note that this means that a "type" can be of mixed order, as the following example shows:
:"Joe DiMaggio and the Yankees won the 1947 World Series".
This sentence can be decomposed into two clauses: "''x'' won the 1947 World Series" + "''y'' won the 1947 World Series". The first sentence takes for ''x'' an individual "Joe DiMaggio" as its input, the other takes for ''y'' an aggregate "Yankees" as its input. Thus the composite-sentence has a (mixed) type of 2, mixed as to order (1 and 2).

By "predicative", Russell meant that the function must be of an order higher than the "type" of its variable(s). Thus a function (of order 2) that creates a class of classes can only entertain arguments for its variable(s) that are classes (type 1) and individuals (type 0), as these are lower types. Type 3 can only entertain types 2, 1 or 0, and so forth. But these types can be mixed (for example, for this sentence to be (sort of) true: " ''z'' won the 1947 World Series " could accept the individual (type 0) "Joe DiMaggio" and/or the names of his other teammates, ''and'' it could accept the class (type 1) of individual players "The Yankees".

'''The axiom of reducibility''': The ''[[axiom of reducibility]]'' is the hypothesis that ''any'' function of ''any'' order can be reduced to (or replaced by) an equivalent ''predicative'' function of the appropriate order.&lt;ref&gt;"The axiom of reducibility is the assumption that, given any function φẑ, there is a formally equivalent, ''predicative'' function, i.e. there is a predicative function which is true when φz is true and false when φz is false. In symbols, the axiom is: ⊦ :(∃ψ) : φz. ≡&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; .ψ!z." (''PM'' 1913/1962 edition:56, the original uses x with a circumflex). Here φẑ indicates the function with variable ẑ, i.e. φ(x) where x is argument "z"; φz indicates the value of the function given argument "z"; ≡&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; indicates "equivalence for all z"; ψ!z indicates a predicative function, i.e. one with no variables except individuals.&lt;/ref&gt; A careful reading of the first edition indicates that an n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order predicative function need not be expressed "all the way down" as a huge "matrix" or aggregate of individual atomic propositions. "For in practice only the ''relative'' types of variables are relevant; thus the lowest type occurring in a given context may be called that of individuals" (p.&amp;nbsp;161). But the axiom of reducibility proposes that ''in theory'' a reduction "all the way down" is possible.

'''Russell 1927 abandons the axiom of reducibility, and the edifice collapses''': By the 2nd edition of ''PM'' of 1927, though, Russell had given up on the axiom of reducibility and concluded he would indeed force any order of function "all the way down" to its elementary propositions, linked together with logical operators:
:"All propositions, of whatever order, are derived from a matrix composed of elementary propositions combined by means of the stroke" (''PM'' 1927 Appendix A, p. 385),
(The "stroke" is Sheffer's inconvenient logical NAND that Russell adopted for the 2nd edition—a single logical function that replaces logical OR and logical NOT).

The net result, though, was a collapse of his theory. Russell arrived at this disheartening conclusion: that "the theory of ordinals and cardinals survives . . . but irrationals, and real numbers generally, can no longer be adequately dealt with. . . .Perhaps some further axiom, less objectionable than the axiom of reducibility, might give these results, but we have not succeeded in finding such an axiom." (''PM'' 1927:xiv).

Gödel 1944 agrees that Russell's logicist project was stymied; he seems to disagree that even the integers survived:
:"[In the second edition] The axiom of reducibility is dropped, and it is stated explicitly that all primitive predicates belong to the lowest type and that the only purpose of variables (and evidently also of constants) of higher orders and types is to make it possible to assert more complicated truth-functions of atomic propositions" (Gödel 1944 in ''Collected Works'':134).

Gödel asserts, however, that this procedure seems to presuppose arithmetic in some form or other (p.&amp;nbsp;134). He deduces that "one obtains integers of different orders" (p.&amp;nbsp;134-135); the proof in Russell 1927 ''PM'' Appendix B that "the integers of any order higher than 5 are the same as those of order 5" is "not conclusive" and "the question whether (or to what extent) the theory of integers can be obtained on the basis of the ramified hierarchy [classes plus types] must be considered as unsolved at the present time". Gödel concluded that it wouldn't matter anyway because propositional functions of order ''n'' (any ''n'') must be described by finite combinations of symbols (all quotes and content derived from page 135).

===Gödel's criticism and suggestions===
Gödel in his 1944 bores down to the exact place where Russell's logicism fails and offers a few suggestions to rectify the problems. He submits the "vicious circle principle" to reexamination, tearing it apart into three phrases "definable only in terms of", "involving" and "presupposing". It is the first clause that "makes impredicative definitions impossible and thereby destroys the derivation of mathematics from logic, effected by Dedekind and Frege, and a good deal of mathematics itself". Since, he argues, mathematics is doing quite well, thank you, with its various inherent impredicativities (e.g. "real numbers defined by reference to all real numbers"), he concludes that what he has offered is "a proof that the vicious circle principle is false [rather] than that classical mathematics is false" (all quotes Gödel 1944:127).

'''Russell's no-class theory is the root of the problem''': Gödel believes that impredicativity is not "absurd", as it appears throughout mathematics. Where Russell's problem derives from is the "constructivistic (or nominalistic&lt;ref&gt;Perry observes that Plato and Russell are "enthusiastic" about "universals", then in the next sentence writes: " 'Nominalists' think that all that particulars really have in common are the words we apply to them" (Perry in his 1997 Introduction to Russell 1912:xi). Perry adds that while your sweatshirt and mine are different objects generalized by the word "sweatshirt", you have a relation to yours and I have a relation to mine. And Russell "treated relations on par with other universals" (p. xii). But Gödel is saying that Russell's "no-class" theory denies the numbers the status of "universals".&lt;/ref&gt;) standpoint toward the objects of logic and mathematics, in particular toward propositions, classes, and notions . . . a notion being a symbol . . . so that a separate object denoted by the symbol appears as a mere fiction" (p.&amp;nbsp;128).

Indeed, this "no class" theory of Russell, Gödel concludes:
:"is of great interest as one of the few examples, carried out in detail, of the tendency to eliminate assumptions about the existence of objects outside the "data" and to replace them by constructions on the basis of these data&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;. [&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; The "data" are to understand in a relative sense here; i.e. in our case as logic without the assumption of the existence of classes and concepts]. The result has been in this case essentially negative; i.e. the classes and concepts introduced in this way do not have all the properties required from their use in mathematics. . . . All this is only a verification of the view defended above that logic and mathematics (just as physics) are built up on axioms with a real content which cannot be explained away" (p. 132)

He concludes his essay with the following suggestions and observations:
:"One should take a more conservative course, such as would consist in trying to make the meaning of terms "class" and "concept" clearer, and to set up a consistent theory of classes and concepts as objectively existing entities.  This is the course which the actual development of mathematical logic has been taking and which Russell himself has been forced to enter upon in the more constructive parts of his work. Major among the attempts in this direction . . . are the simple theory of types . . . and axiomatic set theory, both of which have been successful at least to this extent, that they permit the derivation of modern mathematics and at the same time avoid all known paradoxes . . . ¶ It seems reasonable to suspect that it is this incomplete understanding of the foundations which is responsible for the fact that mathematical logic has up to now remained so far behind the high expectations of Peano and others . . .." (p. 140)

For instance, one might replace [[Basic Law V]] (analogous to the [[axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension]] in [[naive set theory]]) with some 'safer' axiom so as to prevent the derivation of the known paradoxes.  The most cited candidate to replace BLV is [[Hume's principle]], the contextual definition of '#'  given by '#F = #G if and only if there is a [[bijection]] between F and G'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~plxol/Courses/PHIL30067/Syllabus.htm PHIL 30067: Logicism and Neo-Logicism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717200246/http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~plxol/Courses/PHIL30067/Syllabus.htm |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of neo-logicism is often referred to as '''neo-Fregeanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=logicism |title=Logicism and Neologicism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of neo-Fregeanism include [[Crispin Wright]] and [[Bob Hale (philosopher)|Bob Hale]], sometimes also called the '''Scottish School''',&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; or '''abstractionist Platonism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hale and Crispin Wright (2002), "Benacerraf's dilemma revisited", ''European Journal of Philosophy'' '''10'''(1):101–129, esp.

Another quasi-neo-logicist approach has been suggested by M. Randall Holmes. In this kind of amendment to the ''Grundgesetze'', BLV remains intact, save for a restriction to stratifiable formulae in the manner of Quine's NF and related systems. Essentially all of the ''Grundgesetze'' then 'goes through'. The resulting system has the same consistency strength as Jensen's NFU + Rosser's Axiom of Counting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/fregenote.pdf "Repairing Frege’s Logic"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2408">{{for|the Lie algebras or groups |Malcev Lie algebra}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''Malcev algebra''' (or '''Maltsev algebra''' or '''[[Ruth Moufang|Moufang]]–[[Sophus Lie|Lie]] algebra''') over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] is a [[nonassociative algebra]] that is antisymmetric, so that

:&lt;math&gt;xy = -yx&lt;/math&gt;

and satisfies the '''Malcev identity'''

:&lt;math&gt;(xy)(xz) = ((xy)z)x + ((yz)x)x + ((zx)x)y.&lt;/math&gt;

They were first defined by [[Anatoly Maltsev]] (1955).

Malcev algebras play a role in the theory of [[Moufang loop]]s that generalizes the role of [[Lie algebras]] in the theory of [[group (mathematics)|group]]s.  Namely, just as the tangent space of the identity element of a [[Lie group]] forms a Lie algebra, the tangent space of the identity of a smooth Moufang loop forms a Malcev algebra.  Moreover, just as a Lie group can be recovered from its Lie algebra under certain supplementary conditions, a smooth Moufang loop can be recovered from its Malcev algebra if certain supplementary conditions hold.  For example, this is true for a connected, simply connected real-analytic Moufang loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.heldermann-verlag.de/jlt/jlt03/NAGYLAT.PDF|title= Moufang loops and Malcev algebras| author= Peter T. Nagy |journal=Seminar Sophus Lie|volume=3|year=1992|pages=65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*Any [[Lie algebra]] is a Malcev algebra.
*Any [[alternative algebra]] may be made into a Malcev algebra by defining the Malcev product to be ''xy''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''yx''.
*The 7-sphere may be given the structure of a smooth Moufang loop by identifying it with the unit [[octonions]].  The tangent space of the identity of this Moufang loop may be identified with the 7-dimensional space of imaginary octonions.  The imaginary octonions form a Malcev algebra with the Malcev product ''xy''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''yx''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3712">In [[mathematics]], the '''Minkowski–Steiner formula''' is a formula relating the [[area|surface area]] and [[volume]] of [[compact space|compact]] [[subset]]s of [[Euclidean space]]. More precisely, it defines the surface area as the "derivative" of enclosed volume in an appropriate sense.

The Minkowski–Steiner formula is used, together with the [[Brunn–Minkowski theorem]], to prove the [[isoperimetric inequality]]. It is named after [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Jakob Steiner]].

==Statement of the Minkowski-Steiner formula==

Let &lt;math&gt;n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;A \subsetneq \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; be a compact set. Let &lt;math&gt;\mu (A)&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Lebesgue measure]] (volume) of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Define the quantity &lt;math&gt;\lambda (\partial A)&lt;/math&gt; by the '''Minkowski–Steiner formula'''

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda (\partial A) := \liminf_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\mu \left( A + \overline{B_{\delta}} \right) - \mu (A)}{\delta},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{B_{\delta}} := \left\{ x = (x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \left| | x | := \sqrt{x_{1}^{2} + \dots + x_{n}^{2}} \leq \delta \right. \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the [[closed ball]] of [[radius]] &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;A + \overline{B_{\delta}} := \left\{ a + b \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \left| a \in A, b \in \overline{B_{\delta}} \right. \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Minkowski sum]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{B_{\delta}}&lt;/math&gt;, so that

:&lt;math&gt;A + \overline{B_{\delta}} = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \mathrel|\ \mathopen| x - a \mathclose| \leq \delta \mbox{ for some } a \in A \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Remarks==

===Surface measure===

For "sufficiently regular" sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\lambda (\partial A)&lt;/math&gt; does indeed correspond with the &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional measure of the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] &lt;math&gt;\partial A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. See Federer (1969) for a full treatment of this problem.

===Convex sets===

When the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[convex set]], the [[limit inferior|lim-inf]] above is a true [[Limit of a sequence|limit]], and one can show that

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \left( A + \overline{B_{\delta}} \right) = \mu (A) + \lambda (\partial A) \delta + \sum_{i = 2}^{n - 1} \lambda_{i} (A) \delta^{i} + \omega_{n} \delta^{n},&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are some [[continuous function]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (see [[quermassintegral]]s) and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{n}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the measure (volume) of the [[unit ball]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{n} = \frac{2 \pi^{n / 2}}{n \Gamma (n / 2)},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Gamma function]].

==Example: volume and surface area of a ball==

Taking &lt;math&gt;A = \overline{B_{R}}&lt;/math&gt; gives the following well-known formula for the surface area of the [[sphere]] of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{R} := \partial B_{R}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda (S_{R}) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\mu \left( \overline{B_{R}} + \overline{B_{\delta}} \right) - \mu \left( \overline{B_{R}} \right)}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{[ (R + \delta)^{n} - R^{n} ] \omega_{n}}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= n R^{n - 1} \omega_{n},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is as above.

'''NAR 1''' or just '''NAR''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] '''Na'''stavni '''R'''ačunar, [[English language|en.]] ''Educational Computer'') was a theoretical model of a computer created by Faculty of Mathematics of [[University of Belgrade]] professor [[Nedeljko Parezanović]] (In Serbian:Недељко Парезановић).  It was used for [[Assembly language]] and [[Computer architecture]] courses.

==Specifications==
NAR 1 [[Central Processing Unit|processor]] has a 5-[[bit]] [[address bus]] (32 [[byte]]s of addressable memory) and 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]]. [[machine language|Machine]] [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s were single-byte with three [[most significant bit]]s specifying the [[opcode]] and 5 [[least significant bit]]s the parameter - [[memory address]]. A single 8-bit [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator register]] was available and there were no [[Flag (computing)|flags or flag registers]]. Only [[Addressing mode#Absolute|absolute addressing mode]] was available and all others were achieved by [[self-modifying code]]. 

Even though this is only a theoretical computer the following physical characteristics were given:

* Memory cycle: 1μs
* Arithmetic operation (SABF) cycle: 0.9μs (900ns)
* Control panel facilitates power on and off, memory data entry and readout, instruction counter entry and selection of either program execution mode or control panel mode.

==Instruction coding and set==
* '''SABF''' (001aaaaa, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Sab'''eri u '''F'''iksnom zarezu, [[English language|en.]] Add Fixed point) loads the content of memory location specified by the address parameter, adds it to the current value of the accumulator and stores the result into the accumulator
* '''PZAF''' (010xxxxx, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''P'''romeni '''Z'''nak '''A'''kumulatora u '''F'''iksnom zarezu, [[English language|en.]] Change the sign of the accumulator in fixed point) Negates the fixed point (such as integer) value in the accumulator
* '''AUM''' (011aaaaa, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''A'''kumulator '''U''' '''M'''emoriju, [[English language|en.]] Accumulator Into Memory) stores the content of the accumulator into memory location specified by the address parameter
* '''MUA''' (100aaaaa, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''M'''emorija '''U''' '''A'''kumulator, [[English language|en.]] Memory Into Accumulator) loads the content of memory location specified by the address parameter into the accumulator
* '''NES''' (101aaaaa, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Ne'''gativni '''S'''kok, [[English language|en.]] Negative Jump) performs a [[Branch (computer science)|conditional jump]] to the address specified by the parameter if the current value of the accumulator is negative
* '''ZAR''' (110xxxxx, [[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Za'''ustavi '''R'''ačunar, [[English language|en.]] Stop the Computer) stops any further processing.

Two more instructions were not specified but were commonly present in simulators and took instruction codes 000aaaaa and 111aaaaa:
* '''BES''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Be'''zuslovni '''S'''kok, [[English language|en.]] Unconditional Jump) performs an [[Jump instruction|unconditional jump]] to the address specified by the parameter
* '''NUS''' ([[Serbian language|sr.]] '''Nu'''la-'''S'''kok, [[English language|en.]] Zero Jump) performs a [[Branch (computer science)|conditional jump]] to the address specified by the parameter if the current value of the accumulator is zero

==Example programs==
A sample program that sums up an array of 8-bit integers:

&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
00:     0         ; input: 0 or value 22, output: result
01..21: 0,0,0...  ; input: values 1..21
22:     MUA  0    ; Start of program; Load accumulator from address 0
23:     SABF 1    ; Add value from address 1 to accumulator
24:     AUM  0    ; Store accumulator to address 0
25:     MUA  23   ; Load instruction at address 23 (SABF)
26:     SABF 31   ; Add value from address 31 (+1) to accumulator
27:     AUM  23   ; Store accumulator to address 23 (modifies SABF instruction)
28:     SABF 30   ; Add value from address 30 to accumulator
29:     NES  22   ; Jump back to 22 if accumulator value is negative
30:     ZAR  10   ; Stop the computer. Argument makes this byte have the value of -(SABF 22) = -54.
31:     1         ; Value to add to address in each iteration
&lt;/source&gt;

Above program adds up to 22 8-bit values if executed from address 22:
* Values 1-21 stored at locations 1-21
* Value 22 stored at location 0, instead of the constant 0 and will be replaced by the result

NAR 1 programs are commonly self-modifying. Unlike in some other architectures, this is not a 'trick'. As memory can not be addressed by a register, the only way to dynamically manipulate memoory data is to modify memory manipulation instructions. Above example also contains a typical trick to save memory - instruction (at address 30) is reused as data by another instruction (at address 28).

If initial accumulator value can be controlled from the control pane, a 23rd value can be stored in it. Above program has to be only slightly modified - instruction SABF 1 at address 23 has to be changed to SABF 0 and the program should be executed from that address (23) and not from 22.

Other tricks included the use of the changes of the sign after instruction is modified, as shown in the following example:

&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
00..21: 0,0,0...  ; input values 22 to 1
22:     0         ; input: 0 or value 23, output: result
23:     MUA  21   ; start of program; Load (next) value
24:     SABF 22   ; Add subtotal at 22 to accumulator
25:     AUM  22   ; Store new subtotal to 22
26:     MUA  23   ; Load instruction 23 into accumulator
27:     SABF 31   ; Decrement instruction by 1
28:     AUM  23   ; Update instruction
29:     NES  23   ; Repeat if the instruction is still negative
30:     ZAR       ; Otherwise, stop the computer
31:     -1        ; Constant needed for instruction at 27
&lt;/source&gt;

Here the instruction "MUA 21" at address 23 has the binary value 10010101, which is -107 decimal when treated like signed integer in [[two's complement]]. Instructions at addresses 26, 27 and 28 decrement this value by 1 in each iteration. This will modify the 5 least significant bits specifying the address and will not touch the three bits indicating the instruction until that instruction becomes MUA 0 (10000000 binary = -128 decimal, negative). Once this is decremented by one it becomes 01111111 (+127 decimal) which is no longer negative and will cause the jump-if-negative instruction at 29 to pass, proceeding to "stop the computer" at 30.

Similarly to above, this program can add between 22 and 24 values, depending on whether address 22 can be used for both input and output and whether initial value of the accumulator can be used as input (the program should then be executed from address 24 and instruction at 23 should be MUA 22).

If particular implementation stops the computer if it encounters an unknown opcode or it implements additional unconditional jump instruction with opcode "111aaaaa", then such behaviour can be used as follows:

&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
00..22: 0,0,0...  ; input values 23 to 1
23:     0         ; input: 0 or value 24, output: result
24:     MUA  22   ; start of program; Load (next) value
25:     SABF 23   ; Add subtotal at 23 to accumulator
26:     AUM  23   ; Store new subtotal to 23
27:     MUA  24   ; Load instruction 24 into accumulator
28:     SABF 31   ; Decrement instruction by 1
29:     AUM  24   ; Update instruction
30:     NES  24   ; Repeat if the instruction is still negative
31:     -1        ; BES 31 or invalid instruction &amp; constant for instruction at 28
&lt;/source&gt;

Above, the value of "-1" found at address 31 can either be treated as invalid instruction causing the computer to stop or as unconditional jump (BES 31) to the same address, resulting in infinite loop that does not affect the result (control panel can be used to display it).

Finally, depending on whether it is decided that a computer will stop program execution if it reaches the end of memory (address 31, will not roll back to address 0), above program can be reorganized to take one value more by eliminating the need for "stop the computer" instruction altogether, as follows:

&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
00..22: 0,0,0...  ; input values 23 to 1
23:     0         ; input: 0 or value 24, output: result
24:     -1        ; Constant needed for instruction at 29
25:     MUA  22   ; start of program; Load (next) value
26:     SABF 23   ; Add subtotal at 23 to accumulator
27:     AUM  23   ; Store new subtotal to 23
28:     MUA  25   ; Load instruction 25 into accumulator
29:     SABF 24   ; Decrement instruction by 1
30:     AUM  25   ; Update instruction
31:     NES  25   ; Repeat if the instruction is still negative
; ------------- end of memory
&lt;/source&gt;

==Trivia==
* Word "nar" means [[Teaching computer model]]
* Many NAR 1 simulators were created. One was named "Šljiva" ([[English language|en.]] ''[[plum]]'') as that fruit grows in [[Serbia]], while "nar" does not.
* One of frequently given task was to create a program that adds as many numbers as possible, having those numbers stored in 32-byte memory along with the program.
* Some assembly language protocols are derived from the NAR1 khulil code

'''''Numberjacks''''' is a British children's [[television series]] that originally aired on [[CBeebies]] on [[BBC Two]] in the UK between October 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.licensingexpo.com/license-global/numberjacks-series-2-commissioned-bbc|title='Numberjacks' Series 2 Commissioned by BBC|date=4 December 2008|publisher=Global License!|accessdate=18 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009, and on the CBeebies channel also. It was first shown on [[BBC Two]] at 10 am on 16 October 2006. It was then repeated on [[CBeebies]] at 11 am and 3 pm on the same day. BBC Two only showed it for a week due to the half term break and then the future episodes were shown on CBeebies at 11am. Re-runs of the episodes were shown regularly on [[CBeebies]] (when it was on BBC Two, it was only on occasionally, and when it first appeared, it was only on for a week) until October 2015. It was produced by [[Open Mind Productions]] for the [[BBC]] and features a mixture of computer-generated animation and live-action. The show has a swing of [[science fiction]] in it, as the Numberjacks take residence in a [[couch]] in a house, everything around them moves of its own accord, and humans must be scarce at launching time.

==Synopsis==
The Numberjacks are animated characters (the numbers 0 to 9) who live in an ordinary [[couch|sofa]] and solve problems outside; each episode has the same structure. At the beginning of the episode, some of the Numberjacks are engaged in an activity, that would have relevance to the problem that is later discovered - then, an ''agent'' (who was a live-action child)  calls in and describes the problem that is occurring. One (or two) of the Numberjacks go out into the real world to solve the problem while the other Numberjacks stay in the sofa and watch their progress on a screen. As soon as the problem is understood, Five imagines what else could go wrong if the problem wasn't solved (often wondering what would happen to the Dancing Cow, who never actually made any physical appearance in the real world).

Once outside, the Numberjacks are shown in a live-action setting (although themselves still animated); they diagnose their problems by examination, and with help from additional ideas from the agents, who call into the base. The problem can either be caused by one of the antagonists, or one of the younger Numberjacks (Zero, One, or Two) escaping from the sofa and inadvertently making things go wrong. Problems are solved by using ''Brain Gain'', a magical force of power activated by use of a machine in the sofa and transferred to the Numberjack.

Once the problem is solved, the Numberjacks return to their base, replay what happened on a screen, and then challenge the viewer to think about a related problem and "call the Numberjacks". The problems encountered are all based upon simple mathematical concepts, and the programme is intended to stimulate young children's interest in mathematics. On satellite, digital, and cable TV, a link to ''Numberjacks'' often appeared in the corner of the screen and sometimes on (for example) gardening programmes as a way of helping people with basic numeracy.

==Characters==

===Protagonists===
The ''Numberjacks'' are the heroes; each of the numbers 0 through 9 is an individual character and each is broadly the age of his or her number. The male Numberjacks are even numbers and the female Numberjacks are odd numbers - however, One is voiced by a ''male'' actor (Dylan Robertson, who also voices Zero).
*Zero (0) (lime green), One (1) (purple), and Two (2) (orange) are the youngest Numberjacks and are too young to go out on missions and are usually only seen inside the sofa, although sometimes they escape and cause problems of their own (like Zero does in the first episode, ''The Trouble with Nothing''). Also, in ''One Won'', One becomes enormous, as a result of the Brain Gain sent to her (and prevents the Numbertaker from sucking up Six).
*Three (3) (pink), Four (4) (blue), Five (5) (turquoise), and Six (6) (yellow) are the main characters and appear in every episode; Three was considered ''too small a number'' to go into the real world by herself in early episodes, but later on, she is then allowed to do so, initially with Four, Five, and Six. Three once becomes a 4 in ''Being 3'' to prevent the Numbertaker from sucking her up, Four becomes a 5 and a 6 in ''One More Time'', a 14 in ''Into the Teens'', a symmetrical 4 in ''More 4'', and a 1, a 2, and an 8 in ''Half Time'', and Six is once split into two 3s in ''Nine Lives'' to solve a puzzle set by the Puzzler (given that 6 is 2 lots of 3). Also, in ''A Different Sort'', Four becomes green (as opposed to his original colour of blue), tiny, enormous, and finally ''wibbly-wobbly'', and in ''Round and Round'', Five becomes short, tall, thin, fat, and empty when the Problem Blob traps her in a pattern.
*Seven (7) (red), Eight (8) (sky blue), and Nine (9) (green) are the eldest Numberjacks and have their own missions, but are occasionally seen if they become involved in a problem (such as that occasion when Zero accidentally made all of the other Numberjacks disappear in ''Zero the Hero''). They live in another part of the sofa.

===Antagonists===
There are five evil villains, the ''Meanies'', who often cause trouble for people; the Problem Blob, the Puzzler, and the Numbertaker are male villains, while the Shape Japer and Spooky Spoon are female villains. Spooky Spoon also seems to appear more often than any of the other Meanies.

*The Problem Blob is a green blob, with a single eye on the tip of his long tongue. He spits out lumps of green slime that cause anything they touch to suffer from a particular problem; he is usually found in dark corners and does not even speak, as he just heaves and splutters and makes noises. In ''Almost Human'', Numberjack Four gets slimed and thinks he is a person while the person, thinking he is Numberjack Four, becomes the "Numberjack Man". The Problem Blob causes more trouble than any other Meanie. In fact, no one likes him.
*The Shape Japer is a purple sphere (with an "angry" face and sharp teeth, but still "smiles" even when not happy). She causes problems by changing the shape or size of objects; she flies through the air and rarely speaks, but laughs a lot. She is able to change her shape from sphere to cube at will (and in the episode ''A Circle at Both Ends'', a cylinder). In the second series (2009), the shape of her teeth are changed to semicircles rather than triangles (but only in the UK version).
*The Puzzler is a bubble that somewhat resembles a bald, floating head of a [[human]] (with tan skin, some orange hair that looks like bubbles, a pair of green glasses, a mustache, an earring, blue eyes, and a goatee). He traps the Numberjacks inside puzzle bubbles or causes other problems and sets mathematical puzzles that have to be solved to make the problems go away; he is arguably the most fearsome enemy of the Numberjacks, as any Numberjack unable to solve one of his puzzles may be trapped in a puzzle bubble forever. He is also quite intelligent. In the second series (2009), the Puzzler just leaves the Numberjacks instead of ''exploding'' when defeated (however, he still often speaks in rhyme, like Gruntilda from the [[Banjo-Kazooie]] games). He is also an ex-disc jockey. Of all the Meanies, the Puzzler is the meanest (and arguably the hardest for the Numberjacks to defeat), though for some reason, he is secretly pleased when the Numberjacks solve his puzzles.
*Spooky Spoon is an anthropomorphic fuchsia spoon. She mixes things up, and the Numberjacks have to sort them out. She wears a yellow necklace, has purple eyes and can masquerade as a "regular" spoon (even though she is fuchsia). She considers herself superior to everyone around and has a particularly strong dislike for Five, whom she views as a rival - and in the second series (2009), her mouth has an inner part instead of a hollow mouth (again, only in the UK version). Spooky Spoon is the easiest Meanie for the Numberjacks to defeat, and has the most appearances.
*The Numbertaker is a live-action man (with an exaggerated top hat and a white trench coat, based after an [[undertaker]]). He removes numbers (or numbers of things) or mucks about with them. As numbers themselves, the Numberjacks have to be particularly careful when dealing with him. He utilizes a "number sucker-upper", a "number grabber", a net, a magnet, a long pointed pole, a hook, and sometimes his own hands to steal things - and he sometimes becomes his alter-ego, the ''Numbermaker'', causing problems by creating higher numbers of things. He doesn't speak much in any of his appearances (which the only sound he makes is noises), nor smile much either. In ''Into The Teens'' and ''Half Time'', he was multiplied twice; on both occasions the multiple versions of him despised each other and all ended up sucking each other up. Also in ''Half Time'', he halved Four twice, and Three inadvertently doubled the blue number 1 three times (which meant the blue number 8 needed the Numbertaker to halve him again).

==Episodes==
The first series, consisting of 45 15-minute episodes, was premiered on [[BBC Two]] on 16 October 2006, while the second series, consisting of 20 15-minute episodes, was premiered on [[CBeebies]] in 2009; both "specials" were also exclusive to [[DVD]].&lt;ref name=numberjacks /&gt;

'''Photon Doppler velocimetry (PDV)''' is a one-dimensional [[Fourier transform]] analysis of a [[heterodyne]] [[laser]] [[interferometry]], used in the shock physics community to measure velocities in dynamic experiments with high temporal precision. PDV was developed at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] by Strand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://link.aip.org/link/?RSINAK/77/083108/1 Compact system for high-speed velocimetry using heterodyne techniques&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years PDV has achieved popularity in the shock physics community as an adjunct or replacement for [[Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR)]]&lt;!-- see [[Talk:VISAR]] for a reference --&gt;, another time-resolved velocity interferometry system. Modern data acquisition technology and off-the-shelf optical telecommunications devices now enable the assembly of PDV systems within reasonable budgets.

==Theory==
The fundamental mechanism of PDV is the interference pattern created by two electromagnetic waves with a small difference in frequency. Since most PDV systems are constructed with available telecommunications equipment, a standard laser source for a PDV system is centered at 1550&amp;nbsp;nm (or 193.4 THz). If this source is then reflected off of a moving surface with some velocity (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;), the reflected light will be shifted in frequency (&lt;math&gt;\nu_{observed}&lt;/math&gt;) according to the relativistic Doppler shift equation.

:&lt;math&gt;
\nu_{observed} = \nu_{source} \sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}
&lt;/math&gt;

If the shifted return light is then interfered with the original source, the resulting wave will have a beat frequency in the range of a few GHz. This beat frequency is slow enough that it can be monitored with a simple photo-detector and high speed oscilloscope. By recording the beat frequency over time, a complete velocity history of the surface is obtained.

[[File:BeatFrequency.png|thumb|right|400px|Beat frequency obtained from the interference of a 193.4 THz EM wave with a 193.40032 THz EM wave. The shifted frequency corresponds to a surface moving toward the observer at a velocity of 500 m/s.]]

==PDV data analysis==
In theory, the analysis of a PDV data signal is quite simple, where the apparent velocity of the moving surface (&lt;math&gt;v^*&lt;/math&gt;) is simply a function of the source wavelength (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt;) and the signal frequency (&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;
v^* = \frac{\lambda_0}{2} \bar{f}
&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, however, determining the instantaneous frequency (&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt;) of the signal by inspection can be inaccurate and inefficient. Consequently, Fourier transform analysis is used to extract the most probable frequency components, which can then be used to calculate the velocity history.

By taking sequential FFTs over a time window which moves across the data signal, a 2D spectrogram can be created which indicates the frequency components most dominant in the data. The velocity history can then be extracted from the spectrogram.

==PDV advantages==

PDV can measure a wide range of velocities (limited primarily by the time resolution of the signal recording equipment), and is relatively easy to set up and use.

==PDV limitations==

Depending on the quality of the data signal and parameters of the FFT, the inherent error in PDV measurements can be high. However, there are ways to mitigate these problems and obtain velocity histories with very high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dolan | first1 = D.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''q''-exponential}}

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], a '''''q''-exponential''' is a [[q-analog|''q''-analog]] of the [[exponential function]],
namely the [[eigenfunction]] of a ''q''-derivative. There are many  ''q''-derivatives, for example, the classical  [[q-derivative|''q''-derivative]], the Askey-Wilson operator, etc. Therefore, unlike the classical exponentials, ''q''-exponentials are not unique.  For example, &lt;math&gt;e_q(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''q''-exponential corresponding to the classical  [[q-derivative|''q''-derivative]] while  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_q(z)&lt;/math&gt; are eigenfunctions of the Askey-Wilson operators.

==Definition==
The ''q''-exponential &lt;math&gt;e_q(z)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;e_q(z)=
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{[n]_q!} = 
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n (1-q)^n}{(q;q)_n} = 
\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^n\frac{(1-q)^n}{(1-q^n)(1-q^{n-1}) \cdots (1-q)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[n]_q!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[q-factorial|''q''-factorial]] and 
:&lt;math&gt;(q;q)_n=(1-q^n)(1-q^{n-1})\cdots (1-q)&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[q-Pochhammer symbol|''q''-Pochhammer symbol]]. That this is the ''q''-analog of the exponential follows from the property

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{d}{dz}\right)_q e_q(z) = e_q(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where the derivative on the left is the [[q-derivative|''q''-derivative]]. The above is easily verified by considering the ''q''-derivative of the [[monomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{d}{dz}\right)_q z^n = z^{n-1} \frac{1-q^n}{1-q}
=[n]_q z^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;[n]_q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[q-bracket|''q''-bracket]].
For other definitions of the ''q''-exponential function, see {{harvtxt|Exton|1983}}, {{harvtxt|Ismail|Zhang|1994}}, {{harvtxt|Suslov|2003}} and {{harvtxt|Cieslinski|2011}}.

==Properties==
For real &lt;math&gt;q&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;e_q(z)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[entire function]] of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;q&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e_q(z)&lt;/math&gt; is regular in the disk &lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;1/(1-q)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note the inverse,  &lt;math&gt;~e_q(z)  ~   e_{1/q} (-z)        =1&lt;/math&gt;.
===Addition Formula===
If &lt;math&gt;xy=qyx&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e_q(x)e_q(y)=e_q(x+y)&lt;/math&gt; holds.
==Relations==
For  &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;q&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, a function that is closely related is &lt;math&gt;E_q(z).&lt;/math&gt;  It  is a special case of the [[basic hypergeometric series]],

:&lt;math&gt;E_{q}(z)=\;_{0}\phi_{1}(-;0,-z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{q^{\binom{n}{2}}z^{n}}{(q;q)_{n}}=\prod_{n=0}^{\infty}(1-q^{n}z)=(z;q)_\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Clearly,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{q\to1}E_{q}\left(z(1-q)\right)=\lim_{q\to1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{q^{\binom{n}{2}}(1-q)^{n}}{(q;q)_{n}}z^{n}=e^{z} .~ &lt;/math&gt;
===Relation with Dilogarithm===
&lt;math&gt;e_q(x)&lt;/math&gt; has the following infinite product representation:
:&lt;math&gt;e_q(x)=\left(\prod_{k=0}^\infty(1-q^k(1-q)x)\right)^{-1}. &lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\log(1-x)=-\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n}&lt;/math&gt; holds. 
When &lt;math&gt;|q|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\log e_q(x)=-\sum_{k=0}^\infty\log(1-q^k(1-q)x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(q^k(1-q)x)^n}{n}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{((1-q)x)^n}{(1-q^n)n}=\frac{1}{1-q}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{((1-q)x)^n}{[n]_qn}.&lt;/math&gt;
By taking the limit &lt;math&gt;q\to 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{q\to 1}(1-q)\log e_q(x/(1-q))=\mathrm{Li}_2(x), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Li}_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dilogarithm]].

He contributed a celebrated foreword to the Bollingen Series 1944 reprint of the Thomas Taylor translation of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias]]''.  He also wrote a book titled ''The concept of [[matter]] in [[Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]''&lt;ref&gt;R. Catesby Taliaferro, ''The concept of matter in Descartes and Leibniz'', University of Notre Dame Press, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; and one titled ''Number systems, introduction to Euclid book V, and to the theory of limits''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Catesby Taliaferro, ''Number systems, introduction to Euclid book&amp;nbsp;V, and to the theory of limits'', 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his doctorate from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville in 1936. He was a teacher at St. John's College in Annapolis, and in 1948 became a Master at Portsmouth Priory, now [[Portsmouth Abbey]] School, in Portsmouth (Rhode Island). In 1956 he became an associate professor at the University of Notre Dame, after he was there Visiting Associate Professor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11703">The '''radix economy''' of a number in a particular base (or [[radix]]) is the number of [[digit (math)|digit]]s needed to express it in that base, multiplied by the base (the number of possible values each digit could have). This is one of various proposals that have been made to quantify the relative costs of using different radices in representing numbers, especially in computer systems. 

Radix economy also has implications for organizational structure, networking, and other fields.

==Definition==
The '''radix economy''' ''E''(''b'',''N'') for any particular number ''N'' in a given base ''b'' is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;E(b,N) = b \lfloor \log_b (N) +1 \rfloor \,  &lt;/math&gt;

where we use the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;]] and the base-b [[logarithm]] &lt;math&gt;\log_{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

If both ''b'' and ''N'' are positive integers, then the radix economy &lt;math&gt;E(b,N)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of [[digit (math)|digit]]s needed to express the number ''N'' in base  ''b'', multiplied by base ''b''.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Third Base | author = [[Brian Hayes (scientist)|Brian Hayes]] | journal = [[American Scientist]] | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | year = 2001 | pages = 490 | doi = 10.1511/2001.40.3268 | url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2001/11/third-base | accessdate=2013-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The radix economy thus measures the cost of storing or processing the number ''N'' in base ''b'' if the cost of each "digit" is proportional to ''b''. A base with a lower average radix economy is therefore, in some senses, more efficient than a base with a higher average radix economy.

For example, [[100 (number)|100]] in [[decimal]] has three digits, so its radix economy is 10×3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;30; its binary representation has seven digits (1100100&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) so it has radix economy 2×7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;14 in base 2; in [[base 3]] its representation has five digits (10201&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with a radix economy of 3×5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15;  in base 36 (2S&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;) its radix economy is 36×2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;72.

If the number is imagined to be represented by a [[combination lock]] or a [[tally counter]], in which each wheel has ''b'' digit faces, from &lt;math&gt;0, 1, ..., b-1&lt;/math&gt; and having &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \log_b (N) +1 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; wheels, then the radix economy &lt;math&gt;b \lfloor \log_b (N) +1 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of digit faces needed to inclusively represent any integer from 0 to ''N'' (assuming all wheels must have the same number of faces each).

==Radix economy of different bases==
===''e'' has the lowest radix economy===
Here is a proof that [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] is the ''real''-valued base with the lowest average radix economy:

First, note that the function

: &lt;math&gt; y = \frac {x} {\ln(x)}\, &lt;/math&gt;

is strictly decreasing on 1 &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''e'' and strictly increasing on ''x'' &gt; ''e''. Its minimum, therefore, for x &gt; 1, occurs at [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']].

Next, consider that
: &lt;math&gt; {E(b,N)} \approx {b\ {\log_b (N)}} = {b {\ln(N) \over \ln(b)}} &lt;/math&gt;

Then for a constant N, &lt;math&gt;{E(b,N)}&lt;/math&gt; will have a minimum at [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] for the same reason y does, meaning e is therefore the base with the lowest average radix economy.  Since 2 / ln(2) ≈ 2.89 and 3 / ln(3) ≈ 2.73, it follows that 3 is the ''integer'' base with the lowest average radix economy.

===Comparing different bases===
The radix economy of bases ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be compared for a large value of ''N'':

: &lt;math&gt; {{E(b_1,N)} \over {E(b_2,N)}} \approx {{b_1 {\log_{b_1} (N)}} \over {b_2 {\log_{b_2} (N)}}}
= {\left( \dfrac{b_1 \ln (N)} {\ln (b_1)} \right) \over \left( \dfrac{b_2 \ln (N)} {\ln (b_2)} \right)} = {{b_1 \ln (b_2)} \over {b_2 \ln (b_1)}} \, . &lt;/math&gt;

Choosing ''e'' for ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives the economy relative to that of ''e'' by the function:

: &lt;math&gt; {{E(b)} \over {E(e)}} \approx {{b \ln (e)} \over {e \ln (b)}} = {{b} \over {e \ln(b)}} \, &lt;/math&gt;

The average radix economies of various bases up to several arbitrary numbers (avoiding proximity to powers of 2 through 12 and ''e'') are given in the table below.  Also shown are the radix economies relative to that of ''e''.  Note that the radix economy of any number in base 1 is that number, making it the most economical for the first few integers, but as ''N'' climbs to infinity so does its relative economy.

==Ternary tree efficiency==
One result of the relative economy of base 3 is that [[ternary search tree]]s offer an efficient strategy for retrieving elements of a database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/database/ternary-search-trees/184410528 |title=Ternary Search Trees |last1=Bentley |first1=Jon |last2=Sedgewick |first2=Bob |date=1998-04-01 |website=Dr. Dobb's Journal |publisher=UBM Tech |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar analysis suggests that the optimum design of a large [[Interactive voice response|telephone menu system]] to minimise the number of menu choices that the average customer must listen to (i.e. the product of the number of choices per menu and the number of menu levels) is to have three choices per menu.&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;

==Computer hardware efficiencies==
The 1950 reference ''High-Speed Computing Devices'' describes a particular situation using contemporary technology. Each digit of a number would be stored as the state of a [[ring counter]] composed of several [[triode]]s. Whether [[vacuum tube]]s or [[thyratron]]s, the triodes were the most expensive part of a counter. For small radices ''r'' less than about 7, a single digit required ''r'' triodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engineering Research Associates Staff |title=High-Speed Computing Devices |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1950 |pages=22–23 |chapter=3-6 The ''r''-triode Counter, Modulo ''r'' |url=https://archive.org/details/HighSpeedComputingDevices |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Larger radices required 2''r'' triodes arranged as ''r'' [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], as in [[ENIAC]]'s decimal counters.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engineering Research Associates Staff |title=High-Speed Computing Devices |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1950 |pages=23–25 |chapter=3-7 The 2''r''-triode Counter, Modulo ''r'' |url=https://archive.org/details/HighSpeedComputingDevices |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So the number of triodes in a numerical register with ''n'' digits was ''rn''. In order to represent numbers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, the following numbers of tubes were needed:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Radix ''r''
! Tubes ''N'' = ''rn''
|-
| 2
| 39.20
|-
| 3
| 38.24
|-
| 4
| 39.20
|-
| 5
| 42.90
|-
| 10
| 60.00
|}

The authors conclude,
{{quote|Under these assumptions, the radix 3, on the average, is the most economical choice, closely followed by radices 2 and 4. These assumptions are, of course, only approximately valid, and the choice of 2 as a radix is frequently justified on more complete analysis. Even with the optimistic assumption that 10 triodes will yield a decimal ring, radix 10 leads to about one and one-half times the complexity of radix 2, 3, or 4. This is probably significant despite the shallow nature of the argument used here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engineering Research Associates Staff |title=High-Speed Computing Devices |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1950 |pages=84–87 |chapter=6-7 Economy Attained by Radix Choice |url=https://archive.org/details/HighSpeedComputingDevices |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other criteria==
In another application, the authors of ''High-Speed Computing Devices'' consider the speed with which an encoded number may be sent as a series of high-frequency voltage pulses. For this application the compactness of the representation is more important than in the above storage example. They conclude, "A saving of 58 per cent can be gained in going from a binary to a ternary system. A smaller percentage gain is realized in going from a radix 3 to a radix 4 system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engineering Research Associates Staff |title=High-Speed Computing Devices |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1950 |pages=419–421 |chapter=16-2 New Techniques |url=https://archive.org/details/HighSpeedComputingDevices |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary encoding has a notable advantage over all other systems: greater noise immunity. Random voltage fluctuations are less likely to generate an erroneous signal, and circuits may be built with wider voltage tolerances and still represent unambiguous values accurately.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2380">'''Rado's theorem''' is a theorem from the branch of [[mathematics]] known as [[Ramsey theory]].  It is named for the German mathematician [[Richard Rado]]. It was proved in his thesis, ''Studien zur Kombinatorik''.

Let &lt;math&gt;A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; be a system of linear equations, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix with integer entries.  This system is said to be &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;''-regular'' if, for every &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-coloring of the natural numbers 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;..., the system has a monochromatic solution.  A system is ''regular'' if it is ''r-regular'' for all&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.

Rado's theorem states that a system &lt;math&gt;A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; is regular if and only if the matrix ''A'' satisfies the ''columns condition''.  Let ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the ''i''-th column of ''A''.  The matrix ''A'' satisfies the columns condition provided that there exists a partition ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of the column indices such that if &lt;math&gt;s_i = \Sigma_{j \in C_i}c_j&lt;/math&gt;, then

# ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
# for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be written as a rational&lt;ref&gt;Modern graph theory by [[Béla Bollobás]]. 1st ed. 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-387-98488-9}}. Page 204&lt;/ref&gt; linear combination of the ''c&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'''s in  the ''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''i''.

[[Folkman's theorem]], the statement that there exist arbitrarily large sets of integers all of whose nonempty sums are monochromatic, may be seen as a special case of Rado's theorem concerning the regularity of the system of equations
:&lt;math&gt;x_T = \sum_{i\in T}x_{\{i\}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' ranges over each nonempty subset of the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''x''}.}}&lt;ref name="grs"&gt;{{citation|title=Ramsey Theory|first1=Ronald L.|last1=Graham|author1-link=Ronald Graham|first2=Bruce L.|last2=Rothschild|author2-link=Bruce L.

'''Rafael Artzy''' (23 July 1912 – 22 August 2006) was an Israeli [[mathematician]] specializing in [[geometry]].

==Education and emigration==
Artzy was born July 23, 1912, in [[Königsberg]], [[Germany]]. His father was Edward I. Deutschlander and his mother Ida Freudenheim. Rafael studied at [[Königsberg University]] from 1930 to 1933. He transferred to [[Hebrew University]] and obtained a [[master’s degree]] in 1934. He married Elly Iwiansky on October 12, 1934. Rafael continued his studies at Hebrew University under [[Theodore Motzkin]], obtaining a [[Ph.D.]] in 1945. Elly and Rafael raised three children: Ehud, Michal, and Barak. Ehud and Barak died before their father. Michal Artzy is emeritus professor in Marine Civilization&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141204180651/http://marsci.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/maritime-civilizations-personnel Professors of Marine Civilization] at University of Haifa&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Haifa]].

Rafael served as both teacher and principal of Israel High School from 1934 to 1951. He was an instructor and assistant professor at the [[Israel Institute of Technology]] from 1951 to 1956.

==American tour==
Rafael Artzy took up a position as research associate and lecturer at [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]] in 1956. That year he also made his first  of many contributions to [[Mathematical Reviews]]. Artzy became [[associate professor]] at [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]] in 1960. The following year [[Rutgers University]] made him a full professor. In 1964 he was a visitor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=5 Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106144349/http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=5 |date=2013-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''Linear Geometry'' (1965) which was favorably reviewed by [[H. S. M. Coxeter]]&lt;ref&gt;[[H. S. M. Coxeter]] (1965) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/188842.pdf Review of ''Linear Geometry''] in [[Mathematical Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 Artzy was at [[State University of New York]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. In 1967 he joined [[Temple University]] where he was for five years.

==Return==
In 1972 Rafael Artzy returned to Israel and participated in mathematics at Technion in Haifa. He helped organize a quadrennial conference on geometry at Haifa. For instance, in March 1979 such a conference was held and the proceedings ''Geometry and Differential Geometry'' was edited by Artzy and I. Vaisman and published in Springer Lecture Notes as #792. In 1992 he published ''Geometry. An Algebraic Approach''&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Artzy (1992) ''Geometry. An Algebraic Approach'', Bibliographisches Institute, {{ISBN|3-411-15351-2}}, [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/1188640.pdf Review of ''Geometry'' by EJF Primrose]&lt;/ref&gt; Artzy had made 224 contributions to ''Mathematical Reviews'' by his last submission in 1995.

In [[mathematics]], a '''representation theorem''' is a theorem that states that every abstract structure with certain properties is [[isomorphic]] to another (abstract or concrete) structure. 

For example, 
*in algebra, 
** [[Cayley's theorem]] states that every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
**:[[Representation theory]]  studies properties of abstract groups via their representations as linear transformations of vector spaces. 
** [[Stone's representation theorem]] for [[Boolean algebra]]s states that every [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is isomorphic to a field of sets. 
**: A variant, Stone's representation theorem for  lattices states that every [[distributive lattice]] is isomorphic to a sublattice of the [[power set]] lattice of some set.
**: Another variant states that there exists a duality (in the sense of an arrow reversing equivalence) between the categories of [[Boolean algebra]]s and that of [[Stone space]]s.
** The [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] states that every [[Lie algebra]] embeds into the commutator Lie algebra of its [[universal enveloping algebra]]. 
** [[Ado's theorem]] states that every finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic zero]] embeds into the Lie algebra of endomorphisms of some finite-dimensional vector space.
** [[Birkhoff's HSP theorem]] states that every [[model (model theory)|model]] of an algebra ''A'' is the homomorphic image of a [[subalgebra]] of a [[direct product]] of copies of ''A''.
*in category theory, 
** The [[Yoneda lemma]] provides a full and faithful limit-preserving embedding of any category into a category of [[presheaves]].
** [[Mitchell's embedding theorem]] for abelian categories realises every small abelian category as a full (and exactly embedded) subcategory of a category of modules over some ring.
**[[Mostowski collapse lemma|Mostowski's collapsing theorem]] states that every well-founded extensional structure is isomorphic to a transitive set with the ∈-relation.
** One of the fundamental theorems in [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory states that every sheaf over a [[topological space]] can be thought of as a sheaf of [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]s of some (étalé) bundle over that space: the categories of sheaves on a topological space and that of [[étalé space]]s over it are equivalent, where the equivalence is given by the functor that sends a bundle to its sheaf of (local) sections.
*in functional analysis
** The [[Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction]] embeds any [[C*-algebra]] in an algebra of [[bounded operators]] on some [[Hilbert space]].
** The [[Gelfand representation]] (also known as the commutative Gelfand-Naimark theorem) states that any commutative [[C*-algebra]] is isomorphic to an algebra of continuous functions on its [[Gelfand spectrum]]. It can also be seen as the construction as a duality between the category of commutative [[C*-algebras]] and that of [[compact Hausdorff space]]s.
** The [[Riesz representation theorem]] is actually a list of several theorems; one of them identifies the dual space of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with the set of regular measures on ''X''.
*in geometry
** The [[Whitney embedding theorem]]s embed any abstract [[manifold]] in some [[Euclidean space]].
** The [[Nash embedding theorem]] embeds an abstract [[Riemannian manifold]] isometrically in a [[Euclidean space]].

In [[graph theory]], '''Robbins' theorem''', named after {{harvs|first=Herbert|last=Robbins|authorlink=Herbert Robbins|year=1939|txt}}, states that the graphs that have [[strong orientation]]s are exactly the [[k-edge-connected graph|2-edge-connected graphs]]. That is, it is possible to choose a direction for each edge of an [[undirected graph]] {{mvar|G}}, turning into a [[directed graph]] that has a path from every vertex to every other vertex, if and only if {{mvar|G}} is [[connected graph|connected]] and has no [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridge]].

==Orientable graphs==
[[File:Ear decomposition.png|thumb|An [[ear decomposition]] of a bridgeless graph. Orienting each ear as a directed path or a directed cycle makes the whole graph strongly connected.]]
Robbins' characterization of the graphs with strong orientations may be proven using [[ear decomposition]], a tool introduced by Robbins for this task.

If a graph has a bridge, then it cannot be strongly orientable, for no matter which orientation is chosen for the bridge there will be no path from one of the two endpoints of the bridge to the other.

In the other direction, it is necessary to show that every connected bridgeless graph can be strongly oriented. As Robbins proved, every such graph has a partition into a sequence of subgraphs called "ears", in which the first subgraph in the sequence is a cycle and each subsequent subgraph is a path, with the two path endpoints both belonging to earlier ears in the sequence. Orienting the edges within each ear so that it forms a directed cycle or a directed path leads to a strongly connected orientation of the overall graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gross|Yellen|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related results==
An extension of Robbins' theorem to [[mixed graph]]s by {{harvtxt|Boesch|Tindell|1980}} shows that, if {{mvar|G}} is a graph in which some edges may be directed and others undirected, and {{mvar|G}} contains a path respecting the edge orientations from every vertex to every other vertex, then any undirected edge of {{mvar|G}} that is not a bridge may be made directed without changing the connectivity of {{mvar|G}}. In particular, a bridgeless undirected graph may be made into a strongly connected directed graph by a [[greedy algorithm]] that directs edges one at a time while preserving the existence of paths between every pair of vertices; it is impossible for such an algorithm to get stuck in a situation in which no additional orientation decisions can be made.

==Algorithms and complexity==
A strong orientation of a given bridgeless undirected graph may be found in [[linear time]] by performing a [[depth first search]] of the graph, orienting all edges in the depth first search tree away from the tree root, and orienting all the remaining edges (which must necessarily connect an ancestor and a descendant in the depth first search tree) from the descendant to the ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vishkin|1985}} credits this observation to {{harvtxt|Atallah|1984}}, and {{harvtxt|Balakrishnan|1996}} credits it to {{harvtxt|Roberts|1978}}. But as {{harvtxt|Clark|Holton|1991}} point out, the same algorithm is already included (with the assumption of [[k-vertex-connected graph|2-vertex-connectivity]] rather than 2-edge-connectivity) in the seminal earlier work of {{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Tarjan|1973}} on depth first search.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this algorithm is not suitable for [[parallel computer]]s, due to the difficulty of performing depth first search on them, alternative algorithms are available that solve the problem efficiently in the parallel model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vishkin|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel algorithms are also known for finding strongly connected orientations of mixed graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Soroker|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sequential linear-quadratic programming''' ('''SLQP''') is an [[iterative method]] for [[nonlinear programming|nonlinear optimization problems]] where [[objective function]] and constraints are twice [[continuously differentiable]]. Similarly to [[sequential quadratic programming]] (SQP), SLQP proceeds by solving a sequence of optimization subproblems. The difference between the two approaches is that:

* in SQP, each subproblem is a [[quadratic program]], with a quadratic model of the objective subject to a linearization of the constraints
* in SLQP, two subproblems are solved at each step: a [[linear program]] (LP) used to determine an [[active set]], followed by an equality-constrained quadratic program (EQP) used to compute the total step

This decomposition makes SLQP suitable to large-scale optimization problems, for which efficient LP and EQP solvers are available, these problems being easier to scale than full-fledge quadratic programs.

==Algorithm basics==
Consider a [[nonlinear programming]] problem of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
\min\limits_{x} &amp; f(x) \\
\mbox{s.t.} &amp; b(x) \ge 0 \\
  &amp; c(x) = 0.
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian for this problem is&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | year=2006|url=http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/book/num-opt.html| title= Numerical Optimization| publisher=Springer.|isbn=0-387-30303-0| author=Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda,\sigma) = f(x) - \lambda^T b(x) - \sigma^T c(x),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are [[Lagrange multipliers]]. 

=== LP phase ===

In the LP phase of SLQP, the following linear program is solved:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl} 
\min\limits_{d} &amp; f(x_k) + \nabla f(x_k)^Td\\
\mathrm{s.t.} &amp; b(x_k) + \nabla b(x_k)^Td \ge 0 \\
  &amp; c(x_k) + \nabla c(x_k)^T d = 0. \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;{\cal A}_k&lt;/math&gt; denote the ''active set'' at the optimum &lt;math&gt;d^*_{\text{LP}}&lt;/math&gt; of this problem, that is to say, the set of constraints that are equal to zero at &lt;math&gt;d^*_{\text{LP}}&lt;/math&gt;. Denote by &lt;math&gt;b_{{\cal A}_k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{{\cal A}_k}&lt;/math&gt; the sub-vectors of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to elements of &lt;math&gt;{\cal A}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

=== EQP phase ===

In the EQP phase of SLQP, the search direction &lt;math&gt;d_k&lt;/math&gt; of the step is obtained by solving the following quadratic program:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl} 
\min\limits_{d} &amp; f(x_k) + \nabla f(x_k)^Td + \tfrac{1}{2} d^T \nabla_{xx}^2 \mathcal{L}(x_k,\lambda_k,\sigma_k) d\\
\mathrm{s.t.} &amp; b_{{\cal A}_k}(x_k) + \nabla b_{{\cal A}_k}(x_k)^Td = 0 \\
  &amp; c_{{\cal A}_k}(x_k) + \nabla c_{{\cal A}_k}(x_k)^T d = 0. \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the term &lt;math&gt;f(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; in the objective functions above may be left out for the minimization problems, since it is constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">In [[mathematics]], '''Siegel's identity''' refers to one of two formulae that are used in the resolution of [[Diophantine equation]]s.

==Statement==
The first formula is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{x_3 - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} + \frac{x_2 - x_3}{x_2 - x_1} = 1 . &lt;/math&gt;

The second is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{x_3 - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} \cdot\frac{t - x_2}{t - x_3} + \frac{x_2 - x_3}{x_2 - x_1} \cdot \frac{t - x_1}{t - x_3} = 1 . &lt;/math&gt;

==Application==
The identities are used in translating Diophantine problems connected with integral points on [[hyperelliptic curve]]s into [[S-unit equation]]s.

==Description==
SoaML has been created to support the following modeling capabilities:
* Identifying services, dependencies between them and services requirements
* Specifying services (functional capabilities, consumer expectations, the protocols and message exchange patterns)
* Defining service consumers and providers
* The policies for using and providing services
* Services classification schemes
* Integration with OMG [[Business Motivation Model]]
* Foundation for further extensions both related to integration with other OMG metamodels like BPDM and BPMN 2.0, as well as SBVR, OSM, ODM and others.

The existing models and meta models (e.g. [[TOGAF]]) for describing system architectures turned out to be insufficient to describe SOA in a precise and standardized way. The UML itself seems to be too general for the purpose of describing SOA and needed clarification and standardization of even basic terms like provider, consumer, etc.

A '''substring''' is a contiguous sequence of characters within a [[String (computer science)|string]]. For instance, "''the best of''" is a substring of "''It was the best of times''". This is not to be confused with [[subsequence]], which is a [[generalization]] of substring. For example, "''Itwastimes''" is a subsequence of "''It was the best of times''", but not a substring.

'''Prefix''' and '''suffix''' are special cases of substring. A prefix of a string &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a substring of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that occurs at the ''beginning'' of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. A suffix of a string &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a substring that occurs at the ''end'' of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

The list of all substrings of the string "''apple''" would be "''apple''", "''appl''", "''pple''", "''app''", "''ppl''", "''ple''", "''ap''", "''pp''", "''pl''", "''le''", "''a''", "''p''", "''l''", "''e''", "".

A substring (or factor) of a string &lt;math&gt;T = t_1 \dots t_n&lt;/math&gt; is a string &lt;math&gt;\hat T = t_{1+i} \dots t_{m+i}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;0 \leq i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m + i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;. A substring of a string is a prefix of a suffix of the string, and equivalently a suffix of a prefix. If &lt;math&gt;\hat T&lt;/math&gt; is a substring of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, it is also a [[subsequence]], which is a more general concept. Given a pattern &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, you can find its occurrences in a string &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with a [[string searching algorithm]]. Finding the longest string which is equal to a substring of two or more strings is known as the [[longest common substring problem]].

Example: The string &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt; is equal to substrings (and subsequences) of &lt;code&gt;banana&lt;/code&gt; at two different offsets:

 banana
  |||||
  ana||
    |||
    ana

In the mathematical literature, substrings are also called '''subwords''' (in America) or '''factors''' (in Europe).

Not including the empty substring, the number of substrings of a string of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; where symbols only occur once, is the number of ways to choose two distinct places between symbols to start/end the substring. Including the very beginning and very end of the string, there are &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; such places. So there are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n+1}{2} = \tfrac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; non-empty substrings.

== Prefix ==
{{see also|String operations#Prefixes}}
A prefix of a string &lt;math&gt;T = t_1 \dots t_n&lt;/math&gt; is a string &lt;math&gt;\widehat T = t_1 \dots t_{m}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m \leq n&lt;/math&gt;. A ''proper prefix'' of a string is not equal to the string itself (&lt;math&gt;0 \leq m &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;);&lt;ref name=Kel95/&gt; some sources&lt;ref name=Gus97/&gt; in addition restrict a proper prefix to be non-empty (&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; m &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;). A prefix can be seen as a special case of a substring.

Example: The string &lt;code&gt;ban&lt;/code&gt; is equal to a prefix (and substring and subsequence) of the string &lt;code&gt;banana&lt;/code&gt;:

 banana
 |||
 ban

The square subset symbol is sometimes used to indicate a prefix, so that &lt;math&gt;\widehat T \sqsubseteq T&lt;/math&gt; denotes that &lt;math&gt;\widehat T&lt;/math&gt; is a prefix of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. This defines a [[binary relation]] on strings, called the [[prefix relation]], which is a particular kind of [[prefix order]].

In [[formal language theory]], the term ''prefix of a string'' is also commonly understood to be the set of all prefixes of a string, with respect to that language.

== Suffix ==

A suffix of a string is any substring of the string which includes its last letter, including itself. A ''proper suffix'' of a string is not equal to the string itself. A more restricted interpretation is that it is also not empty{{ref|Gus97}}. A suffix can be seen as a special case of a substring.

Example: The string &lt;code&gt;nana&lt;/code&gt; is equal to a suffix (and substring and subsequence) of the string &lt;code&gt;banana&lt;/code&gt;:

 banana
   ||||
   nana

A [[suffix tree]] for a string is a [[trie]] [[data structure]] that represents all of its suffixes. Suffix trees have large numbers of applications in [[String (computer science)#String processing algorithms|string algorithms]]. The [[suffix array]] is a simplified version of this data structure that lists the start positions of the suffixes in alphabetically sorted order; it has many of the same applications.

== Border ==

A border is suffix and prefix of the same string, e.g. "bab" is a border of "babab" (and also of "babooneatingakebab").

== Superstring ==

Given a set of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; strings &lt;math&gt;P = \{s_1,s_2,s_3,\dots s_k\}&lt;/math&gt;, a '''superstring''' of the set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a single string that contains every string in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as a substring. For example, a concatenation of the strings of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in any order gives a trivial superstring of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. For a more interesting example, let &lt;math&gt;P = \{\text{abcc}, \text{efab}, \text{bccla}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\text{bcclabccefab}&lt;/math&gt; is a superstring of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\text{efabccla}&lt;/math&gt; is another, shorter superstring of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Generally, we are interested in finding superstrings whose length is small.{{Clarify|reason=why are we interested in them?|date=June 2010}}

In [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] theory, '''Sylvester's determinant identity''' is an identity useful for evaluating certain types of [[determinant]]s. It is named after [[James Joseph Sylvester]], who stated this identity without proof in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sylvester | first = James Joseph | title = On the relation between the minor determinants of linearly equivalent quadratic functions | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 1 | year = 1851 | pages = 295–305}} &lt;br&gt; Cited in {{Cite journal | last1 = Akritas | first1 = A. G. | last2 = Akritas | first2 = E. K. | last3 = Malaschonok | first3 = G. I. | doi = 10.1016/S0378-4754(96)00035-3 | title = Various proofs of Sylvester's (determinant) identity | journal = Mathematics and Computers in Simulation | volume = 42 | issue = 4–6 | page = 585 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity states that if {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} are matrices of size {{math|''m'' × ''n''}} and {{math|''n'' × ''m''}} respectively, then

:&lt;math&gt;\det(I_m + AB) = \det(I_n + BA),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'''}} is the [[identity matrix]] of order {{math|''k''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harville, David A. |title=Matrix algebra from a statistician's perspective |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-387-78356-3}} page 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weisstein |first=Eric W. |title=Sylvester's Determinant Identity |publisher=MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SylvestersDeterminantIdentity.html |accessdate=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is closely related to the [[Matrix determinant lemma]] and its generalization. It is the determinant analogue of the [[Woodbury matrix identity]] for matrix inverses.

==Proof==
The identity may be proved as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Introduction to Grids, Graphs, and Networks|first=C.|last=Pozrikidis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780199996735|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ws_RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{math|'''M'''}} be a matrix comprising the four blocks {{math|'''I&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'''}}, {{math|−'''A'''}}, {{math|'''B'''}}, and {{math|'''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;M = \begin{pmatrix}I_m &amp; -A \\ B &amp; I_n \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

Because {{math|'''I&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'''}} is [[Invertible matrix|invertible]], the formula for the determinant of a block matrix gives
:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{pmatrix}I_m&amp; -A\\ B&amp; I_n\end{pmatrix} = \det(I_m) \det(I_n - B I_m^{-1} (-A)) = \det(I_n + BA)&lt;/math&gt;.

Because {{math|'''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''}} is invertible, the formula for the determinant of a block matrix gives
:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{pmatrix}I_m&amp; -A\\ B&amp; I_n\end{pmatrix} = \det(I_n) \det(I_m - (-A) I_n^{-1} B) = \det(I_m + AB)&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\det(I_n + B A) = \det(I_m + A B)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
This identify is useful in developing a [[Bayes estimator]] for [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]]s.

The identity also finds applications in [[random matrix theory]] by relating determinants of large matrices to determinants of smaller ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/the-mesoscopic-structure-of-gue-eigenvalues/ |title=The mesoscopic structure of GUE eigenvalues &amp;#124; What's new |website=Terrytao.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir William Timothy Gowers''', {{post-nominals|size=100|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aʊ|.|ər|z}}; born 20 November 1963) is a British mathematician. He is a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the [[Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he also holds the [[Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics|Rouse Ball chair]], and is a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. In 1998, he received the [[Fields Medal]] for research connecting the fields of [[functional analysis]] and [[combinatorics]].&lt;ref name="mathgene"&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=67729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="olympiad"&gt;{{IMO results |id=11101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft"&gt;{{AcademicSearch|1517772}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Gowers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Gowers attended [[King's College School, Cambridge]], as a choirboy in the [[choir of King's College, Cambridge|King's College choir]], and then [[Eton College]]&lt;ref name="whoswho" /&gt; as a [[King's Scholar]]. He completed his PhD, with a [[dissertation]] entitled ''Symmetric Structures in Banach Spaces,''&lt;ref name="gowersphd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Timothy|last=Gowers |title=Symmetric structures in Banach spaces|publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1990 |url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8880|authorlink=Timothy Gowers}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1990, supervised by [[Béla Bollobás]].&lt;ref name="mathgene"/&gt;

==Academic positions==
After his PhD, Gowers was elected to a Junior Research Fellowship at Trinity College. From 1991 until his return to Cambridge in 1995 he was lecturer at [[University College London]]. He was elected to the Rouse Ball Professorship at Cambridge in 1998. During 2000–2 he was visiting professor at [[Princeton University]].

==Academic work==
Gowers initially worked on [[Banach spaces]]. He used combinatorial tools in proving several of [[Stefan Banach]]'s conjectures in the subject, in particular constructing a Banach space with almost no symmetry, serving as a counterexample to several other conjectures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/gowers.html 1998 Fields Medalist William Timothy Gowers] from the [[American Mathematical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Bernard Maurey]] he resolved the "unconditional basic sequence problem" in 1992, showing that not every infinite-dimensional Banach space has an infinite-dimensional subspace that admits an [[Schauder basis|unconditional Schauder basis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-1993-1201238-0|author=Gowers, William Timothy|author2=Maurey, Bernard|title=The unconditional basic sequence problem|journal=Journal of the American Mathematical Society|volume=6|issue=4|year=1993|pages=851–874|arxiv=math/9205204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Gowers turned to combinatorics and combinatorial number theory. In 1997 he proved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=W. Timothy | last=Gowers | title=A lower bound of tower type for Szemeredi's uniformity lemma | journal=[[Geometric and Functional Analysis]] | volume=7 | year=1997 | issue=2 | pages=322–337 | mr=1445389 | doi=10.1007/PL00001621}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]] necessarily comes with tower-type bounds.

In 1998 he proved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=W. Timothy | last=Gowers | title=A new proof of Szemeréi’s theorem | journal=[[Geometric and Functional Analysis]] | volume=11 | year=2001 | issue=3 | pages=465–588 | mr=1844079 | doi=10.1007/s00039-001-0332-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first effective bounds for [[Szemerédi's theorem]], showing that any subset &lt;math&gt;A \subset \{1,\dots, N\}&lt;/math&gt; free of ''k''-term arithmetic progressions has cardinality &lt;math&gt;O(N (\log \log N)^{-c_k})&lt;/math&gt; for an appropriate &lt;math&gt;c_k &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. One of the ingredients in Gowers's argument is a tool now known as the Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers theorem, which has found many further applications. He also introduced the [[Gowers norm]]s, a tool in [[arithmetic combinatorics]], and provided the basic techniques for analysing them. This work was further developed by [[Ben Green (mathematician)|Ben Green]] and [[Terence Tao]], leading to the [[Green–Tao theorem]].

In 2003, Gowers established a regularity lemma for hypergraphs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=W. Timothy | last=Gowers | title=Hypergraph regularity and the multidimensional Szemeredi theorem | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=166 | issue=3 | doi=10.4007/annals.2007.166.897 | mr=2373376 | year=2007 | pages=897–946| arxiv=0710.3032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; analogous to the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]] for graphs.

In 2005, he introduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=W.Timothy | last=Gowers | mr=2410393 | title=Quasirandom groups | year=2008 | issue=3 | volume=17 | pages=363–387 | journal=[[Combinatorics, Probability and Computing]] | doi=10.1017/S0963548307008826 | arxiv=0710.3877}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of a [[quasirandom group]].

More recently Gowers has worked on Ramsey theory in random graphs and random sets with [[David Conlon]], and has turned his attention&lt;ref&gt;http://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/what-i-did-in-my-summer-holidays/&lt;/ref&gt; to other problems such as the [[P versus NP problem]]. He has also developed an interest, in joint work with Mohan Ganesalingam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | title=A fully automatic problem solver with human-style output | eprint=1309.4501 | last2=Gowers | first2=W. Timothy | last1=Ganesalingam | first1=Mohan | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in automated problem solving.

Gowers has an [[Erdős number]] of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freeTools.html|title=Mathematical Reviews: Collaboration Distance|last=|first=|date=|website=mathscinet.ams.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Honours==
In 1996 he received the Prize of the [[European Mathematical Society]], and in 1998 the [[Fields Medal]] for research on [[functional analysis]] and [[combinatorics]]. In 1999 he became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and in 2012 was knighted by the British monarch for services to mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60173 |date=16 June 2012 |page=1 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_202133.pdf |title=Queens Birthday Honors list |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906075344/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_202133.pdf |archivedate=6 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also sits on the selection committee for the Mathematics award, given under the auspices of the [[Shaw Prize]].

==Popularisation work==
Gowers has written several works popularising mathematics, including ''Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gowers |first= Timothy |title= Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction |publisher= Oxford University Press | year=2002 |isbn= 978-0-19-285361-5 | location=Oxford | mr=2147526 | series=Very Short Introductions | volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes modern mathematical research for the general reader. He was consulted about the 2005 film ''[[Proof (2005 film)|Proof]]'', starring [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He edited ''[[The Princeton Companion to Mathematics]]'' (2008), which traces the development of various branches and concepts of modern mathematics. For his work on this book, he won the 2011 [[Euler Book Prize]] of the [[Mathematical Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/prize-booklet-2011.pdf January 2011 Prizes and Awards], [[American Mathematical Society]], retrieved 1 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blogging==
{{main article|Polymath Project}}
After asking on his blog whether "massively collaborative mathematics" was possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gowers | first1 = T. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1038/461879a | title = Massively collaborative mathematics | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7266 | pages = 879–881 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19829354 | pmc = |bibcode = 2009Natur.461..879G }}&lt;/ref&gt; he solicited comments on his blog from people who wanted to try to solve mathematical problems collaboratively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/is-massively-collaborative-mathematics-possible/|title=Is massively collaborative mathematics possible?|last=Gowers|first=Timothy|publisher=Gowers's Weblog|date=27 January 2009|accessdate=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first problem in what is called the Polymath Project, Polymath1, was to find a new combinatorial proof to the density version of the [[Hales–Jewett theorem]]. After 7 weeks, Gowers wrote on his blog that the problem was "probably solved".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=584|title=The Polymath project: scope of participation|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|date=20 March 2009|accessdate=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, with Olof Sisask and Alex Frolkin, he invited people to post comments to his blog to contribute to a collection of methods of mathematical problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/tricki-now-fully-live/|title=Tricki now fully live|last=Gowers|first=Timothy|date=16 April 2009|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors to this Wikipedia-style project, called [http://www.tricki.org Tricki.org], include [[Terence Tao]] and [[Ben J.

In 2012, Gowers posted to his blog to call for a boycott of the publishing house [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whitfield | first1 = J.| doi = 10.1038/nature.2012.10010 | title = Elsevier boycott gathers pace:Rebel academics ponder how to break free of commercial publishers | journal = Nature | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brumfiel |first1=G. |last2=Tollefson |first2=J. |last3=Hand |first3=E. |last4=Baker |first4=M. |last5=Cyranoski |first5=D. |last6=Shen |first6=H. |last7=Van Noorden |first7=R. |last8=Nosengo |first8=N. |last9=Butler |first9=D.

Commenting on the petition in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alok Jha credited Gowers with starting an [[Academic Spring]].&lt;ref name="occupyelsevier"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://the-scientist.com/2012/02/07/occupy-elsevier/ |title=Occupy Elsevier? |first=Bob |last=Grant |work=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/01/28/elseviers-publishing-model-might-be-about-to-go-up-in-smoke/ |title=Elsevier's Publishing Model Might be About to Go Up in Smoke |first=Tim |last=Worstall |work=forbes.com |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/09/frustrated-blogpost-boycott-scientific-journals |title=Academic spring: how an angry maths blog sparked a scientific revolution|author=Alok Jha |journal=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Gowers started [[Discrete Analysis]] to demonstrate that a high-quality mathematics journal could be inexpensively produced outside of the traditional academic publishing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Gowers | first=Timothy | url=https://gowers.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/discrete-analysis-an-arxiv-overlay-journal/ | title=Discrete Analysis — an arXiv overlay journal | date=2015-09-10 | website=Gower's Weblog | accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family relations and personal life==
Gowers's father was [[Patrick Gowers]], a composer; his great-grandfather was [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]], a British civil servant who was best known for guides to English usage; and his great-great-grandfather was [[William Richard Gowers|Sir William Gowers]], a [[neurology|neurologist]]. He has five children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gowers.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/status-update/ |title= Status update |publisher= Timothy Gowers |work= Gowers's Weblog |accessdate= 1 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and plays jazz piano.&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt;

In November 2012, Gowers opted to undergo [[catheter ablation]] to treat a sporadic [[atrial fibrillation]], after performing a mathematical risk–benefit analysis to decide whether to have the treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/mathematics-meets-real-life/ Mathematics meets real life], by Tim Gowers, 5 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Boron-trifluoride-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|200px|Structure of [[boron trifluoride]], an example of a molecule with trigonal planar geometry.]]
In [[chemistry]], '''trigonal planar''' is a [[molecular geometry]] model with one atom at the center and three atoms at the corners of an [[equilateral triangle]], called peripheral atoms, all in one plane.&lt;ref name=March&gt;{{cite book|first=Jerry|last=March|title=Advanced Organic Chemistry|edition=3rd}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ideal trigonal planar species, all three ligands are identical and all bond angles are 120°. Such species belong to the [[point group]] [[Dihedral_symmetry_in_three_dimensions|D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Molecules where the three ligands are not identical, such as [[formaldehyde|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO]], deviate from this idealized geometry. Examples of [[molecule]]s with trigonal planar geometry include [[boron trifluoride]] (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO), [[phosgene]] (COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[sulfur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  Some ions with trigonal planar geometry include [[nitrate]] ({{chem|NO|3|−}}), [[carbonate]] ({{chem|CO|3|2−}}), and [[guanidine|guanidinium]] ({{chem|C(NH|2|)|3|+}}). In organic chemistry, planar, three-connected carbon centers that are trigonal planar are often described as having [[orbital hybridisation|sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holleman|first1=A. F.|last2=Wiberg|first2=E.|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|date=2001|ISBN=0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=G. L.|last1=Miessler|first2=D. A.|last2=Tarr|title=Inorganic Chemistry|edition=3rd|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|ISBN=0-13-035471-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nitrogen inversion]] is the distortion of pyramidal [[amine]]s through a transition state that is trigonal planar.

'''Pyramidalization''' is a distortion of this molecular shape towards a [[tetrahedral molecular geometry]]. One way to observe this distortion is in [[pyramidal alkene]]s.&lt;ref name=March /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2926">The '''United States of America Mathematical Talent Search''' ('''USAMTS''') is a [[mathematics competition]] open to all [[United States]] students in or below [[high school]].  

==History of contest==
Professor George Berzsenyi initiated the contest in 1989 under the [[KöMaL]] model and under joint sponsorship of the [[Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology]] and the [[Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications]].&lt;ref name="website1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usamts.org/About/U_AbHist.php|title=History|publisher=USAMTS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, the USAMTS is sponsored by the [[National Security Agency]] and administered by the [[Art of Problem Solving]] foundation. There were 718 participants in the 2004-2005 school year, with an average score of 49.25 out of 100.

==Format==
The competition is proof and research based. Students submit [[mathematical proof|proofs]] within the round's timeframe (usually a month), and return solutions by mail or upload their solutions in a PDF file through the USAMTS website. During this time, students are free to use any mathematical resources that are available, so long as it is not the help of another person. Carefully written justifications are required for each problem.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usamts.org/About/U_AbOverview.php|title=Overview|publisher=USAMTS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to academic year 2010–2011 the competition consisted of four rounds of five problems each, covering all non-[[calculus]] topics.  Students were given approximately one month to solve the questions.  Each question is scored out of five points; thus, a perfect score is &lt;math&gt;4 \times 5 \times 5 = 100&lt;/math&gt;.

In the academic year 2010-2011, the USAMTS changed their format to two rounds of six problems each, and approximately six weeks are allotted for each round.

The current format consists of three problem sets, each 5 problems and lasting about a month each. Every question is still worth 5 points making a perfect score &lt;math&gt;3 \times 5 \times 5 = 75&lt;/math&gt;.

The graders also submit suggestions on possible improvements to the students' solutions with the scores.

==Prizes==

Prizes are given to all contestants who place within a certain range. These prizes include a shirt from AoPS, software, and one or two mathematical books of varying difficulty.  Prizes are also awarded to students with outstanding solutions in individual rounds. Further, after the third round, given a high enough score, a student may qualify to take the AIME exam instead of qualifying through the AMC 10 or 12 competitions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2625">'''Visibility''' in [[geometry]] is a mathematical [[abstraction]] of the real-life notion of visibility.

Given a set of obstacles in the [[Euclidean space]], two points in the space are said to be '''visible to each other''', if the line segment that joins them does not intersect any obstacles. (In the [[Earth's atmosphere]] light follows a slightly curved path that is not perfectly predictable, complicating the calculation of actual visibility.)

Computation of visibility is among the basic problems in [[computational geometry]] and has applications in  [[computer graphics]], [[motion planning]], and other areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2339">{{Calculus |Multivariable}}

In [[mathematics]]&amp;mdash;in particular, in [[multivariable calculus]]&amp;mdash;a '''volume integral''' refers to an [[integral]] over a  3-[[dimension]]al domain, that is, it is a special case of [[Multiple integral|multiple integrals]]. Volume integrals are especially important in physics for many applications, for example, to calculate flux densities.

==In coordinates==
It can also mean a [[multiple integral|triple integral]] within a region ''D'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z),&lt;/math&gt; and is usually written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint\limits_D f(x,y,z)\,dx\,dy\,dz.&lt;/math&gt;

A volume integral in [[cylindrical coordinates]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint\limits_D f(\rho,\varphi,z)\,\rho\,d\rho\,d\varphi\,dz, &lt;/math&gt;


and a volume integral in [[spherical coordinates]] (using the ISO convention for angles with &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; as the azimuth and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; measured from the polar axis (see more on [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions|conventions]])) has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint\limits_D f(r,\theta,\varphi)\,r^2 \sin\theta \,dr \,d\theta\, d\varphi .&lt;/math&gt;

== Example 1 ==

Integrating the function &lt;math&gt; f(x,y,z) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; over a unit cube yields the following result:

&lt;math&gt; \int\limits_0^1\int\limits_0^1\int\limits_0^1 1 \,dx\, dy \,dz = \int\limits_0^1\int\limits_0^1 (1 - 0) \,dy \,dz = \int\limits_0^1 (1 - 0) dz = 1 - 0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

So the volume of the unit cube is 1 as expected. This is rather trivial however, and a volume integral is far more powerful. For instance if we have a scalar function  &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} f\colon \mathbb{R}^3 &amp;\to \mathbb{R}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt; describing the density of the cube at a given point &lt;math&gt; (x,y,z) &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; f = x+y+z &lt;/math&gt; then performing the volume integral will give the total mass of the cube:

&lt;math&gt; \int\limits_0^1\int\limits_0^1\int\limits_0^1 \left(x + y + z\right) \, dx \,dy \,dz = \int\limits_0^1\int\limits_0^1 \left(\frac 12 + y + z\right) \, dy \,dz = \int \limits_0^1 \left(1 + z\right) \, dz = \frac 32&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1560">In [[geometry]], the positive and negative '''Voronoi poles''' of a [[cell (geometry)|cell]] in a [[Voronoi diagram]] are certain vertices of the diagram.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt; be the Voronoi cell of the site &lt;math&gt;p\in P&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt; is bounded then its ''positive pole'' is the Voronoi vertex in &lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt; with maximal distance to the sample point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, let &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt; be the vector from &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to the positive pole. If the cell is unbounded, then a positive pole is not defined, and &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be a vector in the average direction of all unbounded Voronoi edges of the cell.

The ''negative pole'' is the Voronoi vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt; with the largest distance to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; such that the vector &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt; and the vector from &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; make an angle larger than &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
[[File:Voronoi diagram with poles.svg|480px|Example of poles in a Voronoi diagram]]

Here &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the positive pole of &lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; its negative. As the cell corresponding to &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded only the negative pole &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; exists.

The '''weighted arithmetic mean''' is similar to an ordinary [[arithmetic mean]] (the most common type of [[average]]), except that instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than others. The notion of weighted mean plays a role in [[descriptive statistics]] and also occurs in a more general form in several other areas of mathematics.

If all the weights are equal, then the weighted mean is the same as the [[arithmetic mean]].  While weighted means generally behave in a similar fashion to arithmetic means, they do have a few counterintuitive properties, as captured for instance in [[Simpson's paradox]].

== Examples ==
=== Basic example ===
Given two school classes, one with 20 students, and one with 30 students, the grades in each class on a test were:

:Morning class = 62, 67, 71, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 79, 80, 80, 81, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 89, 93, 98

:Afternoon class = 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 87, 88, 88, 89, 89, 89, 90, 90, 90, 90, 91, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99

The straight average for the morning class is 80 and the straight average of the afternoon class is 90. The straight average of 80 and 90 is 85, the mean of the two class means. However, this does not account for the difference in number of students in each class (20 versus 30); hence the value of 85 does not reflect the average student grade (independent of class). The average student grade can be obtained by averaging all the grades, without regard to classes (add all the grades up and divide by the total number of students):

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{x} = \frac{4300}{50} = 86.
&lt;/math&gt;

Or, this can be accomplished by weighting the class means by the number of students in each class (using a weighted mean of the class means):

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac{(20\times80) + (30\times90)}{20 + 30} = 86.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the weighted mean makes it possible to find the average student grade in the case where only the class means and the number of students in each class are available.

=== Convex combination example ===
Since only the ''relative'' weights are relevant, any weighted mean can be expressed using coefficients that sum to one. Such a linear combination is called a [[convex combination]].

Using the previous example, we would get the following weights:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{20}{20 + 30} = 0.4
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{30}{20 + 30} = 0.6
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, apply the weights like this: 
:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{x} = (0.4\times80) + (0.6\times90) = 86.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Mathematical definition==
Formally, the weighted mean of a [[non-empty set]] of data

:&lt;math&gt;\{x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n\},&lt;/math&gt;
(where x represents a set of mean values)
with non-negative [[weight function|weights]]

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac{ \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_i}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i},
&lt;/math&gt;

which means:

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{x} = \frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \cdots + w_n x_n}{w_1 + w_2 + \cdots + w_n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, data elements with a high weight contribute more to the weighted mean than do elements with a low weight. The weights cannot be negative. Some may be zero, but not all of them (since division by zero is not allowed).

The formulas are simplified when the weights are normalized such that they sum up to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.:
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n {w_i'} = 1&lt;/math&gt;. 
For such normalized weights the weighted mean is then:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar {x} = \sum_{i=1}^n {w_i' x_i}&lt;/math&gt;.
Note that one can always normalize the weights by making the following transformation on the original weights:
:&lt;math&gt;w_i' = \frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n{w_j}}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Using the normalized weight yields the same results as when using the original weights:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\bar{x} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n w'_i x_i= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n w_j} x_i = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n w_j}
\\
&amp; = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[ordinary mean]] &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n {x_i}&lt;/math&gt; is a special case of the weighted mean where all data have equal weights, &lt;math&gt;w_i=1&lt;/math&gt;. 

The ''standard error of the weighted mean (unit input variances)'', &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\bar{x}}&lt;/math&gt; can be shown via [[uncertainty propagation]] to be:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \left(\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n {w_i}} \right)^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Statistical properties==
The weighted sample mean, &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;, is itself a random variable. Its expected value and standard deviation are related to the expected values and standard deviations of the observations, as follows. For simplicity, we assume normalized weights (weights summing to one). 

If the observations have expected values 
: &lt;math&gt;E(x_i )={\mu_i},&lt;/math&gt;
then the weighted sample mean has expectation
: &lt;math&gt;E(\bar{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^n {w_i' \mu_i}. &lt;/math&gt;
In particular, if the means are equal, &lt;math&gt;\mu_i=\mu&lt;/math&gt;, then the expectation of the weighted sample mean will be that value,
: &lt;math&gt;E(\bar{x})= \mu. &lt;/math&gt;

For uncorrelated observations with variances &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_i&lt;/math&gt;, the variance of the weighted sample mean is{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} 
: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_{\bar x} = \sum_{i=1}^n {w_i'^2 \sigma^2_i}&lt;/math&gt;
whose square root &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\bar x}&lt;/math&gt; can be called the ''standard error of the weighted mean (general case)''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}{{anchor|Standard error}}

Consequently, if all the observations have equal variance, &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_i= \sigma^2_0&lt;/math&gt;, the weighted sample mean will have variance
: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_{\bar x} =  \sigma^2_0 \sum_{i=1}^n {w_i'^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;1/n \le \sum_{i=1}^n {w_i'^2} \le 1&lt;/math&gt;. The variance attains its maximum value, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0^2&lt;/math&gt;, when all weights except one are zero. Its minimum value is found when all weights are equal (i.e., unweighted mean), in which case we have &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{\bar x} = \sigma_0 / \sqrt {n} &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., it degenerates into the [[standard error of the mean]], squared.

Note that because one can always transform non-normalized weights to normalized weights all formula in this section can be adapted to non-normalized weights by replacing all &lt;math&gt;w_i' = \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n{w_i}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Variance weights==
{{see also|Weighted least squares}}
For the weighted mean of a list of data for which each element &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; potentially comes from a different [[probability distribution]] with known [[variance]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i^2&lt;/math&gt;, one possible choice for the weights is given by the reciprocal of variance:

:&lt;math&gt;
w_i = \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The weighted mean in this case is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{x} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( x_i \sigma_i^{-2} \right)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^{-2}},
&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''standard error of the weighted mean (with variance weights)'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \sqrt{\frac{ 1 }{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^{-2}}},
&lt;/math&gt;

Note this reduces to &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{\bar{x}}^2 = \sigma_0^2/n&lt;/math&gt; when all &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i = \sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;.
It is a special case of the general formula in previous section,
: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_{\bar x} = \sum_{i=1}^n {w_i'^2 \sigma^2_i} = \sum_{i=1}^n {\sigma_i^{-4} \sigma^2_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The equations above can be combined to obtain:
:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{x} = \sigma_{\bar{x}}^2 \sum_{i=1}^n x_i / \sigma_i^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

The significance of this choice is that this weighted mean is the [[maximum likelihood estimator]] of the mean of the probability distributions under the assumption that they are independent and [[normally distributed]] with the same mean.

===Correcting for over- or under-dispersion===
{{further|Weighted sample variance}}
Weighted means are typically used to find the weighted mean of historical data, rather than theoretically generated data. In this case, there will be some error in the variance of each data point. Typically experimental errors may be underestimated due to the experimenter not taking into account all sources of error in calculating the variance of each data point. In this event, the variance in the weighted mean must be corrected to account for the fact that &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; is too large. The correction that must be made is

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{x}}^2 = \sigma_{\bar{x}}^2 \chi^2_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi^2_\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced chi-squared]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi^2_\nu = \frac{1}{(n-1)} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{ (x_i - \bar{x} )^2}{ \sigma_i^2 };&lt;/math&gt;

The square root &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{x}}&lt;/math&gt; can be called the ''standard error of the weighted mean (variance weights, scale corrected)''.

When all data variances are equal, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i = \sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;, they cancel out in the weighted mean variance,  &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2&lt;/math&gt;, which again reduces to the [[standard error of the mean]] (squared), &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2 = \sigma^2/n&lt;/math&gt;, formulated in terms of the [[sample standard deviation]] (squared),
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x} )^2} {n-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Bootstrapping validation==

It has been shown by [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]] methods that the following is an accurate estimation for the standard error of the mean (general case):&lt;ref&gt;Gatz, Donald F., and Luther Smith. “The Standard Error of a Weighted Mean Concentration—I. Bootstrapping vs Other Methods.” Atmospheric Environment 29, no. 11 (June 1, 1995): 1185–93. https://doi.org/10.1016/1352-2310(94)00210-C.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2 = \frac{n}{(n-1)\bar{w}^2}  \left[\sum (w_i x_i - w_s \bar{x})^2 - 
2 \bar{x} \sum (w_i - w_s)(w_i x_i - w_s\bar{x})
+ \bar{x}^2 \sum (w_i - w_s)^2 \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w_s = \sum w_i&lt;/math&gt;. Further simplification leads to

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2 = \frac{n}{(n-1)w_s^2}  \sum w_i^2(x_i - \bar{x})^2
&lt;/math&gt;

==Weighted sample variance==
{{see also|#Correcting for over- or under-dispersion}}

Typically when a mean is calculated it is important to know the [[variance]] and [[standard deviation]] about that mean. When a weighted mean &lt;math&gt;\mu^*&lt;/math&gt; is used, the variance of the weighted sample is different from the variance of the unweighted sample.

The ''biased'' weighted [[sample variance]] &lt;math&gt;\hat \sigma^2_\mathrm{w}&lt;/math&gt; is defined similarly to the normal ''biased'' sample variance &lt;math&gt;\hat \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\hat \sigma^2\ &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \left(x_i - \mu\right)^2} N \\
\hat \sigma^2_\mathrm{w} &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left(x_i - \mu^*\right)^2 }{V_1}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_1 = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i&lt;/math&gt;, which is 1 for normalized weights. If the weights are ''frequency weights'' (and thus are random variables), it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\hat \sigma^2_\mathrm{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum likelihood estimator of &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; for [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|iid]] Gaussian observations.

For small samples, it is customary to use an [[unbiased estimator]] for the population variance. In normal unweighted samples, the ''N'' in the denominator (corresponding to the sample size) is changed to ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 (see [[Bessel's correction]]). In the weighted setting, there are actually two different unbiased estimators, one for the case of ''frequency weights'' and another for the case of ''reliability weights''.

===Frequency weights===
If the weights are ''frequency weights'', then the unbiased estimator is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s^2\ &amp;= \frac {\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left(x_i - \mu^*\right)^2} {V_1 - 1}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This effectively applies Bessel's correction for frequency weights.

For example, if values &lt;math&gt;\{2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5\}&lt;/math&gt; are drawn from the same distribution, then we can treat this set as an unweighted sample, or we can treat it as the weighted sample &lt;math&gt;\{2, 4, 5\}&lt;/math&gt; with corresponding weights &lt;math&gt;\{2, 1, 3\}&lt;/math&gt;, and we get the same result either way.

If the frequency weights &lt;math&gt;\{w_i\}&lt;/math&gt; are normalized to 1, then the correct expression after Bessel's correction becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s^2\ &amp;= \frac {V_1} {V_1 - 1}\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left(x_i - \mu^*\right)^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the total number of samples is &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; (not &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;). In any case, the information on total number of samples is necessary in order to obtain an unbiased correction, even if &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; has a different meaning other than frequency weight.

===Reliability weights===
If the weights are instead non-random (''reliability weights''), we can determine a correction factor to yield an unbiased estimator. Assuming each random variable is sampled from the same distribution with mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and actual variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\text{actual}}^2&lt;/math&gt;, taking expectations we have,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E} [\hat \sigma^2]
&amp;=  \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N \operatorname{E} [(x_i - \mu)^2]} N \\
&amp;= \operatorname{E} [(X - \operatorname{E}[X])^2] - \frac{1}{N} \operatorname{E} [(X - \operatorname{E}[X])^2] \\
&amp;= \left( \frac{N - 1} N \right) \sigma_{\text{actual}}^2 \\
\operatorname{E} [\hat \sigma^2_\mathrm{w}] &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \operatorname{E} [(x_i - \mu^*)^2] }{V_1} \\
&amp;= \operatorname{E}[(X - \operatorname{E}[X])^2] - \frac{V_2}{V_1^2} \operatorname{E}[(X - \operatorname{E}[X])^2] \\
&amp;= \left(1 - \frac{V_2 }{ V_1^2}\right) \sigma_{\text{actual}}^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_2 = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i^2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the bias in our estimator is &lt;math&gt;\left(1 - \frac{V_2 }{ V_1^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;, analogous to the &lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{N - 1} {N} \right)&lt;/math&gt; bias in the unweighted estimator. This means that to unbias our estimator we need to pre-divide by &lt;math&gt;1 - \left(V_2 / V_1^2\right) &lt;/math&gt;, ensuring that the expected value of the estimated variance equals the actual variance of the sampling distribution.

The final unbiased estimate of sample variance is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s^2\ &amp;=  \frac{\hat \sigma^2_\mathrm{w}} {1 - (V_2 / V_1^2)} \\
&amp;= \frac {\sum_{i=1}^N w_i (x_i - \mu^*)^2} {V_1 - (V_2 / V_1)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Weighted-Samples.html|title=GNU Scientific Library – Reference Manual: Weighted Samples|website=Gnu.org|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[s^2] =  \sigma_{\text{actual}}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The degrees of freedom of the weighted, unbiased sample variance vary accordingly from ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 down to&amp;nbsp;0.

The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance above.

As a side note, other approaches have been described to compute the weighted sample variance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.analyticalgroup.com/download/WEIGHTED_MEAN.pdf|title=Weighted Standard Error and its Impact on Significance Testing (WinCross vs. Quantum &amp; SPSS), Dr. Albert Madansky|website=Analyticalgroup.com|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weighted sample covariance==
In a weighted sample, each row vector &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{x}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; (each set of single observations on each of the ''K'' random variables) is assigned a weight &lt;math&gt;\textstyle w_i \geq0&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the [[weighted mean]] vector &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{\mu^*}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\mu^*}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \mathbf{x}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

And the weighted covariance matrix is given by:&lt;ref name="PRICE-1972"&gt;{{cite web|author=George R. Price|url=http://www.dynamics.org/Altenberg/LIBRARY/REPRINTS/Price_extension_AnnHumGenetLond.1972.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ann. Hum. Genet., Lond, pp. 485-490, Extension of covariance selection mathematics|date=1972|website=Dynamics.org|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Sigma &amp;= \frac {\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right)^T \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right)} {V_1}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly to weighted sample variance, there are two different unbiased estimators depending on the type of the weights.

===Frequency weights===
If the weights are ''frequency weights'', the ''unbiased'' weighted estimate of the covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, with Bessel's correction, is given by:&lt;ref name="PRICE-1972"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Sigma &amp;= \frac {\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right)^T \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right)} {V_1 - 1}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Reliability weights===
In the case of ''reliability weights'', the weights are [[Normalizing constant|normalized]]:

: &lt;math&gt; V_1 = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

(If they are not, divide the weights by their sum to normalize prior to calculating &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; w_i' = \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Then the [[weighted mean]] vector &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{\mu^*}&lt;/math&gt; can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\mu^*}=\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \mathbf{x}_i.&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''unbiased'' weighted estimate of the covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is:&lt;ref name="Galassi-2007-GSL"&gt;Mark Galassi, Jim Davies, James Theiler, Brian Gough, Gerard Jungman, Michael Booth, and Fabrice Rossi. [https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual GNU Scientific Library - Reference manual, Version 1.15], 2011. 
[https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Weighted-Samples.html Sec. 21.7 Weighted Samples]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Sigma &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\right)^2-\sum_{i=1}^N w_i^2} \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right)^T \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right) \\
&amp;= \frac {\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right)^T \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right)} {V_1 - (V_2 / V_1)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reasoning here is the same as in the previous section.

Since we are assuming the weights are normalized, then &lt;math&gt;V_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and this reduces to:

: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right)^T \left(\mathbf{x}_i - \mu^*\right)}{1-V_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

If all weights are the same, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\textstyle w_{i} / V_1=1/N&lt;/math&gt;, then the weighted mean and covariance reduce to the unweighted sample mean and covariance above.

==Vector-valued estimates==
The above generalizes easily to the case of taking the mean of vector-valued estimates. For example, estimates of position on a plane may have less certainty in one direction than another. As in the scalar case, the weighted mean of multiple estimates can provide a [[maximum likelihood]] estimate. We simply replace the variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; by the [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and the [[arithmetic inverse]] by the [[matrix inverse]] (both denoted in the same way, via superscripts); the weight matrix then reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Frederick|title=Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics|year=2006|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=981-270-527-9|edition=2nd|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 \text{W}_i = \Sigma_i^{-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The weighted mean in this case is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\mathbf{x}} = \Sigma_{\bar{\mathbf{x}}} \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \text{W}_i \mathbf{x}_i\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

(where the order of the [[matrix-vector product]] is not [[commutative]]), in terms of the covariance of the weighted mean:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma_{\bar{\mathbf{x}}} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \text{W}_i\right)^{-1},
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the weighted mean of the point [1 0] with high variance in the second component and [0 1] with high variance in the first component. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1 := \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}^\top, \qquad \Sigma_1 := \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 100\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_2 := \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^\top, \qquad \Sigma_2 := \begin{bmatrix}100 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

then the weighted mean is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\bar{\mathbf{x}} &amp; = \left(\Sigma_1^{-1} + \Sigma_2^{-1}\right)^{-1} \left(\Sigma_1^{-1} \mathbf{x}_1 + \Sigma_2^{-1} \mathbf{x}_2\right) \\[5pt]
&amp; =\begin{bmatrix}  0.9901 &amp;0\\ 0&amp; 0.9901\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0.9901 \\ 0.9901\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which makes sense: the [1 0] estimate is "compliant" in the second component and the [0 1] estimate is compliant in the first component, so the weighted mean is nearly [1 1].

==Accounting for correlations==
{{see also|Generalized least squares|Variance#Sum of correlated variables}}
In the general case, suppose that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}=[x_1,\dots,x_n]^T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[covariance matrix]] relating the quantities &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the common mean to be estimated, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[design matrix]] equal to a [[vector of ones]] &lt;math&gt;[1, ..., 1]^T&lt;/math&gt; (of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). The [[Gauss–Markov theorem]] states that the estimate of the mean having minimum variance is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_\bar{x}=(\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{W} \mathbf{J})^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \sigma^2_\bar{x} (\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{W} \mathbf{X}),&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Decreasing strength of interactions==

Consider the time series of an independent variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a dependent variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; observations sampled at discrete times &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;. In many common situations, the value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; depends not only on &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; but also on its past values. Commonly, the strength of this dependence decreases as the separation of observations in time increases. To model this situation, one may replace the independent variable by its sliding mean &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; for a window size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
z_k=\sum_{i=1}^m w_i x_{k+1-i}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Exponentially decreasing weights==
{{see also|Exponentially weighted moving average}}
In the scenario described in the previous section, most frequently the decrease in interaction strength obeys a negative exponential law. If the observations are sampled at equidistant times, then exponential decrease is equivalent to decrease by a constant fraction &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\Delta&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; at each time step. Setting &lt;math&gt;w=1-\Delta&lt;/math&gt; we can define &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; normalized weights by
: &lt;math&gt;w_i=\frac {w^{i-1}}{V_1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the unnormalized weights. In this case &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; is simply
: &lt;math&gt;V_1=\sum_{i=1}^m{w^{i-1}} = \frac {1-w^{m}}{1-w},&lt;/math&gt;
approaching &lt;math&gt;V_1=1/(1-w)&lt;/math&gt; for large values of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

The damping constant &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; must correspond to the actual decrease of interaction strength. If this cannot be determined from theoretical considerations, then the following properties of exponentially decreasing weights are useful in making a suitable choice: at step &lt;math&gt;(1-w)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the weight approximately equals &lt;math&gt;{e^{-1}}(1-w)=0.39(1-w)&lt;/math&gt;, the tail area the value &lt;math&gt;e^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the head area &lt;math&gt;{1-e^{-1}}=0.61&lt;/math&gt;. The tail area at step &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\le {e^{-n(1-w)}}&lt;/math&gt;. Where primarily the closest &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; observations matter and the effect of the remaining observations can be ignored safely, then choose &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; such that the tail area is sufficiently small.
