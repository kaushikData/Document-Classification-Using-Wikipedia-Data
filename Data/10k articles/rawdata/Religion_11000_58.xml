      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">'''Alice Gurschner''' (née '''Pollak''', 8 October 1869, [[Vienna]] – 26 March 1944, [[Vienna]]) was an Austrian writer. She wrote largely under the masculine [[pen name]] '''Paul Althof'''.

== Life ==
Pollak grew up in a middle-class [[Jewish]] family in Vienna, and received private lessons in her secondary school subjects, [[music]] and [[modern languages]]. In 1897 she married the sculptor [[Gustav Gurschner]], a co-founder of the [[Vienna Secession]], and had three children by him. Some of her work was published in the Secession magazine ''[[Ver Sacrum (magazine)|Ver Sacrum]]''. Her family did not approve of her marriage to a [[Catholic]]. After the marriage, the Gurschners lived in [[Paris]] for two years. After her father's death in 1905, she converted to Catholicism and became a [[monarchist]] and an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[nationalist]].

As 'Paul Althof', she had newspaper and magazine articles published in the [[Neue Wiener Journal]], the [[Illustritre Wiener Extrablatt]], the [[Wiener Fremden-Blatt]], the [[Österreichische Volks-Zeitung]] and the [[Berliner Börsen-Courier]].

She was a member of the [[Austrian Association of Women Artists]].

{{Book of Mormon}}
In the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Ammon''' is a prominent [[Nephite]] missionary and [[Sons of Mosiah|a son of King Mosiah]]. He originally opposes the church but, along with his brothers and [[Alma the Younger]], is miraculously converted. Following his conversion he serves a mission to the [[Lamanite]]s and converts [[Lamoni]] and his people.

==Etymology==
According to [[Hugh Nibley]], ''Ammon (or Amon)'' ({{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|7|3}}) is "the commonest name in the Book of Mormon" and "the commonest name in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian Empire]]" (which embraced [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] at [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]]'s time, which fell within its [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1106&amp;index=5%20Lehi%20in%20the%20Desert|title=Lehi in the Desert; The World of the Jaredites; There Were Jaredites|last=Nibley|first=Hugh|publisher=Deseret Book, FARMS|year=1988|isbn=978-0875791326|location=|pages=|chapter=Men of the East}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name also occurs in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 19:37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and conversion==
As one of the four sons of King Mosiah, Ammon has tremendous influence among his people, the Nephites. He rejects the Church and attempts to turn the people from the teachings of the prophets. Because of the fervent prayers of their parents, Alma the Younger and the four sons of Mosiah have a conversion experience much like that of [[Paul the Apostle]]; an [[angel]] appears to them on the road and rebukes them for their wickedness. The shock puts Alma the Younger into an insensible state for a time; the specific effect on Ammon is not described, but he becomes fully converted to the Gospel and desires to serve as a missionary to the Lamanites.

==Successful mission==
Ammon and his brothers spend several years teaching the Gospel to the Lamanites.&lt;ref&gt;Alma 17-26&lt;/ref&gt; Ammon goes first to the land of Ishmael. He is captured by the Lamanites and taken before their king, Lamoni. Lamoni asks his purpose in straying so far from Nephite lands. When Ammon replies that he wants to live among Lamoni's people, the king, impressed, offers him one of his daughters. Ammon refuses but becomes a servant in the king's household, assisting others in caring for the king's flocks.

When bandits attack, Ammon directs the others to encircle the flock so they will not scatter and confronts the bandits. Fellow servants tell him they will be killed if the bandits acquire any of the flock. As he is seemingly outnumbered, the thieves attack Ammon.  From a distance he kills several with his sling and then in hand-to-hand combat cuts off the arms of every robber who attacks him.&lt;ref&gt;Alma 17: 35-37&lt;/ref&gt; Ammon's defense of the King's flock convinces the servants and the king that he is favored by God.  The king, his household, and the entire kingdom convert to the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Alma 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Ammon's love and respect for Lamoni impresses Lamoni's father, the king of all the Lamanites.&lt;ref&gt;Alma 20&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Lamanite king accepts the teachings of Aaron, Ammon's brother, and is converted. The Lamanites converted as a result of Ammon's ministry are called the "Anti-Nephi-Lehies" until they change their name to the [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|People of Ammon]] after their migration to the Nephite land of Jershon. They swear to never take up arms again (and never do), although the [[two thousand stripling warriors]] are later recruited from among their sons.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian goddess Anahit is related to the similar [[Old Persian]] goddess [[Anahita]]. Anahit's worship, most likely borrowed from the Iranians during the [[Medes|Median]] invasion or the early [[Achaemenid]] period, was of paramount significance in Armenia. Unlike Iranians, Armenians incorporated idol-worship into the cult of Anahit. [[Artaxias I]] erected statues of Anahit, and promulgated orders to worship them.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1003"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Armenian Anahit and Persian Anahita ==
According to Strabo, the "Armenians shared in the religion of the Perses and the Medes and particularly honored Anaitis".&lt;ref name="strabo11"/&gt; The kings of [[Armenia]] were "steadfast supporters of the cult"&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1007"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]], before his conversion to Christianity, "prayed officially to the triad [[Aramazd]]-Anahit-[[Vahagn]] but is said to have shown a special devotion to 'the great lady Anahit, ... the benefactress of the whole human race, mother of all knowledge, daughter of the great Aramazd'"&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1007_Agathangelos"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1007}} Cit. [[Agathangelos]] 22.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Agathangelos]], tradition required the Kings of Armenia to travel once a year to the temple at Eriza (Erez) in [[Acilisene]] in order to celebrate the festival of the divinity; Tiridates made this journey in the first year of his reign where he offered sacrifice and wreaths and boughs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agathangelos]] 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple at Eriza appears to have been particularly famous, "the wealthiest and most venerable in Armenia",&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[no title]'' 9.23.&lt;/ref&gt; staffed with priests and priestesses, the latter from eminent families who would serve at the temple before marrying.&lt;ref name="strabo11"/&gt; This practice may again reveal Semitic syncretic influences,&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1007"/&gt; and is not otherwise attested in other areas. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports that [[Mark Antony]]'s soldiers smashed an enormous statue of the divinity made of solid gold and then divided the pieces amongst themselves.&lt;ref name="plin33"&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:33.24 XXXIII.24].&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Pliny, supported by [[Dio Cassius]], Acilisene eventually came to be known as Anaïtica.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Naturalis Historia'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:5.20 V.20].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''Historia Romana'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/36*.html XXXVI.48.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Dio Cassius also mentions that another region along the Cyrus River, on the borders of [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]], was also called "the land of Anaïtis."&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Historia Romana'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/36*.html XXXVI.53.5]. Dio calls the river "Cyrnus" rather than "Cyrus".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temples dedicated to Anahit ==
In Armenia, Anahit-worship was established in [[Erzincan|Erez]], [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], [[Artashat (ancient city)|Artashat]] and [[Ashtishat]].&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt; A mountain in [[Sophene]] district was known as Anahit's throne (''Athor Anahta''). The entire district of Erez, in the province of Akilisene (Ekeghiats), was called ''Anahtakan Gavar''.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]], the temple of Erez was the wealthiest and the noblest in Armenia.   During the expedition of [[Mark Antony]] in Armenia, the statue was broken to pieces by the Roman soldiers. [[Pliny the Elder]] gives us the following story about it: The Emperor [[Augustus]], being invited to dinner by one of his generals, asked him if it were true that the wreckers of Anahit's statue had been punished by the wrathful goddess. "No!" answered the general, "on the contrary, I have to‑day the good fortune of treating you with one part of the hip of that gold statue."&lt;ref name="plin33"/&gt; The Armenians erected a new golden statue of Anahit in Erez, which was worshiped before the time of [[Gregory the Illuminator|St. Gregory Illuminator]].

The annual festivity of the month [[Navasard]], held in honor of Anahit, was the occasion of great gatherings, attended with dance, music, recitals, competitions, etc. The sick went to the temples in pilgrimage, asking for recovery. The symbol of ancient Armenian medicine was the head of the bronze gilded statue of the goddess Anahit.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

== Historians' accounts of Anahit ==

[[File:5000 Armenian dram - 1995 (reverse).png|right|thumb|5000 [[Armenian Dram]]]]

According to [[Agathangelos]], King [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Trdat]] extolls the "great Lady Anahit, the glory of our nation and vivifier ...; mother of all chastity, and issue of the great and valiant [[Aramazd]]." The historian [[Berossus]] identifies Anahit with [[Aphrodite]], while medieval Armenian scribes identify her with [[Artemis]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  According to [[Strabo]], Anahit's worship included rituals of [[sacred prostitution]],&lt;ref name="strabo11"&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11N*.html XI.14.16]&lt;/ref&gt; but later Christian writers do not mention such custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Anguttara Nikaya''' (''{{IAST|aṅguttaranikāya}}''; literally "Increased by One Collection," also translated "Gradual Collection" or "Numerical Discourses") is a Buddhist scripture, the fourth of the five [[nikaya]]s, or collections, in the [[Sutta Pitaka]], which is one of the "three baskets" that comprise the [[Pāli|Pali]] [[Tipitaka]] of [[Theravada]] Buddhism.  This nikaya consists of several thousand discourses ascribed to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and his chief disciples arranged in eleven [[nipata]]s, or books, according to the number of [[dhamma]] items referenced in them.

The Anguttara Nikaya corresponds to the [[Ekottara Agama|''Ekottara Āgama'']] ("Increased by One Discourses") found in the Sutra Pitikas of various Sanskritic early Buddhists schools, fragments of which survive in Sanskrit. A complete version survives in Chinese translation by the name ''Zēngyī Ahánjīng'' (增一阿含經); it is thought to be from either the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] or [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādin]] recensions. According to [[Damien Keown|Keown]], "there is considerable disparity between the Pāli and the Sarvāstivādin versions, with more than two-thirds of the sūtras found in one but not the other compilation, which suggests that much of this portion of the Sūtra Piṭaka was not formed until a fairly late date."&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Buddhism, by Damien Keown, Oxford University Press: 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Szyk''' (Polish: [ˈartur ʃɪk], June 16, 1894 &amp;ndash; September 13, 1951) was a Polish-Jewish artist who worked primarily as a [[book illustration|book illustrator]] and political artist throughout his career. Arthur Szyk was born into a prosperous middle-class [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Łódź]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00178831?rskey=6Ngkwk&amp;result=1 Benezit Dictionary of Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, Joseph P. Arthur Szyk: Artist, Jew, Pole. Oxford: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2004. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; in the part of Poland which was under Russian rule in the 19th century. An acculturated Polish Jew, Szyk always proudly regarded himself both as a Pole and a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921, he lived and created his works mainly in France and Poland, and in 1937 he moved to the United Kingdom. In 1940, he settled permanently in the United States, where he was granted American citizenship in 1948.

Arthur Szyk became a renowned artist and book illustrator as early as the interwar period. His works were exhibited and published not only in Poland, but also in France, the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States. However, he gained broad popularity in the United States primarily through his political caricatures, in which, after the outbreak of World War II, he savaged the policies and personalities of the leaders of the [[Axis powers]]. After the war, he also devoted himself to political issues, especially the support of the creation of the state of [[Israel]].

Szyk's work is characterized in its material content by social and political commitment, and in its formal aspect by its rejection of [[modernism]] and embrace of the traditions of [[medieval art|medieval]] and [[renaissance art|renaissance painting]], especially [[illuminated manuscript]]s from those periods. Unlike most caricaturists, Szyk always showed great attention to the colouristic effects and details in his works.

Today, Szyk is an increasingly well-known and often exhibited artist only in his last home country, the United States. However, exhibitions in Poland and Germany are familiarizing Europe with one of the most prolific artists of World War II.

== Background and youth ==
Arthur Szyk,&lt;ref&gt;The artist's birth name was Artur Szyk, but in Western Europe and the United States he is commonly known as Arthur Szyk, which is also how he usually signed his works.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Solomon Szyk and his wife Eugenia, was born in Łódź, in Russian-occupied Poland, on June 16, 1894. Solomon Szyk was a textile factory director, a quiet occupation until June 1905, when, during the so-called [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|Łódź insurrection]], one of his workers threw acid in his face, permanently blinding him.

[[File:Arthur Szyk (1894-1951). Portrait of Julia Szyk (1926), Paris.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Julia Szyk. Paris, 1926.]]

Szyk showed artistic talent as a child; when he was six years old, he reportedly drew sketches of the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Current Biography]]'', New York, 1946, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though his family was culturally assimilated and did not practice [[Orthodox Judaism]], Arthur also liked drawing biblical scenes from the [[Hebrew Bible]]. These interests and talents prompted his father, upon the advice of Szyk's teachers, to send Szyk to Paris to study at [[Académie Julian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://szyk.com/about-szyk/early-years.htm?mnHd=2&amp;mnSubHd=12 szyk.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a studio school popular among French and foreign students. In Paris, Szyk was exposed to all modern trends in art; however, he decided to follow his own way, which hewed closely to tradition. He was especially attracted by the medieval art of illuminating manuscripts, which greatly influenced his later works. When studying in Paris, Szyk remained closely involved with the social and civic life of Łódź. During the years 1912–1914 the teenage artist produced numerous drawings and caricatures on contemporary political themes that were published in the Łódź satirical magazine ''Śmiech'' ("Laughter").

After four years in France, Szyk returned to Poland in 1913 and continued his studies in [[Teodor Axentowicz]]'s class at [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Kraków]], which was under Austrian rule at that time. He not only attended lectures and classes, but he also actively participated in Kraków's cultural life. He did not forget his home city Łódź – he designed the stage sets and costumes for the Łódź-based Bi Ba Bo cabaret. The political and national engagement of the artist also deepened during that time – Szyk regarded himself as a Polish patriot but he was also proud of being Jewish and he often opposed [[antisemitism]] in his works. At the beginning of 1914, Szyk in a group with other Polish-Jewish artists and writers set off on a journey to Palestine, organized by the Jewish Cultural Society Hazamir ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: nightingale). There he observed the efforts of Jewish settlers working for the benefit of the future Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Ungar : ''Arthur Szyk : Soldier in Art'', in: ''Arthur Szyk : Drawing against National Socialism and Terror'', German Historical Museum, Berlin, 2008, pp. 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The visit was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Szyk, who was a Russian subject, had to leave Palestine, which was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at that time, and go back to his home country in August 1914. He was conscripted into the Russian army and fought at the [[Battle of Łódź (1914)|battle of Łódź]] in November/December 1914, but at the beginning of 1915 he managed to escape from the army and spent the rest of the war in his home city. He also used the time spent in the Russian army to draw Russian soldiers and published these drawings as postcards in the same year (1915).&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing against National Socialism and Terror'', German Historical Museum, Berlin, 2008, pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 1916, Arthur Szyk married Julia Likerman. Their son George was born in the following year, and their daughter Alexandra in 1922.

== Between the wars ==

=== In reborn Poland ===
[[File:Arthur Szyk (1894-1951). Rewolucja w Niemczech (Revolution in Germany), Valkyrie (1919), Łódź, Poland.jpg|thumb|In this image from the 1919 book Rewolucja w Niemczech (Revolution in Germany), a [[Valkyrie]]-like figure stands on a globe stamped with the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz).]]
After Poland had regained independence in 1918, Szyk fully developed his artistic activity, combining it with political engagement. In 1919, influenced by the events of the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], he published, together with poet [[Julian Tuwim]], his first book of political illustrations: ''Rewolucja w Niemczech'' (''Revolution in Germany''), which was a satire on the Germans, who need the [[Kaiser]]'s and the military's consent even to start a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Szyk had to take part in warfare again – during the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–1920), in which he served as a [[Polish cavalry]] officer and as the artistic director of the [[propaganda]] department of the Polish army in Łódź.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…, pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In France ===
In 1921 Arthur Szyk and his family moved to Paris where they stayed until 1933. The relocation to Paris is marked by a breakthrough in the formal aspect of Szyk's works. While Szyk's prior book illustrations were drawings in pen and ink (Szyk had illustrated six books before 1925, including three published in the [[Yiddish language]]), the illustrations for the books published in Paris were full colour and full of detail. The first book illustrated in this way was the ''[[Book of Esther]]'' (''Le livre d'Esther'', 1925), followed by [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s dialogue ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'' (''La tentation de Saint Antoine'', 1926), [[Pierre Benoît (novelist)|Pierre Benoît]]'s novel ''Jacob's Well'' (Le puits de Jacob, 1927) and other books. Those illustrations, which are characterized by a rich diversity of colours and detailed presentation, deliberately referred to the medieval and renaissance traditions of illumination of manuscripts, often with interspersed contemporary elements. Szyk drew himself as one of the characters in the Book of Esther.. The only stylistic exception is illustrations to the two volume collection of humorous [[anecdote]]s about Jews ''Le juif qui rit'' (1926/27), in which the artist returned to simple black and white graphics. (Paradoxically, the book, one of the best known of his works, met with criticism as repeating antisemitic stereotypes.) The artist's reputation was also enhanced by exhibitions which were organized by Galeries Auguste Decour (the art gallery first exhibited Szyk's works in 1922). Szyk's drawings were purchased by the Minister of Education and Fine Arts [[Anatole de Monzie]] and the New York businessman Harry Glemby.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit. '', pp. 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Szyk had many opportunities to travel for his art. In 1922, he spent seven weeks in [[Morocco]], then a [[French protectorate of Morocco|protectorate of France]], where he drew the portrait of the [[pasha]] of [[Marrakech]] – as a goodwill ambassador he received the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]] from the French government for this work. In 1931 he was invited to the seat of the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]], where he began illustrating the statute of the League. The artist made some of the pages of the statute but did not complete that work as a result of his disappointment with the policies of the organization in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== ''Statute of Kalisz'' and ''Washington and his Times'' ===
During his stay in France, Szyk maintained his ties with Poland. He often visited his home country, illustrated books, and exhibited his works there. During the second half of the 1920s, he mainly illustrated the ''[[Statute of Kalisz]]'', a charter of liberties which were granted to the Jews by [[Bolesław the Pious]], the Duke of [[Kalisz]], in 1264.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, Joseph P. "Art against Prejudice: Arthur Szyk's Statute of Kalisz." The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts 14 (1989): 47-63. doi:10.2307/1504027.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1926–1928, he created a rich graphic setting of the 45-page-long Statute, showing the contribution of the Jews to Polish society; for example their participation in Poland's pro-independence struggle, during the [[January Uprising]] of 1863, and in the [[Polish Legions in World War I]] commanded by [[Józef Piłsudski]], to whom Szyk also dedicated his work. ''The Statute of Kalisz'' was published in book form in [[Munich]] in 1932, but it gained popularity even earlier. Postcards with reproductions of Szyk's illustrations were published in Kraków around 1927. The original art was shown at exhibitions in [[Warsaw]], Łódź and Kalisz in 1929, and a "Traveling Exhibition of Artur Szyk's Works" was held in 1932–1933, displaying the Statute at exhibitions in 14 Polish towns and cities. In recognition for his work, Arthur Szyk was decorated with the Gold [[Cross of Merit (Poland)|Cross of Merit]] by the Polish government.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original paintings for the Statute are now in the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in New York City.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another great historical series Szyk created was ''Washington and his Times'', which he began in Paris in 1930. The series, which included 38 [[watercolor painting|watercolours]], depicted the events of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was a tribute to the first president of the United States and the American nation in general. The series was presented at an exhibition at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C. in 1934. It brought another decoration to Szyk – this time the George Washington Bicentennial Medal from the American government.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit. '', pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Washington and his Times'' was published in book form in [[Vienna]] in 1932. The originals of the watercolours were presented by the President of Poland [[Ignacy Mościcki]] to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1935. They are now stored at the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum]] in [[Hyde Park, New York]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''Haggadah'' and moving to London. ===
[[File:Arthur Szyk (1894-1951). Hitler as Pharaoh (c. 1933).jpg|thumb|Arthur Szyk (1894–1951). Hitler as Pharaoh, c. 1933. This sketch depicts the newly appointed Chancellor of Germany [[Adolf Hitler]] dressed as an ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]], a clear reference to the antagonist in the biblical story of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] of the Hebrew slaves from Egypt.]]

Szyk's art became even more politically engaged when [[Adolf Hitler]] took power in Germany in 1933. Szyk started drawing caricatures of Germany's Führer as early as 1933; probably the first was a pencil drawing of Hitler dressed as an ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; These drawings anticipated another great series of Szyk's drawings – the ''[[Haggadah of Pesach|Haggadah]]'', which is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. The ''Haggadah'' is a very important and popular story in Jewish culture and religion about the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] or departure of the [[Israelites]] from [[ancient Egypt]], which is read every year during the [[Passover Seder]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare the complete Hebrew and English texts of the ''Hagaddah'' on website [http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1735/jewish/The-Haggadah.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; Szyk illustrated the Haggadah in 48 miniature paintings in the years 1934–1936. The antisemitic politics in Germany led Szyk introduce some contemporary elements to it. For example, he painted the Jewish [[parable]] of the Four Sons, in which the "wicked son" was portrayed as a man wearing German clothes, with a Hitler-like moustache and a green Alpine hat. The political intent of the series was even stronger in its original version: he painted upon the red snakes the swastika, the symbol of the [[Third Reich]].

In 1937, Arthur Szyk went to London to supervise the publication of the ''Haggadah''. However, in the three years leading to its publication, the artist had to agree to many compromises, including painting over the swastikas. It is not clear whether he did it under the pressure from his publisher or from British politicians who pursued the policy of [[appeasement]] with to Germany. The ''Haggadah'' was at last published in 1940, dedicated it to King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and with a translation (of the Hebrew) and commentary by British Jewish historian Cecil Roth. The work was widely acclaimed by critics; according to ''[[The Times]]'' of London Literary Supplement, it was "worthy to be placed among the most beautiful of books that the hand of man has ever produced".&lt;ref&gt;[http://szyk.com/szyk-haggadah/ The Szyk Haggadah]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit. '' pp. 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most expensive new book in the world at the time, with each of the 250 limited edition copies of vellum selling for 100 guineas or USD$520.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York World's Fair, 1939===
The last major exhibition of Szyk's works before the outbreak of World War II was the presentation of his paintings at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], which opened in April 1939 in New York.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Pavilion prominently featured Szyk's twenty-three paintings depicting the contribution of the Poles to the history of the United States; many works specifically highlighted the historic political connections between the two countries, as if to remind the viewer that Poland remained a suitable ally in a turbulent time.. (Twenty of the images were reproduced as postcards in Kraków in 1938 and were available for sale.). In this series, Szyk depicted the contribution of the Poles to the history of the United States, and highlighted historic connections between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The German invasion of Poland found Szyk in Britain where he supervised the publication of the ''Haggadah'' and continued to exhibit his works. The artist immediately reacted to the outbreak of World War II by producing war-themed works.  One feature which distinguished Szyk from other caricaturists who were active during World War II was that he concentrated on the presentation of the enemy in his works and seldom depicted the leaders or soldiers of the Allies. This was a characteristic feature of Szyk's work till the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1940, the exhibition of his 72 caricatures entitled ''War and "Kultur" in Poland'' opened at the Fine Art Society in London, and was well received by the critics. As the reviewer of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote:

{{Quote|There are three leading motives in the exhibition: the brutality of the Germans – and the more primitive savagery of the Russians, the heroism of the Poles, and the suffering of the Jews. The cumulative effect of the exhibition is immensely powerful because nothing in it appears to be a hasty judgment, but part of the unrelenting pursuit of an evil so firmly grasped that it can be dwelt upon with artistic satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Polish War Satires : Miniatures by Mr Szyk'', in: ''The Times'', January 11, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Szyk drew more and more caricatures directed at the Axis powers and their leaders, and his popularity steadily grew. In 1940, the American publisher [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]] offered to publish a collection of his drawings. Szyk agreed, and the result was the 1941 book ''The New Order'', available months before the United States joined the war. [[Thomas Craven]] declared on the dust jacket of ''The New Order'' that Szyk:
{{Quote|…makes not only cartoons but beautifully composed pictures which suggest, in their curiously decorative quality, the inspired illuminations of the early religious manuscripts. His designs are as compact as a bomb, extraordinarily lucid in statement, firm and incisive in line, and deadly in their characterizations. (…) These are remarkable documents.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Szyk, ''The New Order'', New York, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some years later, in 1946, art critic [[Carl Clinton Van Doren|Carl Van Doren]] said of Szyk:
{{Quote|There is no one more certain to be alive two hundred years from now. Just as we turn back to Hogarth and Goya for the living images of their age, so our descendants will turn back to Arthur Szyk for the most graphic history of Hitler and Hirohito and Mussolini. Here is the damning essence of what has happened; here is the piercing summary of what men have thought and felt.}}

=== Moving to the United States and war caricatures ===

At the beginning of July 1940, with the support of the British government and the [[Polish government-in-exile]], Arthur Szyk left Britain for North America, on assignment to popularize in the New World the struggle of the British and Polish nations against [[Nazism]]. His first destination on the continent was Canada, where he was welcomed enthusiastically by the media: they wrote about his engagement in the fight with Nazi Germany, and the Halifax-based ''[[The Chronicle Herald|Morning Herald]]'' even reported about the alleged bounty Hitler had put on Szyk.&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Herald'', July 13, 1940. The information about the alleged bounty was also repeated by American media, but it is not confirmed by reliable sources.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1940, Szyk and his wife and daughter went to New York City, where he lived till 1945. His son, George, had enlisted in the [[Free French Forces]] commanded by General [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his arrival in the U.S., Szyk was inspired by Roosevelt's 1941 "[[Four Freedoms]]" [[State of the Union]] speech to illustrate the Four Freedoms, preceding [[Norman Rockwell]]'s Four Freedoms by two years;&lt;ref&gt;"Visualizing the Four Freedoms: FDR's Fighting Artist Arthur Szyk" by Allison Claire Chang, ''The Nation'', January 8, 2016 (online only)&lt;/ref&gt; these were used as [[poster stamp]]s during the war, and appeared on the Four Freedoms Award which was presented to [[Harry Truman]], [[George Marshall]] and [[Herbert H. Lehman]]. Szyk became an immensely popular artist in his new home country the war, especially after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the entry of the United States into the war. His caricatures of the leaders of the Axis powers (Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito) and other drawings appeared practically everywhere: in newspapers, magazines (including ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]] (cover caricature of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] in December 1941)'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[Collier's]]''), on posters, postcards and stamps, in secular, religious and military publications, on public and military buildings. He also produced advertisements for [[Coca-Cola]] and [[U.S. Steel]], and exhibited in the galleries of M. Knodler &amp; Co., Andre Seligmann, Inc., Messrs. Wildenstein &amp; Co., the [[Philadelphia Art Alliance]], the [[Brooklyn Museum]], the [[Palace of the Legion of Honor]] in San Francisco, and the [[White House]]. More than 25 exhibitions were staged altogether in the United States during the war years. At the end of the war, in 1945, his drawing ''Two Down and One to Go'' was used in a propaganda film calling American soldiers to the final assault on Japan. According to the ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, the posters with Szyk's drawings enjoyed even bigger popularity with American soldiers than [[pin-up girl]]s put on the walls of American military bases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Answer'', New York, September 1945, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, more than one million American soldiers saw Szyk's in reproduction at some 500 locations administered by the United Services Organization.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morton Weinstein presenting Eleanor Roosevelt with a book by Arthur Szyk - NARA - 195394.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] presented with an Arthur Szyk work in 1956. Szyk himself died 5 years earlier.]]

In recognition for his services in the fight against Nazism, [[Fascism]], and the Japanese aggression, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], First Lady and wife of President F. D. Roosevelt, wrote about Szyk several times in her newspaper column, ''My Day''.&lt;ref&gt;George Washington University, The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project, "My Day" electronic edition: https://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/myday/ Accessed May 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, 1943, she wrote:

{{Quote|...I had a few minutes to stop in to see an exhibition of war satires and miniatures by Arthur Szyk at the Seligman Galleries on East 57th Street. This exhibition is sponsored by the Writers' War Board. I know of no other miniaturist doing quite this kind of work. In its way it fights the war against Hitlerism as truly as any of us who cannot actually be on the fighting fronts today.}}

=== Social justice on the home front  ===
Though Szyk was a fierce opponent of [[Nazi Germany]] and the rest of the [[Axis Powers]], he did not avoid topics or themes which presented the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in a less favourable light. Szyk criticized the United Kingdom for its policies in the Middle East, especially its practice of imposing limits on Jewish emigration to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Despite the fact that the British government had provided for the creation of a Jewish state in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], in May 1939, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] passed the so-called [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]], which limited the number of Jewish immigrants to the Holy Land to 10,000 yearly, a policy that had tragic consequences for the Jews in Hitler-occupied Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;) Szyk also criticized the apparent passivity of American-Jewish organizations towards the tragedy of their European fellows.&lt;ref&gt;The rescue of European Jewry was personal for Szyk: his mother and his brother were in the ghettos of Łódź. (Ultimately Szyk's mother, Eugenia Szyk, and possibly her Polish-Christian companion, was murdered at the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] in 1942. See Luckert, The Art and Politics of Arthur Szyk, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the work of [[Hillel Kook]], also known as Peter Bergson, a member of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] organization [[Irgun]], who mounted a publicity campaign in American society whose aim was to draw the American public's attention to the fate of the European Jews. Szyk illustrated for example full-page advertisements (sometimes with copy by screenwriter [[Ben Hecht]]) which were published in ''[[The New York Times]]''. The artist also spoke against racial tensions in the United States and criticized the fact that the black population did not have the same rights as the whites. In one of his drawings, there are two American soldiers – one black and one white – escorting German prisoners of war. When the white one asks the black: "And what would you do with Hitler?", the black one answers: "I would have made him a Negro and dropped him somewhere in the U.S.A."&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Szyk's attitude to his mother country, Poland, was very interesting and full of contradictions. Even though he regarded himself both as Jewish and Polish and showed the suffering of the Poles (not only those of Jewish descent) in the Russian-occupied Polish territories in his drawings, even though he benefited from financial support of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] (at least at the beginning of the war), Szyk sometimes presented that government in a negative light, especially at the end of World War II. In a controversial drawing dated 1944, a group of debating Polish politicians are shown as opponents of Roosevelt, [[Joseph Stalin]], the "Bolshevik agent" [[Winston Churchill]], and at the same time adherents of Father [[Charles Coughlin]], known for his antisemitic  views, as well as "(national) democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Szyk alludes to the [[National Democracy]], a pre-war right-wing political movement in Poland, known for its nationalistic and antisemitic views.&lt;/ref&gt; and "(national) socialism." Around 1943, Szyk, a former participant in the Polish–Soviet War, also completely changed his opinions on the Soviet Union. His drawing from 1944 already depicts outright a soldier of the Moscow-supported [[People's Army of Poland]] next to a [[Red Army]] soldier, both liberating Poland.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever his political views, in July 1942 Szyk took the time to look after the family of the Polish diplomat and poet General [[Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski]] when the General committed suicide. He invited his wife [[Bronisława Wieniawa-Długoszowska]] and daughter Zuzanna to stay with his family for six weeks in the country.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Book illustrations ===

Even though caricatures dominated Szyk's artistic output during the war, he was still engaged in other areas of art. In 1940, the American publisher [[George Macy]], who saw his illustrations for the ''Haggadah'' at an exhibition in London, asked him to illustrate the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'', a collection of poems of the Iranian poet [[Omar Khayyám]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the artist started work on illustrations for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', published in 1946; he also illustrated collections of fairy tales by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (''Andersen's Fairy Tales'', 1945) and [[Charles Perrault]] (''[[Mother Goose]]'', which was not published).&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postwar: final years ==
In 1945, Arthur Szyk and his family moved from New York City to [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] where he lived till the end of his life. The end of the war released him from the duty to fight Nazism through his caricatures; a large collection of drawings from the war period was published by the Heritage Press in 1946 in book form as ''Ink and Blood: A Book of Drawings''. The artist returned to book illustrations, working for example on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and, most notably, books telling [[Bible]] stories, such as ''Pathways through the Bible'' by Mortimer J. Cohen (1946), ''The Book of Job'' (1946), ''The Book of Ruth'' (1947), ''The Ten Commandments'' (1947), ''The Story of Joseph and his Brothers'' (1949). Some of the books illustrated by Szyk were also published posthumously, including ''The Arabian Nights Entertainments'' (1954) and ''The Book of Esther'' (1974). He was also commissioned by Canadian entrepreneur and stamp connoisseur, [[Kasimir Bileski]], to create illustrations for the Visual History of Nations (or [[United Nations]]) series of stamps; though the project never came to fruition, Szyk did design stamp album frontispieces for more than a dozen countries, including the United States, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Israel.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Arthur Szyk was granted American citizenship on May 22, 1948, but he reportedly experienced the happiest day in his life eight days earlier: on May 14, the day of the announcement of the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare the memoirs of Julia Szyk, the artist's wife, who recorded her husband's reaction to that event. Her memoirs are kept by The Arthur Szyk Archives in Burlingame, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Szyk commemorated that event by creating the richly decorated illumination of the Hebrew text of the declaration. Two years later, on July 4, 1950, he also exhibited the richly illuminated text of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. The artist continued to be politically engaged in his country, criticizing the [[McCarthyism]] policy (the ubiquitous atmosphere of suspicion and searching for sympathizers of [[communism]] in American artistic and academic circles) and signs of [[racism]]. One of his well-known drawings from 1949 shows two armed members of [[Ku Klux Klan]] approaching a tied-up African American; the caption for the drawing reads, "Do not forgive them, oh Lord, for they do know what they do." Like many outspoken artists of his era, Szyk was suspected by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], which accused him of being a member of the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee]] and six other suspicious organizations. Szyk himself, however, repudiated these accusations of alleged sympathy for communism; his son George sent Judge Simon Rifkind a memorandum outlining his father's innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell. p232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Szyk died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in New Canaan on September 13, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; He was eulogized by Rabbi [[Ben Zion Bokser]], who said: {{quotation |:"Arthur Szyk was a great artist. Endowed by God with a rare sensitivity to beauty and with a rare skill in giving it graphic representation, he used his talents to create a series of works of splendor and magnificence that will live forever in the history of art. But Arthur Szyk was more than a great artist. He was a great man, a champion of justice, a fearless warrior in the cause of every humanitarian endeavor. His art was his tool and he used it brilliantly. It was in his hands a weapon of struggle with which he fought for the causes close to his heart"; and by Judge Simon H. Rifkind, who said: "The Arthur Szyk whom the world knows, the Arthur Szyk of the wondrous color, and of the beautiful design, that Arthur Szyk whom the world mourns today—he is indeed not dead at all. How can he be when the Arthur Szyk who is known to mankind lives and is immortal and will remain immortal as long as the love of truth and beauty prevails among mankind?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szyk.org/tributes.html The Arthur Szyk Society – Eulogies and Tributes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106111605/http://www.szyk.org/tributes.html |date=November 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Legacy ==
[[File:Houston Holocaust Museum Advertisement.JPG|thumb|Exhibition of Szyk's works at the [[Holocaust Museum Houston]]]]

The immense popularity Szyk enjoyed in the United States and Europe in his lifetime gradually flagged after his death. From the 1960s to the end of the 1980s, the artist's works were seldom exhibited in American museums. This changed in 1991 when the non-profit organization [[Arthur Szyk Society|The Arthur Szyk Society]] was established in [[Orange County, California]]. The founder of the Society, George Gooche, rediscovered Szyk's works and staged the exhibition "Arthur Szyk – Illuminator" in Los Angeles. In 1997, the seat of the Society was transferred to [[Burlingame, California]], and a new Board of [[Trustee]]s was elected, headed by rabbi, curator and antiquarian [[Irvin Ungar]]. The Society's work resulted in staging many exhibitions of Szyk's works in American cities in the 1990s and 2000s. The Society also maintains a large educational website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://szyk.org See The Arthur Szyk Society's website]&lt;/ref&gt; holds lectures, and produces publications on the artist. In April 2017, the Ungar collection of his work, consisting of 450 paintings, drawings and sketches, was purchased for $10.1 million by the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life]], through a donation by Taube Philanthropies, the largest single monetary gift to acquire art in UC Berkeley history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Magnes-museum-gets-big-collection-of-Jewish-art-11044902.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/04/03/gift-to-the-magnes-collection-of-jewish-art-and-life/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Bahá'í Faith]] in Hong Kong''' began during the lifetime of the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, [[Bahá'u'lláh]].

[[Hong Kong]]’s history as crown colony of the [[United Kingdom]] and then a special administrative region of the [[People’s Republic of China]] has given it a unique history – a history that has impacted the structure and growth of the Bahá'í Faith there.  Of course the cataclysm of the World Wars and other major events impacted the Bahá'í community as it did the citizenry in generally. In 2005 the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying mostly on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated the Bahá'í population of Hong Kong at about 1100.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; |publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | accessdate = 16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Period==

As a commercial center and relatively open city even in the 1870s, Hong Kong became a location where non-Chinese Bahá'ís could settle and earn a living in trade or other commercial activities.  The  first Bahá'í in China was recorded as having lived in Shanghai in 1862. in 1870, this person was joined by his brother and they established a trading company.&lt;ref name="Hassall"/&gt;

In the period 1881–1882 a nephew of the wife of the [[Báb]] resided in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong was a frequent transit hub  throughout the early 1900s for western Bahá'ís travelling to China and other parts of Asia. Among these travelers was [[Martha Root]] who started traveling  in 1924 and on several subsequent trips,she met with editors, librarians, and the president of the university. She spoke on radio, at the Hong Kong University and had several press articles in local papers.&lt;ref&gt;Garis, M.R. (1983). Martha Root: Lioness at the Threshold. Wilmette, Illinois, USA: Bahá'í Publishing Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

Association with so many Bahá'ís from other lands gave heart to the Hong Kong Bahá'í expatriate community and demonstrated to the first Hong Kong Bahá'ís the reality of the global community that they became a part of.

Charles Duncan, [[Knight of Bahá'u'lláh]] to Brunei, recorded of this period that [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] moved there and that slowly a community was built in Hong Kong consisting of longtime residents. They were of Chinese, Indian, British and Southeast Asian backgrounds. He indicated there was a constant stream of Bahá'í visitors from abroad.&lt;ref name="Hassall"&gt;Hassall, Graham (January 2000). The Bahá'í Faith in Hong Kong, Bahá'í Academic Library http://bahai-library.com/hassall_bahai_hong_kong&lt;/ref&gt;

Pei Tswi, a Bahá'í who lived in Hong Kong for a decade from the late 1920s, and Liu Chan Song, are the only Chinese Bahá'ís known to have resided in Hong Kong just prior to the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Hassall"/&gt;

==Maturity==

Starting in 1953 there was a concerted effort to establish a permanent community of Bahá'ís in Hong Kong and with dedicated efforts this was accomplished by the mid1950s.

The enrolment of four new members allowed the Hong Kong Bahá'ís to form their first Bahá'í [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assembly]] in 1956.  The Local Spiritual Assembly was registered with the Hong Kong government as a society on 29 May 1958, then incorporated in 1969. These were transferred to the National Spiritual Assembly when it was formed in 1974.  At the beginning of 1957 there were 14 members in the Hong Kong Bahá'í community.&lt;ref&gt;Datwani, Lachmi, (in collaboration with Mrs. Rose Ong). ''The Challenging years – Early history of the Bahai Faith in Hong Kong''.  (National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Hong Kong)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1957 until 1974 Hong Kong was under the administration of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia whose jurisdiction included Japan, Korea, Formosa, Macau, Hong Kong, Hainan Island and Sakhalin Island.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, Barbara R. (1991) “The Macau Bahá'í Community in the Early Years”, http://bahai-library.com/east-asia/macau/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong and Macau Bahá'í communities had a close relationship fostered by their proximity and similar circumstances.  They were jointly administered in this period until Macau established its own [[National Spiritual Assembly]] in 1989 – firstly by the Regional Spiritual Assembly, and later under the National Spiritual Assembly of Hong Kong.

By 1961 there were approximately 60 Bahá'ís in Hong Kong and three Local Spiritual Assemblies. Much of the growth was assisted by pioneers of Chinese background from the Malaysian Bahá'í community who could best help with contacts and support with the Chinese community living in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong established a Bahá'í Centre which officially opened in August 1968.  It housed the secretariat, and had live-in facilities as well as having a room for study classes and public meetings.

By 1974 there were five local assemblies in Hong Kong and the [[Universal House of Justice]] decided it was time for the Hong Kong Bahá'ís to establish a National Spiritual Assembly. The formation of the national assembly was the culmination of efforts commenced by Bahá'ís some 104 years before and a cause for great celebration in the Bahá'í communities of Hong Kong and elsewhere.

In the years since the formation of the national assembly, the Hong Kong Bahá'í community continued to expand.
By 1979 they had grown to ten local assemblies and a total of twenty-six localities. By 1991 there were twenty-two local assemblies in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Hassall"/&gt;

==Modern Community==

Despite the agreement to transfer sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997 and its designation as a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region (SAR)]] (but with the retention of many unique governmental systems for at least 50 years), the position of the Bahá'í administration in Hong Kong – its administration, membership and communities – in the context of local laws has remained unchanged. The "National" Spiritual Assembly is now referred to as the “Spiritual Assembly” or “Main Spiritual Assembly” in Chinese and still retains jurisdiction over the Local Spiritual Assemblies in Hong Kong. It is elected from the generality of Bahá'í residents in the community of Hong Kong SAR.

Like numerous communities around the world, the Hong Kong Bahá'í Community undertakes community-building activities in the Hong Kong SAR.  These consist of:   “meetings that strengthen the devotional character of the community; classes that nurture the tender hearts and minds of children; groups that channel the surging energies of junior youth; circles of study, open to all, that enable people of varied backgrounds to advance on equal footing and explore the application of the teachings to their individual and collective lives."&lt;ref&gt;Universal House of Justice, “To the Baha’is of the World”,  Ridvan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong Bahá'í Community, together with the [[Bahá'í Faith in Macau|Macau Bahá'í Community]], frequently act as liaison and contact points with the Government of the People's Republic of China since there is no administrative structure for the Bahá'í Faith operating in mainland China.

The Hong Kong Bahá'í Community has also been involved with exchanges, conferences and events with government, academic, and non-governmental organisations that explore the application of the Bahá'í teachings to the advancement of society. It also leads events and activities that promote religious and societal unity and advancement (such as the annual commemoration of World Religion Day which "call(s) attention to the harmony of the various religions’ spiritual principles and to emphasize that religion is the motivating force for world unity.")&lt;ref&gt;Baha'is of the United States website, http://www.bahai.us/world-religion-day {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228032719/http://www.bahai.us/world-religion-day |date=28 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying mostly on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated the Bahá'í population of Hong Kong at about 1100.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt;

The '''[[Bahá'í Faith]] in Jamaica''' begins with a mention by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], then head of the religion, in 1916 as [[Latin America]] being among the places Bahá'ís should take the religion to.&lt;ref name="sohrab"&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community of the Bahá'ís begins in 1942 with the arrival of Dr. Malcolm King.&lt;ref name="rites"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bridge |first=Abena |title=Divine rites - Uncovering the faiths |newspaper=Jamaican Gleaner News |pages= |date=2000-07-05 |url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20000705/News/News1.html |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913045219/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20000705/News/News1.html |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of [[Jamaica]], in Kingston, was elected in 1943.&lt;ref name="60th"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Joyous festivities in Jamaica | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | pages = | date = 2003-07-25 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/233 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957 the Bahá'ís of Jamaica were organized under the regional National Spiritual Assembly of the [[Greater Antilles]], and on the eve of national independence in 1962, the Jamaica Bahá'ís elected their own National Spiritual Assembly in 1961.&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{Cite web | title = National Spiritual Assemblies Statistics

== Early phase ==

`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to [[Mexico]] and [[South America]] near or before this unveiling in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and [[Hands of the Cause#Appointed posthumously by Shoghi Effendi|Roy C. Wilhelm]], and [[Martha Root]]. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref name="sohrab" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Christ Holiness says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the [[Kingdom of God]].…(travel to) the Islands of the West Indies, such as [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]], the Islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]], [[Bahama Islands]], even the small [[Watling Island]], have great importance…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0877432333 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-6.html.iso8859-1?#gr10 | pages = 31–36 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades ===

[[Shoghi Effendi]] wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |origyear = |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal | pages = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan'' (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.

=== Establishment ===

After a brief visit in 1939 by John and Rosa Shaw from San Francisco,&lt;ref name="basic"&gt;{{cite book

The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Jamaica, in Kingston, was elected in 1943.&lt;ref name="60th" /&gt; Mitchell was the Jamaican delegate to the Bahá'í All-America Convention called for by [[Shoghi Effendi]], then head of the religion, to be held in the United States May 17–24, 1944 on the centenary of the declaration of the [[Báb]].&lt;ref name="alamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bahá'í Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell in turn taught the religion to Julius Edwards, associated with Garvey and later [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneered]] to the area now called [[Ghana]] in 1953 and later in [[Bahá'í Faith in Liberia|Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie" /&gt; There was also Eustace Whyte among the early Bahá'ís of Jamaica who served as president of UNIA's Harmony Division in Kingston as well as elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Kingston.&lt;ref name="Carnegie" /&gt; Garvey scholar Robert Hill gave a eulogy at one of Whyte's funeral services.&lt;ref name="Carnegie" /&gt;

== Growth ==

[[File:JamaicaOMC.png|thumb|450px|right|Jamaica parishes and towns]]From the early period of development the Bahá'í community in Jamaica grew in organization and in relationship with the wider community while growing internally as well. Before national independence, the Jamaicans were part of a regional National Spiritual Assembly of the [[Greater Antilles]] from 1957 through 1961 and on the eve of national independence in 1962, the Jamaica Bahá'ís elected their own National Spiritual Assembly in 1961&lt;ref name="notes" /&gt; with [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Enoch Olinga]] representing the [[Bahá'í International Community]].&lt;ref name="xviii" /&gt; In 1963 there were Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] in 6 cities:&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#19 | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963| author = Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | pages = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annatto Bay, [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[May Pen]], [[Port Antonio]], [[Spanish Town]], and [[Yallahs]] and smaller groups of Bahá'ís in Bartons ([[Saint Catherine Parish|St. Catherine]]), [[Crooked River, Jamaica|Crooked River]], [[Montego Bay]], and [[Porus, Jamaica|Porus]].

In 1963 the Bahá'ís of the world looked to the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]] as the new head of the religion. The electors were the members of the national assemblies then in existence. The members of the Jamaican National Assembly who participated in the election were Miss Doris Maud Buchanan, Mr. Randolph Fitz-Henley, Miss Alice Maude Gallier, Mr. Wm. Arthur Wellesley Mitchell, Mr. Alfred Senior, Miss Emily Taylor, Miss Ruby Taylor, Mr. Clarence Ullrich, Mrs. Margarite Ullrich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Rabbani, R. |editor-link=Rúhíyyih Khanum |year = 1992 |title = The Ministry of the Custodians 1957-1963 |publisher = Bahá'í World Centre |isbn = 085398350X

She was received by the Governor General and Prime Minister while over two hundred Bahá'ís attended a weekend conference and more non-Bahá'ís attended a public meeting. A twenty-minute television interview as well as general coverage by radio and television reporters highlighted her visit.&lt;ref name="xviii" /&gt;

Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith" | publisher = Bahai-library.com | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon | first = Geeta Gandhi | title = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory" /&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion |issue= 1 | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8 |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1985 the Bahá'í International Community canvassed the National Assemblies with a questionnaire - 77 of the 143 then existing assemblies responded. Jamaican responses highlighted a sense that women in Jamaica were taking on leadership positions on local assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |author=Bahá'í International Community |author-link=Bahá'í International Community |title=Activities in the Bahá'í World Community to Improve the Status of Women during the United Nations Decade for Women |url=http://bahai-library.com/bic_women_decade_status |conference=World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality, Development and Peace |year=1985 |place=Nairobi, Kenya |publisher=Bahá'í International Community}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former assistant to the dean of the school of engineering and applied science at [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis]], Naomi McCord, and her husband served as caretakers of the National Bahá'í Center in Kingston for a number of years. McCord willed more than 200 volumes from her personal library to the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Ann Moore | first = Waveney | title = Naomi McCord, 83, Baha'i teacher | newspaper = St. Petersburg Times | pages = | date = 2005-01-26 | url =http://www.sptimes.com/2005/01/26/Neighborhoodtimes/Naomi_McCord__83__Bah.shtml | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a first step in relation to the general Jamaican community, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Jamaica was a founding member of the Jamaican Interfaith Council in 1992.&lt;ref name="4th" /&gt;

The '''Bishop of [[Turku]]''' ('''''episcopus Aboensis''''') was the medieval Christian religious leader of [[Finland]].

Influenced by [[papal bull]]s Swedish magnates in the 12th century set up [[crusades|crusade]] expeditions to convert the heathens in the eastern [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. This resulted in the establishment of the [[Roman Catholicism in Finland|Catholic Church]], the [[Christian]] religion and the [[First Swedish Crusade|Swedish conquest of Finland]]. [[Turku]], or ''Aboa'', ''Åbo'', became the principal city in Finland and site of a bishopric.

The [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century made the Catholic Church give way to the [[Church of Sweden|Lutheran state church]] established by King [[Gustav I of Sweden]], whose principal reformer in Finland was [[Mikael Agricola]] and from 1554 also the bishop. See [[Lutheran Diocese of Turku]].

With the creation of the Finnish state at the [[Diet of Porvoo]] in 1809, the Bishop of Turku was elevated to the position of the archbishop of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], as the [[Archbishop of Turku]].

'''Buddhism in Italy''' is the third most spread religion, next to Christianity and Islam. According to [[Caritas Italiana]], in the country there are 160,000 Buddhists,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071129184319/http://www.db.caritas.glauco.it/caritastest/informiamoci/Riviste_e_pubblicazioni/Sussidi2007/Libri/dossierimmigrazione2007/materiale/panorama_multireligioso.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that is to say the 0.3% of the total population.

==History==
The Buddhist presence in Italy begins to be known in the 1960s, with the first attempts to ground some Buddhist centers. Between the oldest we can count the one of Engaku Taino and the Fudenji of Taiten Guareschi, disciple of Taisen Deshimaru. In 1960 is founded the Buddhist Italian Association (Associazione Buddhista Italiana) and in 1967 begins the publishing of the review Buddhismo Scientifico.

From the years 1984-1989, the [[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition]] of [[Thubten Yeshe]] and [[Thubten Zopa Rinpoche]] was based at the [[Istituto Lama Tzong Khapa]] in the Tuscan village of [[Pomaia]].

The [[Italian Buddhist Union]], member of the [[European Buddhist Union]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-b-u.org/italian-buddhist-union.html Unione Buddhista Italiana] at [[European Buddhist Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in Milan in 1985,&lt;ref name="ente"&gt;[http://www.buddhismo.it/ente.htm Unione Buddhista Italiana: l'Ente]&lt;/ref&gt; received recognition by the President of the Italian Republic in 1991 and signed an agreement with the [[Council of Ministers (Italy)|Italian government]] in 2007, in accordance with article 8 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] (which regulates the relations with religious minorities), and the agreement became law in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://presidenza.governo.it/USRI/confessioni/intese_indice.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2012;245&lt;/ref&gt;

The UBI is acknowledged as an association with juridical figure and coordinates the 44 principal centers in Italy in the tradition Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana which hold the practice and the sharing of the traditional teaching. 
Between the most important Buddhist centers of Italy we can note the Soto Zen center "L'Arco", in Rome, the already citated Scaramuccia of Engaku Taino, in Orvieto; even in Rome, the lay association laica A.Me.Co for the practice of Theravada buddhism, founded and directed by the lay dharma teacher Corrado Pensa, and near to the theravada monastery of the Forest's Sangha; In Milan, the biggest zen center is the zen monastery [[Ensoji il Cerchio]], founded and guided by the zen master Testugen Serra; in Pomaia, the Tibetan Buddhism finds one of the biggest center in Europe, the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute. The [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism is represented, among others, by the centers of the [[Diamond Way Buddhism]] of the [[Kagyu]] school, spread in almost all the Italian regions.

Even the Japanese Buddhist school founded by [[Nichiren|Nichiren Daishonin]]  sees in the UBI his representance: the temple of the [[Nichiren-shū|Nichiren Shu]] Renkoji, in Cereseto, near Novara, guided by the master Shoryo Tarabini, and the association Nipponzan Myohonji, which provided to the grounding of the biggest stupa in Italy, the Peace Pagoda in Comiso ([[Sicily]]). In 2014 also [[Honmon Butsuryū-shū]], or HBS, with its Kofuji temple in Florence, has become part of UBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.buddhismo.it/i-centri/per-regione/toscana/firenze/|title = HBS as an U.B.I. center|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the SGI-Italy ([[Soka Gakkai Italian Buddhist Institute]]) was recognized by the Italian government with a special accord under [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] Article 8, acknowledging it as an [[Religion in Italy#Freedom of religion|official religion of Italy]] and eligible to receive direct taxpayer funding for its religious and social activities. It also recognizes the Soka Gakkai as a "Concordat" (It: "Intesa") that grants the religions status in "a special 'club' of denominations consulted by the government in certain occasions, allowed to appoint chaplains in the army - a concordat is not needed for appointing chaplains in hospitals and jails - and, perhaps more importantly, to be partially financed by taxpayers' money." Eleven other religious denominations share this status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Introvigne |first1=Massimo |title=Italy signs Concordat with Soka Gakkai |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2015/intesa_soka.html|website=Cesnur.org |publisher=[[CESNUR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = berkley&gt;{{cite web | url = http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/religion-in-the-italian-constitution | title = Religion in the Italian Constitution | publisher = Georgetown University | accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = italy&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/USRI/confessioni/intese_indice.html | title = Istituto Buddista Italiano Soka Gakkai | publisher = Governo Italiano | accessdate = 14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No written record exists about the early Buddhism in the Philippines. The recent archaeological discoveries and the few scant references in the other nations’s historical records can tell, however, about the existence of Buddhism from the 9th century onward in the islands. These records mention the independent states that comprise the Philippines and which show that they were not united as one country in the early days.

The Philippines’s early states must have become the tributary states of the powerful Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] empire that controlled the trade and its sea routes from the 6th century to the 13th century in Southeast Asia. The states’s trade contacts with the empire long before or in the 9th century must have served as the conduit for introducing Vajrayana Buddhism to the islands.

Both Srivijaya empire in [[Sumatra]] and [[Majapahit]] empire in [[Java]] were unknown in history until 1918 when the Ecole Francaise d’Extreme Orient’s [[George Coedes]] postulated their existence because they had been mentioned in the records of the Chinese Tang and Sung imperial dynasties. [[Ji Ying]], a Chinese monk and scholar, stayed in Sumatra from 687 to 689 on his way to India. He wrote on the Srivijaya’s splendour, "Buddhism was flourishing throughout the islands of Southeast Asia. Many of the kings and the chieftains in the islands in the southern seas admire and believe in Buddhism, and their hearts are set on accumulating good action."

Both empires replaced their early [[Theravada]] Buddhist religion with Vajrayana Buddhism in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philippinebuddhism.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/early-buddhism-in-the-philippines/|title=Early Buddhism in the Philippines|first=|last=filipinobuddhism|date=8 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Srivijaya empire flourished as a Buddhist cultural centre over 600 years from 650 to 1377 in Palembang, Sumatra. Built as a mandala on a hill from 770 to 825 in central Java, the [[Borobodur]] stands today as the living testament of the Srivijaya empire’s grandeur. Three generations of the Sailendra kings built the temple that displays a three-dimensional view of the Vajrayana Buddhist cosmology. Later on, the Javanese Majapahit empire took control over the Srivijaya and became the leading Buddhist cultural centre from 1292 to 1478 in Southeast Asia.

Ritual practice rather than meditation makes Vajrayana Buddhism distinct from the other forms of Buddhism. Vajrayana Buddhism was also known as Tantric Buddhism and Mantrayana, the esoteric teaching, which was conveyed only by a master to a disciple through initiation or empowerment. Vajrayana means Adamantine Vehicle or Diamond Vehicle that shows the way to awaken the Enlightenment. [[Mantrayana]] comes from the word mantra, which means words (incantation, spell, oath) of special vibrations. Mantrayana makes use of upaya or skillful means, such as the mantra and the mandala. They serve as aids to mind cultivation.

The Mantrayana practitioner visualizes the mind as a mandala that expresses the mind’s innate nature as the ahistorical Buddha or Enlightenment, which means the Absolute in its emptiness and which has no beginning and no end. he mind is its sacred dwelling place. The Mantrayana practitioner sees her/himself as divine because, according to the Mahayana Buddhist perspective, their mind has been endowed with the ahistorical Buddha or Enlightenment nature. It is also known as the Dharma nature, the eternal law that governs the universe.

===Archaeological evidence===

The Philippines’s archaeological finds include a few of Buddhist artifacts, most of them dated to the 9th century. The artifacts reflect the iconography of the Srivijaya empire’s [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and its influences on the Philippines’s early states. The artifacts’s distinct features point to their production in the islands and they hint at the artisans’s or goldsmiths’s knowledge of the Buddhist culture and the Buddhist literature because the artisans have made these unique works of Buddhist art. The artifacts imply also the presence of the Buddhist believers in the places where these artifacts turned up. These places extended from the Agusan-Surigao area in Mindanao island to [[Cebu]], [[Palawan]], and [[Luzon]] islands. Hence, [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] must have spread far and wide throughout the archipelago. And Vajrayana Buddhism must have become the religion of the majority of the inhabitants in the islands.

In 1225, China's [[Zhao Rugua]], a [[wikt:superintendent|superintendent]] of maritime trade in [[Fujian|Fukien]] province wrote the book entitled ''Zhu Fan Zhi'' ({{zh|c=諸番志|l="Account of the Various Barbarians"}}) in which he described trade with a country called [[Ma-i]] in the island of [[Mindoro]] in [[Luzon]],(pronounced "Ma-yi") which was a prehispanic Philippine state. In it he said:

{{Quote|The country of Mai is to the north of [[Borneo]]. The [[natives]] live in large [[villages]] on the opposite banks of a stream and cover themselves with a cloth like a sheet or hide their bodies with a loin cloth. There are metal images of [[Buddhas]] of unknown origin scattered about in the tangled wilds.}}.&lt;ref&gt;Prehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"The gentleness of Tagalog customs that the first Spaniards found, very lfferent from those of other provinces of the same race and in Luzon itself, can very well be the effect of Buddhism "There are [[copper]] Buddha's" images.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political and Historical Writings (Vol. 7) | publisher=National Historical Institute | author=Rizal, Jose | year=2000 | location=Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gold statue of the deity [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] is the most significant Buddhist artifact. In the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, Tara symbolizes the Absolute in its emptiness as the wisdom heart’s essence that finds its expression through love and through compassion. The Vajrayana tradition also tells about the outpouring of the human heart’s compassion that manifests Tara and about the fascinating story of the Bodhisattva of Compassion shedding a tear out of pity for the suffering of all sentient beings when he hears their cries. The tear created a lake where a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] flower emerges. It bears Tara who relieves their sorrow and their pain.

The Golden Tara was discovered in 1918 in Esperanza, Agusan and it has been kept in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago, Illinois since the 1920s. [[Henry Otley Beyer]], the Philippines’s pioneer anthropologist-archaeologist, and some experts have agreed on its identity and have dated it to belong within 900-950 CE, which covers the Sailendra period of the Srivijaya empire. They can not place, however, the Golden Tara’s provenance because it has distinct features.

In the archipelago that was to become the Philippines, the statues of the Hindu gods were hidden to prevent their destruction by a religion which destroyed all [[cult image]]s. One statue, a "Golden Tara", a 4-pound gold statue of a Hindu-Malayan goddess, was found in [[Mindanao]] in 1917. The statue, denoted the ''Agusan Image'', is now in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]], Chicago. The image is that of a Hindu-Malayan female deity, seated cross-legged. It is made of "twenty-one carat gold and weighs nearly four pounds." It has a richly ornamented headdress and many ornaments in the arms and other parts of the body. Scholars date it to the late 13th or early 14th century. It was made by local artists, perhaps copying from an imported Javanese model. The gold that was used was from this area, since Javanese miners were known to have been engaged in gold mining in [[Butuan]] at this time.

The existence of these gold mines, this artefact and the presence of "foreigners" proves the existence of some foreign trade, gold as element in the barter economy, and of cultural and social contact between the natives and "foreigners." As previously stated, this statue is not in The Philippines. Louise Adriana Wood (whose husband, [[Leonard Wood]], was military-governor of the Moro Province in 1903-1906 and governor general in 1921-1927) raised funds for its purchase by the Chicago Museum of Natural History. It is now on display in that museum's Gold Room.

According to Prof. Beyer, considered the "Father of Philippine Anthropology and Archaeology", a woman in 1917 found it on the left bank of the Wawa River near Esperanza, Agusan, projecting from the silt in a ravine after a storm and flood. From her hands it passed into those of Bias Baklagon, a local government official. Shortly after, ownership passed to the Agusan Coconut Company, to whom Baklagon owed a considerable debt. Mrs. Wood bought it from the coconut company.

The Philippines's archaeological finds include many ancient gold artifacts. Most of them have been dated to belong to the 9th century iconography of the Srivijaya empire. The artifacts’s distinct features point to their production in the islands. It is probable that they were made locally because archaeologist Peter Bellwood discovered the existence of an ancient goldsmith’s shop that made the 20-centuries-old lingling-o, or omega-shaped gold ornaments in Batanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino |title=The Indian in the Filipino |first=Sunita |last=Khatnani |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621051322/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino |archivedate=21 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological finds include Buddhist artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus Peralta, "Prehistoric Gold Ornaments CB Philippines," Arts of Asia, 1981, 4:54-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2008/04/26/going-for-the-gold.html Art Exhibit: Philippines' 'Gold of Ancestors'] in [[Newsweek]].&lt;/ref&gt; The style are of [[Vajrayana]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Legeza, "Tantric Elements in Pre-Hispanic Gold Art," Arts of Asia, 1988, 4:129-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="camperspoint"&gt;[http://www.camperspoint.com/article.php3?id_article=239 Camperspoint: History of Palawan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115190428/http://www.camperspoint.com/article.php3?id_article=239# |date=15 January 2009 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9758">{{Priesthoods of ancient Rome}}
The '''College of Pontiffs''' ([[Latin]]: ''Collegium Pontificum''; see ''[[collegium]]'') was a body of the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] state whose members were the highest-ranking priests of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|state religion]].  The college consisted of the [[Pontifex Maximus]] and the other ''pontifices'', the ''[[Rex Sacrorum]]'', the fifteen [[flamen]]s, and the [[Vestals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], "Communicating with the Gods," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', (Blackwell, 2010), p. 226; [[John A. North]], "The Constitution of the Roman Republic," in the same volume, p. 268 (a table showing priestly roles of Roman religion, including assignment to colleges).&lt;/ref&gt; The College of [[Pontiff]]s was one of the four major priestly colleges; originally their responsibility was limited to supervising both public and private sacrifices, but as time passed their responsibilities increased.&lt;ref&gt;Martha W. Hoffman Lewis, ''The Official Priests of Rome under the Julio-Claudians'' (Rome: American Academy, 1955), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The other colleges were the [[augurs]] (who read omens), the ''[[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]] '' ("fifteen men who carry out the rites"), and the [[Epulones]] (who set up feasts at festivals).

The title ''[[pontiff|pontifex]]'' comes from the Latin for "bridge builder", a possible allusion to a very early role in placating the gods and spirits associated with the [[Tiber River]], for instance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/7Cnuma.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Varro cites this position as meaning "able to do".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xQd82l39KX4C&amp;pg=PA195 Religions of Rome, Vol. 2, pg 195]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''pontifex maximus'' was the most important member of the college.  Until 104 BC, the ''pontifex maximus'' held the sole power in appointing members to the other priesthoods in the college.

The flamens were priests in charge of fifteen official cults of Roman religion, each assigned to a particular god.  The three major flamens ''([[flamines maiores]])'' were the [[Flamen Dialis]], the high priest of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]; the [[Flamen Martialis]], who cultivated [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]; and the [[Flamen Quirinalis]], devoted to [[Quirinus]]. The deities cultivated by the twelve ''[[flamines minores]]'' were [[Carmenta]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Falacer]], [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], [[Furrina]], [[Palatua]], [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]], [[Portunus (mythology)|Portunus]], [[Vulcan (mythology)|Volcanus]] (Vulcan), [[Volturnus]], and two whose names are lost.

The Vestal Virgins were the only female members of the college.  They were in charge of guarding Rome's sacred hearth, keeping the flame burning inside the Temple of Vesta.  Around age 6 to 10, girls were chosen for this position and were required to perform the rites and obligations, including remaining chaste, for 30 years.

==Membership==

Membership in the various colleges of priests, including the College of Pontiffs, was usually an honor offered to members of politically powerful or wealthy families.  Membership was for life, except for the [[Vestal Virgin]]s whose term was 30 years.  In the early Republic, only [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]s could become priests.  However, the ''[[Lex Ogulnia]]'' in 300 BC granted the right to become ''pontifices'' and ''augures'' to [[plebeian]]s. Nevertheless, even in the late Republic it was still believed that the auspices ultimately resided with patrician magistrates, and certain ancient priesthoods: the ''rex sacrorum'', the ''Dialis'', ''Martialis'' and '' Quirinalis flamines'', and the college of the ''Salii'' were never opened to the plebeians.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman Lewis, ''The Official Priests of Rome'', pp. 8f&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of members in the college of pontiffs grew over time. Originally consisting of three members, the number was increased to nine by the third century BC; Sulla increased the number to fifteen; Augustus increased the number even further, perhaps to as many as 25.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman Lewis, ''The Official Priests of Rome'', pp. 9f, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 3rd century BC, the college elected the ''pontifex maximus'' from their own number. The right of the college to elect their ''own pontifex maximus'' was returned, but the circumstances surrounding this are unclear. This changed again after Sulla, when in response to his reforms, the election of the ''pontifex maximus'' was once again placed in the hands of an assembly of seventeen of the twenty-five tribes. However, the college still controlled which candidates the assembly voted on. During the Empire, the office was publicly elected from the candidates of existing pontiffs, until the Emperors began to automatically assume the title, following [[Julius Caesar]]’s example.  The ''pontifex maximus'' was a powerful political position to hold and the candidates for office were often very active political members of the college.  Many, such as Julius Caesar, went on to hold [[consul]]ships during their time as ''pontifex maximus''.

However, after 44 BC the Pontiffs, as with the other official priests of Rome, lost their political influence. [[Martha Hoffman Lewis]] could only find four instances where the pontiff's advice was asked: before Augustus' marriage to Livia; in 37 BC when they ordered the removal of the body of one of the proscribed from the Campus; they made expiatory sacrifices on the day the emperor Claudius married Agrippina; and their advice was sought concerning reforms of the discipline of the [[haruspices]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman Lewis, ''The Official Priests of Rome'', p. 17 n. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the Roman State==
During the [[Roman Kingdom|Kingdom]] of Roman history, the pontiffs were primarily [[concilia]] (advisers) of the kings, but after the expulsion of [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|the last Roman King]] in 510 BC, the College of Pontiffs became religious advisers to the [[Roman Senate]].  As the most important of the four priestly colleges, the college of pontiffs’ duties involved advising the senate on issues pertaining to the gods, the supervision of the calendar and thus the supervision of ceremonies with their specific rituals, and the appeasement of the gods upon the appearance of [[omen|prodigies]].

One of their most important duties was their guardianship of the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|libri pontificales]]'' (pontifical books). Among these were the ''acta'', ''[[indigitamenta]]'' (lists of invocations or names of deities), ''ritualia'', ''commentarii'', ''fasti'', and ''annales'' (yearly records of magistrates and important events).  These items were under the sole possession of the college of pontiffs and only they were allowed to consult these items when necessary.

The ''[[Lex Acilia]]'' bestowed power on the college to manage the calendar. Thus, they determined the days which religious and political meetings could be held, when sacrifices could be offered, votes cast, and senatorial decisions brought forth.

The College of Pontiffs came to occupy the [[Regia]] (the old palace of the kings) during the early [[Roman Republic|Republican Period]]. They came to replace the religious authority that was once held by the king. A position, the [[Rex Sacrorum]], was even created to replace the king for purposes of religious ceremonies.

When [[Christianity]] became the official religion of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Pope Leo I]] began using the title Pontifex Maximus around 440 to emphasize the authority of the [[Pope]]. The term "chief priests" in the New Testament (e.g. Mark 15:11) is translated as ''Pontifices'' in the Latin Vulgate and "high priest" as ''Pontifex'' in Hebrews 2:17.

==''Pontifex minor''==
The pontiffs were assisted by pontifical clerks or scribes ''([[scriba (ancient Rome)|scribae]])'', a position known in the earlier Republican period as a ''scriba pontificius'' but by the [[Augustus|Augustan]] period as a ''pontifex minor''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 22.57; [[Jörg Rüpke]], ''The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History, and the Fasti'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''pontifex minor'' assisted at the rite ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#res divina|res divina]])'' for [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] performed each [[Kalends]], the first day of the month. He took up a position in the [[Curia Calabra]], a sacred precinct ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#templum|templum]])'' on the [[Capitoline Hill]], to observe the [[new moon]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1733">'''Commissariat of the Holy Land''' is the term in the [[Order of Friars Minor]] the territory or district assigned to a [[commissary]], whose duty it was to collect alms for the maintenance of the Catholic Holy Places in Palestine/Israel committed to the care of the Friars Minor.
 
The term also designates, in a more restricted sense, the Franciscan convent where the aforesaid commissary resides.
 
The commissary, always a member of the order, receives his appointment by letters patent from the [[minister general]], to whom he is bound to transmit every year a detailed account of the alms received.
 
These alms may not, under any circumstances, without express permission of the [[Holy See]], be applied to other purposes, however pious and meritorious, under grave ecclesiastical penalties. The alms taken up by the bishops at the annual collections for the Holy Land are conveyed to the [[custos]] in Jerusalem through the commissary in whose district the dioceses of the bishops are situated.
 
There were in the early 20th century forty commissariats throughout the Christian world, the most ancient being that of Naples, founded in 1333, when [[Robert of Anjou]] redeemed the Holy Places from the Sultan of Egypt. In English-speaking countries there were seven — three in the United States, one in Canada, one in Great Britain, one in Ireland, and one in Australia. The Commissariat of the United States was founded in 1882, the commissary residing in the new convent of Mount St. Sepulchre, Washington, D. C. In 1902, commissariats were erected in California and at St. Louis.

The curandero's life is dedicated to the administration of remedies for mental, emotional, physical and spiritual illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=11371263|year=2001|last1=Padilla|first1=R|last2=Gomez|first2=V|last3=Biggerstaff|first3=SL|last4=Mehler|first4=PS|title=Use of curanderismo in a public health care system|volume=161|issue=10|pages=1336–40|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |doi=10.1001/archinte.161.10.1336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21343599| year=2011| last1=Davis|first1=RE |last2=Peterson |first2=KE |last3=Rothschild |first3=SK |last4=Resnicow|first4=K|title=Pushing the envelope for cultural appropriateness: Does evidence support cultural tailoring in type 2 diabetes interventions for Mexican American adults? |volume=37 |issue=2| pages=227–38| doi=10.1177/0145721710395329| pmc=3209710| journal=The Diabetes Educator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19842004|year=2009|last1=Reyes-Ortiz|first1=CA|last2=Rodriguez|first2=M|last3=Markides|first3=KS|title=The role of spirituality healing with perceptions of the medical encounter among Latinos|volume=24 Suppl 3|pages=542–7|doi=10.1007/s11606-009-1067-9|pmc=2764036|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|issue=Suppl 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15666958|year=2004|last1=Sleath|first1=BL|last2=Williams Jr |first2=JW |title=Hispanic ethnicity, language, and depression: Physician-patient communication and patient use of alternative treatments |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=235–46 |journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine|doi=10.2190/vqu1-qywt-xw6y-4m14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of a curandero can also incorporate the roles of psychiatrist along with that of doctor and healer. Some curanderos, such as [[Don Pedro Jaramillo|Don Pedrito, the Healer of Los Olmos]], make use of simple herbs, waters, and even mud to effect their cures. Others add [[Catholicism|Catholic]] elements, such as [[holy water]] and pictures of [[saint|saints]]. The use of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] prayers and other borrowings and lendings are often found alongside native religious elements. Many curanderos emphasize their native spirituality in healing while being practicing Roman Catholics.

Curanderos are often respected members of the community. Believers consider their powers to be supernatural and think that that many illnesses are caused by lost malevolent spirits, a lesson from God, or a curse.

==History in Latin America==
The term ''curanderos'' can be traced back to the Spanish colonization of Latin America. Curanderos in this part of the world are the result of the mixture of traditional indigenous medicinal practices and Catholic rituals. There was also an influence from African rituals brought to Latin America by slaves. &lt;ref name="mrt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrt.com/news/article/Univision-Curanderos-carry-on-traditions-of-7572561.php|title=Univision: Curanderos carry on traditions of Catholicism, African rites|website=mrt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term stems from the Spanish word for "to heal", ''curar''. Curanderos go beyond Western medicine, linking illness with evil spirits. This extends a curandero's duties to cover not only physical ailments but also psychological and interpersonal issues. Traditional communities see all of these issues as a loss of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newstaco.com/2013/09/26/what-are-curanderos-in-hispanic-cultures/|title=What are curanderos in Hispanic cultures? - News Taco|website=newstaco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that the curanderos can enter different dimensions where they are able to find the solutions to a person's illness or problem. Furthermore, they believe that God or the Higher Creator gives curanderos difficult and painful experiences so that they are better able to assist their patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.palomacervantes.com/what-is-a-curandera/|title=What is a Curandera or Curandero?|date=9 August 2013|website=palomacervantes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Colonial Latin America, female folk healers, or curanderas, were often conflated with ''brujas'' (witches), which refers to those who cast spells; although curanderas were persecuted during such times, it is likely because they were females in positions of authority, not because of their healing methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onfaith.co/onfaith/2010/10/25/can-a-catholic-be-a-witch/7379|title=Can a Catholic be a witch?  - OnFaith|date=25 October 2010|website=onfaith.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today many women and men continue the curandero tradition in Mexico and the southwestern United States. &lt;ref name="mrt.com"/&gt;

==History in the United States==
Historically, in the United States, curanderos were only found in concentrated Amerindian populations. In the mid- to late 1970s the rise in ethnic minority and immigrant populations grew in tandem with the public presence of curanderos in areas outside of the historical geographic regions of the United States which had large Indigenous populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1007/s10903-005-1387-8| title=Use of Alternative Folk Medicine by Mexican American Women |year=2005 |last1=Lopez |first1=Rebecca A. |journal=Journal of Immigrant Health |volume=7 |pages=23–31 |pmid=15744474 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, it has become more commonplace to see curanderos in northern-tier cities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Oregonian |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/O/index.ssf/2010/04/traditional_curanderos_a_lifel.html |title=Traditional curanderos in Oregon a lifeline for the Latino version of health care providers |publisher=OregonLive.com |date=2010-04-03 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are many different types of curanderos. ''Yerberos'' are primarily herbalists. ''Hueseros'' are bone and muscle therapists who emphasize physical ailments. ''Parteras'' are midwives. ''[[Oracionista]]s'' work primarily through the power of prayer. Other types include ''sobadors,'' who are masseurs, and ''brujas'', who are witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40678337|title=La gente : hispano history and life in Colorado|date=1998|publisher=Colorado Historical Society|others=C. de Baca, Vincent., Colorado Historical Society.|isbn=9780870815386|location=Denver, Colo.|oclc=40678337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among these broader terms there are several subspecialties. For instance, ''yerberos'' who work primarily with [[Nicotiana rustica|tobacco]] to heal patients are known as ''tabaqueros''. Healers who work primarily with [[ayahuasca]] are known as ''ayahuasqueros''. Healers who work with peyote are known as ''peyoteros''.

Although many curanderos do have a specialty and may identify with it, that does not mean that these healing modalities are necessarily strict and do not overlap. As an example, an oracionista may also be a yerbera, and so on.

==Further information==
The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]] often depicted curanderos in their art.&lt;ref&gt;Berrin, Katherine &amp; Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru: treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Andes]], one of the instruments of the ''curandero'' is the ''chonta'', a lance carved from the chonta palm, ''[[Bactris gasipaes]]'', thought to be imbued with magical powers. The palm grows only in the [[Amazon basin]] and is the object of a brisk commerce. The [[Jivaro people]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] use the hardwood of the chonta to carve their spears.&lt;ref&gt;Karsten, Rafael. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Kg2lrNfHtwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Rafael%20Karsten&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Blood, Revenge, War and Victory Feasts Among the Jibara Indians of Eastern Ecuador.''] Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-4179-3181-1}}. Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The shaman is also known as ''chonteador'', and his most important wand is the ''chonta defensa''; if he dies without disciples, the ''chonta'' is thrown, wrapped in rubands{{Clarify|reason=not a familiar English word|date=August 2018}} and weighted with stones, to the bottom of a lake with the belief that its power will reemerge when a new shaman will take office. The shamans also use wands of ''huatulco'' wood, ''[[Loxopterygium huasango]]''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Polia, The priest of the nameless hill, Le Scienze, october 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
Curanderos, probably because of the mystery and intrigue that surrounds them, are frequently included in fictional works:

'''''Disputationes''''' (full title: '''''[[Disputation|Disputationes]] de Controversiis Christianae Fidei adversus hujus temporis Haereticos'''''{{Pronunciation needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt;, also referred to as '''''De Controversiis''''') is a work on dogmatics by [[Robert Bellarmine]]. It has been described as "the definitive defence of papal power".&lt;ref name="THCB"&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After its publication, Bellarmine was regarded as Rome's foremost apologist on doctrine and [[Papacy|papal power]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 515-516.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written while Bellarmine was lecturing at the [[Roman College]], and was first published at [[Ingolstadt]] in three volumes (1581, 1582, 1593)&lt;ref name="THCB"/&gt; or four.&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterliness.com/a/Robert.Bellarmine.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726143537/http://www.masterliness.com/a/Robert.Bellarmine.htm |archivedate=2008-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the earliest attempt to systematize the various controversies of the time, and made an immense impression throughout Europe, the strength of its arguments against [[Protestantism]] so acutely felt in Germany and England that special chairs were founded in order to provide replies to it.&lt;ref name = "CC"&gt;http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/r/robert_francis_romulus_bellarmine,saint.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]],&lt;ref name="THCB"/&gt; [[Theodore Beza]]&lt;ref name="THCB516"&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 516.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rainolds]]&lt;ref name="THCB516"/&gt; were among those who wrote counter-arguments against the work.

The first volume treats of the [[Word of God (Bible)|Word of God]], of [[Christ]], and of the [[pope]]; the second of the authority of [[ecumenical council]]s, and of the [[Church (Christian)|Church]], whether militant, suffering, or triumphant; the third of the [[sacrament]]s; and the fourth of [[Divine grace]], [[free will]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and [[good works]].&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt;

As much as Protestants disliked Bellarmine's theories, he was in fact moderate in his defence of papal power. In 1590, [[Pope Sixtus V]] had, or very nearly had,&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycatholic.org/issue/2003Sep/sep14doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the first volume placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] for denying temporal hegemony to the papacy. Bellarmine's reasoning was that though the pope is the vicar of Christ, since Christ did not ''exercise'' his [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]], nor may the pope.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 516-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important part of the work is contained in the five books regarding the pope. In these, after a speculative introduction on forms of [[government]] in general, holding [[monarchy]] to be relatively the best, Bellarmine says that a monarchical government and the related temporal power are necessary for the Church, to preserve unity and order in it.

Such power Bellarmine considers to have been established by the commission of Christ to [[Saint Peter]]. He then proceeds to demonstrate that this power has been transmitted to the successors of Peter, admitting that a heretical pope may be freely judged and deposed by the Church since by the very fact of his [[Christian heresy|heresy]] he would cease to be pope, or even a member of the Church.

The third section discusses the [[Antichrist]]. Bellarmine gives in full the theory set forth by the [[Church Fathers]], of a personal Antichrist to come just before the end of the world and to be accepted by the [[Jew]]s and enthroned in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]—thus endeavoring to dispose of the Protestant exposition which saw in the pope the Antichrist.

The fourth section sets forth the pope as the supreme judge in matters of faith and morals, though making the concessions that the pope may err in questions of fact which may be known by ordinary human knowledge, and also when he speaks as a mere unofficial theologian. Bellarmine took in particular the example of [[Pope Honorius I]], who had been anathemized by the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] as holding to [[monothelitism]]. He claimed that although monothelitism had been rightly condemned, Honorius was however orthodox as he had not really held these views, and that papal authority did not extend itself to the factual interpretation of what was to be found in Honorius or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pascal/blaise/p27pr/part17.html 17th Letter] of the [[Provincial Letters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation into English==

Though several books of this work have been translated into English in the past, only recently is it seeing its first complete translation project in full, in an English translation made by Ryan Grant. Several parts of the work have been translated, and the whole project will be resumed to after the translation project of Theologia Moralis by [[ Saint Alphonsus Liguori]] is completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Robert Bellarmine Translation Project|url=https://mediatrixpress.com/?page_id=21|website=Mediatrix Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Divali Nagar''' (''City of Lights'') is an annual exposition of [[Hindu culture]] (broadly) and [[Indo-Trinidadian]] culture (specifically), it is associated with the celebration of [[Diwali]]  in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].  The exposition is staged at the ''Divali Nagar Site'', located in the borough of [[Chaguanas]]. This event was started in the Mid Centre Mall car park in late 1986. It was given a permanent site on the John Peters Road Extension off the Uriah Butler Highway a couple of years after.

Although organised as a religious and cultural presentation, Divali Nagar has been criticised by some for the level of commercialization associated with the endeavour. Commercial activity, however partly funds the Nagar which really consumes a lot of resources.Emphasis has to be placed on the several cultural and religious parts of the programme every year and the enormous positive impact it has had in Trinidad and the Caribbean as well as the diaspora living abroad.Diwali Nagar is the most significant  Indian cultural event of the T&amp;T and possibly in the wider Caribbean and North America. It has set a trend in that now Miami and other places have Diwali Nagars of their own.  
The festivities usually start one week prior to the annual Divali day holiday and finishes the night before Divali. The Nagar  culminates with  extensive fireworks show on the final night.
Diwali Nagar was born out of a concept enunciated by Hans Hanoomansingh, then President of the National Council of Indian Culture and was organized by a team of dedicated individuals, led by Rampersad Parasram,first chairman of Diwali Nagar.Mr Deokinanan Sharma, current president of NCIC, was chairman for many years
At the commencement of Divali Nagar 2011,that marked its twenty-first anniversary, pioneers of Diwali nagar were honoured.

The Divali Nagar site is utilised during the year for educational seminars, Indian Arrival Day festivities, charitable events, religious festivities and wedding receptions. The site is also used for trade exhibitors from India selling religious and cultural merchandise.

The '''''Domkustos''''' of a [[cathedral]] in German-speaking countries is responsible for its physical maintenance, furniture, decoration and security, including the safekeeping of the [[cathedral treasure]], as well as arranging for cleaning, preparation for the [[church service|services]] and ringing the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s. His or her subordinate is the '''Subkustos'''. The word "kustos" is derived from the Latin word ''custodia'' which has the sense of custody, guard, protection, preservation, oversight, care, welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.pons.com/%C3%BCbersetzung?q=custodia&amp;in=&amp;kbd=la&amp;l=dela ''Übersetzungen für custodia im Deutsch-Latein-Wörterbuch.''] on: ''de.pons.com.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the duty to guard the cathedral treasure, in several [[cathedral church]]es, such as Magdeburg, the term ''[[Thesaurar]]'' ("treasurer") was used instead of ''Domkustos''.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Wentz, Berent Schwineköper: [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Ucqwyy1bOEC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Domkustos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lIUALRI8qZ&amp;sig=h-ghGYM4vDdQO9v2Pnxh51kFEg4&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=1AR1Tu_XNdGG-wachemdDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Domkustos&amp;f=false ''Das Erzbistum Magdeburg.''] Vols.&amp;nbsp;1–2, p.&amp;nbsp;142.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere the title ''Thesaurar'' usually referred to the person responsible to the [[cathedral dean|dean]] for handling income.

The office of ''Domkustos'' may either be a senior, independent post within the [[cathedral chapter]] as, for example, until 1806 in Salzburg,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirchen.net/portal/page.asp?id=10616 ''Erzdiözese Salzburg. Geschichte.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829153616/http://www.kirchen.net/portal/page.asp?id=10616 |date=August 29, 2014 }} on: ''kirchen.net.''&lt;/ref&gt; one of the offices under the dean or [[provost (church)|provost]] (''Domdekan''), as in [[Mainz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bistummainz.de/bistum/bistum/domkapitel/aemter.html#kustos ''Ämter und Einrichtungen. Domkustos.''] on: ''bistummainz.de.''&lt;/ref&gt; or carried out in combination with other duties by one person.

Frequently the ''Domkustos'' is the head of the cathedral construction department and its workshop (''Dombauhütte''). Formerly its responsibility usually extended to other buildings in the ''[[Domimmunität]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2668">'''Ellinais''' ({{lang-el|Ελληναίς or ΕΛΛΗΝ.Α.Ι.Σ.}}), also known as '''The Holy Association of Greek Ancient Religion Believers''' (Ελλήνων Αρχαιοθρήσκων Ιερόν Σωματείον), is an [[Athens]]-based religious organization intended to promote the spread of [[Hellenismos]], the modern worship of the ancient [[Greek gods]]. Ellinais was founded in 2005 and has over 30 official members; including academics, lawyers and other professionals. The group has received state recognition of the religion. It is demanding that its offices be registered as places of worship, which could allow the group to perform weddings and other rites. The group believes in world peace, ecological awareness, and the right to education. The group has three high priests, one of whom is Kostas Stathopoulos.

==2007 Temple of Olympian Zeus rite==
On 22 January 2007 Ellinais held the first known ceremony of its kind at the 1,800-year-old [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] since the ancient Greek religion was outlawed by the Christian [[Roman empire]] in the late 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/world/AP-Greece-Ancient-Gods.html Zeus Worshippers Demand Access to Temple]. ''The New York Times'', January 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In defiance of a government ban, the 90-minute event included hymns, dancers and torchbearers. Worshipers, dressed in ancient costume, recited ancient hymns calling on [[Zeus]], "King of the Gods and the mover of things", to bring peace to the world. The priests celebrated the nuptials of Zeus with [[Hera]], the goddess of love and marriage, below the imposing [[Corinthian Order|Corinthian-style]] columns in the city centre.

A herald holding a metal staff, topped with two snake heads, proclaimed the beginning of the ceremony before priests in blue and red chitons, or robes, released two white doves, symbols of peace. A priest then poured libations of wine and incense burned on a tiny copper tripod while a choir of men and women chanted ancient hymns under the watchful eye of "guards", dressed as ancient Greek [[hoplites]], or soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2003096,00.html By Zeus!], [[Guardian Unlimited]],  February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zoroastrianism}}
The '''Faravahar''' ({{lang-fa|{{nq|فروهر}}}}), also known as '''Farr-e Kiyani''' ({{lang|fa|{{nq|فر کیانی}}}}), is one of the best-known symbols of [[Iran]]. It symbolizes [[Zoroastrianism]], the first religion of Iran before [[Arab invasion of Iran]] [[Name of Iran|Persia]], and [[Iranian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/symbols/a/faravahar.htm|title=What Does the Winged Symbol of Zoroastrianism Mean?|newspaper=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zoroastrianismforbeginners.weebly.com/sacred-symbols.html|title=Sacred Symbols|website=Zoroastrianism for beginners|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faravahar is the most worn pendant among [[Iranian_peoples|Iranians]] and has become a secular national symbol, rather than a religious symbol.{{Citation needed|reason=There are present-day Zoroastrians that still where this pendant for religious purposes. Please cite your source. |date=October 2018}} It symbolizes nice thoughts ({{lang|fa|{{nq|پندار نیک}}}} pendār-e nik), nice words ({{lang|fa|{{nq|گفتار نیک}}}} goftār-e nik) and nice deeds ({{lang|fa|{{nq|کردار نیک}}}} kerdār-e nik), which are the basic tenets and principles of Zoroastrianism.

==Etymology==
The [[New Persian]] word {{lang|fa|فروهر}} is read as ''forouhar'' or ''faravahar'' (it was pronounced as ''furōhar'' in Classical Persian). The [[Middle Persian]] forms were ''frawahr'' ([[Book Pahlavi]]: plwʾhl, [[Manichaean alphabet|Manichaean]]: prwhr), ''frōhar'' (recorded in [[Pazend]] as {{lang|pal-Avst|𐬟𐬭𐬋𐬵𐬀𐬭}}; it is a later form of the previous form), and ''fraward'' ([[Book Pahlavi]]: plwlt', [[Manichaean alphabet|Manichaean]]: frwrd), which was directly from [[Old Persian]] ''*fravarti-''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=FRAVAŠI|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fravasi-|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=12 February 2014|authorlink=Mary Boyce|date=15 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKenzie|first=David Neil|title=A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=0-19-713559-5|authorlink=David Neil MacKenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Avestan language]] form was ''fravaṣ̌i'' ({{lang|ae|𐬟𐬭𐬀𐬎𐬎𐬀𐬴𐬌}}).

[[File:Faravahar on Fire Temple, Yazd.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Faravahar symbol on a [[Fire temple|Fire Temple]] in [[Yazd]]]]
Even after the [[Arab conquest of Iran]], [[Zoroastrianism]] continued to be part of Iranian culture. Throughout the year, festivities are celebrated such as the Iranian New Year or [[Nowruz]], [[Mehregan]], and [[Chaharshanbe Suri]]. These are remnants of Zoroastrian traditions. From the start of the 20th century, the Farvahar icon found itself in public places and became a known icon amongst all Iranians.

The [[Shahnameh]] by [[Ferdowsi]] is Iran's national epic and contains stories (partly historical and partly mythical) from [[Pre-Islamic Iranian literature|pre-Islamic]] Zoroastrian times. The [[Tomb of Ferdowsi|tomb of Ferdowsi]] (built early 1930), which is visited by numerous Iranians every year, contains the Faravahar icon as well.

The [[Sun Throne]], the imperial seat of Persia, has strong relations from the ''Farahavar''. The sovereign would be seated in the middle of the throne, which is shaped like a platform or bed that is raised from the ground. This religious-cultural symbol was adapted by the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] to represent the Iranian nation. In present-day Zoroastrianism, the ''Faravahar'' is said to be a reminder of one's purpose in life, which is to live in such a way that the soul progresses towards ''[[frashokereti]]'', or union with [[Ahura Mazda]], the supreme divinity in Zoroastrianism. Although there are a number of interpretations of the individual elements of the symbol, none of them are older than the 20th century.

After the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] of 1979, the [[The Lion and Sun|Lion and Sun]], which was part of Iran's original national flag, was banned by the government from public places in order to prevent people from being reminded of life prior to the revolution. Nevertheless, Faravahar icons were not removed. As a result, the Faravahar icon became a national symbol amongst the people, and it became somewhat tolerated by the government as opposed to the Lion and Sun. The Faravahar is the most worn pendant amongst Iranians {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for such a claim|date=June 2015}} and has become a national symbol, rather than a religious icon because it has  been absconded with by non-Zoroastrians{{Citation needed|reason=Appears to be a bogus claim with zero sources|date=October 2018}}, although its Zoroastrian roots should not be ignored. It's  the  symbol of the state religion of the Persian Empire: Zoroastrianism. Nowadays, it is a common symbol of both the modern and ancient Iranian state (which used to be Persia). Although Zoroastrianism is no longer Iran's state religion, it is an important, customary and traditional symbol. The winged discs has a long history in the art and culture of the [[Near East|ancient Near]] and [[Middle East]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In Neo-Assyrian times, a human bust is added to the disk,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} the "feather-robed archer" interpreted as symbolizing [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and the winged disc- [[Anshar]]

[[File:Egypte louvre 091 faucon.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Egyptian Horbehutet ([[Horus]] of [[Edfu|Behdet]]), holding [[Shen ring]]s in his grasp ([[Louvre|Louvre Museum]])]]
While the symbol is currently thought to represent a ''[[Fravashi]]'' (approximately a [[guardian angel]]), from which it derives its name (see below), what it represented in the minds of those who adapted it from earlier [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Egypt]]ian reliefs is unclear. Because the symbol first appears on royal inscriptions, it is also thought to represent the 'Divine Royal Glory' (''[[Khvarenah]]''), or the ''[[Fravashi]]'' of the king, or represented the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine mandate]] that was the foundation of a king's authority.

This relationship between the name of the symbol and the class of divine entities it represents, reflects the current belief that the symbol represents a ''Fravashi''. However, there is no physical description of the ''Fravashi''s in the [[Avesta]], the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, and in Avestan the entities are grammatically feminine.

'''Gurdawara Bair Sahib''' also called as Baba Beri or Baba Bair is situated in [[Sialkot]], [[Pakistan]]. It was  the place where Baba [[Guru Nanak]] stayed and met Hazrat Hamza Ghaus - a famous saint of Sialkot. The Bair tree under which Guru Nanak had stayed is still present.  The Gurdawara was built by Natha Singh. A big well was also constructed by him inside this Gurdwara and many Persian wheels worked in it. A beautiful tank was also there. It also  includes a garden, a pool and residential rooms. The Gurdawara was damaged in the wake of the [[Ayodhya debate|Babari Masjid dispute]]. There used to be a very high temple which was razed to ground when it was demolished by an unruly mob. The Gurdwara is in urgent need of repairs.

The '''doctrine of the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamate]] in [[Isma'ilism]]''' differs from that of the [[Twelver]]s because the Isma'ilis had living [[Imamate|Imams]] for centuries after the last Twelver Imam went into concealment. They followed [[Isma'il ibn Jafar]], elder brother of [[Musa al-Kadhim]], as the rightful Imam after his father, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]].&lt;ref&gt;Rise of The Fatimids, by W. Ivanow. Page 81, 275&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ismailis believe that whether Imam Ismail did or did not die before Imam Ja'far, he had passed on the mantle of the imamate to his son [[Muhammad ibn Isma'il]] as the next imam.&lt;ref name="IMAMATE IN ISMAʿILISM"&gt;{{Iranica|ismailism-xvii-the-imamate-in-ismailism|Ismaʿilism xvii.

According to some early Isma'ilis, the [[Sevener]]s, as well as the [[Qarmatians]], a splinter group, the number of imams was fixed, with seven Imams preordained by God. These groups considers [[Muhammad ibn Isma'il]], the foundation Imam of the Isma'ili branch of [[Shia Islam]], to be the [[Mahdi]] and to be preserved in hiding, which is referred to as [[the Occultation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ismaili.net/histoire/history04/history408.html MUHAMMAD BIN ISMAIL (158-197/775-813)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qarmatians]] believed that ''[[Muhammad ibn Isma'il]] was [[Imām]] [[Al-Qa'im (person)|al-Qā'im]] [[Mahdi|al-Mahdi]]'' and the last of the great messenger - prophets.&lt;ref name="Rasūl"/&gt; On his reappearance, he would bring a new religious law by abrogating the one conveyed by the [[Prophet Muhammad]]. Qarmatians recognized a series of ''Seven law-announcing prophets'' called ''ūlul’l-ʿazm,'' namely, [[Noah in Islam|Nūh]], [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrāhīm]], [[Moses in Islam|Mūsā]], [[Jesus in Islam|ʿIsā]], [[Muhammad|Muhammad bin ʿAbd Allāh]], [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Tālib]], and [[Muhammad ibn Ismail|Muhammad bin Ismā‘īl]], who was the seal of the series.&lt;ref name="Rasūl"/&gt;

=== Early beliefs ===
According to the early Ismāʿīlis, God sent Seven great [[prophets and messengers in Islam|prophets]], known as ''nātiq'' "speakers", in order to disseminate and improve Islam. All of these great prophets has an assistant, the Sāmad (Silent) Imam. After six silent imams, a ''nātiq'' was sent to reinvigorate Islam. After [[Adam]] and his son [[Seth]], and after six “Nātiq” ''(Speaker)'' – “Sāmad” ''(Silent)'' silsila&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dawr-1 Encyclopedia Iranica, DAWR (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Noah]]–[[Shem]]), ([[Abraham]]–[[Ishmael]]), ([[Moses]]–[[Aaron]] or [[Joshua]]), ([[Jesus]]–[[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Simeon]]), ([[Muhammad|Muhammad bin ʿAbd Allāh]]–[[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Tālib]]); the silsila of “Nātıqs and Sāmads have been completed with ([[Muhammad ibn Ismail|Muhammad bin Ismā‘īl as-ṣaghīr]] (Maymūn al-Qaddāh&lt;ref name="Öz"&gt;Öz, Mustafa, ''Mezhepler Tarihi ve Terimleri Sözlüğü (The History of [[madh'hab]]s and its terminology dictionary),'' Ensar Yayıncılık, [[İstanbul]], 2011. (This is the name of the trainer of [[Muhammad ibn Ismail|Muhammed bin Ismā‘īl]] ibn [[Isma'il ibn Jafar|Jā’far]]. He had established the principles of the [[Batiniyya]] [[Madh'hab]], later.)&lt;/ref&gt;) – ʿAbd Allāh Ibn-i Maymūn&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abdallah-b-maymun-al-qaddah-legendary-founder-of-the-qarmatian-ismaili-doctrine Encyclopaedia Iranica, "ʿAbdallāh b. Maymūn al-Qaddāḥ: Legendary founder of the Qarmatian-Ismaʿili doctrine and alleged forefather of the Fatimid dynasty"]&lt;/ref&gt; and his sons).

Early Ismāʿīlis believed that hierarchical history of the mankind is created in ''Seven Eras'' of various durations each one inaugurated by "speaker-[[prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet]]" (known as ''nātiq''). In the first ''Six Eras'' of human history, ''nātiqs'' or ''ūlul’l-ʿazm'' had been [[Adam in Islam|Adam]], [[Noah in Islam|Nūh]], [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrāhīm]], [[Moses in Islam|Mūsā]], [[Jesus in Islam|ʿIsā]], [[Muhammad|Muhammad bin ʿAbd Allāh]]. Qarmatians, on the other hand, originally included [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Tālib]] instead of Adam in their list of law-announcing prophets.  Later substitution of Adam in place of Ali as one of the nātiqs, and the reduction of Ali's rank from a prophet level to that of Muhammad's successor indicate the renouncement of their extremist views. Furthermore, they believed that each of the first six nātiqs were succeeded by a spiritual legatee called ''wāsi'' or foundation ''asās'' or silent ''sāmit,'' who interpreted the inner esoteric ''([[Batin (Islam)|batin]])'' meaning of the revelation. Each ''sāmit'' in turn was followed by ''Seven Imāms'' called ''atimmā','' who guarded the true meaning of the scriptures and the laws.&lt;ref name="Ismāʿīlis"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary, Farhad]] |title=''The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQGlyZAy134C&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=Al-Dibaj&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |place=[[Cambridge]] |page=139 |year=1990 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jewish mysticism}}
Academic study of '''Jewish mysticism''', especially since [[Gershom Scholem]]'s ''[[Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism]]'' (1941), distinguishes between different forms of [[mysticism]] across different eras of [[Jewish history]]. Of these, [[Kabbalah]], which emerged in 12th-century Europe, is the most well known, but not the only typologic form, or the earliest to emerge. Among previous forms were [[Merkabah mysticism]] (c. 100 BC&amp;nbsp;– 1000 AD), and [[Ashkenazi Hasidim]] (early 13th century AD) around the time of Kabbalistic emergence.

Kabbalah means "received tradition", a term previously used in other Judaic contexts, but which the Medieval Kabbalists adopted for their own doctrine to express the belief that they were not innovating, but merely revealing the ancient hidden esoteric tradition of the [[Torah]]. This issue is crystallised until today by alternative views on the origin of the [[Zohar]], the main text of Kabbalah. Traditional Kabbalists regard it as originating in [[Tannaim|Tannaic]] times, redacting the [[Oral Torah]], so do not make a sharp distinction between Kabbalah and early Rabbinic Jewish mysticism. Academic scholars regard it as a synthesis from Medieval times, but assimilating and incorporating into itself earlier forms of Jewish mystical tradition, as well as other philosophical elements.

The theosophical aspect of Kabbalah itself developed through two historical forms: "[[Kabbalah|Medieval/Classic/Zoharic Kabbalah]]" (c.1175&amp;nbsp;– [[Expulsion from Spain|1492]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Cordoverian Kabbalah|1570]]), and [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] (1569 AD&amp;nbsp;– today) which assimilated Medieval Kabbalah into its wider system and became the basis for modern Jewish Kabbalah. After Luria, two new mystical forms popularised Kabbalah in Judaism: [[Antinomianism|antinomian]]-[[Heresy|heretical]] [[Sabbateans|Sabbatean movements]] (1666&amp;nbsp;– 18th century AD), and [[Hasidic Judaism]] (1734 AD&amp;nbsp;– today). In contemporary Judaism, the only main forms of Jewish mysticism followed are esoteric Lurianic Kabbalah and its later commentaries, the variety of schools in Hasidic Judaism, and [[Neo-Hasidism]] (incorporating Neo-Kabbalah) in non-Orthodox [[Jewish denominations]].

Two non-Jewish [[syncretic]] traditions also popularised Judaic Kabbalah through its incorporation as part of general [[Western esotericism|Western esoteric]] culture from the [[Renaissance]] onwards: theological [[Christian Cabala]] (c. 15th &amp;nbsp;– 18th century) which adapted Judaic Kabbalistic doctrine to Christian belief, and its diverging occultist offshoot [[Hermetic Qabalah]] (c. 15th century&amp;nbsp;– today) which became a main element in esoteric and magical societies and teachings. As separate traditions of development outside Judaism, drawing from, syncretically adapting, and different in nature and aims from Judaic mysticism, they are not listed on this page.

== Three aims in Jewish mysticism ==

The Kabbalistic form of Jewish mysticism itself divides into three general streams: the [[Kabbalah|Theosophical/Speculative Kabbalah]] (seeking to understand and describe the divine realm), the [[Meditative Kabbalah|Meditative/Ecstatic Kabbalah]] (seeking to achieve a mystical union with God), and the [[Practical Kabbalah|Practical/Magical Kabbalah]] (seeking to [[Theurgy|theurgically]] alter the divine realms and the World). These three different, but inter-relating, methods or aims of mystical involvement are also found throughout the other pre-Kabbalistic and post-Kabbalistic stages in Jewish mystical development, as three general typologies. As in Kabbalah, the same text can contain aspects of all three approaches, though the three streams often distill into three separate literatures under the influence of particular exponents or eras.

Within Kabbalah, the theosophical tradition is distinguished from many forms of [[mysticism]] in other religions by its doctrinal form as a mystical "philosophy" of [[Gnosis]] esoteric knowledge. Instead, the tradition of Meditative Kabbalah has similarity of aim, if not form, with usual traditions of general mysticism; to unite the individual intuitively with God. The tradition of theurgic Practical Kabbalah in Judaism, censored and restricted by mainstream Jewish Kabbalists, has similarities with non-Jewish [[Hermetic Qabalah]] magical [[Western Esotericism]]. However, as understood by Jewish Kabbalists, it is censored and forgotten in contemporary times because without the requisite purity and holy motive, it would degenerate into impure and [[613 commandments|forbidden]] magic. Consequently, it has formed a minor tradition in Jewish mystical history.

| [[Nevi'im|Prophetic Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;There is academic debate whether [[Nevi'im|Prophetic Judaism]] is [[Phenomenology of religion|phenomenologically]] a mysticism. While the [[prophet]]s differed from many (not Hasidic) Jewish mystics in their social role, there are mystical passages in the prophetic books; eg. [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 1 became the basis of [[Merkabah mysticism]]. The Talmud says that there were hundreds of thousands of prophets among Israel: twice as many as the 600,000 Israelites who left Egypt; but most conveyed messages solely for their own generation, so were not reported in scripture ([http://www.jewfaq.org/prophet.htm Judaism 101-Prophets and Prophecy]).

}}The '''Jordanian Interfaith Coexistence Research Center''' (or '''JICRC''') is a non-governmental organization for promoting peaceful religious coexistence based out of [[Amman|Amman, Jordan]]. It focuses on fostering [[interfaith dialogue]] on a grassroots level and creating interreligious harmony. The JICRC is currently run by its founder and director, [[Nabil Haddad#Career and activities|Father Nabil Haddad]].

== History ==
[[File:Father Nabil.jpg|170px|thumb|left|JICRC founder Nabil Haddad with [[King Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]].]]Father Nabil Haddad established the JICRC in 2003. He founded the center on what he described as “the belief that an approach of togetherness is needed to expand upon the conviction that all values, morals, and religions guide us to peace. JICRC calls for mutual respect and dignity for all people as human beings by emphasizing that we are all children of Adam.”&lt;ref name="pluralism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pluralism.org/profiles/view/74214|title=Jordanian Interfaith Coexistence Research Center (JICRC) - The Pluralism Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The JICRC is based out of its headquarters on Jebel Al-Weibdeh in [[Amman|Amman, Jordan]]. It is situated in between Luzmilla Hospital and the site of the oldest cathedral in Jordan.&lt;ref name="rania"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queenrania.jo/media/news/queen-rania-celebrates-holiday-season-jordanian-interfaith-coexistence-research-centre|title=Queen Rania celebrates holiday season at Jordanian Interfaith Coexistence Research Centre - Queen Rania|first=Queen Rania official|last=website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The JICRC participates in many interfaith dialogue events.&lt;ref name="pluralism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rania" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://amman-news.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=837:jordanian-un-mission-marks-world-interfaith-harmony-week&amp;catid=41:top-headlines]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has worked with the US Department of State and the US nonprofit [[Amideast]] program.&lt;ref name="pluralism" /&gt; Public figures including John Kerry and Laura Bush have publicly commended the JICRC for its interfaith dialogue work.&lt;ref name="pluralism" /&gt;

The JICRC plays an advisory role to both the Jordanian Government and other [[non-governmental organization]]s.&lt;ref name="pluralism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acommonword.com/index.php?page=newcontent&amp;item=1|title=A Common Word Between Us and You|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center also holds events in collaboration with the government to promote interfaith harmony, such as its February 2011 “Harmony: Jordan as a Model”, a celebration of the United Nations’ [[World Interfaith Harmony Week]] held in concert with the Jordanian Ministry of Islamic Affairs under the patronage of [[Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad|Prince Ghazi bin Mohammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/events-calendar/#2011a02a02|title=Events Calendar|website= World Interfaith Harmony Week |access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JICRC frequently hosts visiting groups of students, religious leaders, politicians, and academics. The JICRC also offers an internship program for current students and recent graduates.

==Programs==
The JICRC continues to be globally active through hosting and attending various conferences to promote interfaith dialogue and peaceful coexistence among different faiths. Over the past decade, the JICRC has launched several successful programs which seek to foster positive interfaith relations in Jordan, in the Middle East, and around the world.

"Imams for Coexistence" is an effort to present to other societies the moderate voices of the Muslim world working for harmony, tolerance, moderation, and peaceful coexistence with others. This program brought imams to the United States in order to introduce young, progressive leaders to the culture, history, and society of the West and allow them to witness how different religions are expressed and peacefully in the western realm. "Imams for Coexistence" also gives the imams opportunities to interact with western societies in a positive and constructive way through participating in dialogues at public events, where they can discuss Islamic perspectives on human rights, democracy, and gender, while allowing them to address misconceptions and misunderstandings of Islam prevalent in a post-September 11 American and western society.

"Women for Coexistence" consists of initiatives of workshops, camps and conferences, which provide an open forum for women to interact using the core interfaith values as a foundation for building harmony, religious coexistence, cultural understanding, gender equality, and peace.

"Youth for Coexistence" provides a venue for Muslim and Christian youth to dialogue and to build relationships of respect and understanding. Youth who have the passion and the capacity to promote peace and understanding between the faith traditions will become the most effective future spokespersons for the cause of peaceful coexistence. The program includes conferences, camps and workshops. The purpose of this program is to involve youth in the development of grass roots program initiatives related to the JICRC’s Document on Islamic-Christian Interfaith Coexistence.

"Media and Coexistence" is a newer project which seeks to promote balanced portrayal of interfaith relations in Jordanian media, empowering young journalists to use social media and learn more about the Jordanian model of interfaith harmony.

'''Khorat Thai''' or '''Korat Thai''' (Thai: ไทยโคราช) people refers to an [[ethnic group]] named for their main settlement area in [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]], unofficially called "Korat". Korat Thai people call themselves '''Tai Berng''' (ไทยเบิ้ง), '''Tai Derng''' (ไทยเดิ้ง), or '''Tai Korat''' ({{lang-th|ไทยโคราช}}; {{rtgs|''thai khorat''}}). Other tribes in northern Thailand also refer to them by those names.{{CN|date=July 2017}}

Theories of the origin of the name '''Tai berng''' are:

#From its meaning, '''berng''' means '''some''' or '''few'''. Thai Khorat people lived in three major kingdoms: central Thai kingdoms (Ayutthaya, Thonburi, and Bangkok),  Lao Kingdom, and Cambodia Kingdom. People who live in the Khorat area are of different origin, e.g., Thai, Lao, Khmer, Kui,  and blended their cultures and beliefs together into their own culture.
# It may be from their commonly used word, '''berng''' is a word unique to the Thai Khorat people, and it is frequently used in their conversation.{{CN|date=July 2017}}

Thai Khorat people have their own traditions and cultures called '''Khorat culture''', which is similar to the culture of [[Thai people]] on the central plain, but their own unique words, dialect, costumes, songs, and beliefs are different from the rest of the [[Tai languages|Tai]]-speaking peoples. In spite of their [[Isan]] domicile, populated by [[Isan language|northeast Thai speakers]], the Khorat Thai speak [[Central Thai]].&lt;ref name="Asia H"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World; Khorat Thai|url=https://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/uploads/people-groups/Thailand/KhoratThai.pdf|website=Asia Harvest|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their fluency in the official Thai language means has meant that the group does not appear on official lists of ethnic groups in Thailand.&lt;ref name="Joshua" /&gt;

==Population==
In 1999, an estimated 10,000 Khorat Thai lived in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=Schliesinger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schliesinger|first1=Joachim|title=Tai Groups of Thailand,  Vol 2: Profile of the Existing Groups|date=2001|publisher=White Lotus Co, Ltd|location=Bangkok|isbn=9781633232358|pages=7-12|edition=eBook by BooksMango|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=XTkjBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 July 2017|chapter=Chapter 2: Khorat Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|8}} The population mainly inhabits two villages, Ban Nung Thap Prang and Ban Nong Samrong, both in the [[Chok Chai District]] about 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of the provincial capital. About 4,000 Khorat Thai live in each village. A few thousand Khorat Thai live in smaller villages in and around Nakhon Ratchasima City.&lt;ref name=Joshua&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai, Khorat in Thailand|url=https://joshuaproject.net/index.php/people_groups/19258/TH|website=Joshua Project|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thai Khorat also inhabit adjacent provinces:{{CN|date=July 2017}}

# [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]]: all districts, except for the northern part, e.g., [[Non Sung District]], [[Bua Yai District]].
# [[Saraburi Province]]: [[Wang Muang District]]
# [[Lopburi Province]]: [[Phatthana Nikhom District]], [[Chai Badan District]], [[Khok Samrong District]] and [[Sa Bot District]]
# [[Phetchabun Province]]: [[Si Thep District]] and [[Wichian Buri District]]
# [[Chaiyaphum Province]]: [[Chatturat District]] and [[Bamnet Narong District]]
# [[Buriram Province]]: [[Mueang Buriram District]], [[Nang Rong District]], [[Lahan Sai District]], [[Nong Ki District]], [[Chamni District]] and [[Lam Plai Mat District]]

==History==
The Khorat Thai can be traced back at least to the late-18th century, when King [[Narai]] of the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] ordered a new city built as the eastern fortress of his kingdom. This was the origin of [[Nakhon Ratchasima|Nakhon Ratchasima city]]. The city thus marked the boundary between Ayutthaya and the Lao regions.

The Khorat Thai are closely related to the [[Lao people|Thai]] people. Some claim they are descended from Thai soldiers who married Khmer women,&lt;ref name="LePoer-1987"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=LePoer|editor1-first=Barbara Leitch|title=Thailand: A Country Study|date=1987|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|location=Washington|url=http://countrystudies.us/thailand/42.htm|accessdate=9 July 2017|chapter=The Thai and Other Tai-Speaking Peoples}}&lt;/ref&gt; though evidence proving this is lacking.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums''''' (In English ''Criminal History of Christianity'') is the main work of the author and [[Criticism of religion|church critic]] [[Karlheinz Deschner]]. It describes the misconduct attributed to various [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian Church|churches]], [[Religious denomination|denominations]], [[sect]]s, and leagues, as well as its representatives and Christian sovereigns during Christian history. The work covers the entire [[history of Christianity]] from its [[Bible|biblical]] beginnings until the present. It was published in ten volumes beginning in 1986, with the final volume appearing in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rowohlt.de/magazin_artikel/Karlheinz_Deschner_Kriminalgeschichte_des_Christentums_Bd_9.2849583.html |title= Karlheinz Deschner: Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums, Bd. 9 |publisher=[[Rowohlt Verlag]] |language=German |work=Rowohlt Magazin |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partial or complete translations of this work have been published in Italian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edizioniariele.it/ilviandante_03.htm |title=Storia criminale del Cristianesimo |publisher=Edizioni Ariele |language=Italian |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish, Greek, Polish, and Russian.

== Summary ==
In the introduction to the complete works, which is the beginning of the first volume, Deschner explains his intention by starting with what is not to be found in his work: an answer to the question "What is Christianity good for?". According to the sentence ''Audiatur et altera pars'' ("one should listen to the other side, too") he wants to counterbalance the gigantic ascendence of the existing glorification of Christianity. Also, he does not want to write about the alleged or - exceptionally - really positive effects of Christianity. Instead, he wants to demonstrate that the advocates of a primary moral instance not only partially but permanently failed their own ideals. 

Deschner anticipates the main criticism at his work, namely the one-sidedness of selection of facts, and responds with a clear counter. His aim was not a history of churches, but an illustration of all (including non-churchy) phenomena of Christianity. These would be measured up to not only generic terms, like crime or humanity, but also to the central ethical ideas of the synoptics, as well as to the Christian self-conception as the religion of glad tidings, love, peace, etc., and also the ignored demands of the later church, like prohibition of military service (first for all Christians, then for the clergy, only), ban on simony, interest-taking, usury and many more.

== List of volumes with abstracts ==
In the following, all volumes are listed with an abstract for each of them. The English titles were taken from the author's English web-site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Karlheinz Deschner |url=http://www.deschner.info/index.htm?/en/work/kg/criminalhistory.htm |title=Christianity's Criminal History |publisher=Deschner.info |date=2002-01-18 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; where available. Where not available, they are marked as ''(translation)''.

=== Vol. 1: Die Frühzeit (The Early Period) ===
* {{cite book |author=Deschner, Karlheinz |title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums, Bd.1, Die Frühzeit. Von den Ursprüngen im Alten Testament bis zum Tod des heiligen Augustinus (430) |publisher=Rowohlt |location=Reinbek bei Hamburg |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=3-498-01263-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}
* English title: ''Christianity's Criminal History. Volume 1. The Early Period. From Old Testament origins to the death of Saint Augustine (430).''

This first volume was published after 16 years of preparatory work. It illustrates the genesis of Christianity and its ascension to the Roman [[state religion]].

It starts with a look into the [[Old Testament]]. Deschner describes the land seizure of the Israelites after the crumbling Egyptian power in Palestine in the 14th and 13th century B.C.E. and the destruction of the [[Canaan]] city-state system. This beginning, which does not directly concern Christianity, but ancient Judaism, demonstrates the relation between religious rhetoric and violent political reality: This is where Deschner sees the origin of a tradition of holy wars, following which Christians later commit numerous mass murders in the name of Israel's God, too. He describes the many death penalties the Torah stipulates for religious offences, King David's policy of conquest, the ruling and corruption of the priests, and finally the decline of the state of Israel in Roman times.

Only this decline made the ascension of Christianity in the Roman empire possible, because Christians could see themselves as the true ''Israel of God''. Christian [[Anti-Judaism]] begins with the [[New Testament]] (see [[Antisemitism and the New Testament]]) and continues with the Church being interpreted as new Israel. Based on selected quotations, Deschner demonstrates the antisemitism of the [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]] [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Jerome]] and [[Hilary of Poitiers]].

Likewise, the [[Church Fathers]] - according to Deschner - agitated against ''heretics'' and ''misbelievers''. Deschner defends only [[Origen]], whom he numbers among ''the most noble Christians at all''. One whole chapter is dedicated to the ''attacks against paganism''. He then analyses the persecution of Christians in the mirror of partially exaggerating martyr legends from Christian historiography as well as the retrospective Christian view of pagan emperors. Furthermore, Deschner looks at the ''first significant adversaries of Christianity'', Celsus and Porphyrios.

According to Deschner, emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] turned ''"the church of pacifists into a church of battlefield-shavelings"''. In Deschner's eyes, giving up the central pacifist values of pre-Constantine Christianity means ''"a bankruptcy of Jesus' teachings"''. Furthermore, Deschner describes Constantine's actions in the ''battle against Jews, "heretics" and Pagans''. He also does not spare the kingdom of Armenia, the first state in the world to make Christianity a state religion (in 301), by asserting that ''"this immediately began with massive persecution of Pagans"''.

About emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] Deschner writes that he ''"towers over his Christian antecessors in all aspects: in character, ethical and intellectual."''. Julian's attempt to re-legitimate Pagan religions is commented as follows: {{Quote|''Vielleicht, wer weiß, wäre eine nichtchristliche Welt in genauso viele Kriege gestürzt – obwohl die nichtchristliche Welt seit siebzehn Jahrhunderten weniger Kriege führt als die christliche! Schwer vorstellbar aber in einer heidnischen Welt: die ganze Heuchelei der christlichen. Und noch schwerer denkbar deren religiöse Intoleranz.''|Kriminalgeschichte Bd. 1, S. 317 und passim}}

:English translation: ''Maybe, who knows, a non-Christian world would have tumbled into as many wars – though, during the last 17 centuries, the non-Christian world fought fewer wars than the Christian! But it is very hard to imagine in a Pagan world: all the hypocrisy of the Christians. And even less thinkable is their religious intolerance.''

The volume closes with an evaluation of the [[Church Fathers]] [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]], [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. Deschner accuses Athanasius of ''"unscrupulousness"'' as well as ''"striving for prestige and power"''. Ambrose is in Deschner's words a ''"fanatic antisemite"''. Thanks to his church policies, ''"adamant and intolerant, but not so direct; versed, smoother"'', he set an ''"example for the Church until today"'' (page 400 and passim). And finally, Augustine, who positioned ''"patriotism above the love of a father for his son"'' (page 520) and sanctioned ''"just war"'' as well as ''"holy war"''.

=== Vol. 2: Die Spätantike (Late Antiquity) ===
* {{cite book |author=Deschner, Karlheinz |title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums, Bd.2, Die Spätantike |publisher=Rowohlt, Reinbek |location= |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=3-498-01277-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}
* English title: ''Christianity's Criminal History. Volume 2. Late Antiquity. From the Catholic "children emperors" to the extermination of the Arian Vandals and Ostrogoths under Justinian I (527-565).''

Deschner writes, the ''"conditions as in ancient Rome"'' (German ''"Zustände wie im alten Rom"'' is a proverb meaning decadent, chaotic, irresponsible, violent etc. - a civilisation in decline) were characteristic for the conditions of the Roman Church. The atrocities committed by Christian leaders in late antiquity are mostly euphemised and concealed by Church-historians until today.

=== Vol. 3: Die Alte Kirche (The Ancient Church) ===
* {{cite book |author=Deschner, Karlheinz |title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums, Bd.3, Die Alte Kirche |publisher=Rowohlt, Reinbek |location= |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=3-498-01285-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}
* English title: ''Christianity's Criminal History. Volume 3. The Ancient Church. Forgery, Brainwashing, Exploitation, Annihilation.''

Unlike the other volumes, which used a chronological approach, Deschner organised this volume according to so-called crime key aspects, which he identifies in the following areas:

* The Christian forgery
* The miracle and relic cheating
* The pilgrimage economy
* The brainwashing, [[dumbing down]] and ruin of the ancient education
* The Christian book burning and the annihilation of Paganism
* The preservation, stabilisation and expansion of slavery
* The double-tongued social doctrine and the actual social policy of the main Church

=== Vol. 4: Frühmittelalter (Early Middle Ages) ===
* {{cite book |author=Deschner, Karlheinz |title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums, Bd.4, Frühmittelalter |publisher=Rowohlt, Reinbek |location= |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=3-498-01300-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}
* English title: ''Christianity's Criminal History. Volume 4. Early Middle Ages. From King Clovis (ca. 500) to the death of Charles "the Great" (814).''

In the early Middle Ages, the split-off from Byzantium happened, the war against the Islam began and the [[pope]]s in Rome became powerful rulers. Deschner considers pope Gregor I as a man of double morale, who consistently called to repentance and preached the close apocalypse, but himself pursued the extension of his power at any cost, recommending dungeon, torture, hostage-taking and pillaging, and also knew using bribery well. Deschner calls the [[Donation of Constantine]] ''"the biggest forgery of documents in world history"''. In the end of the volume, [[Charlemagne]] is accused of opportunistic relations to the popes, as well as blamed for his excessively bloody "[[Forced_conversion#Medieval_era|sword mission]]" with the [[Saxons]] and his annihilation of the kingdoms of the [[Lombards]] and of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]].

=== Vol. 5: 9. und 10. Jahrhundert (9th and 10th Centuries) ===
* {{cite book |author=Deschner, Karlheinz |title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums, Bd.5, 9. und 10. Jahrhundert |publisher=Rowohlt, Reinbek |location= |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=3-498-01304-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}
* English title: ''Christianity's Criminal History. Volume 5. 9th and 10th Centuries. From Louis the Pious (814) to the death of Otto III (1002).''

Before the volume's actual beginning, a reply to the [[anthology]] ''Criminalisation of Christianity?'' and an [[editorial]] written by Hermann Gieselbusch ([[Literary editor|lector]] with [[Rowohlt Verlag|Rowohlt]] publishing house) has been put.

In the then following description of the 9th and 10th century, Deschner illustrates the deep entanglement of secular and church power. Clerical principalities came into existence and the military service of the high clergy prospered. Under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], the Church in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was completely militarised; dioceses and abbeys controlled a major military potential. Even popes entered wars: [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] in the naval [[Battle of Ostia]] (849) and [[Pope John X|John X]] in the [[Battle of Garigliano]] (915). Popes [[excommunicate]]d each other, some were thrown in prison, strangled, mutilated, poisoned. [[Pope Sergius III|Sergius III]] had even two other popes murdered. Chapter 3 discusses the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]], which are the most important forgery in Carolingian times (Dawson).

=== Vol. 6: Das 11. und 12. Jahrhundert (11th and 12th Centuries) ===
* {{cite book |author=Deschner, Karlheinz |title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums, Bd.6, Das 11. und 12. Jahrhundert |publisher=Rowohlt, Reinbek |location= |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=3-498-01309-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}
* English title: ''Christianity's Criminal History. Volume 6. 11th and 12th Centuries. From Emperor Henry II "the Holy" (1002) to the end of the Third Crusade (1192).''

This volume covers emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II the Holy]], who, in alliance with Pagans, fought three wars against Catholic Poland, the momentous pontificate of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], an "aggressive Satan", who lead the [[Holy See]] to victory over the emperor's throne in the [[Investiture Controversy]] ([[Walk to Canossa|Canossa]]), the [[East-West Schism]], the [[First Crusade]] with the massacre of Jerusalem's inhabitants as well as the [[Second Crusade|Second]] and [[Third Crusade]].

=== Vol. 7: Das 13. und 14. Jahrhundert (13th and 14th Centuries) ===
* {{cite book |author=Deschner, Karlheinz |title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums, Bd.7, Das 13. und 14. Jahrhundert |publisher=Rowohlt, Reinbek |location= |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=3-498-01320-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}
* English title: ''Christianity's Criminal History. Volume 7. 13th and 14th Centuries. From Emperor Henry VI (1190) to the death of Louis IV of Bavaria (1347).''

Deschner writes about the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Staufer]]-emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], who aimed for global dominance even without papal blessing, and about the most powerful pope of history, [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]]. During the time covered by this volume, crusades to all directions happened, including the [[Fourth Crusade]], the crusade of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the crusades of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] to Egypt and Tunis, the grotesque [[Children's Crusade]], the crusades of Christians against Christians, the [[Sicilian Vespers]], the extermination of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], the annihilation of the Pagans in the northeast, the Christian murders of Jews and last but not least the totalitarian [[Inquisition]], which aimed for the repression of any liberal mind.

=== Vol. 8: Das 15. und 16. Jahrhundert (The 15th and 16th century) ===
* {{cite book |author=Deschner, Karlheinz |title=Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums, Bd.8, Das 15. und 16. Jahrhundert. Vom Exil der Päpste in Avignon bis zum Augsburger Religionsfrieden |publisher=Rowohlt Verlag GmbH |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=3-498-01323-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}
* English title ''(translation)'': ''Christianity's Criminal History. Volume 8. The 15th and 16th century. From the exile of the popes in Avignon till the Peace Of Augsburg.''

Deschner describes the beginning [[witch-hunt]], the [[Western Schism]], the Renaissance popes, the fight against intra-Christian opposition ([[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus|Hus]] and the [[Council of Constance]], [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and the [[German Peasants' War]]).

* The [[reformation in Switzerland]]; [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]]
* The [[Counter-Reformation]]

* English title ''(translation)'': ''Christianity's Criminal History. Volume 10. 18th century and outlook onto the aftermath. Kings by grace of God and decline of papacy.''

More than a quarter century after the first volume's publication, Deschner completed this work: The 10th and last volume of the Criminal History is going to be published in March 2013. This volume covers:
* The decline of papacy.
* The gradual separation of church and state.

== Reception ==
The reactions to this book series have been mixed. While some praised Deschner's writings as a contribution to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as important as the works of [[Pierre Bayle]], [[Claude Helvetius]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Heinrich Heine]], others condemned his ''Christianity's Criminal History'' as "criminalisation of Christianity".

[[:de:Horst Herrmann|Horst Herrmann]], from 1970 til 1975 professor of church law at the Catholic theological faculty of [[Münster University]], who left the Catholic church in 1981, praised Deschner in 1989 in an article in [[Der Spiegel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrmann|first=Horst|year=1989|title=Einer singt falsch beim Halleluja|journal=Der Spiegel|issue=1|pages=54–56|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13493017.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a moralist asking the question: {{Quote|''Wie viele Ermordete müssen denn noch her, bis Reue einsetzt und Abkehr? Wieviel muß aufgedeckt sein, bis Komplizenschaft sich nicht mehr lohnt? Bis es als Schande gilt, sich als Christ zu bekennen? Bis die Täter nicht mehr die Beleidigten spielen dürfen?''}}

:English translation: ''How many more need to be murdered until remorse and renunciation will finally begin? How much more needs to be exposed, until complicity won't be worth it anymore? Until confessing to Christianity is considered to be a shame? Until the wrongdoers are not allowed to act offended anymore?''

A three-day-symposium organized by Hans Reinhard Seeliger in the Catholic Academy in [[Schwerte]] was dedicated to the first three volumes in the beginning of October 1992. Besides Seeliger, 22 other specialists in Christian history, patrology, old history, archaeology, jurisprudence, and other fields participated. The symposium's papers were published in 1993 as an [[anthology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hans Reinhard Seeliger |title=Kriminalisierung des Christentums?: Karlheinz Deschners Kirchengeschichte auf dem Prüfstand |publisher=Herder |location=[[Freiburg im Breisgau]] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=3-451-23222-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deschner refused the invitation arguing that he already answered all basic questions sufficiently in the preface of his first volume. He decided to exemplarily confront the paper ''Emperor Konstantin, one of the Greats in history?'' in a reply which was put in front of the fifth volume. The other papers were skipped. Hermann Gieselbusch, lector with the Rowohlt publishing house, noted at the same place (preface of vol. 5), that only few symposium participants "abstained at least from personal revilement", mentioning four speakers by name - Ulrich Faust, Theofried Baumeister, Erich Feldmann und Gert Haendler - and thanking them for their fairness in Deschner's name.

When Deschner's ''Criminal History'' (volumes 1 to 8) was published digitally as CD ROM in 2005, Giesbert Damaschke wrote in his recension:&lt;ref&gt;Damaschke, Giesbert. [http://www.literaturkritik.de/public/rezension.php?rez_id=8895&amp;ausgabe=200512 "Religionskritik? Allerdings!"], ''literaturkritik.de'', 2005 December 12. Retrieved 2013-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|''Wenn hierzulande das Stichwort "Kirchenkritik" fällt, dann kann man sicher sein, dass es [...] fast ausschließlich um das Werk eines einzelnen Mannes geht: Um Karlheinz Deschner [...]. So umfassend und omnipräsent ist sein Schaffen, [...] dass anderes daneben nur wie eine fade Wiederholung wirkt.''}}

:English translation: ''Whenever the key word "criticism of the Church" is mentioned in this country [Germany], you can be sure that the discussion is [...] nearly exclusively about the work of one single man: Karlheinz Deschner [...]. His works are so comprehensive and omnipresent [...] that everything else looks like a bland repetition when compared to Deschner's works.''

In 2008, after the publication of volume 9, Arno Widmann wrote in the [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], ''"Kette der Grausamkeiten"'' (''"Chain of atrocities"''):&lt;ref&gt;Widmann, Arno.

Retrieved 2013-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|''Es gibt Sätze in diesem Buch, die möchte man auswendig lernen, um niemals zu vergessen, welches die Grundlagen der Welt sind, in der wir leben.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11743">{{About|a figure of medieval European legend}}
'''Last Roman Emperor''', '''Last World Emperor''' or '''Emperor of the Last Days''' is a figure of medieval European legend, which developed as an aspect of [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] in the [[Catholic Church]]. The legend predicts that in the [[end times]], a last emperor would appear on earth to reestablish the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and assume his function as biblical [[katechon]] who stalls the coming of the [[Antichrist]]. The legend first appears in the 7th-century [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic text]] known as the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]''; that and the oracles of the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]] are its two most important sources. It developed over the centuries, becoming particularly prominent in the 15th century. The notion of '''Great Catholic Monarch''' is related to it, as is the notion of the [[Pope Peter II|Angelic Pope]].

==Foundations==
===Biblical===
The [[Bible|biblical foundations]] for the concept of the Great Monarch can be found in the [[Old Testament]] and in the [[New Testament]]. References in the Old Testament can be found in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]].  It is also found in the New Testament.  Catholic teaching refers to the 25th chapter of [[Matthew's Gospel]] in which Christ says that ''no one knows the hour or the day,'' except the Father in Heaven.  The Church furthermore teaches that Christ indicated the approximation of these events in the [[New Testament]], when he spoke of signs which would indicate that the ''end of days was near''.  Some of these signs include natural disasters, civil problems, and other catastrophes.  Of the precise time, however, it is unknown.

===Prophetic===
The legend is based on the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'', which was, after the [[Book of Daniel]] and the [[Book of Revelation]], "the most widespread apocalypse story in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://epdf.tips/emperor-of-the-world-charlemagne-and-the-construction-of-imperial-authority-800-.html|title=Emperor of the World: Charlemagne and the Construction of Imperial Authority, 800-1229 - PDF Free Download|website=epdf.tips|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes a different Last Emperor from the previous figure, who fought against religious enemies, and introduced the conflict with [[Islam]]:&lt;ref name=latowsky&gt;{{cite book|title=Emperor of the World: Charlemagne and the Construction of Imperial Authority, 800–1229|first=Anne A.|last=Latowsky|publisher=Cornell UP|year=2013|isbn=9780801451485|pages=70-72}}&lt;/ref&gt; he will "go forth against them [the enemies of the faith] from the Ethiopian sea and will send the sword and desolation into Ethribus their homeland, capturing their women and children living in the Land of Promise".&lt;ref name=mcginn&gt;{{cite book|last=McGinn|first=Bernard|year=1979|chapter=Adso of Montier-en-Der||title=Apocalyptic Spirituality: Treatises and Letters of Lactantius, Adso of Montier-en-Dur, Joachim of Fiore, the Franciscan Spirituals, Savonarola|location=New York|publisher=Paulist Press|pages=89-96}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conquering his enemies he would travel to Jerusalem and relinquish his power on the [[Mount of Olives]].&lt;ref name=latowsky/&gt; The Last Emperor was further developed in the writings of [[Adso of Montier-en-Der]], whose ''Libellus de Antichristo'' (ca. 954) was a popular biography of the Antichrist, whose coming was preceded by the rise of a Frankish ruler (the continuation of the Roman Empire); this Last Emperor would voluntarily give up his power and die, after which the Antichrist comes to power.&lt;ref name=mcginn/&gt; Another important impetus came from the oracles of the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]], first recorded in Latin around the year 1000; its legend proved particularly adaptable to rulers all over Europe, containing as it did a list of emperors and kings leading up to the Last Emperor which could be revised or added to as political and dynastic circumstances required.&lt;ref name=latowsky/&gt; It still had great currency in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Encounters: The Impact of the Inquisition in Spain and the New World|editor1-last=Perry|editor1-first=Mary Elizabeth|editor2-first=Anne J.|editor2-last=Cruz|location=Berkeley|publisher=U of California P|year=1991|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft396nb1w0&amp;chunk.id=d0e5389&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e164&amp;brand=eschol|chapter=Visionaries and Affective Spirituality during the First Half of the Sixteenth Century|first1=Geraldine|last1=McKendrick|first2=Angus|last2=MacKay|pages=93-101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Eschatology is a part of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] concerned with the final events in the [[history of the world]], or the ultimate [[destiny]] of [[World population|humanity]], commonly referred to as the [[End Time|end of the world]]. 

While in [[mysticism]] the phrase metaphorically refers to the end of ordinary reality and reunion with the Divine, in the [[Catholic Church]] it is taught as an actual future event [[prophecy|prophesied]] in [[sacred text]]s or prophecies or [[apocalyptic literature]].  

More broadly, it encompasses related concepts such as the [[Antichrist]], the [[Second Coming|return of Jesus]], the [[end times]], [[End of Days (eschatology)|end of days]] and the [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]], the [[resurrection of the dead]], the [[Last Judgment]], the renewal of creation, [[heaven]] and [[hell]], the establishment of the [[kingdom of God]], and the consummation of all of God's purposes, the fulfillment of [[Messianic prophecy]] and the beginning of the [[Messianic Age]].

The term eschatology is often used in a more popular and narrower sense when comparing various interpretations of the [[Book of Revelation]] and other [[prophet]]ic parts of the [[Bible]], such as the [[Book of Daniel]] and various sayings of Jesus in the [[Gospels]], such as the [[Olivet discourse]] and the [[The Sheep and the Goats|Judgment of the Nations]], concerning the timing of what many Christians believe to be the imminent second coming of Christ.

==Catholic tradition==

The concept of the Great King features prominently in mystical and folk traditions, as well as writings of people thought to have been granted gifts of prophecy or special visitations by messengers from heaven (such as [[angel]]s, [[saints]], or Christ). The Great Catholic Monarch was very popular in popular folklore until the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He reappeared in 19th century prophecy when French [[legitimism|legitimists]] believed that the [[count of Chambord]], Henry V of France would be the new king. 

[[Saint Remigius]], [[bishop of Reims]] and apostle of the [[Franks]], [[baptism|baptised]] [[Clovis I]], [[List of Frankish monarchs|king of the Franks]] on 24 December 496. This baptism, leading to the conversion of the entire Frankish people to [[Nicene Christianity]], was a momentous success for the [[Catholic Church]] and a seminal event in European history. He had a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] and prophesied that in the distant future, the last monarch who descended from the line of the [[King of France|kings of France]], would be revealed and reestablish the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the [[end time|end of time]]. This prophecy was related through [[Hincmar]], [[archbishop of Reims]], and [[Rabanus Maurus Magnentius]] [[O.S.B.]], [[archbishop of Mainz]].     [[Marie_Julie_Jahenny|Marie-Julie Jahenny]] (1850-1941), also known as the "Breton" stigmatist, prophesied that Henry V, the Count of Chambord, was the chosen King.  Despite his death, one of her predictions dated 1890 declares he is yet "reserved for the great epochs", i.e. the end of time.&lt;ref&gt;'Marie-Julie Jahenny, The 'Breton Stigmatist': Her life and Prophecies, [http://www.mysticsofthechurch.com/2015/07/marie-julie-jahenny-breton-stigmatist.html www.mysticsofthechurch.com/2015/07/marie-julie-jahenny-breton-stigmatist.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] speaks only of Christ as the king who is to be manifested in "the last days".&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm#671-672 Catechism of the Catholic Church, 671-672]&lt;/ref&gt; It speaks of this manifestation as associated by his recognition by "all Israel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm#674 Catechism of the Catholic Church, 674]&lt;/ref&gt; and preceded by the Church's ultimate trial, "a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth. The supreme religious deception is that of the Antichrist, a pseudo-messianism by which man glorifies himself in place of God and of his Messiah come in the flesh".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm#675 Catechism of the Catholic Church, 675]&lt;/ref&gt; It makes no mention of the coming of any Great Catholic Monarch, whether French or German or of any continent.

The [[French people|French]] writer and [[Traditionalist Catholic]] [[Yves Dupont]] has opined that the Great Monarch will have a restorationist character and that he will restore European Catholic royalty, destroy the power of heretics and atheists, and successfully convert many [[Muslim]]s and [[Jew]]s to the Faith.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Catholic Prophecy: The Coming Chastisement'' by [[Yves Dupont]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Roman temples''' were built during antiquity by the people of [[ancient Rome]] or peoples belonging to the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Roman temple|These temples]] were dedicated to divinities from the [[Roman pantheon]].

Most of the best survivals had been converted to churches (and sometimes later mosques), which some remain.  Rural areas in the Islamic world have some good remains, which had been left largely undisturbed. In Spain some remarkable discoveries (Vic, Cordoba, Barcelona) were made in the 19th century when old buildings being reconstructed or demolished were found to contain major remains encased in later buildings. In Rome, Pula, and elsewhere some walls incorporated in later buildings have always been evident.  In most cases loose pieces of stone have been removed from the site, and some such as capitals may be found in local museums, along with non-architectural items excavated, such as terracotta [[votive]] statuettes or amulets, which are often found in large numbers.

===Rome ===

An associate of [[Left Hegelian]] circles, Feuerbach advocated liberalism, [[atheism]], and [[materialism]]. Many of his philosophical writings offered a critical analysis of religion. His thought was influential in the development of [[historical materialism]],&lt;ref name="NC57"/&gt; where he is often recognized as a bridge between [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and Marx.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Van A., "Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Winter 2008 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/ludwig-feuerbach/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==

Feuerbach was the fourth son of the eminent jurist [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach]], brother of mathematician [[Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach]] and uncle of painter [[Anselm Feuerbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Van A., "Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/ludwig-feuerbach/, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Feuerbach's other brothers were almost all distinguished in scholarship or science:
* [[Joseph Anselm Feuerbach]] (1798–1851), archaeology and philology; his son was the painter Anselm Feuerbach (1829–1880)
* Eduard August Feuerbach (1803–1843), jurisprudence
* [[Friedrich Feuerbach|Friedrich Heinrich Feuerbach]] (1806–1880), philology and philosophy
He also had three sisters:
* Rebekka Magdalena "Helene" Feuerbach von Dobeneck (1808–1891)
* Leonore Feuerbach (1809–1885)
* Elise Feuerbach (1813–1883)

===Education===
Feuerbach matriculated in the [[University of Heidelberg]] with the intention of pursuing a career in the church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Through the influence of Prof. [[Karl Daub]] he was led to an interest in the then predominant philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and, in spite of his father's opposition, enrolled in the [[University of Berlin]] in order to study under the master himself. After 2 years, the Hegelian influence began to slacken. Feuerbach became associated with a group known as the [[Young Hegelians]], alternately known as the Left Hegelians, who synthesized a radical offshoot of Hegelian philosophy, interpreting Hegel's dialectic march of spirit through history to mean that existing Western culture and institutional forms—and, in particular, Christianity—would be superseded. "Theology," he wrote to a friend, "I can bring myself to study no more. I long to take nature to my heart, that nature before whose depth the faint-hearted theologian shrinks back; and with nature man, man in his entire quality." These words are a key to Feuerbach's development. He completed his education at [[Erlangen]], at the [[University of Erlangen]] with the study of [[natural science]]. He earned his [[habilitation]] from Erlangen on 25 July 1828 with his [[thesis]] ''De ratione una, universali, infinita'' (''The Infinity, Unity and Universality of Reason'').&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Tomasoni, ''Ludwig Feuerbach: Entstehung, Entwicklung und Bedeutung seines Werks'', Waxmann Verlag, 2015, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early writings===
His first book, published anonymously, ''Gedanken über Tod und Unsterblichkeit'' (1830), contains an attack on personal [[immortality]] and an advocacy of the [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinozistic]] immortality of reabsorption in nature. These principles, combined with his embarrassed manner of public speaking, debarred him from academic advancement. After some years of struggling, during which he published his ''Geschichte der neueren Philosophie'' (2 vols., 1833–1837, 2nd ed. 1844), and ''Abelard und Heloise'' (1834, 3rd ed. 1877), he married in 1837 and lived a rural existence at [[Bruckberg, Middle Franconia|Bruckberg]] near Nuremberg, supported by his wife's share in a small [[porcelain]] factory.

In two works of this period, ''Pierre Bayle'' (1838) and ''Philosophie und Christentum'' (1839), which deal largely with [[theology]], he held that he had proven "that Christianity has in fact long vanished not only from the reason but from the life of mankind, that it is nothing more than a fixed idea."

===''Das Wesen des Christentums'' (''The Essence of Christianity'')===
{{Criticism of Christianity sidebar}}
His most important work, ''Das Wesen des Christentums'' (1841), was translated by Mary Ann Evans (later known as [[George Eliot]]) into English as ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''.

Feuerbach's theme was a derivation of Hegel's speculative theology in which the Creation remains a part of the Creator, while the Creator remains greater than the Creation.  When the student Feuerbach presented his own theory to professor [[Hegel]], Hegel refused to reply positively to it.

In part I of his book Feuerbach developed what he calls the "true or anthropological essence of religion." Treating of God in his various aspects "as a being of the understanding," "as a moral being or law," "as love" and so on. Feuerbach talks of how humankind is equally a conscious being, more so than God because humans have placed upon God the ability of understanding. Humans contemplate many things and in doing so they become acquainted with themselves. Feuerbach shows that in every aspect God corresponds to some feature or need of human nature. As he states, &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the consciousness of the infinite, the conscious subject has for his object the infinity of his own nature."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Ludwig feuerbach.jpg|left|thumb|Ludwig Feuerbach]]
&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Instead, Feuerbach concludes, "If man is to find contentment in God," he claims, "he must find himself in God."

Thus God is nothing else than human: he is, so to speak, the outward projection of a human's inward nature. This projection is dubbed as a chimera by Feuerbach, that God and the idea of a higher being is dependent upon the aspect of benevolence. Feuerbach states that, “a God who is not benevolent, not just, not wise, is no God,” and continues to say that qualities are not suddenly denoted as divine because of their godly association. The qualities themselves are divine therefore making God divine, indicating that humans are capable of understanding and applying meanings of divinity to religion and not that religion makes a human divine.

The force of this attraction to religion though, giving divinity to a figure like God, is explained by Feuerbach as God is a being that acts throughout humans in all forms. God, “is the principle of [man's] salvation, of [man's] good dispositions and actions, consequently [man's] own good principle and nature.” It appeals to humankind to give qualities to the idol of their religion because without these qualities a figure such as God would become merely an object, its importance would become obsolete, there would no longer be a feeling of an existence for God. Therefore, Feuerbach says, when humans remove all qualities from God, “God is no longer anything more to him than a negative being.” Additionally, because humans are imaginative, God is given traits and there holds the appeal. God is a part of a human through the invention of a God. Equally though, humans are repulsed by God because, “God alone is the being who acts of himself.”

In part 2 he discusses the "false or theological essence of religion," i.e. the view which regards God as having a separate existence over against humankind. Hence arise various mistaken beliefs, such as the belief in revelation which he believes not only injures the moral sense, but also "poisons, nay destroys, the divinest feeling in man, the sense of truth," and the belief in [[sacrament]]s such as the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], which is to him a piece of religious materialism of which "the necessary consequences are superstition and immorality."

A caustic criticism of Feuerbach was delivered in 1844 by [[Max Stirner]]. In his book ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' (''[[The Ego and His Own]]''), he attacked Feuerbach as inconsistent in his [[atheism]]. The pertinent portions of the books, Feuerbach's reply, and Stirner's counter-reply form an instructive polemics. (see External Links)

===After "1848"===
During the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|troubles of 1848–1849]] Feuerbach's attack upon [[orthodoxy]] made him something of a hero with the revolutionary party; but he never threw himself into the political movement, and indeed lacked the qualities of a popular leader. During the period of the [[Frankfurt Congress]] he had given public lectures on religion at Heidelberg. When the diet closed he withdrew to Bruckberg and occupied himself partly with scientific study, partly with the composition of his ''Theogonie'' (1857).

In 1860 he was compelled by the failure of the porcelain factory to leave Bruckberg, and he would have suffered the extremity of want but for the assistance of friends supplemented by a public subscription. His last book, ''Gottheit, Freiheit und Unsterblichkeit'', appeared in 1866 (2nd ed., 1890). In 1868 he read the first volume of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'' and joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social-Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nürnberger Nachrichten]]'', Wed. July 28, 2004, Kulturteil p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After a long period of decline, he died on September 13, 1872. He is buried in Johannis-Friedhof Cemetery in Nuremberg, which is also where the artist [[Albrecht Dürer]] is interred.

===Philosophy===
Essentially the thought of Feuerbach consisted in a new interpretation of religion's phenomena, giving an anthropological explanation. Following [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]’s theses, Feuerbach thought religion was principally a matter of feeling in its unrestricted subjectivity. So the feeling breaks through all the limits of understanding and manifests itself in several religious beliefs. But, beyond the feeling, is the fancy, the true maker of projections of "Gods" and of the sacred in general.

==Critical reception==

{{quote | Unlike his countrymen, whose writings on these subjects are usually enveloped in such an impenetrable mist that their most perilous ideas pass harmlessly over the heads of the multitude, Feuerbach, by his keen incisiveness of language and luminousness of exposition, was calculated to bring his meaning home to the average reader.&lt;ref name="Blind 1883"&gt;{{cite book | last=Blind | first=Mathilde | author-link=Mathilde Blind | year=1883 | title=George Eliot | chapter=IV.

===Influence===
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were strongly influenced by Feuerbach's atheism, though they criticised him for his inconsistent espousal of materialism.

'''''Osmanoğlu and Kocabaş v. Switzerland''''' was a case heard by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in a chamber judgement concerning whether mandatory mixed-gender swimming for girls against the will of their Muslim parents who objected on religious grounds violated [[Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 9]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by contravening religious freedom. On 10 January 2017 the court unanimously found that the convention had not been violated.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;Jennifer Rankin (10 January 2017) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/10/echr-swiss-muslim-girls-must-attend-mixed-sex-swimming-lessons "ECHR: Swiss Muslim girls must attend mixed-sex swimming lessons"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Cranmer (10 January 2017) [http://www.lawandreligionuk.com/2017/01/10/islam-modesty-and-mixed-bathing-osmanoglu/ "Islam, modesty and mixed bathing: Osmanoğlu"].

The case concerned parents of Turkish origin and Muslim faith, residing in Switzerland, who refused on religious grounds to permit their two daughters (born 1999 and 2001)&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-170346 AFFAIRE OSMANOĞLU ET KOCABAŞ c.

Paragraph I, A. nb. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; take part in compulsory swimming lessons at their public school because in their view mixed-gendered swimming violated the requirement in Islam for females to be properly covered in front of males. In 2010, the authorities ordered the parents to pay a fine of 1,400&amp;nbsp;[[Swiss franc]]s, about 1,292&amp;nbsp;[[euro]]s, because their daughters had not taken the required class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-170346 AFFAIRE OSMANOĞLU ET KOCABAŞ c. SUISSE] HUDOC. EN FAIT. I. LES CIRCONSTANCES DE L’ESPÈCE. Paragraph I, A. nb. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the school, as the girls had not yet reached [[puberty]] they did not qualify for an exemption from swimming lessons under Swiss law. In 2011 the parents brought a case in a local court, which dismissed their claims,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-170346 AFFAIRE OSMANOĞLU ET KOCABAŞ c. SUISSE] HUDOC. EN FAIT. I. LES CIRCONSTANCES DE L’ESPÈCE. Paragraph I, A. nb. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 a Swiss federal court likewise dismissed the case with a finding that the parents' right to freedom of religion had not been violated.&lt;ref name=pr&gt;ECHR, Press release by the Registrar of the Court.

Paragraph I, B. nb. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a unanimous chamber decision on 10 January 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that states had a wide margin of discretion with regard to the balance between religious freedom and the state's wish to educate pupils according to their tradition and needs.&lt;ref name=pr/&gt; It put emphasis on the fact that in the opinion of the court the school had shown flexibility by offering to allow the girls to swim in [[burkini]]s and to change their clothes in a room with no boys present.&lt;ref name=pr/&gt; It further found that it was important for social integration, particularly for children of foreign origins, that pupils take full part in their education and not be exempted because of their parental background.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=pr/&gt;

The court thus found that the Swiss authorities had been within their rights when they fined the girls' parents, also saying that the fine in this case was proportional to the aim pursued and not an unduly harsh punishment.&lt;ref name=pr/&gt;

As a chamber judgment, the result may be appealed to the Grand Chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Friedman.

'''''Parsiana''''', a semi-monthly magazine in English published from [[Bombay]], carries information on, and features of interest to the International [[Zoroastrian]] community.&lt;ref name=ParsiNewsVol&gt;[http://www.parsinews.net/zoroastrians-volunteered-to-serve-king-emperor/55914.html Zoroastrians volunteered to serve King EmperorParsiNews.net | Parsi Zoroastrian News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, it is in its 51st year of publication.&lt;ref name=ParsiNewsVol /&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
''Parsiana'' was founded in November 1964 by Pestonji Warden in Bombay. It's tag-line is "A new medium for old wisdom". The magazine covered articles pertaining to Zoroastrian religion, its history, customs and traditions.

The magazine became embroiled with community politics especially when Warden got into a tussle with the [[Bombay Parsi Punchayet]] (BPP) over the printing of the monthly at the Godrej Printing Press run by the apex Bombay trust. For some time it was cyclostyled.&lt;ref name=dnaindia1538757&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-parsis-get-new-community-newspaper-1538757 Parsis get new community newspaper &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the aging Warden sold the publication for Re 1 to [[Jehangir Patel]], a journalist. The ownership was subsequently transferred in 1983 to Parsiana Publications Private Limited.&lt;ref name=dnaindia1538757 /&gt;

===Taking the lead===
''Parsiana'' was the first publication in India to use the prefix [[Ms.|Ms]] when referring to women instead of Miss and Mrs, despite opposition from some readers. It has since dropped both Mr and Ms.

Beginning in 1987 ''Parsiana'' began to collect and publish data on community births, marriages, and deaths in the Zoroastrian community in Bombay; as well as sporadic data received from outstation sources. In 1988 it published data on interfaith marriages in Bombay which proved highly controversial. There was a public outcry as a taboo had been broken. At that time the interfaith marriage count was 14%. In 2013 it was 39% and in 2014, 37%.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Since 1999 ''Parsiana'' has been publishing a calendar issue every year, juxtaposing the [[Zoroastrian festivals|Shahenshahi, Kadmi, and Fasli]] days and months within the Gregorian calendar.

===Allied efforts===
The ''Parsiana'' ''Book Of Iranian Names'' which contains authentic Iranian names is in its fourth edition, having first been published in 1978. The names were compiled by the late [[Avesta]] and [[Middle Persian literature|Pahlavi]] scholar Ervad Jamshed Katrak and were vetted by Dasturs (Dr) Hormazdyar Mirza and (Dr) Kaikhusroo JamaspAsa, Ervad (Dr) Peshotan Peer, and Mahyar Patel.

In 2005 ''Parsiana'' published ''Judgments'', a 272-page book containing the judgements delivered in crucial community legal cases such as ''Petit vs Jejeebhoy'' (Parsi Punchayet case) and ''Saklat vs Bella'' along with other judgments and articles analyzing the pronouncements.

In 2002 ''Parsiana'' started the Parsiana Book Club which offers books on Zoroastrianism and Parsis written by community members and others.

==Contents==
Under a new management, the magazine’s focus shifted to journalistic coverage of current events, personalities and developments in the community in India and overseas. The first issue under the new management in August 1973 carried a cover story on Parsi divorces which were said to be the highest amongst any community in Indian (around 10%). Since then Parsiana has continued to cover controversial and unusual stories on all aspects of the community.

As the international coverage increased, ''Parsiana'' started a Zoroastrians Abroad column which is now published in every issue. The publication’s journalists have covered major events in many parts of the world including Iran, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, London, New York and Los Angeles.

The magazine’s Readers’ Forum column contains letters from readers with three pages or more space being reserved for their views in every issue. The Events and Personalities column focuses on Parsis and Iranis in India who have made news, good or bad, and is one of the most popular columns.

The Politics and Policy column covers the various happenings in the anjumans and punchayets (associations) such as the Bombay Parsi Punchayet, the Delhi Parsi Anjuman and the Federation of the Parsi Zoroastrian Anjumans of India amongst others. Other columns include Books, In Memoriam, History, Art, Business, Sports, Food, Law. Parsiana has devoted extensive coverage to controversial court cases pertaining to crucial community issues and has championed several social causes.&lt;ref name=tti&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Minority-report-Community-magazines-try-to-keep-pace-with-changing-lifestyles/articleshow/45590197.cms Minority report: Community magazines try to keep pace with changing lifestyles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''The Times of India''. 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

To cater to the global Zoroastrian readership ''Parsiana'' started a website in 2002 which carried extracts from the magazine. Since December 2012 the entire contents of the ''Parsiana'' issues are posted on the website and are accessible to subscribers.

'''Pietra dura''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpjɛːtra ˈduːra|lang}}) or '''''pietre dure''''' {{IPA-it|ˈpjɛːtre ˈduːre|}} (see below), called '''parchin kari''' or '''parchinkari''' in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], is a term for the [[inlay]] technique of using cut and fitted, highly polished colored stones to create images. It is considered a [[decorative art]]. The stonework, after the work is assembled loosely, is glued stone-by-stone to a substrate after having previously been "sliced and cut in different shape sections; and then assembled together so precisely that the contact between each section was practically invisible". Stability was achieved by grooving the undersides of the stones so that they interlocked, rather like a jigsaw puzzle, with everything held tautly in place by an encircling 'frame'. Many different colored stones, particularly [[marble]]s, were used, along with [[semiprecious stone|semiprecious]], and even [[gemstone|precious stones]]. It first appeared in [[Rome]] in the 16th century, reaching its full maturity in [[Florence]].  Pietra dura items are generally crafted on green, white or black marble base stones.  Typically, the resulting panel is completely flat, but some examples where the image is in low [[relief]] were made, taking the work more into the area of [[hardstone carving]].

[[:wikt:pietra|Pietre]] [[:wikt:duro|dure]] is an Italian plural meaning "hard rocks" or [[hardstone]]s; the singular ''pietra dura'' is also encountered in Italian.  In Italian, but not in English, the term embraces all [[gem engraving]] and [[hardstone carving]], which is the artistic carving of three-dimensional objects in [[semi-precious]] stone, normally from a single piece, for example in [[Chinese jade]].  The traditional convention in English has been to use the singular ''pietra dura'' just to denote multi-colored inlay work.&lt;ref&gt;A distinction easily seen by comparing the [http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109123911/http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html |date=2011-01-09 }} and [http://www.firenzemusei.it/opificio/index.html Italian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014011118/http://www.firenzemusei.it/opificio/index.html |date=2009-10-14 }} versions of the website of the [[Opificio delle pietre dure]] in Florence.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years there has been a trend to use ''pietre dure'' as a term for the same thing, but not for all of the techniques it covers, in Italian.&lt;ref name="Getty Center"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/3545/galleria-de'lavori-in-pietre-dure-italian-active-1588-present/ | title=Galleria de'Lavori in pietre dure | publisher=The J. Paul Getty Museum | accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the title of a 2008 exhibition at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, ''Art of the Royal Court: Treasures in Pietre Dure from the Palaces of Europe'' used the full Italian sense of the term, probably because they thought that it had greater brand recognition.  The material on the website speaks of objects such as a vase in [[lapis lazuli]] as being examples of "hardstone carving (''pietre dure'')"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/pietre_dure/more.asp Metropolitan Museum of Art] ''Art of the Royal Court: Treasures in Pietre Dure from the Palaces of Europe''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London uses both versions on its website, but uses pietra dura ("A method of inlaying coloured marbles or semi-precious stones into a stone base, often in geometric or flower patterns....") in its "Glossary",&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.vam.ac.uk/vamembed/media/uploads/files/vanda-course-high_renaissance-glossary.pdf V&amp;A glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; which was evidently not consulted by the author of another page, where the reader is told: "Pietre dure (from the Italian 'hard stone') is made from finely sliced coloured stones, precisely matched, to create a pictorial scene or regular design".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/sculpture_features/caring_marble_plaster/marble_similar/index.html Is it Marble?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226161617/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/sculpture_features/caring_marble_plaster/marble_similar/index.html |date=2009-02-26 }} V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;  The English term "Florentine mosaic" is sometimes also encountered, probably developed by the tourist industry. Giovanni Montelatici (1864-1930) was an Italian Florentine artist whose brilliant work has been distributed across the world by tourists and collectors.

It is distinct from mosaic in that the component stones are mostly much larger and cut to a shape suiting their place in the image, not all of roughly equal size and shape as in mosaic. In pietra dura, the stones are not cemented together with [[grout]], and works in pietra dura are often portable.  Nor should it be confused with [[micromosaics]], a form of [[mosaic]] using very small [[tesserae]] of the same size to create images rather than decorative patterns, for [[Byzantine]] icons, and later for panels for setting into furniture and the like.

For fixed [[inlay]] work on walls, ceilings, and pavements that do not meet the definition for mosaic, the terms [[intarsia]] or [[cosmati]] work/[[cosmatesque]] are better used.  Similarly, for works that use larger pieces of stone (or tile), [[opus sectile]] may be used.  Pietre dure is essentially stone [[marquetry]].  As a high expression of [[lapidary]] art, it is closely related to the [[jewelery|jewelers art]].  It can also be seen as a branch of [[sculpture]] as three-dimensionality can be achieved, as with a [[bas relief]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010427064818/http://www.medici.org/hum/topics/pietredure.htm Medici.org] &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pietra dura developed from the ancient Roman [[opus sectile]], which at least in terms of surviving examples, was architectural, used on floors and walls, with both geometric and figurative designs.  In the Middle Ages [[cosmatesque]] floors and small columns etc. on tombs and altars continued to use inlays of different colours in geometric patterns. [[Byzantine art]] continued with inlaid floors, but also produced some small religious figures in hardstone inlays, for example in the [[Pala d'Oro]] in [[San Marco, Venice]] (though this mainly uses [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]). In the [[Italian Renaissance]] this technique again was used for images.  The Florentines, who most fully developed the form, however, regarded it as 'painting in stone'.

As it developed in Florence, the technique was initially called ''opere di commessi'' (approximately, "Fitted together works"). [[Medici]] Grand Duke [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando I]] of [[Tuscany]] founded the ''Galleria di'Lavori'' in 1588,&lt;ref name="Getty Center"/&gt; now the [[Opificio delle pietre dure]], for the purpose of developing this and other decorative forms.

A multitude of varied objects were created. Table tops were particularly prized, and these tend to be the largest specimens. Smaller items in the form of [[medallion]]s, [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]s, wall [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]]s, panels inserted into doors or onto cabinets,  bowls, [[jardiniere]]s, garden ornaments, fountains, benches, etc. are all found. A popular form was to copy an existing painting, often of a human figure, as illustrated by the image of [[Pope Clement VIII]], above. Examples are found in many museums. The medium was transported to other European centers of court art and remained popular into the 19th century. In particular, [[Naples]] became a noted center of the craft. By the 20th century, the medium was in decline, in part by the assault of [[modernism]], and the craft had been reduced to mainly restoration work. In recent decades, however, the form has been revived, and receives state-funded sponsorship. Modern examples range from tourist-oriented [[kitsch]] including syrupy reproductions of 19th century style religious subjects (especially in Florence and Naples), to works copying or based on older designs used for luxurious decorative contexts, to works in a genuinely contemporary artistic idiom.

==Parchin kari==
By the early part of the 17th century, smaller objects produced by the Opificio were widely diffused throughout Europe, and as far East to the court of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in [[Indian art|India]], where the form was imitated and reinterpreted in a native style; its most sumptuous expression is found in the [[Taj Mahal]]. In Mughal India, pietra dura was known as ''Parchin kari'', literally 'inlay' or 'driven-in' work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.tcl?document_id=10070 IJAR, vol. 1- Issue 1: The Notion of Hierarchy: The 'Parchin Kari' Programme at the Taj Mahal] ArchNet Islamic architecture library. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202160308/http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.tcl?document_id=10070 |date=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the Taj Mahal being one of the major tourist attractions, there is a flourishing industry of Pietra Dura artifacts in Agra ranging from tabletops, medallions, elephants and other animal forms, jewellery boxes and other decorative items.  This art form is fully alive and thriving in Agra, India though the patterns in the designs are more Persian than Roman or Medician.

Several Protestant denominations, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, are active in every Micronesian state.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2007/90145.htm |title=Micronesia, Federated States of: International Religious Freedom Report 2007

On [[Pohnpei]], the population of 35,000 is evenly divided between Protestants and Catholics (50% catholic &amp; 50% Protestant). On [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]] and [[Yap]], (an estimated 60% Catholic &amp; 40% Protestant). Religious groups with small followings include [[Baptists]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Salvation Army]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), and the [[Baha'i Faith]].  There is a small group of [[Buddhists]] on [[Pohnpei]], (0.7% Buddhist) (population as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/Countries/Country_150_2.asp |publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives |title=Religious Adherents, 2010 (World Christian Database) |accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance at religious services is generally high; [[church (building)|churches]] are well supported by their congregations and play a significant role in civil society.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Muslims]] were registered in Kosrae in July 2015, despite strong public resistance against [[Islam]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marshallislandsjournal.com/Archive%207-10-15-page.html | title=Council bans Islam | publisher=Marshall Islands Journal | date=July 10, 2015 | accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most immigrants are Filipino Catholics who have joined local Catholic churches. The Filipino [[Iglesia Ni Cristo]] also has a church in Pohnpei. In the 1890s, on the island of Pohnpei, intermissionary conflicts and the conversion of clan leaders resulted in religious divisions along clan lines which persist today. Protestants are the majority on the western side of the island, while Catholics are the majority on the eastern side. Missionaries of many religious traditions are present and operate freely. The Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the Government generally respected this right in practice. The US government received no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice in 2007.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

'''Childhood'''- According to the psychologist [[Jean Piaget]], children and adolescents go through 3 stages of religious development. From one study, in which children were asked about what they thought of religious pictures and [[Bible story|Bible stories]], Piaget's theories were supported by the children's responses.

1) Pre-operational intuitive religious thought- This [[Thought|thought process]] can occur in children up to 7 to 8 years of age, it is marked by unsystematic and fragmented thoughts on children. Children do not understand or comprehend the stories and the evidence of religions.

2) [[Theory of cognitive development|Concrete operational]] thought- Occurs between 7 and 8 to 13 or 14 years of age, children now focus on particular details of pictures and stories.

3) Formal operational thought- From 14 through the rest of adolescents, abstract religious thoughts start to occur in adolescents.

'''Early Adulthood'''- The importance of religion in the lives of people in [[Adult|early adulthood]] has been going down since the 21st century. Religious importance in early adulthood is still high in [[Developing country|less developed countries]] compared to [[Developed country|developed countries]] where its on the downfall. During this age, people start going through identity development which may lead them to start thinking deeper into [[Religion|religious beliefs]].

'''Adulthood'''- Religion increase in importance in some studies later in adulthood. 70 percent of U.S individuals surveyed said they are religious and consider spirituality a major part of their lives (Brim 1999). However, studies are also showing that adults are becoming less devoted to one particular religion. Instead they are focused more on their own spiritual journeys.

----

'''Parenting'''- Parents can have a strong effect on religious development in children and adolescents, as they tend to adopt the religion that is practiced during their upbringing. The relationship between parents and their children however can change this. If there is a positive relationship between the parents and child, the child will be more likely to adopt their religious beliefs. In the case where there is a [[negative relationship]] between the parents and child, the child will be more likely to disaffiliate themselves with their parents religious ideas.

'''Race and Gender'''- Race and gender play a major role in religious development as well. Females tend to believe there is a [[higher power]] more than males. They also participate more in organized and personal forms of religion. Females also are more likely to feel like religion is a major factor in their lives. In regards to race, Latinos and [[African American]]s show higher rates of participation in religion than [[European American|White Americans]]. Religious importance also varies from country to country. In a study of emerging adults, Japanese said that religion had a 0 percent importance in their lives compared to a high of 93 percent saying it has a very high importance in their lives in Nigeria. 40 percent of emerging adults in Sweden believe in God compared to a high of 100 percent belief in God in Pakistan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8271">The '''Rule of Three''' (also '''Three-fold Law''' or '''Law of Return''') is a religious tenet held by some [[Wicca]]ns/Pagans and occultists. It states that whatever [[energy]] a person puts out into the world, be it positive or negative, will be returned to that person three times. Some subscribe to a variant of this law in which return is not necessarily threefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=MacMorgan-Douglas, Kaatryn | title=All One Wicca: A study in the universal eclectic tradition of wicca. | publisher=Covenstead Press|  location=Buffalo, NY| year=2007|edition=Tenth Anniversary | isbn=978-0-615-15094-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Treleven, Amethyst | title=Seeker's Guide to Learning Wicca: Training to First Degree for the Northern Hemisphere.| publisher=Oak &amp; Mistletoe|location=Adelaide, South Australia| year=2008| isbn= 978-0-9805818-2-9 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rule of Three is sometimes described as [[karma]] by Wiccans; however, this is not strictly accurate. Both concepts describe the process of cause and effect and often encourage the individual to act in an upright way. In [[Hindu]] [[Vedanta]] literature, there is a comparable idea of threefold [[Karma]] referred to as Sanchita (accumulated works), Prarabdha (fructifying works) and Kriyamana, Agami, or Vartamana (current works), which are associated with past, present and future respectively. According to some traditions, the rule of three is not literal but symbolizes that our energy returns our way as many times as needed for us to learn the lesson associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;Witch School First Degree: Lessons in the Correllian Tradition (Witch School) by Rev.

According to John Coughlin, the Law posits "a literal reward or punishment tied to one's actions, particularly when it comes to working magic".&lt;ref name="Coughlin"&gt;Coughlin, John J. (2001) [http://www.waningmoon.com/ethics/3fl-1.shtml The Three-fold Law]&lt;/ref&gt; The law is not a universal article of faith among Wiccans, and "there are many Wiccans, experienced and new alike, who view the Law of Return as an over-elaboration on the [[Wiccan Rede]]."&lt;ref name="Coughlin"/&gt; Some Wiccans believe that it is a modern innovation based on [[Christianity|Christian]] morality.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Guy (September 2001).

The Rule of Three has been compared by Karl Lembke to other [[Ethic of reciprocity|ethics of reciprocity]], such as the concept of [[karma]] in [[Dharmic religions]] and the [[Golden Rule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usca&amp;c=words&amp;id=3801 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508032805/http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usca&amp;c=words&amp;id=3801 |archivedate=2005-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rule of Three has a possible prototype in a piece of Wiccan liturgy which first appeared in print in [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s 1949 novel ''[[High Magic's Aid]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Gerald|authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|title=High Magic's Aid|year=1949|publisher=Pentacle Enterprises|isbn=1-872189-06-7|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coughlin, John J.

However, The Threefold Law as an actual "law", was an interpretation of Wiccan ideas and ritual, made by noted witch Monique Wilson (1923-1982) and further popularized by [[Raymond Buckland]], in his books on Wicca.  Prior to this innovation by Wilson and its subsequent inclusion in publications, Wiccan ideas of reciprocal ethics were far less defined and more often interpreted as a kind of general karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Luthaneal |title=The Book of Mirrors |year=2011 |publisher=Capall Bann |location=UK |isbn=1-86163-325-4 |page=218|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/186163336X/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule was described by the Dutch metal band [[Nemesea]], in the song "Threefold Law", from the album ''[[Mana (Nemesea album)|Mana]]''.

== Anthroposophy ==

Though much closer to [[Rosicrucianism]] than Wicca, [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s "spiritual science" or "[[anthroposophy]]"  includes a type of threefold law. This is not, however, a theory of power. In Anthroposophy, the focus is on gaining the supersensible insight to bring spiritual power to any natural area of human endeavor like art, education, business, or politics - and also less obviously practical human pursuits like religion or philosophy. 

Steiner lays out this theory in a fairly comprehensive way in his 1904 book, "Knowledge of Higher Worlds and its Attainment." In chapter two, "The Stages of Initiation," he states the threefold law as follows.

"...Once the student has found the beginnings of spiritual vision by means of such exercises, he may proceed to the contemplation of man himself. Simple phenomena of human life must first be chosen. But before making any attempt in this direction it is imperative for the student to strive for the absolute purity of his moral character. He must banish all thought of ever using knowledge gained in this way for his own personal benefit. He must be convinced that he would never, under any circumstances, avail himself in an evil sense of any power he may gain over his fellow-creatures. For this reason, all who seek to discover through personal vision the secrets in human nature must follow the golden rule of true spiritual science. This golden rule is as follows:  '''For every one step that you take in the pursuit of higher knowledge, take three steps in the perfection of your own character'''." (Knowledge of Higher Worlds and its Attainment, 1904) (&lt;ref&gt;http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/AP1947/GA010_c02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of the law is not on any obvious consequences to the practitioner; it's more of a natural law. Without having taken the requisite steps, one will not ''be able to'' make an advance into true knowledge. One may get some results, but those results are likely to be delusions, into which one can fall at any time.

'''Sabbath''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|b|ə|θ}}) ({{Lang-he|שַׁבָּת}}) is a day set aside for rest and worship. According to the [[Book of Exodus]] the Sabbath is a day of rest on the seventh day, [[Ten Commandments|commanded]] by [[God]] to be kept as a [[Holiday|holy day]] of rest, as God rested from [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sabbath&lt;/ref&gt; It is observed differently among the [[Abrahamic religions]] and informs a similar occasion in several other practices. Although many viewpoints and definitions have arisen over the millennia, most originate in the same textual tradition of: "[[Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy]]".

The term has been used to describe a similar weekly observance in any of several other traditions; the first crescent or [[new moon]]; any of seven annual festivals in Judaism and some [[Christian]] traditions; any of eight annual [[pagan]] festivals (usually "[[Wheel of the Year|sabbat]]"); an annual secular holiday; and a year of rest in religious or secular usage, the [[sabbath year]], originally every seventh year.

==Biblical Sabbath==
{{details|Biblical Sabbath}}
[[File:Tissot The Sabbath-Breaker Stoned.jpg|thumb|''The Sabbath-Breaker Stoned'' (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]
[[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] (as the verb שָׁבַת֙ ''šāḇaṯ'') is first mentioned in the [[Genesis creation narrative]], where the seventh day is set aside as a day of rest (in Hebrew, ''shabbath''), and made holy by [[God]] ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:2–3|KJV}}). Observation and remembrance of Sabbath ({{Lang-he|שַׁבָּת}} ''šabbaṯ'') is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] (the fourth in the original [[Jewish]], the [[Eastern Orthodox]], and most [[Protestant]] traditions, the third in [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] traditions). Most people who observe the Sabbath regard it as having been instituted as a perpetual [[covenant (Biblical)|covenant]] for the [[Israelites]] ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|31:13–17|KJV}}), as a sign respecting two events: the day during which God rested after having completed [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] in six days ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|20:8–11|KJV}}), and the Israelites' [[The Exodus|deliverance from Egypt]] ({{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:12–15|KJV}}). The different Sabbaths were to be revered as a shadow of the Christ who was to come (Colossians 2:16–17) who would give mankind rest from their labors in trying to make themselves acceptable before God. For if we rest in the work of Christ on the cross, then we can cease from our own works or self efforts in trying to make ourselves acceptable before God (Hebrews: 4:9–11), however the weekly Sabbath was still to be kept even after Jesus' ascension (Matthew 24:20). Originally, [[Sabbath breaking|Sabbath-breakers]] were officially to be [[List of capital crimes in the Torah#Religious practices|cut off from the assembly or potentially killed]] ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|31:15|KJV}}). Observance in the [[Hebrew Bible]] was universally from [[Day#Boundaries of the day|sixth-day sundown]] to seventh-day sundown ({{Bibleverse||Nehemiah|13:19|KJV}}, cf. {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|23:32|KJV}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cev bible, search keyword 'like sabbath'|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=like+sabbath&amp;qs_version=CEV}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[seven-day week]].

===Seven-day week===
{{Main article|Seven-day week}}
By [[synecdoche]] (naming the whole for a part), in Jewish sources by the time of the [[Septuagint]], the term "Sabbath" ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''Sabbaton'', Strong's ''4521'') also came to mean an entire "[[se'nnight]]" or seven-day week, the interval between two weekly Sabbaths. [[Jesus]]'s [[parable]] of the [[Pharisee and the Publican]] ({{Bibleverse||Luke|18:9–14|KJV}}) describes the [[Pharisee]] as fasting "twice a week" ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''dis tou sabbatou'', literally, "Twice of the Sabbath").

===High Sabbaths===
{{Main article|High Sabbaths}}
"High Sabbaths" are observed by Jews and some Christians. Seven annual Biblical festivals, called ''miqra'' ("called assembly") in Hebrew and "High Sabbath" in English and serving as supplemental testimonies to Sabbath, are specified in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Deuteronomy]]; they do not necessarily fall on weekly Sabbath. Three occur in spring: the first and seventh days of [[Pesach]] ([[Passover (Christian holiday)|Passover]]), and [[Shavuot]] ([[Pentecost]]). Four occur in fall, in the seventh month, and are also called ''Shabbaton'': [[Rosh Hashanah]] ([[Feast of Trumpets (Christian holiday)|Trumpets]]); [[Yom Kippur]], "Sabbath of Sabbaths" ([[Christian observances of Yom Kippur|Atonement]]); and the first and eighth days of [[Sukkoth]] ([[Christian observances of Jewish holidays#Feast of Tabernacles|Tabernacles]]). "High Sabbaths" is also often a synonym of "[[High Holy Days]]", viz., Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.

===Shmita (Sabbath)===
{{details|Shmita}}
''Shmita'' ({{lang-he|שמטה}}, Strong's 8059 as ''sh&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;mittah'', literally "release"), also called sabbatical year, is the seventh (שביעי, Strong's 7637 as ''sh&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;biy'iy'') year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by [[Torah]] for the [[Land of Israel]], relatively little observed in Biblical tradition, but still observed in contemporary [[Judaism]]. During ''Shmita'', the land is left to lie [[fallow]] and all agricultural activity, including plowing, planting, pruning and harvesting, is forbidden by Torah and [[halakha|Jewish law]]. By tradition, other cultivation techniques (such as watering, fertilizing, weeding, spraying, trimming and mowing) may be performed as preventative measures only, not to improve the growth of trees or plants; additionally, whatever fruits grow of their own accord during that year are deemed ''hefker'' (ownerless), not for the landowner but for the poor, the stranger, and the beasts of the field; these fruits may be picked by anyone. A variety of laws also apply to the sale, consumption and disposal of ''Shmita'' produce. When the year ended, all debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted ({{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|15:1–11|KJV}}); in similar fashion, Torah requires a slave who had worked for six years to go free in the seventh year. [[Leviticus]] 25 promises bountiful harvests to those who observe ''Shmita'', and describes its observance as a test of religious faith. The term ''Shmita'' is translated "release" five times in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] (from the root שמט, ''shamat'', "''desist'', ''remit''", 8058).

==Judaism==

===Shabbat===
{{Main article|Shabbat}}
{{see also|Hebrew calendar}}
Jewish ''Shabbat'' (''Shabbath'', ''Shabbes'', ''Shobos'', etc.) is a weekly day of rest, observed from sundown on Friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night. It is also observed by a minority of Christians, such as adherents of [[Messianic Judaism]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist]]s. [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|Thirty-nine activities prohibited on ''Shabbat'']] are listed in Tractate ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' ([[Talmud]]). Customarily, ''Shabbat'' is ushered in by lighting [[candle]]s shortly before sunset, at [[halakhic]]ally calculated times that change weekly and geographically. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered'', a translation by [[Robert Eisenman]] and Michael Wise, reveals the [[Essenes|Essene]] calendar as celebrating the Sabbath commencing on the 4th day of Abib (Nisan) page 192 3 days after the new moon of the Passover month then celebrated on the 11th, 18th and 25th. The second Essene month reveals a Sabbath on the second day exactly 7 days from the 25th of Abib Sabbath witnessing a solar calendar continuation for the rest of the year. The Essenes did it this way to be in harmony with the book of Genesis where God created the moon and sun on the 4th day and rested 3 days later.

[[Judah ha-Levi]] (12th century) proposed a nascent Jewish [[date line]] for dating of ''Shabbat'', later calculated to fall between [[China]] and [[Japan]] (other lines exist, and travelers are expected to note both personal and local ''Shabbat''); and [[Anarchism and Orthodox Judaism|Pinchas Elijah Horovitz]] (18th century) stated that polar regions should observe ''Shabbat'' based on calculating 24-hour days, although without establishing a date line.

''Shabbat'' is a widely noted hallmark of Jewish peoples. [[Subbotniks]] (literally, Sabbatarians) are a Russian sect, categorized as either Jews or [[Judaizers|Judaizing]] Christians, that became particularly branded by strict ''Shabbat'' observance; (Hungarian-born radical [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] leader Ignaz Einhorn even shifted his congregation's ''Shabbat'' worship to Sundays.) Several weekly ''Shabbat''s per year are designated as [[Special Sabbaths]], such as ''Shabbat haGadol'', prior to [[Pesach]] (literally, "the High Sabbath", but not to be confused with other [[High Sabbaths]]); and ''Shabbat Teshuvah'', prior to [[Yom Kippur]] ("Repentance Sabbath").

===Shabbaton===
{{Main article|Shabbaton}}
Colloquially, in contemporary Israel, the term ''Shabbaton'' or ''Shaboson'' means an event or program of education and usually celebration held on ''[[Shabbat]]'', or over an entire [[weekend]] with main focus on ''Shabbat''. Such events are held by youth groups, singles groups, synagogues, schools, social groups, charitable groups or family reunions, can be either multi-generational and wide-open or limited-group, and can be held where a group usually meets or offsite. "''Shabbaton''", rather than just "[[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]]", signifies recognition of the importance of ''Shabbat'' in the event or program.{{Citation Needed|date=June 2018}}

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Sabbath in Christianity}}
{{See also|Gregorian calendar}}
In [[Eastern Christianity]], the Sabbath is considered still to be on [[Saturday]], the seventh day, in remembrance of the Hebrew Sabbath. In [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and most sects of Protestantism, the "[[Lord's Day]]" (Greek Κυριακή) is considered to be on Sunday, the first day (and "eighth day"). Communal worship, including the Holy Mysteries, may take place on any day, but a weekly observance of the resurrection is made consistently on Sunday. [[Western Christianity]] sometimes refers to the Lord's Day as a "Christian Sabbath", distinct from the Hebrew Sabbath, but related in varying manner.

===First-day===
{{details|Puritan Sabbath}}
Since [[Puritan]] times, most English-speaking [[Protestant]]s identify the "[[Lord's Day]]" (viz., Sunday) with a "[[Sunday Sabbath|Christian Sabbath]]", a term [[Roman Catholic]]s in those areas may also celebrate with the [[Eucharist]].  It is considered both the first day and the "eighth day" of the seven-day week. Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] generally follow the stronger of first-day Christian Sabbatarian traditions, avoiding shopping, leisure activities, and work unless absolutely necessary. In [[Tonga]], all commerce and entertainment activities cease on Sunday, starting at midnight and ending the next day, at midnight, as Tonga's constitution declares the Sabbath sacred forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of Tonga |url=https://www.parliament.gov.to/parliamentary-business/documents/constitution-of-tonga/file/115-constitution-of-tonga-revised-1988 |website=Parliament of Tonga |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has observed both Sunday Resurrection Day and [[Saturday Sabbath]] in different ways for several centuries, as have other [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions.

[[Puritan]] Sabbatarianism or [[Reformed]] Sabbatarianism is strict observance of [[Sabbath in Christianity]] that is typically characterized by its avoidance of [[leisure|recreational]] activities. "Puritan Sabbath", expressed in the ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'', is often contrasted with "[[Continental Europe|Continental]] Sabbath": the latter follows the Continental [[Reformed Christian confessions of faith|Reformed confessions]] such as the ''[[Heidelberg Catechism]]'', which emphasize rest and [[worship]] on [[Lord's Day]], but do not forbid recreational activities.

===Seventh-day===
{{Main article|Sabbath in seventh-day churches}}
Several Christian denominations observe Sabbath in a similar manner to Judaism, though with observance ending at Saturday sunset instead of Saturday nightfall. Early church historians [[Sozomen]] and [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]] cite the seventh day as the Christian day of worship except for the Christians in Rome and Alexandria. Many Sabbatarian Judeo-Christian groups were attested during the Middle Ages; the [[Szekler Sabbatarians]] were founded in 1588 from among the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]] and maintained a presence until the group converted to Judaism in the 1870s. [[Seventh Day Baptist]]s have observed Sabbath on Saturday since the mid-17th century (either from sundown or from midnight), and influenced the (now more numerous) [[Seventh-day Adventists]] in America to begin the practice in the mid-19th century. They believe that keeping [[seventh-day Sabbath]] is a moral responsibility equal to that of any of the other [[Ten Commandments]], based on the example of [[Jesus]]. They also use "Lord's Day" to mean the seventh day, based on Scriptures in which God calls the day "my Sabbath" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|31:13|KJV}}) and "to the {{LORD}}" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|16:23|KJV}}) and in which Jesus calls himself "Lord of Sabbath" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|12:8|KJV}}). The question of defining Sabbath worldwide on a round earth was resolved by some [[seventh-day Sabbatarian]]s by making use of the [[International Date Line]] (i.e., permitting local rest-day adjustment, {{Bibleverse||Esther|9:16–19|KJV}}), while others (such as some [[Alaska]]n Sabbatarians) keep Sabbath according to [[Jerusalem]] time (i.e., rejecting manmade temporal customs, {{Bibleverse||Daniel|7:25|KJV}}). Many of the [[Lemba people|Lemba]] in [[southern Africa]], like some other African tribes, are Christians and claim [[African Jews|common descent]] from the Biblical [[Israelites]], keep one day a week holy like Sabbath, and maintain many beliefs and practices associated with Judaism.

===Seventh-day versus First-day===
{{Main article|Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath in seventh-day churches}}

In 321 AD, Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]] enacted the first civil law regarding Sunday observance. The law did not mention the Sabbath by name, but referred to a day of rest on "the venerable day of the sun."
{{quote|On the venerable day of the sun let the magistrate and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country however, persons engaged in agricultural work may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits; because it often happens that another day is not so suitable for grain growing or for vine planting; lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations the bounty of heaven should be lost.&lt;ref&gt;Schaff’s History of the Christian Church, vol. III, chap. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An Abridgment of the Christian Doctrine: 
:Q. How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days?
:A. By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves, by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church.
:Q. How prove you that?
:A. Because by keeping Sunday, they acknowledge the church’s power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin; and by not keeping the rest [of the feasts] by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Henry Tuberville, D.D. (R.C.), (1833), An Abridgment of the Christian Doctrine. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augsburg Confession:
:They [the Catholics] allege the Sabbath changed into Sunday, the Lord’s day, contrary to the decalogue, as it appears; neither is there any example more boasted of than the changing of the Sabbath day. Great, they say, is the power and authority of the church, since it dispensed with one of the ten commandments.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 28. Augsburg Confession.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Doctrinal Catechism,
:Q. Have you any other way of proving that the Church has power to institute festivals of precept?
:A. Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her. She could not have substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Stephen Keenan, (1851), A Doctrinal Catechism. p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic Christian:
:Q. Has the [Catholic] church power to make any alterations in the commandments of God?
:A. ...Instead of the seventh day, and other festivals appointed by the old law, the church has prescribed the Sundays and holy days to be set apart for God’s worship; and these we are now obliged to keep in consequence of God’s commandment, instead of the ancient Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Christian Instructed in the Sacraments, Sacrifices, Ceremonies, and Observances of the Church By Way of Question and Answer, RT Rev.

===New moon===
{{See also|New moon}}
The new moon, occurring every 29 or 30 days, is an important separately sanctioned occasion in Judaism and some other faiths. It is not widely regarded as Sabbath, but some [[Hebrew Roots|messianic]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches,{{cn|date=September 2018}} such as the native New Israelites of Peru and the [[Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church]], do keep the day of the new moon as Sabbath or rest day, from evening to evening. New-moon services can last all day.

===Day of the Vow===
{{Main article|Day of the Vow}}
Day of the Vow or [[Dingane]]'s Day ([[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] ''Geloftedag'' or ''Dingaansdag'', December 16) was the name of a religious public holiday in [[South Africa]] commemorating a famous [[Boer]] victory over the [[Zulu people|Zulu]]. Celebrated as annual Sabbath (a holy day of thanksgiving) since 1838, it was renamed [[Day of Reconciliation]] in 1994. The anniversary and its commemoration are intimately connected with various streams of [[Afrikaner]] and South African nationalism.

===Millennial Sabbath===
{{Main article|Millennial Day Theory}}
Since [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in the early third century, Christians have often considered that some thousand-year Sabbath, expected to begin six thousand years after Creation, might be identical with the [[millennialism|millennium]] described in the [[Book of Revelation]]. This view was also popular among 19th- and 20th-century [[dispensationalism|dispensational]] [[premillennialist]]s. The term "Sabbatism" or "Sabbatizing" (Greek ''Sabbatismos''), which generically means any literal or spiritual Sabbath-keeping, has also been taken in {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|4:9|KJV}} to have special reference to this definition.

===Spiritual Sabbath===
As another minority view, some modern Christians uphold Sabbath principles but do not limit observance to either Saturday or Sunday, instead advocating rest on any one chosen day of the week as following the spirit of Sabbath, or advocating Sabbath as instead a symbolic metaphor for rest in Christ. These look upon Sabbath as a principle to be observed in spirit rather than in letter, regarding the rest offered in [[Jesus]] as the only New Testament admonishment containing the root word of "Sabbath" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:28|KJV}}) and sometimes as a more permanent rest than a day could fulfill ({{Bibleverse||Hebrews|4:9|KJV}}).

===Latter Day Saint Movement===
In 1831, [[Joseph Smith]] published a revelation commanding his related movement, the formative [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], to go to the house of prayer, offer up their sacraments, rest from their labors, and pay their devotions on the Lord's day (D&amp;C 59:9–12).
In a revelation given to founder [[Joseph Smith]] in 1831, the Lord commanded: {{quote|That thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day; for verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High.|D&amp;C 59:9–10&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mormons believe this means performing no labor that would keep them from giving their full attention to spiritual matters (Ex. 20:10). LDS prophets have described this as meaning they should not shop, hunt, fish, attend sports events, or participate in similar activities on that day. Elder [[Spencer W. Kimball]] wrote in his ''[[The Miracle of Forgiveness]]'' that mere idle lounging on the Sabbath does not keep the day holy, and that it calls for constructive thoughts and acts.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Miracle of Forgiveness]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons are encouraged to prepare their meals with "singleness of heart" on the Sabbath &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59?lang=eng LDS.org D&amp;C 59:13]&lt;/ref&gt;(D&amp;C 59:13) and believe the day is only for righteous activities (Is. 58:13.) In most areas of the world, Mormons worship on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/study/topics/sabbath?lang=eng LDS.org - Study by Topic - Sabbath]&lt;/ref&gt;

In harmony with this revelation, members of the LDS church attend [[sacrament meeting]] each week. Other Sabbath-day activities may include: praying, meditating, studying the scriptures and the teachings of latter-day prophets, writing letters to family members and friends, reading wholesome material, visiting the sick and distressed, and attending other Church meetings.&lt;ref&gt;True to the Faith, p. 146 http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/36863_eng.pdf{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main article|Jumu'ah}}
{{See also|Islamic calendar}}
The [[Quran]] acknowledges a six-part Creation period (32:4, 50:38) and the [[Biblical Sabbath]] as the seventh-day (''yaum as-Sabt'': 2:65, 4:47, 154, 7:163, 16:124), but [[Allah]]'s mounting the throne after Creation is taken in contradistinction to [[Elohim]]'s concluding and resting from his labors, and so Muslims replace Sabbath rest with ''jumu'ah'' ([[Arabic]] جمعة ). Also known as "Friday prayer", ''jumu'ah'' is a congregational prayer (''[[salat]]'') held every Friday (the Day of Assembly), just after midday, in place of the otherwise daily ''[[dhuhr]]'' prayer; it commemorates the [[Islamic view of Adam|creation of Adam]] on the sixth day, as a loving gathering of Adam's sons. The Quran states: "When the call is proclaimed to prayer on Friday, hasten earnestly to the Remembrance of Allah, and leave off business: That is best for you if ye but knew" (62:9). The next verse ("When the prayer is ended, then disperse in the land ...") leads many Muslims not to consider Friday a rest day, as in [[Indonesia]], which regards the seventh-day Sabbath as unchanged; but many Muslim countries, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bangladesh]], do consider Friday a nonwork day, a holiday or a weekend; and other Muslim countries, like [[Pakistan]], count it as half a rest day (after the Friday prayer is over). ''Jumu'ah'' attendance is strictly incumbent upon all free adult males who are legal residents of the locality.

==Other religious traditions==

===Babylonian rest days===
{{Main article|Babylonian calendar#Days|Shappatum}}
Counting from the [[new moon]], the Babylonians celebrated the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th as "holy-days", also called "evil days" (meaning "unsuitable" for prohibited activities). On these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to "make a wish", and at least the 28th was known as a "rest-day". On each of them, offerings were made to a different god and goddess. Tablets from the 6th-century BCE reigns of [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Cambyses]] indicate these dates were sometimes approximate. The [[lunation]] of 29 or 30 days basically contained three [[seven-day week]]s, and a final week of nine or ten days inclusive, breaking the continuous seven-day cycle. The Babylonians additionally celebrated the 19th as a special "evil day", the "day of anger", because it was roughly the 49th day of the (preceding) month, completing a "week of weeks", also with sacrifices and prohibitions. Difficulties with [[Friedrich Delitzsch]]'s [[origin theory]] connecting Hebrew ''[[Shabbat]]'' with the Babylonian [[lunar cycle]] include reconciling the differences between an unbroken week and a lunar week, and explaining the absence of texts naming the lunar week as ''Shabbat'' in any language. Reconstruction of a broken tablet seems to define the rarely attested Babylonian [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] word ''Sapattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''Sabattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' as the [[full moon]]: this word is cognate or merged with Hebrew ''Shabbat'', but is monthly rather than weekly. It is regarded as a form of [[Sumer]]ian ''sa-bat'' ("mid-rest"), attested in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''um nuh libbi'' ("day of mid-repose"). This conclusion is a contextual restoration of the damaged [[Enûma Eliš]] [[creation mythos]], which is read as: "[Sa]pattu shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly."

The [[pentecontad calendar]], thought to be of [[Amorite]] origin, includes a period known to [[Babylonia]]ns as ''Shappatum''. The year is broken down into seven periods of fifty days (made up of seven weeks of seven days, containing seven weekly Sabbaths, and an extra fiftieth day, known as the ''atzeret''), plus an annual supplement of fifteen or sixteen days, called ''Shappatum'', the period of harvest time at the end of each year. Identified and reconstructed by Hildegaard and Julius Lewy in the 1940s, the calendar's use dates back to at least the 3rd millennium BCE in Western [[Mesopotamia]] and surrounding areas; it was used by the [[Canaan]]ite tribes, thought by some to have been used by the [[Israelite]]s prior to [[King Solomon]], and related to the [[liturgical]] calendar of the [[Essene]]s at [[Qumran]]. Used well into the modern age, forms of it have been found in [[Nestorianism]] and among the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ''[[fellaheen]]''. Julius Morgenstern believed that the calendar of the [[Jubilees]] had ancient origins as a somewhat modified survival of the pentecontad calendar.

===Zoroastrianism===
{{See also|Zoroastrian festivals}}
In relating to the seventh and other days of the month, the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] contributed to the [[Jewish calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haas|first1=W.S.|title=Iran|date=1946|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of writings by early Christians in the [[New Testament apocrypha]] ([[Zostrianos]], [[Marsenes]] and [[Allogenes]]) describe God's revelation received by a man named [[Zostrianos]].  Further evidence of Zoroastrian influence on Judaic tradition is demonstrated through [[Nehemiah]], the Priest in the [[Book of Nehemiah]], a book of the [[Neviim]] contained in the [[Tanakh]]. With the support and protection of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]] (445/444 BCE), Nehemiah purified the Temple and the priests and Levites and enforced the observance of the law of Moses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allbright|first1=William|title=The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey|date=1963|publisher=Harpercollins College Div}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{See also|Second Temple}}

For exemplar, the observance of [[Passover]] coincides with [[Nowruz]], the Zoroastrian New Year which marks the first day of spring or vernal [[Equinox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haas|first1=W.S.|title=Iran|date=1946|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist rest day===
{{Main article|Uposatha}}
The ''Uposatha'' has been observed since [[Gautama Buddha]]'s time (500 BCE), and is still being kept today in [[Theravada Buddhist]] countries. It occurs every seven or eight days, in accordance with the four phases of the moon. Buddha taught that ''Uposatha'' is for "the cleansing of the defiled mind", resulting in inner calm and joy. On this day, [[Śrāvaka|disciples]] and [[monk]]s intensify their practice, deepen their knowledge, and express communal commitment through millennia-old acts of lay-monastic reciprocity.

{{details|Wan Phra}}
[[Thai Chinese]] likewise observe their Sabbaths and [[traditional Chinese holidays]] according to lunar phases, but not on exactly the same days as ''Uposatha''. These Sabbaths cycle through the month with respect to the [[Thai solar calendar]], so common Thai calendars incorporate Thai and [[Chinese calendar]] lunar dates, as well as ''Uposatha'' dates, for [[religion|religious]] purposes.

===Cherokee rest days===
The first day of the [[new moon]], beginning at sunrise, is a [[holiday]] of [[leisure|quiet reflection]] and [[prayer]] among the [[Cherokee]]. Monthly [[fasting]] is encouraged, for up to four days. Work, cooking, sex and childbirth were also prohibited during the empty moon days, called "un-time" or "non-days"; childbirth during these days was considered unlucky. The Cherokee [[new year]], the "great new moon" or "Hunting Moon", is the first new moon in [[autumn]], after the setting of the [[Pleiades]] star cluster and around the time of the [[Leonids]] meteoric shower.

===Sabbath as Saturday===
{{details|Saturday}}
One [[folk tradition]] in English is the widespread use of "Sabbath" as a synonym of midnight-to-midnight "Saturday" (literally, [[Saturn]]'s day in at least a dozen languages): this is a simplification of the use of "Sabbath" in other religious contexts, where the two do not coincide. (Using midnight instead of sundown as delimiter dates back to the [[Roman Empire]].) In over thirty other languages, the [[week-day names|common name]] for this day in the [[seven-day week]] is a cognate of "Sabbath". "[[Sabbatini]]", originally "Sabbadini", often "Sabatini", etc., is a very frequent Italian name form ("[[Christodoulos Sabbatos|Sabbatos]]" is the Greek form), indicating a family whose ancestor was born on Saturday, Italian ''sabato''; "Domenico" indicated birth on Sunday. In [[vampire hunter]] lore, people born on Saturday were specially designated as ''sabbatianoí'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] and ''sâbotnichavi'' in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (rendered in English as "Sabbatarians"). It was also believed in the [[Balkans]] that someone born on a Saturday could see a [[vampire]] when it was otherwise invisible.

===Wicca===
{{See also|Sabbat|Esbat|Witches' Sabbath}}
The annual cycle of the Earth's seasons is called the Wheel of the Year in [[Wicca]] and [[neopagan]]ism. Eight [[sabbat]]s (occasionally "sabbaths", or "Sun sabbats") are spaced at approximately even intervals throughout the year. [[Samhain]], which coincides with [[Halloween]], is considered the first sabbat of the year.

An esbat is a ritual observance of the [[full moon]] in Wicca and neopaganism. Some groups extend the esbat to include the dark moon and the first and last quarters. "Esbat" and "sabbat" are distinct and are probably not [[cognate]] terms, although an esbat is also called "moon sabbat".

European records from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 17th century or later also place Witches' Sabbaths on similar dates to sabbats in modern Wicca, but with some disagreement; medieval reports of sabbat activity are generally not firsthand and may be imaginative, but many persons were accused of, or tried for, taking part in sabbats.

===Unification Church===
{{See also|Ahn Shi Il}}
The [[Unification Church]] has a regular day of worship on Sunday, but every eight days Unificationists celebrate the day of Ahn Shi Il, considered as Sabbath but cycling among the weekdays of the Gregorian calendar. The [[Family Pledge]], formerly recited at 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Sundays, was moved to Ahn Shi Il in 1994 and includes eight verses containing the phrase "by centering on true love".

==Secular traditions==

===Rest day in seven-day weeks===
{{See also|Secular day of rest|Weekend}}
Secular use of "Sabbath" for "rest day", while it usually refers to the same period of time (Sunday) as the majority Christian use of "Sabbath", is often stated in [[North America]] to refer to different purposes for the rest day than those of [[Christendom]]. In ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'' (1961), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that contemporary [[Maryland]] [[blue law]]s (typically, Sunday rest laws) were intended to promote the secular values of "health, safety, recreation, and general well-being" through a common day of rest, and that this day coinciding with majority Christian Sabbath neither reduces its effectiveness for secular purposes nor prevents adherents of other religions from observing their own holy days. [[Massachusetts]], uncharacteristically, does not specify the weekday in its "Day of Rest" statute, providing only that one day off from work is required every week; an unspecified weekly day off is a very widespread business production cycle. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]], in ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]]'' (1985) and ''[[R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd.]]'' (1986), found some blue laws invalid for having no legitimate secular purpose, but others valid because they had no religious purpose.

The weekend is that period of the week set aside by custom or law for rest from labor. In many countries it is Saturday and Sunday and often includes Friday night. This five-day workweek arose in [[United States|America]] when [[labor union]]s attempted to accommodate Jewish Sabbath, beginning at a [[New England]] [[cotton mill]] and also instituted by [[Henry Ford]] in 1926; it became standard in America by about 1940 and spread among English-speaking and European countries to become the international workweek. [[China]] adopted it in 1995 and [[Hong Kong]] by 2006. [[India]] and some other countries follow both the international workweek and a more traditional Saturday half-workday and Sunday weekend. While [[Indonesia]] and [[Lebanon]] have the international workweek, most Muslim countries count Friday as the weekend, alone or with Thursday (all or half) or Saturday. Some universities permit a three-day weekend from Friday to Sunday. The weekend in [[Israel]], [[Nepal]], and parts of [[Malaysia]], is Friday (all or half) and Saturday. Only the one-day customary or legal weekends are usually called "Sabbath".

===Rest day in other weeks===
{{See also|Blank day|Chinese week|Décadi|Soviet week}}
State-mandated rest days are widespread. Laws of the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE) required imperial officials to rest on every ''mu'' (every fifth day), within a ten-day Chinese week. The rest day was changed to ''huan'' or ''xún'' (every tenth day) in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907).

The [[calendar reform|reform calendar]] of the [[French Revolution]] was used from 1793 to 1805. It contained twelve months of three ten-day weeks; the five or six extra days needed to approximate the [[tropical year]] were placed after the months at the end of each year. The tenth day of each week, ''décadi'', replaced Sunday as the day of rest and festivity in France.

From 1929 to 1931, the [[Soviet Union]] mandated a [[Soviet calendar|five-day week]], with each day designated by color as a state rest day for a different 20% of the workforce; families usually did not share rest days. Three weeks a year were six or seven days, because interrupted by holidays. From 1931 to 1940, the Soviets mandated a six-day week, with state rest days for all upon the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, and 30th of each [[Gregorian month]], as well as upon March 1. This also necessitated varying weeks of five to seven days over the year.

Among many calendar reform proposals that eliminate the constant [[seven-day week]] in exchange for simplified calculation of calendrical data like [[weekday names]] for given dates, some retain Sabbatical influences. The [[Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar]] uses [[moon phases]], resulting in weeks of six to nine days. The [[International Fixed Calendar]] and [[World Calendar]] both consist of 364-day years containing exactly 52 weeks (each starting on a day designated as Sunday), with an additional one or two [[intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] "blank" days not designated as part of any week (Year Day and Leap Day in the International Fixed Calendar; Worldsday and Leapyear Day in the World Calendar). Reform supporters sought to accommodate Sabbatical observance by retaining the modified week and designating the intercalary days as additional Sabbaths or [[holidays]]; however, religious leaders held that such days disrupt the traditional seven-day weekly cycle. This unresolved issue contributed to the cessation of reform activities in the 1930s (International Fixed Calendar) and again in 1955 (World Calendar), though supporters of both proposals remain.

===Subbotnik===
{{Main article|Subbotnik}}
The subbotnik is a weekly day of volunteer work on Saturday in [[Russia]], other (former) [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s, the [[Eastern Bloc]], and the [[German Democratic Republic]], sporadically observed since 1919. The ''voskresnik'' is a related volunteer workday on Sunday. They focus on community service work; "[[Lenin]]'s Subbotnik" was also observed annually around his birthday.

===Sabbatical===
{{Main article|Sabbatical}}
From the biblical sabbatical year came the modern concept of a 'sabbatical', a prolonged, often one-year, hiatus in the career of an individual (not usually tied to a seven-year period). Such a period is often taken in order to fulfill some goal such as writing a book or traveling extensively for research. Some universities and other institutional employers of scientists, physicians, or academics offer paid sabbatical as an employee benefit, called "sabbatical leave"; some companies offer unpaid sabbatical for people wanting to take career breaks.

In [[Catholic]] teaching, an '''omission''' is a failure to do something one can and ought to do. If an omission happens deliberately and freely, it is considered a [[sin]].

The degree of [[culpability|guilt]] incurred by an omission is measured, like that attaching to sins of commission, by the dignity of the virtue and the magnitude of the precept to which the omission is opposed, as well as the amount of deliberation.

A person may be guilty of a sin of omission if he fails to do something which he is able to do and which he ought to do because he has put himself into a state or situation whereby he is unable to complete the action. For example, if a person chooses to become inebriated and is therefore unable to perform a necessary task, that person is responsible for that failure, even though that person is physically unable to perform the task because he or she knowingly put themselves into a state (drunkenness) where accomplishing the task was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delany|first1=J|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1911|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11251b.htm|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul the Apostle]] refers to this sin directly when he states "For I do not do the good I want ..." ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|7:19|ESV}}).

The '''State Administration for Religious Affairs''' ('''SARA''') was a functioning department under the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] which oversaw religious affairs for the [[People's Republic of China]]. Originally created in 1951 as the Religious Affairs Bureau, SARA was closely connected with the [[United Front Work Department]] and charged with overseeing the operations of China's five officially sanctioned religious organizations: 
* [[Buddhist Association of China]]
* [[Chinese Taoist Association]]
* [[Islamic Association of China]]
* [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] (Protestant)
* [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]]
SARA was dissolved in 2018, placing all religious affairs directly under the United Front Work Department.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2138279/bigger-overseas-liaison-agency-fuels-fears-about|title=Fears about Chinese influence grow as more powers given to shadowy agency|last=Ng|first=Teddy|date=21 March 2018|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Lau|first2=Mimi|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The State Administration for Religious Affairs was established to exercise control over religious appointments, the selection of clergy, and the interpretation of religious doctrine. SARA was also meant to ensure that the registered religious organizations support and carry out the policy priorities of the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=136443 Top Leaders Praise the Work of China's "Patriotic Religious Organizations"] , 10 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ye Xiaowen]] directed the SARA from 1995 to 2009. During his tenure, he issued the [[State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5]], which furthered state control over [[reincarnation]]s in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and attempted to suppress [[Roman Catholicism in China|underground Catholics]] loyal to [[Holy See|Rome]] (which he considered "colonial") and not to the government-sanctioned [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=16351&amp;size=A|title=CHINA Ye Xiaowen, party hound on Vatican and religions, is promoted|last=Cervellera|first=Bernardo|date=17 September 2009|website=www.asianews.it|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ye was promoted to the Secretary of the CPC Committee at the [[Central Institute of Socialism]], the former Deputy Director {{ill |Wang Zuoan|zh|王作安}} was promoted to Director.&lt;ref name="mingpao1"&gt;[http://news.sina.com.hk/cgi-bin/nw/show.cgi/94/1/1/1268390/1.html 宗教局長換人 專家指政策不變] (New Chairman for SARA, Experts Says Policy Has Not Changed), [[Ming Pao]], 18 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1056944.shtml?mc_cid=d34d47c815&amp;mc_eid=1f9d28130a |publisher=''[[Global Times]]'' |title=Party members told to give up religion for Party unity or face punishment |first=Caiyu |last=Liu |date=July 18, 2017 |quote=[...] Wang Zuoan, director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA) wrote in an article released in the Qiushi Journal on Saturday, the flagship magazine of the CPC Central Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Xi Jinping]] administration, it was announced in 2018 that SARA was being dissolved and its functions would be collapsed into the United Front Work Department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Tarikhaneh Temple''' ({{lang-fa|پرستشگاه تاریخانه}}), also called the '''Tarikhaneh Mosque''' ({{lang-fa|مسجد تاریخانه}}), is a [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid-era]] monument located on the southern limit of the present day city of [[Damghan]], [[Iran]]. This structure was initially used as a [[Zoroastrian]] [[Fire temple|Fire Temple]] during the Sassanid period, however, after the fall of the Sassanid Empire it was converted into a [[mosque]] in the 8th century. The monument is, thus, known as the oldest mosque in Iran.&lt;ref name=Rezaian126&gt;{{cite book |title=The Seven Auspicious Faces of Iran (هفت رخ فرخ ایران) |last=Rezaian (رضاییان) |first=Farzin (فرزین) |year=2007 |publisher= Green Circle (انتشارات دایره سبز) |isbn= |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Tarikhaneh1, Damghan, Iran.jpg|thumb|260px|A view of the [[portico]] of Tarikhaneh]]
''Tari'' is the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] term for God, and ''Khaneh'' is a [[Persian language|Persian]] word meaning house. Therefore, the compound word ''Tarikhaneh'', translates into "the house of God".

==Architecture and design==

The main plan consists of a square courtyard which is surrounded by arcades of barrel vaults supported by slightly pointed fired brick arches set on rather stumpy circular pillars, typical of the [[Sassanid architecture]]. The pillars are 3.5 meters tall and almost 2 meters in diameter.&lt;ref name=Goode&gt;{{cite book |title= The Oxford Companion to Architecture |last= Goode |first= Patrick |year=2009 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-860568-3 |page=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Michell&gt;{{cite book |title=Architecture of the Islamic World |author= Ernst J.

Petherbridge  |editor= George Michell |year=1978 |publisher= Thames and Hudson |isbn= 0-500-27847-4 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing together at a distance from the mosque are the remains of a square column of uncertain date, possibly part of the original construction period, and a cylindrical [[minaret]] from the [[Seljuk empire|Seljuk period]]. The latter was built in 1026-1029 to replace an older 9th century minaret, and is strikingly divided into six zones of ornamentation, each rendered in brick with a different geometric pattern. The minaret is 4.2 meters in diameter; its top has fallen, but originally it must have measured more the 30 meters high, with a gallery supported on [[muqarnas]] corbels.&lt;ref name=Blair96&gt;{{cite book |title= The monumental inscriptions from early Islamic Iran and Transoxiana |last= Blair |first= Sheila |year=1991 |publisher= Brill Academic Publishers |isbn= 978-90-04-09367-6 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Godard&gt;{{cite book |title= The Art of Iran |author= André Godard|editor=Michael Rogers|translator=Michael Heron |first= |year=1965 |publisher= Praeger |asin= B0006BMOO8 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O’Kane"&gt;{{cite book |title= Studies in Persian Art and Architecture |last= O'Kane  |first=Bernard |year=1995 |publisher= The American University in Cairo Press |isbn= 978-977-424-370-7 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teva Learning Alliance''' (formerly '''Teva Learning Center''') is a Jewish-based environmental education [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] that teaches about Judaism and the environment at Jewish day schools, summer camps and Hebrew schools.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|title=Love the Earth? Bless the Sun|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123872560930985495|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=3 April 2009 | first=Julie | last=Wiener}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only full-time year-round program dedicated to innovative, experiential Jewish education taught through the lens of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Westchester Jewish Conference, Organizations and Synagogues Directory 2009-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and mission==
The Teva Learning Center was developed in 1994 by the [[Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center]] and [[Surprise Lake Camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isabellafreedman.org/environment/teva |title=Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center |publisher=Isabellafreedman.org |date=2009-04-20 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella Freedman has been Teva’s fall home since its founding in 1994.
The Teva Learning Center's educational approach, &lt;blockquote&gt;
seeks to create awareness among Jews about their connection with and dependence upon the natural systems that support life. The Center seeks “to renew the [[ecological wisdom]] inherent in Judaism” by “immersing participants in the natural world.”
&lt;ref name="D.C. News &amp; Views: Faith Goes Green "&gt;{{cite news|title=D.C. News &amp; Views: Faith Goes Green |url=http://www.mpac.org/article.php?id=663 |accessdate=2009-07-24 |date=27 June 2008 |publisher=Muslim Public Affairs Committee |quote=The Teva Learning Center, for example, seeks to create awareness among Jews about their connection with and dependence upon the natural systems that support life. The Center seeks “to renew the ecological wisdom inherent in Judaism” by “immersing participants in the natural world.” |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723110613/http://www.mpac.org/article.php?id=663 |archivedate=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The director is Nili Simhai, who won the 2009 Covenant Foundation award for Excellence in Jewish Education "for making significant marks in their communities, and for designing and using innovative educational approaches to achieve dramatic and lasting impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.covenantfn.org/news/18/137/Covenant-Foundation-Announces-2009-Awardees-for-Excellence-in-Jewish-Education/ |title=News Article &amp;#124; The Covenant Foundation |publisher=Covenantfn.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Teva and its base, the Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center, merged with the Jewish environmental organization [[Hazon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hazon.org/isabella-freedman/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Teva Learning Center is a Jewish education group which engages in environmental education and activism through the context of Judaism.&lt;ref name="Retreat mixes spirit with love of nature "&gt;{{cite news | title = Retreat mixes spirit with love of nature | url = http://www.njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/111507/moRetreatMixesSpirit.html| accessdate = 2009-07-24 | date = 13 November 2007 | publisher = New Jersey Jewish News| quote = They took part in the program at the Teva Learning Center in Falls Village, Conn., which integrates outdoor environmental education with Jewish concepts and values.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teva's education centers on the preservation of the environment through the eyes of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c227_a15272/Special_Sections/Celebrate.html |accessdate=July 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501235316/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c227_a15272/Special_Sections/Celebrate.html |archivedate=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Teva frequently, though not exclusively, caters to the educational needs of children in Jewish day schools and provides a hands on approach to environmental education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hadassah.org/news/content/per_hadassah/archive/2009/09_Feb/feature_2.asp |title=Site Map &amp;#124; Hadassah, The Women's Zionist Org of America |publisher=Hadassah.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Tepfer |url=http://www.jvibe.com/Real_life/Renewal.php |title=Using Religion to Save the Planet |publisher=JVibe |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teva also teaches synagogues, camps and youth groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/15080/ |title=Digging Deep on Tu B’Shevat – |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bring It Back To Our School===
Teva provides workshops on the environment and outdoor experiences along the East Coast at 45 different schools.&lt;ref name="thejewishweek.com"&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c36_a13447/News/New_York.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923081605/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c36_a13447/News/New_York.html |date=September 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They work with about 4,000 students annually.&lt;ref name="njjewishnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/062509/sxSchoolRecycling.html |title=School recycling effort earns state recognition &amp;#124; New Jersey Jewish News |publisher=Njjewishnews.com |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of this is teaching students that they are ''Shomrei Adamah'' ("Keepers of the Earth"): &lt;blockquote&gt;Shomrei Adamah (“Keepers of the Earth”), is for fifth- and sixth-grade day-school students who visit a retreat center for four days and make a “brit adamah,” or covenant with the earth, to engage in environmental activity. The Center also runs a program for junior-high students, Achdoot (“Togetherness”), in which the teens camp in the wilderness, usually a state campground&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c372_a12455/Special_Sections/The_New_Activism.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120224152/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c372_a12455/Special_Sections/The_New_Activism.html |date=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2009, students from the [[Solomon Schechter Day School of Raritan Valley]] in New Jersey were presented with the "Kids for Clean Communities Award" for the recycling program they developed at their school after attending the Teva program.&lt;ref name="njjewishnews.com"/&gt;

===Birkat HaChamah===
Teva recently purchased a bus previously owned by [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] founder [[Ben Cohen (businessman)]] for use in environmental classes.&lt;ref name="forward.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/104024/ |title=Blessing of the Sun: A Teachable Moment – |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bus was incorporated into environmental awareness programs related to ''[[Birkat Hachamah]]'' or ''Blessing of the Sun''.&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt; However, Orthodox Talmudic scholar Rabbi [[J. David Bleich]] of [[Yeshiva University]], a specialist in Birkat Hachamah has been critical of the interpretation of Judaism as a notably environmental faith. He argues that environmental problems are "issues in and of themselves and are totally unrelated to the blessing of the sun," as the blessing is an occasion to acknowledge the wonder of God's creations, not a political statement. "I suppose you can connect anything," he says. "You can draw dots and lines; you don't have to be logical.".&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1433">'''The Theosophical Society of New York''' was a theosophical organization, that separated in 1899 from the [[Theosophical Society in America]]. It is not to be confused with "The New York Theosophical Society" founded in 1875, which is today a lodge of the American section of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]].

In 1895 the Theosophical Society was divided into the TG Adyar (with [[Henry Steel Olcott]]) and the TG in America (with [[William Quan Judge]]). After Judge's death, Tingley was elected in a controversial election as president of the TG in America. The Theosophical Society of New York separated itself from the TG in America as a result of these controversies.

The TS of New York was founded by ''J.H. Salisbury'' und ''Donald Nicholson'', both friends of [[W.Q. Judge]].

The organization published the journal "The Word", editor of the journal was ''[[Harold W. Percival]]'' (1868–1953).

"'''Working Class Hero'''" is a song by [[John Lennon]] from his 1970 album ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'', his first album after the [[Break-up of the Beatles|break-up]] of the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Beatles]].

==Theme==
A political song,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.beatlesbible.com/people/john-lennon/songs/working-class-hero/|title=Working Class Hero|last=|first=|date=2 August 2010|work=The Beatles Bible|access-date=20 July 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; the song is a commentary/criticism on the difference between social classes. It tells the story of someone growing up in the [[working class]]. According to Lennon in an interview with [[Jann Wenner]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in December 1970, it is about working class individuals being processed into the [[middle class]]es, into the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/16313366/john_lennon_the_rolling_stone_interview |title=John Lennon interview, by Jan S. Wenner, ''Rolling Stone'', audio available|work=www.rollingstone.com|accessdate=8 May 2009|date=December 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; John also said, "I think it's a revolutionary song – it's really just revolutionary. I just think its concept is revolutionary. I hope it's for workers and not for tarts and fags. I hope it's about what Give Peace A Chance was about. But I don't know – on the other hand, it might just be ignored. I think it's for the people like me who are working class, who are supposed to be processed into the middle classes, or into the machinery. It's my experience, and I hope it's just a warning to people, Working Class Hero." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.beatlesbible.com/people/john-lennon/songs/working-class-hero/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[refrain]] of the song is "A [[working class]] [[hero]] is something to be".

The song is not Lennon's first political song. His string of political songs began in 1968 with the Beatles' "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]" and further continued in 1972 with the release of ''[[Some Time in New York City]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Recording and Sound==
Recorded at EMI Studios on 27 September 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Madinger |first=Chip |last2=Raile |first2=Scott |title=LENNONOLOGY Strange Days Indeed - A Scrapbook Of Madness |year= 2015 |publisher= Chesterfield, MO: Open Your Books, LLC |page=210 |isbn= 978-1-63110-175-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the song features only Lennon, singing and playing an acoustic guitar as his backing. The chord progression is very simple, and builds on A-minor and G-major, with a short detour to D-major in one line of the chorus. Lennon's strumming technique includes a riff with a [[hammer-on]] pick of the E note on the D string and then an open A string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lennon | first = John | title = Lennon: The Solo Years | publisher = Hal Leonard Publishing Corporation | year = 1983 | pages = 156 | isbn = 0-88188-249-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tone and style of the song is similar to that of "[[Masters of War]]" and "[[North Country Blues]]" by [[Bob Dylan]], a known influence of Lennon. Both are based on [[Jean Ritchie]]'s arrangement of the traditional [[England|English]] [[folk song]], "[[Nottamun Town]]". Lennon recorded "Working Class Hero" over a hundred times until he was satisfied with the recording.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The recording is the composite of two different takes: the sound of the guitar and vocal changes at 1:24 prior to the verse "When they've tortured and scared you."

==Controversy==
In 1973,&lt;ref =name="RadioFree"&gt;{{cite web | title=Radio Free Georgetown | first=Guy | last=Raz | url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=16638 | work= | publisher=[[Washington City Paper]] | date=29 January 1999 | accessdate=31 March 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; US Representative [[Harley Orrin Staggers]] heard the song – which includes the lines "'Til you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules" and "But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see" – on [[WGTB]] and lodged a complaint with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). The manager of the station, Ken Sleeman, faced a year in prison and a $10,000 fine, but defended his decision to play the song saying, "The People of Washington DC are sophisticated enough to accept the occasional four-letter word in context, and not become sexually aroused, offended, or upset." The charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blecha | first = Peter | title = Taboo Tunes: A History of Banned Bands &amp; Censored Songs | publisher = Backbeat Books | year = 2004 | pages = 160–161 | isbn = 0-87930-792-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other US radio stations, like Boston's [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]], banned the song for its use of the word "fucking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schechter | first = Danny | authorlink = Danny Schechter | title = The More You Watch, the Less You Know: News Wars/Submerged Hopes/Media Adventures | publisher = [[Seven Stories Press]] | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-888363-80-0 | page = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia, the album was released with the expletive removed from the song and the lyrics censored on the inner sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blaney | first = John | title = John Lennon: Listen To This Book | publisher = Paper Jukebox | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-9544528-1-X | page = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
