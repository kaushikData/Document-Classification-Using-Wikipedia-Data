{{italic title}}'''''A-Force''''' was an [[ongoing series|ongoing]] [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]] that debuted in May 2015 as a part of Marvel's "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" [[Fictional crossover|crossover storyline]]. The series, created by writers [[G. Willow Wilson]] and [[Marguerite Bennett]] and artist [[Jorge Molina (comics)|Jorge Molina]], features Marvel's first all-female team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The team first appeared as part of an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] during "Secret Wars" but later reemerged in [[Earth-616|Marvel's primary continuity]]. ''A-Force'' ended in October 2016 due to poor sales despite favorable reviews from critics and was described as being "decidedly [[Feminism|feminist]]".

==Publication history==
In February 2015, [[Marvel Comics]] announced that they would launch ''A-Force'' in May 2015. The series, written by  [[G. Willow Wilson]] (''[[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]]'') and Marguerite Bennett (''[[Angela (comics)|Angela: Asgard's Assassin]]'') and drawn by [[Jorge Molina (comics)|Jorge Molina]] (''[[X-Men (comic book)|X-Men]]''), features Marvel's first all-female team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The team, led by [[She-Hulk]], initially consists of [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Nico Minoru]] and Singularity, a new "[[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic]] powered" hero, but features many more characters.&lt;ref name="Mashable"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dickey |first=Josh |date=2015-02-06 |title=Marvel assembles first all-female Avengers team, the 'A-Force'|url=http://mashable.com/2015/02/06/marvel-female-avengers-a-force/|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson stated that Marvel editor Daniel Ketchum mandated that the team be composed entirely of female characters, but gave the writers total discretion when it came to which women to choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=2015-02-06 |title=MARVEL Announces All-Female Avengers Team -- A-FORCE|url=http://www.newsarama.com/23459-marvel-announces-all-female-avengers-team-a-force.html|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketchum also brought in Bennett, whom he worked with on ''[[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'', to co-write the series with Wilson.&lt;ref name="CBRFeb2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=2015-02-20 |title=Bennett Assembles Battleworld's Mightiest Heroes in "A-Force"|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=59441 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series takes place within Marvel's 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" [[crossover fiction|crossover storyline]], which finds the entire [[Marvel Universe]], including the Avengers, disbanded. What is left is a patchwork of different environments and on one such environment called Arcadia, which Wilson describes as a "feminist paradise", a familiar threat arises that forces A-Force to come together.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite web |last=Truitt |first=Brian |date=2015-02-06 |title=Female Avengers team comes to the fore with 'A-Force'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/02/06/marvel-comics-a-force-female-avengers/22970157/|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett elaborated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's this world where the Marvel heroines are leaders in their own civilization. I really didn't want to have some kind of validating reason... So I didn't want to do anything like, "all the men disappeared years ago" or "ever since all the menfolk were killed in that war" or something like that. There are men—there are heroes there. You'll see familiar faces and favorites, but the heroines are in charge, by majority. It's just this is how their world evolved. They were competent. They were clever and they were the ones in charge because of their skills and they were the best fit for these roles and demands of their world.&lt;ref name="CBRFeb2015" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About the roster Wilson said, "We've purposefully assembled a team composed of very different characters—from disparate parts of the [[Marvel Universe|Marvel U]], with very different power sets, identities and ideologies. They'll all have to come together to answer some big questions: What would you sacrifice to succeed? What is being a hero worth?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=White |first=Brett |date=2015-02-06 |title=Marvel Announces Female-led 'A-Force' From Wilson, Bennett, Molina |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=59095 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson elaborated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This an opportunity to put people who would normally have no reason to interact with each other on one team... I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together. Nobody's so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody's so underpowered that they have to be saved all the time. I wanted a balance visually and practically... What's also going to be interesting is working out the power structure of the group. You have several people on it who are used to being either their own bosses or in a leadership position, and all of a sudden they're together.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bennett explained that although the team features a broader roster, Dazzler, Medusa, She-Hulk, Singularity and Nico Minoru make up the core members. Bennett stated that she found Dazzler's optimism to be the most interesting explaining, "It's really hard to write a dark and dire book if you've got Dazzler there beside you." Regarding the dynamic between Medusa and She-Hulk, Bennett said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;They're both leaders and there's a lot of conflict between them. They are very supportive of one another when operating against a third party, but they also disagree with how things should be handled when it comes to crises. Medusa is monarchy; She-Hulk is democracy. Medusa is the right of queens and She-Hulk is the rule of law. She-Hulk is much more balanced than Medusa. It's the two of them playing off of their strengths and sometime playing off of each other for both necessary good and necessary evil.&lt;ref name="CBRFeb2015" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The series also introduces a new character named Singularity, a [[pocket universe]] that gains self-consciousness during "Secret Wars". Wilson likened Singularity to [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and said, "Her entire existence is so unlike that of ours that she really has to learn about what we think of as being an individual and having an identity from the ground up, with no point of access except those she meets." Wilson also stated that Singularity can act as "a whole world within herself and she can also move between different worlds and dimensions like taking a walk, so she has access to all corners of the Marvel U in a way that other characters do not."&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; "[Nico Minoru is] one of the first people we have encounter Singularity," Bennett revealed. "So Nico is put in charge of acclimating this character and showing her their civilization and world while trying to save it. Nico is sort of like the grounding human force and the anchor that begins to show Singularity the capacity of human beings, both for good and for evil, so Nico becomes even more invested when she starts to see her homeland through the eyes of this stranger."&lt;ref name="CBRFeb2015" /&gt;

At the 2015 [[Chicago Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo]], Marvel announced that ''A-Force'' would continue into [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]], the next phase of Marvel Universe after the end of "Secret Wars", with a second volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=2015-04-24 |title=Report: Marvel Talks Post-SECRET WARS, A-FORCE As 'Lead' Book &amp; Return of CAPTAIN AMERICA: WHITE |url=http://www.newsarama.com/24285-marvel-announcements-at-c2e2-retailer-breakfast.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson said, "After 'Secret Wars', things don't go back to status quo. There [are] long-term repercussions for what has happened in Battleworld. What the aftermath of ''Secret Wars'' is for all of those characters who were together in Arcadia who are now waking up in the Marvel Universe… I'm not going to say. But they're going to have to deal probably more directly with those repercussions than any of the other teams in the aftermath of ''Secret Wars''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Morse |first=Ben |date=2015-05-20 |title=Secret Wars Correspondence: A-Force |url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/24636/secret_wars_correspondence_a-force |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=2015-06-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526221827/http://marvel.com/news/comics/24636/secret_wars_correspondence_a-force |archive-date=2015-05-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Marvel announced that writer [[Kelly Thompson]], who co-wrote ''A-Force'' vol. 2, #2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerding|first1=Stephen|title="Vader Down" Concludes, Deadpool 2099 Debuts &amp; More Marvel January Highlights|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/vader-down-concludes-deadpool-2099-debuts-more-marvel-january-highlights|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=2015-10-20|accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; will take over the series with artist [[Ben Caldwell (cartoonist)|Ben Caldwell]] starting with issue 5. Thompson stated that while she respects the way Wilson built the team, in a world where women are the primary heroes, she does not intend on making stories that are "unique to women". Thompson explained, "It's a comic about super heroes saving the day, plain and simple, and I approach writing them like I would writing anyone. These ladies are heroes just like any of their male colleagues." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grauso|first1=Alisha|title=A-Force Gets New Recruits|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/25632/a-force_gets_new_recruits|publisher=Marvel.com|date=2015-01-15|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, ''A-Force'' tied into the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline beginning with issue #8. About the crossover, Thompson said, "There's no way, with our cast, that we weren't going to get drawn into it – Carol is obviously the big co-star of "Civil War II" and both Medusa and She-Hulk are poised to play big roles too. But I think we've got a really great ''A-Force'' story that ties directly to the event but will also stand on its own nicely. Because of the intricacies of "Civil War II" the ideas behind the event really pull our team apart – so what we're doing is a very personal and emotional gut punch of a story for these ladies who were sort of just getting started as friends and as a team."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marston |first=George |date=2016-05-02 |title=CIVIL WAR II Packs 'Emotional Gut Punch' For A-FORCE |url=http://www.newsarama.com/29087-civil-war-ii-packs-an-emotional-gut-punch-for-a-force.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, a day before the release of issue #10, it was reported that ''A-Force'' was "effectively cancelled" after no new issues were listed among Marvel's November, December, or January solicitations. The report came despite Thompson's intentions to continue the series after "Civil War II" with a storyline that involved an "unspecified A-lister". Sales of ''A-Force'' had fallen by 79% since its debut with issue #1 selling 114,528 copies and issue #9 selling 23,484 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=2016-10-18 |title=Marvel's A-FORCE Axed ...

==Plot==
===Secret Wars===
A-Force, the defenders of the matriarchal [[Battleworld]] nation of Arcadia, responds to a [[megalodon]] attack while on routine patrol. During the attack, [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]] throws the shark across the Shield, the wall that separates their borders, thus breaking the laws of [[Doctor Doom|Emperor Doom]] and is subsequently arrested by Doom's enforcers, the Thor Corps. Despite appeals from [[She-Hulk]], the baroness of Arcadia, Chavez is sentenced to spend the rest of her life on the wall. In response, She-Hulk tasks the Sub-Mariners - [[Namor]], [[Namorita]], and [[Namora]] - to find the source of the megalodon attack. Meanwhile, [[Nico Minoru]], lamenting the loss of Chavez, comes across a mysterious figure that fell out of the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Bennett, Marguerite; Wilson, G. Willow |penciller=Molina, Jorge|inker=Molina, Jorge; Yeung, Craig |colorist=Martin, Laura; Milla, Matt |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Ketchum, Daniel |title=A-Force |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=May 2015 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sub-Mariners discover a strange portal in the ocean's depths but it implodes as they draw near. Later, at the behest of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], Minoru introduces her new friend to She-Hulk. When [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] accuses the stranger, a sentient [[pocket universe]], of creating the portal, a [[Sentinel (comics)|sentinel]] falls from another portal and attacks the team. During the fight, the newcomer saves [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] and convinces She-Hulk that she is not the cause. After destroying the sentinel, She-Hulk decides to travel through the still open portal and investigate the source herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Bennett, Marguerite; Wilson, G. Willow |penciller=Molina, Jorge |inker=Yeung, Craig; Wong, Walden |colorist=Martin, Laura |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Ketchum, Daniel |title=A-Force |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=July 2015 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She-Hulk arrives in a post-apocalyptic Manhattan and after a brief encounter with more sentinels, she is chased back to Arcadia by the Thor Corps. The Thor Corps follow in pursuit, but Medusa manages to repel them back into the portal and is killed in the process. When the Thor Corps return, She-Hulk alerts the citizens of Arcadia that there is a traitor in their midst that is spreading discontent and vows to bring them to justice as she and other A-Forcers go into hiding inside the newcomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Bennett, Marguerite; Wilson, G. Willow |penciller=Molina, Jorge |inker=Molina, Jorge; Yeung, Craig |colorist=Martin, Laura |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Ketchum, Daniel |title=A-Force |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=August 2015 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newcomer smuggles A-Force outside the city. There, She-Hulk realizes that the portals' energy is of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] origin and they deduce that the traitor is Loki. With A-Force outlawed, Loki is set to be crowned the new baroness of Arcadia but is preemptively attacked by A-Force. After Loki is defeated, she releases a final blast of energy that breaches the Shield thus allowing the [[Marvel Zombies|zombie horde]] on the other side to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Bennett, Marguerite; Wilson, G. Willow |penciller=Molina, Jorge |inker=Yeung, Craig; Wong, Walden |colorist=Martin, Laura |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Ketchum, Daniel |title=A-Force |volume=1 |issue=4 |date=September 2015 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the horde approaches, She-Hulk rallies A-Force, the Thor Corps and other heroes in defense of Arcadia. During the fight, the zombies begin to overwhelm the city but the newcomer – now named Singularity – absorbs the entire horde, sacrificing herself in the process. In the aftermath of the battle, the Thor Corps arrests Loki as A-Force begins reconstruction of Arcadia. Meanwhile, She-Hulk comforts Minoru, who is still mourning the loss of her friends, telling her that she believes Singularity lives on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Bennett, Marguerite; Wilson, G.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Following the conclusion of ''Secret Wars'', Singularity awakes in the primary [[Earth-616]] universe and quickly spots [[Carol Danvers]] but Danvers does not recognize her. Unbeknownst to Singularity, she is being pursued by a similar being named Antimatter. While Danvers confronts Antimatter, Singularity flees to New York City. With Antimatter still in pursuit, Singularity locates She-Hulk, who does not remember her either, and asks for help. As the pair fight Antimatter, Medusa arrives with reinforcements and takes Singularity into custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Wilson, G. Willow |artist=Molina, Jorge |colorist=Martin, Laura |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Ketchum, Daniel; Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=January 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Antimatter kills one of Medusa's soldiers, she releases Singularity and teleports Antimatter to the moon. Realizing that physical attacks are having little effect on Antimatter, Singularity transports She-Hulk, Medusa and herself to Japan to seek the help of Minoru. When Antimatter returns, Minoru casts a spell that causes him to be temporarily unmade. The spell buys the women some time during which Danvers suggests that Antimatter maybe susceptible to intense levels of light particles. They then travel to Miami to recruit Dazzler just as Antimatter remerges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Thompson, Kelly; Wilson, G. Willow |artist=Molina, Jorge |colorist=Martin, Laura |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=February 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dazzler hits Antimatter with everything she has to no avail but it gives Danvers time to activate a containment device that she designed. When Antimatter overloads the device, Singularity has Minoru remove Antimatter's tracking ability and transports the team to [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|The Peak]]. As Antimatter eventually reaches The Peak, She-Hulk orders Singularity to stay behind while the rest of the team leaves to parley with Antimatter. After talks fail, Antimatter fatally wounds Dazzler and in turn She-Hulk decapitates Antimatter. Angered by Dazzler's death, Singularity leaves to confront a recovered Antimatter one-on-one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Thompson, Kelly; Wilson, G. Willow |artist=Molina, Jorge |colorist=Milla, Matt |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=3 |date=March 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Singularity fights Antimatter, Dr. Tempest Bell, The Peak's lead scientist, develops a bomb capable of destroying Antimatter but denoting it will also kill Singularity. She-Hulk, Minoru and Danvers go to reinforce Singularity, while Medusa places the bomb inside Antimatter. Just as the bomb explodes, a revived Dazzler arrives with a dimensional teleporter and whisks Singularity away from the blast. With Antimatter destroyed, the team celebrates at a diner when Singularity senses a disturbance as remnants of Antimatter tear open portals to other worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Thompson, Kelly; Wilson, G. Willow |artist=Molina, Jorge |colorist=Martin, Laura |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=April 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Astoria, Oregon]], A-Force tracks a dragon from Battleworld named Countess and discover that she is being pursued by an alternate version of Dazzler that belonged to the Thor Corps. A-Force joins Dazzler Thor in combat which causes Countess to retreat. As the heroes wait for Countess's return, Dazzler confides to Dazzler Thor that she has been infected by the [[Terrigen Mist]] and is dying. When Countess arrives, she takes control of Minoru who then incapacitates the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Thompson, Kelly |artist=Caldwell, Ben |colorist=Herring, Ian |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=5 |date=May 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She-Hulk, Medusa, Dazzler, Dazzler Thor, and Danvers awake in a jail cell in Astoria to discover that their powers are gone and the populace under the control of the Countess. After She-Hulk taunts the Countess, she has Minoru turn She-Hulk against the others. As the fight with She-Hulk takes the team away from the city and their powers return, the Countess has Minoru turn their feet into [[cement shoes]] and drag them under water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Thompson, Kelly |penciller=Caldwell, Ben |inker=Hanna, Scott |colorist=Herring, Ian |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=June 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the team is about to drown, Minoru commands them to breathe. Once out of the water, She-Hulk sends half the team to distract Countess, while the others rescue Minoru. After being rescued, Minoru reveals the true nature of Countess' powers and returns with Dazzler and Dazzler Thor to confront Countess. Minoru convinces Countess to have a change of heart as Dazzler Thor succumbs to the compounded effects that the Terrigen Mist are having on her otherworldly system. After Dazzler Thor's body vanishes, Dazzler warns her teammates that she may suffer a similar fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Thompson, Kelly |penciller=Caldwell, Ben |inker=Hanna, Scott |colorist=Herring, Ian |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=7 |date=July 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War II===
After She-Hulk is gravely wounded in a battle with [[Thanos]] during the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Danvers tells Minoru that the Inhuman [[Ulysses (comics)#Ulysses Cain|Ulysses]] had a vision of her killing a woman named Alice. Refusing to be arrested for a crime that she has yet to commit, Minoru flees to a safehouse in [[Ouray, Colorado]]. Unbeknownst to Minoru, the town is under attack from a swarm of giant bugs and encounters [[Elsa Bloodstone]]. Bloodstone informs Minoru that the attack is the result of an infection that is turning the populace into insects and takes her to meet Janine, whose daughter Alice has gone missing during the commotion. Meanwhile, Danvers and Medusa race to find Minoru before Dazzler and Singularity, who disagree with their methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Thompson, Kelly |artist=Siqueira, Paulo |colorist=Rosenberg, Rachelle |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=8 |date=August 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danvers and Medusa find Minoru and Bloodstone just before Dazzler and Singularity arrive. After a brief confrontation, they agree to split into two teams: one to find Alice and the other to protect the civilians. While searching for Alice in an abandoned mine, Danvers, Minoru and Bloodstone are attacked by a giant bug. The bug incapacitates Danvers and Bloodstone before telepathically communicating to Minoru that she is Alice and has been inadvertently infecting the townspeople after her transformation. Alice tells Minoru that killing her is the only way to save the people. When Minrou refuses, an infected Bloodstone threatens to kill Danvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Thompson, Kelly |artist=Siqueira, Paulo |colorist=Rosenberg, Rachelle |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=9 |date=September 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medusa, Singularity, and an infected Dazzler are overrun by bugs and regroup with the others just as Bloodstone infects Danvers. After Dazzler infects Medusa, Minoru casts a spell to transform Alice back into a human but it does not cure the rest of the populace. Alice explains that she must be killed and Minoru reluctantly casts a death spell on Alice which transforms the infected back into humans. Alice then remerges in her final form and tells A-Force that she is no longer a threat as she now has greater control of her powers. When the commotion is over, Danvers and Minoru continue to disagree over each other's actions but agree to visit She-Hulk together in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Thompson, Kelly |artist=Siqueira, Paulo; Bennet, Joe |colorist=Rosenberg, Rachelle |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Kubert, Katie |title=A-Force |volume=2 |issue=10 |date=October 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg McElhatton of [[Comic Book Resources]] (CBR) gave ''A-Force'' #1 four-and-a-half stars out of five writing, "''A-Force'' #1 is a triumph, taking a concept that could have simply been dashed off and then ignored and turning it into a book that I'd cheerfully read every month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McElhatton |first=Greg |date=2015-05-20 |title=A-Force #1 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-review/a-force-1-marvel-comics |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Guerrero of [[Comic Vine]] gave it four out of five stars saying, "This book was pretty much exactly what I wanted and hoped for. Too many times the female heroes in the Marvel Universe get overlooked. Marguerite Bennett and G. Willow Wilson have created a natural feeling world. It's easy to cry out that having just female heroes is a gimmick but it all simply works here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guerrero |first=Tony |date=2015-05-19 |title=A-Force #1 Review |url=http://www.comicvine.com/reviews/a-force-1/1900-4119/ |publisher=[[Comic Vine]] |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] gave the issue an 8.4 out of 10 and said, "While certain details regarding the nature of this team and their connection to the old marvel Universe remain unclear, A-Force #1 marks a worthy debut for Marvel's newest team book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2015-05-20 |title=A-Force #1 Review |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/21/a-force-1-review |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Diaz of [[The Nerdist]] gave it three out of five burritos and wrote, "Overall the issue was fine, and I'm curious to see where it all goes, but I'm far more eager to see what can be done with this grouping of  awesome female heroes once the wacky conceit of Secret Wars is over and they return to the Marvel Universe proper." Diaz also noted that, "[Marvel is] making a decidedly feminist statement by taking nearly all of their major female heroes and putting them together in their own Avengers title called ''A-Force''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Diaz |first=Eric |date=2015-05-19 |title=Review: Marvel’s A-FORCE #1 |url=http://nerdist.com/review-marvels-a-force-1/ |publisher=[[The Nerdist]] |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lan Pitts of [[Newsarama]] gave it an 8 out of 10 praising the artwork of Jorge Molina, [[Laura Martin]] and Matt Milla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pitts |first=Lan |date=2015-05-19 |title=Best Shots Advance Reviews: A-FORCE #1, PLANET HULK #1, SPIDER-VERSE #1  |url=http://www.newsarama.com/24557-best-shots-advance-reviews-a-force-1-planet-hulk-1-spider-verse-1.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doug Zawisza of CBR gave issue #2 four stars, writing "''A-Force'' #2 appears to be a straightforward superheroine adventure on the surface but, as the pages turn, Bennett, Wilson, Molina, Yeung, Wong, Martin and Petit make it quite clear this isn't a straightforward anything... Easily dismissed as a gimmick, ''A-Force'' is anything but, packing in strong characters, smart characterization and wonderful artwork."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zawisa |first=Doug |date=2015-07-03 |title=A-Force #2 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-review/a-force-2-marvel-comics |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Lake of IGN gave it an 8, saying "The first issue of ''A-Force'' provided a fine mix of boisterous action and engaging character work, all of which effectively tied into the larger Battleworld picture. Issue #2 offers much of the same, G. Willow Wilson and Marguerite Bennett both focusing the direction of the main narrative as they expand their characters place within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lake |first=Jeff |date=2015-07-02 |title=Comic Book Reviews for July 1, 2015 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/comic-book-reviews-for-july-1-2015?page=2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gray of Newsarama also gave it an 8 and wrote, "With the introduction of a new heroine and a new threat, the issue skillfully plays to the strengths of the ensemble, from She-Hulk's natural leadership, Medusa's ruthless decision making and former Runaway Nico Minoru's compassion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gray |first=Richard |date=2015-07-02 |title=Best Shots Reviews: DARTH VADER #7, MIDNIGHTER #2, 8HOUSE: ARCLIGHT #1, More  |url=http://www.newsarama.com/25029-best-shots-reviews-darth-vader-7-midnighter-2-8house-arclight-1-more.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marykate Jasper of CBR gave issue #3 three-and-a-half stars writing, "Altogether, ''A-Force'' still has a lot going for it, but the pacing is compounding the problems of its large cast. Luckily, issue #3 takes many of the necessary steps for ramping the pace back up, and I'm optimistic for issue #4."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jasper |first=Marykate |date=2015-08-17 |title=A-Force #3 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-review/a-force-3-marvel-comics |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake gave it a 7.3, praising the artwork of Molina but criticizing the narrative restraints of the ''Secret Wars'' storyline but said, "Thankfully, this is one example where the book’s art is able to mask any narrative quibbles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lake |first=Jeff |date=2015-08-13 |title=Comic Book Reviews for August 12, 2015 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/comic-book-reviews-for-august-12-2015?page=2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.K. Stewart of Newsarama gave it an 8 saying, "''A-Force'' gets stronger with each passing issue, and the dramatic turns at the end of ''A-Force'' #3 make it the best issue yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stewart |first=C.K. |date=2015-08-13 |title=Best Shots Reviews: HOUSE OF M #1 (Advance), A-FORCE #3, BATMAN #43, More |url=http://www.newsarama.com/25541-best-shots-reviews-house-of-m-1-advance.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McElhatton gave issue #4 three stars writing, "While "A-Force" #4 is not a bad comic, Marguerite Bennett, G. Willow Wilson, Jorge Molina, Craig Yeung and Walden Wong's latest installment clearly tries to get a lot of the exposition onto the table as the plot gears up for next month's conclusion, and that original sense of wonder and newness is greatly diminished as a result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McElhatton |first=Greg |date=2015-09-11 |title=A-Force #4 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-review/a-force-4-marvel-comics |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levi Hunt of IGN gave it a 6.8 and said, "Jorge Molina's art is once again the best thing about ''A-Force'' as the series hits its least narratively satisfying issue. The underserved nature of the book’s development has led to a conflict that has few real emotional stakes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hunt |first=Levi |date=2015-09-10 |title=Comic Book Reviews for September 9, 2015 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/10/comic-book-reviews-for-september-9-2015?page=2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Pepose of Newsarama gave it a 7 saying, "It's a good thing this book looks so good, because the plot definitely feels flat, with the reveal of A-Force's traitor - and her endgame after being easily overcome - feels particularly undercooked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pepose |first=David |date=2015-09-10 |title=Best Shots Rapid-Fire Reviews: A-FORCE #3, BATMAN #44, THE WICKED + THE DIVINE #14, CIVIL WAR #4, More |url=http://www.newsarama.com/25848-best-shots-rapid-fire-reviews-a-force-3-batman-44-the-wicked-+-the-divine-14-civil-war-4.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg McElhatton of CBR gave ''A-Force'' #1 three stars out of five writing, "Ultimately, I wish the narration from Singularity had been dropped entirely from "A-Force" #1. You can still understand what's going on without it, and the disparate clash of her thoughts and dialogue would have never happened. Hopefully, they will get smoothed out a bit in future issues, but—for now—this issue is only alright."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McElhatton |first=Greg |date=2016-01-06 |title=A-Force #1 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-review/a-force-1-marvel-comics-2016 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Lake of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10 and said, "Overall, ''A-Force'' #1 is a solid, if unspectacular debut. It's great to see this cast together again, especially in the hands of Wilson, Molina and Martin, but as of now this new direction feels hamstrung by its need to square peg its way into a round hole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lake |first=Jeff |date=2016-01-06 |title=A-Force #1 Review |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/a-force-1-review-2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Pepose of [[Newsarama]] gave it an 8 out of 10 saying, "While this book starts off with a shaky foundation - namely, that you have to have read a ''Secret Wars'' tie-in to understand where Singularity came from - Wilson does a great job at firming things up, with her new heroine proving to be a fun addition to the Marvel Universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pepose |first=David |date=2016-01-06 |title=Best Shots Reviews: DR.

Willow Wilson and Jorge Molina."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lake |first=Jeff |date=2016-02-04 |title=Comic Book Reviews for February 3, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/comic-book-reviews-for-february-3-2016?page=2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Partridge of Newsarama gave it a 9 writing, "''A-Force'' #2 reads like a [[Sleater-Kinney]] song sounds: all confident bravado and a relentless pace. While the original series was inescapably tied to a company wide, Kelly Thompson, G. Willow Wilson, Jorge Molina and Laura Martin quickly cast off those ropes of continuity to let these ladies stand on their own and get down to the important work of punching weird stuff and giving each other sass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Partridge |first=Justin |date=2016-02-03 |title=Best Shots Reviews: DR.

McElhatton gave ''A-Force'' #3 three-and-a-half stars writing, "''A-Force'' #3 feels like a turning point for this ongoing series. With the team fully solidified, Kelly Thompson, G. Willow Wilson and Jorge Molina begin to show readers just how these established characters will work together, even as the relatively new Singularity continues to establish herself. Bit by bit, that early potential we saw in the "Secret Wars" tie-in starts to bear fruit in ''A-Force'' #3."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McElhatton |first=Greg |date=2016-03-07 |title=A-Force #3 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-review/a-force-3-marvel-comics-1 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake gave the issue a 7.5 saying, "Bucking the usual slow roll-out most super team books enjoy, ''A-Force'''s latest is again a high energy affair. Where last issue saw Kelly Thompson and G. Willow Wilson provide a welcome jump in character development and explored relationship dynamics, issue #3 offers a more action oriented focus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lake |first=Jeff |date=2016-03-03 |title=Comic Book Reviews for March 2, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/comic-book-reviews-for-march-2-2016?page=2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partridge gave it an 8 and said, "Writers Kelly Thompson and G. Willow Wilson continue the dazzling chemistry and tension between the team while at the same time keeping each woman's voice on point and selling Antimatter as a real threat to the team."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Partridge |first=Justin |date=2016-03-03 |title=Best Shots Rapid-Fire Reviews: Spider-Man #2, Midnighter #10, Old Man Logan #3, More |url=http://www.newsarama.com/28238-best-shots-rapid-fire-reviews-spider-man-2-midnighter-10-old-man-logan-3-more.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marykate Jasper of CBR gave issue #4 four stars writing, ''A-Force'' #4 gives readers the camaraderie, compassion and quips that they've come to love and expect from this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jasper |first=Marykate |date=2016-04-18 |title=A-Force #4 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-review/a-force-4-marvel-comics-1 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake gave it a 7.8 saying, "In just four short issues Kelly Thompson and G. Willow Wilson have crafted a team rife with unique personalities, in turn creating an undeniable chemistry between them that makes their unfolding adventures ones worth investing in. Issue #4 only solidifies that fact, the conclusion to the Antimatter arc resulting in plenty of great moments both joint and character specific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lake |first=Jeff |date=2016-04-14 |title=Comic Book Reviews for April 13, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/14/comic-book-reviews-for-april-13-2016?page=2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McElhattan gave issue #5 four stars writing, "If ''A-Force'' #5 is any indication, the series is in good hands. Thompson, Caldwell and Herring's first issue together is fun and exciting, even as there are strong character and plot hooks to keep readers coming back for more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McElhatton |first=Greg |date=2016-05-05 |title=A-Force #5 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-review/a-force-5-marvel-comics |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake gave issue #6 a 7.3 saying, "When it comes to ''A-Force'', the team's chemistry goes hand in hand with its success. Case in point – issue #6 is a solid, if unspectacular affair, with a familiar villain and a by the numbers plot. What makes the issue click is its fantastic characterization, writer Kelly Thompson continuing to build off of the great chemistry generated in the book's first arc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lake |first=Jeff |date=2016-06-02 |title=Comic Book Reviews for June 1, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/02/comic-book-reviews-for-june-1-2016?page=2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Argentine National Symphony Orchestra''' is the state symphony of [[Argentina]], and is based in [[Buenos Aires]].

==Overview==

Established as the State Symphony Orchestra, on November 20, 1948, via a bill (Law 35879) signed by President [[Juan Perón]], the orchestra was created that it could ''"constitute the pitch of universal resonance that our music needs, while providing the most effective means of popular education in the arts."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://culturasinfonica.blogspot.com/2006/04/decreto-de-fundacin.html Cultura Sinfónica: Decreto de fundación] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philharmonic associations had, by then, a long tradition in Argentina, and could be traced in Buenos Aires to the 1822 formation of the Academy of Music and of the Philharmonic Association, the following year. These orchestras struggled under the instability prevailing during the years of the [[Confederación Argentina|Argentine Confederation]], however, and their performances were only sporadic. The [[German Argentine]] community helped advance the medium with the founding a number of [[choir|choral societies]] between 1852 and 1863, notably ''Concordia'', ''Germania'' and the ''Deutsche Sing-Akademie'', and these were complementted by the Buenos Aires Orchestral Society (1876) and the Musical Mutual Society (1894). The latter ultimately formed the first orchestral [[guild]] in Argentina, the Orchestra Professionals' Association (APO), in 1919.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.historiasinfonica.blogspot.com/ Historia Sinfónica] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The APO Orchestra was constituted as such in 1922, and prospered with its colloaboration with the local [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] Association, reaching its zenith under the baton of Swiss conductor [[Ernest Ansermet]]. The [[great depression]] later limited its activity sharply, and the orchestra was nearly closed in 1935, highlighting the need for state support. Accordingly, the Buenos Aires Symphony (today the [[Buenos Aires Philharmonic]]) was founded in 1947, and in 1948, the State Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The symphony was created under the aegis of the Secretariat of Culture, and with 92 musicians. Directed initially by Roberto Kinsky, its first concert took place at the renowned [[Teatro Colón|Colón Opera House]] on November 30, 1949; on that evening's program was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Consecration of the House Overture]]'', [[Johannes Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Symphony No.2]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''Scherzo Fantastico''. Its repertoire was soon expanded to include works by classical Argentine composers, as well, notably [[Carlos Guastavino]], [[Carlos López Buchardo]] and [[Alberto Williams]]. Apart from its performances at the Colón Opera House, the symphony would appear often in the [[Cervantes Theatre (Buenos Aires)|Cervantes]] and [[Teatro Gran Rex|Gran Rex]] theatres, and it increasingly featured [[20th-century classical music]], notably [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''Sinfonia Drammatica'' and [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)|Alexander Nevsky]]''; among the well-known guest musicians during the symphony's early years was violinist [[Henryk Szeryng]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; 
[[File:Programa de la Sinfonica Nacional 1966.jpg|thumb|A playbill from 1966]]
The [[Revolución Libertadora|1955 overthrow]] of President Juan Perón led to the State Symphony's reorganization as the Argentine National Symphony. Its first post-Perón conductor, former Colón Opera House Director [[Juan José Castro]], had returned from exile and took the baton to acclaim on November 11, leading the symphony in their performance of ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', by [[Claude Debussy]]. He worked to widen its appeal by incorporating works by contemporary composers such as [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Paul Hindemith]], Igor Stravinsky and [[Béla Bartók]], and by securing guest conductors such as [[Willem van Otterloo]] and Igor Stravinsky, who conducted performances of his own works in 1960. Frustrated by bureaucratic tedium, however, Castro resigned in October.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Argentine National Symphony, Sheraton.jpg|left|thumb|240px|The National Symphony celebrates its 25th anniversary with a rooftop concert in 1974{{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 22 November 2011}}]] --&gt;

The symphony followed a more traditional line after Víctor Tevah's appointment as chief conductor in 1961, and the contemporary music programs were cancelled. Its itinerary was steeped up, and would include a successful tour of theatres in the Argentine hinterland as well as in [[Asunción, Paraguay]], in 1962. Highlights from this period included guest conductor [[Paul Klecki]]'s [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] concert series and the rise to prominence of pianist [[Martha Argerich]]. Ongoing administrative disputes, however, took their toll, and the appointment of Teodoro Fuchs in March 1966 as its first full director since Castro met one the body's chief demands, though budget scarcities led to his resignation later that year. 

The installation of a dictatorship under General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] led to a marked influence of the [[Church-state relations in Argentina|Catholic Church]] over the repertoire, and its new director, Juan Carlos Zorzi, offered up mostly [[requiem]]s, [[mass (religion)|masses]] and [[te deum]]s, as well as frequent collaboratios with the [[Universidad Católica Argentina|Argentine Catholic University]]'s choir. The symphony performed at the reinauguation of the Cervantes Theatre, which had been nearly lost to a 1961 fire, in 1968, though the Onganía regime's continuing hostility to the symphony led to its being stripped of a formal home, and the body performed as a [[radio orchestra]]. Losing numerous musicians, Zorzi resigned, and though the 1970 appointment of Spanish conductor [[Jacques Bodmer]] as director was followed by a sponsorship from the Italian Embassy, lack of federal support kept the symphony on the brink of closure throughout 1971 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturasinfonica.blogspot.com/2006/04/carta-de-renuncia-de-juan-jose-castro.html Cultura Sinfónica: Juan José Castro] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/06/04/espectaculos/c-01301.htm ''Clarín'': La Sinfónica, en la encrucijada] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The election of [[Peronist]] candidate [[Héctor Cámpora]] in 1973 brought with it restored support for the institution, including disbursement for a year's worth of unpaid salaries. A successful Beethoven series at the [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires|Luna Park Arena]] was followed by the 25th anniversary concert, November 29, 1974, memorable for its being held atop the [[Sheraton Buenos Aires Hotel &amp; Convention Center|Buenos Aires Sheraton]] with a televised reprise of Roberto Kinsky's inaugural program. A renewed funding crisis led director Bodmer to return to [[Barcelona]] in July 1975, however, and his assistant, Jorge Fontenla, was appointed in his stead. Fontenla's replacement with Bruno D'Astoli in 1978 coincided with the symphony's eclipse by the Buenos Aires Philharmonic, which enjoyed the advantage of a permanent home at the Colón Opera House (while the symphony was relegated to Monday nights at the Cervantes). Its struggles helped result in the 1980 establishment of the Friends of the National Symphony, and though the end of the last dictatorship in 1983 brought with it high hopes, a conflict with the newly appointed general director, Iván Cosentino, resulted in a stoppage during the first half of 1985. Ongoing budgetary problems prompted the new director, Jorge Rotter, to schedule free concerts to the public every other Wednesday as a form of protest during 1987. A renewed crisis in 1990 led to his resignation and the suspension of activities.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Lacking a director, the symphony was supervised by the head of [[SADAIC]], [[José María Castiñeira de Dios]], who organized the symphony's first European performance (in [[Spain]]), and secured appointment of Simón Blech as director in late 1991. Another figure credited with shepherding the symphony through this difficult era was its former director, Juan Carlos Zorzi, who had served as interim director during the early 1980s and continued to influence the repertoire, including more works by Latin American composers such as [[Mexican music|Mexican composer]] [[Eduardo Diazmuñoz]], who led the symphony as guest conductor; Zorzi also took the baton for a tour of [[Chile]] in 1992. The appointment of Pedro Ignacio Calderón as chief conductor in 1996 was followed by a number of critics' awards and by the symphony's 50th anniversary celebrations in 1998, for which the body was invited to perform in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultura.gov.ar/direcciones/?info=detalle&amp;id=132&amp;idd=1 Secretariat of Culture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012114258/http://www.cultura.gov.ar/direcciones/?info=detalle&amp;id=132&amp;idd=1 |date=October 12, 2009 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obtaining their first salary increase in thirteen years in 2006, the National Symphony Orchestra has persisted over often overwhelming odds, not the least of which has been its lack of a permanent home (unofficially located in the [[Cervantes Theatre (Buenos Aires)|Cervantes Theatre]]). Maintaining a loyal esprit de corps among its musicians, who have on numerous past occasions performed without pay, the symphony has also attracted figures of international stature on the classical music stage, including guest conductors [[Erich Kleiber]], Sir [[Georg Solti]], [[Ernest Ansermet]], [[Igor Markevitch]], [[Hermann Scherchen]], [[Sergiu Celibidache]], [[Rudolf Kempe]], [[Antal Dorati]], Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]], [[Hans Rosbaud]], [[Jean Fournet]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], [[Aram Katchaturian]], [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] and [[Pablo Casals]], as well as renowned guest soloists such as [[Arthur Rubinstein]], [[Ruggiero Ricci]], [[Nicanor Zabaleta]], [[Gyorgy Sandor]], Martha Argerich, [[Uto Ughi]], and [[Barry Douglas (musician)|Barry Douglas]].

Its need for an official home was addressed in 2006 with plans to create a concert hall for the symphony in the Bicentennial Cultural Center. The center's inaugural in the former [[Buenos Aires Central Post Office]], scheduled for the [[Argentina Bicentennial|Bicentennial]] in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://212.145.146.10/ejercicio/concursos/inicio/060607a_bases.pdf  Centro Cultural del Bicentenario.

The '''Chacarera''' is a dance and music that originated in [[Santiago del Estero]], [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-daydreams.com/enc/world/show_country.php?id=5 |title=World Music - Argentina |website=Digital-daydreams.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a genre of [[folk music]] that, for many [[Argentina|Argentines]], serves as a rural counterpart to the cosmopolitan imagery of the [[tango (ballroom)|Tango]]. A dance form played by contemporary musicians as soloists or in small ensembles of voice, guitar, violin and bombo drum, the Chacarera is often legitimized by its “origin” in the remote province of [[Santiago del Estero]]. It is also the product of a romanticized construction of national identity projected by urban cultural institutions and disseminated through the mass media{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}. A recent and very well known singer, [[Soledad Pastorutti]], made an important popularization across all Argentine provinces, during the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.

==Chacarera music==
While much of the Chacarera repertoire can be traced to the 1920s sheet music of Andrés Chazarreta (Chazarreta 1947[1916]), the contemporary Chacarera style described in this article was standardized by the recordings of the 1950s folk group Los Hermanos Abalos (Abalos 1952). Today, this style is ubiquitous throughout Argentina, with important variants appearing in the provinces of Santiago del Estero and Salta.

===Melody and harmony===
Contemporary Chacareras generally utilize descending, minor-mode melodies within an octave range. They are not harmonically distinctive, relying predominantly on tonic and dominant accompaniment, and the occasional shift to the relative major. Some modern Chacarera musicians use major-seventh and other altered chords in their arrangements.

===Rhythm===
Contemporary Chacarera music is distinguished by its unique [[hemiola]] [[syncopation]]. Melody lines tend to begin in duple meter ({{music|time|6|8}}), and conclude in triple meter ({{music|time|3|4}}). Accompaniment parts – including those on guitar, piano, bandoneón and drum – employ a constant compound meter of {{music|time|6|8}} and {{music|time|3|4}}, with accents on the second dotted quarter and the third quarter note, respectively (Abalos 1952). The downbeat is generally elided until cadences, a characteristic that is particularly salient in the case of the “Chacarera Trunca” style, which cadences on the third beat.

===Structure===
The Chacarera is a binary form. The A section (6 or 8 bars) doubles as an introduction and an interlude. The B section (8 bars) returns twice before concluding with a repetition. The entire form repeats two times.    
A	B	A	B	A	B	B

==Chacarera choreography==
The Chacarera is a [[Contradance]]-influenced partner dance with similarities to many Ibero-American folk dances, including the Chilean (Zama) cueca and the Peruvian [[Marinera]] (Vega 1944). Male dancers circle about their female partners, seducing them with foot stomping ([[zapateo]]) and handkerchief waving during the A sections and “coronating,” or embracing, them in the final B section.

==History of the Chacarera genre==
According to the musicologist Carlos Vega (Vega 1944), the Chacarera belongs to a family of Ibero-American dances derived from baroque Contradance choreography. While this assertion may be accurate, Vega himself admits to the absence of documentation regarding the Chacarera before the advent of the recording industry. As the first mention of the Chacarera as a musical genre appears in the early twentieth century publications of the [[Santiagueñan]] band leader Andrés Chazarreta, it may thus be more accurate to place this dance’s “origin” within the modern era.

===Argentine musical nationalism===
The Chacarera can be understood as an outgrowth of Argentine "[[Nativism (politics)|nativism]]," a nationalist "back-to-the-roots" movement inspired by increasing Argentine urbanization, and the influence of romantic European philosophy (Delaney 2002). The musical impact of “nativism” was felt particularly strongly in the rural province of Santiago del Estero, a region identified as a wellspring of “authentic” Argentine culture (Rojas 1905). Both Argentine individuals and institutions were inspired by the nativist perspective. In 1911, the Santiagueñan band leader Andrés Chazarreta established the nation’s first folk music “ballet” (Compañía de bailes nativos) (Vega 1981). In 1917, meanwhile, the Universidad de Tucumán hired the pianist Manuel Gómez Carrillo to conduct ethnomusicological research in Santiago (Veniard 1999). Chazarreta and Carrillo’s publications are the first to mention the Chacarera as a musical genre. While both musicians claimed to be replicating “folk” traditions in their books and recordings, some scholars credit them with establishing the form and choreography of the dance (Chazarreta 2007).

===Impact of the recording industry===
The Chacarera recordings and compositions of Manuel Gómez Carrillo and Andrés Chazarreta have provided a foundation for recording artists throughout the twentieth century, including Atahualpa Yupanqui, Los Hermanos Abalos, and more recent musical ensembles like the Dúo Coplanacu, Peteco Carabajal and La Chacarerata Santiagueña. The distribution of these recordings via record and radio has led to the establishment of  local, national, and international audiences for the genre. In Santiago del Estero, Mendoza, and Buenos Aires alike, musicians gather in Peñas, or small folkloric clubs, to sing and dance their favorite Chacareras, often with specific regional flare. In neighboring nation-states including Uruguay, Perú, Brazil, Bolivia and Chile, Chacarera recordings of artists like Yupanqui are well-known, and often incorporated into local repertoires.

===Chacarera as art music===
The Chacarera has also provided inspiration for art music composers like Alberto Ginastera, who used the genre’s distinctive syncopations frequently in his work. Manuel Gómez Carrillo himself was a conservatory-trained pianist, and set a precedent for this kind of “academic” setting in his compositions for solo piano.

==Some famous chacareras==

*Chacarera de las Piedras (Yupanqui)
*La Olvidada (Yupanqui)
*La Vieja (Hermanos Abalos)
*Chacarera del rancho (Hermanos Abalos)

Formerly Clowns of America, COAI was founded in its current form in 1984. In the early 1980s Clowns of America had financial problems. This led to its breakup and the founding of COAI and the World Clown Association. 

It comprises numerous "alleys", local clown clubs which act as meeting places for members, and general membership is available to anyone 16.

'''''Çoan ki''''' ({{zh|t=樽棋|p=zunqi|w=tsun k'i}}, also ''erectus ludus'' or "The Bottle Game") is a Chinese [[board game]] similar to [[backgammon]].&lt;ref name="Culin1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Culin|title=Korean games: with notes on the corresponding games of China and Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mopZAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=18 March 2013|date=1 January 1991|publisher=Brooklyn Museum in association with Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-26593-3|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first described in 1694 by [[Thomas Hyde|Dr. Thomas Hyde]] in ''De Ludis Orientalibus Libri Duo''.&lt;ref name="gamesmuseum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Culin/Dice1893/chongunchau.html | title=Elliott Avedon Virtual Museum Of Games | publisher=University of Waterloo | accessdate=June 21, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607183135/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Culin/Dice1893/chongunchau.html | archivedate=June 7, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell1969"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Charles Bell|title=Board and table games from many civilizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-cTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 March 2013|year=1969|publisher=Oxford U.P.|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
On a [[Game board|board]] divided transversely into eight fields, players take turns to move their sixteen bottle- or vase-shaped pieces around the board according to the roll of two [[dice]]. The aim of the game is to get all of a player's pieces to make one full circuit around the board and return them to their starting position.&lt;ref name="Wykes1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Wykes|title=The complete illustrated guide to gambling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6m1AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 June 2012|year=1964|publisher=Doubleday|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dice rolls can be divided between pieces as follows: either one piece moves the total value of the throw, or two pieces move the values shown on each individual die. If a double is thrown, the player may move two pieces the total value of the throw or one piece half the value (such that if a double five is rolled, two pieces may each move ten spaces or one piece may move five spaces). If the two dice show consecutive numbers, the player may move one piece the full value of the throw and one piece the lower value, or he may move one piece the full value and another piece the full value minus one (e.g. a throw of two and three would allow either one piece to move two spaces and another five, or one piece to move five spaces and another four). A player must use the full roll of the dice; if he cannot do so, he loses his turn.

By stationing eight pieces in the same field of the board, a player can create a block, which cannot be passed by the other player. Blocks cannot be created on either of the starting fields.

Players must enter a [[ante (poker)|stake]] before the game begins. If at any time a player rolls double-one on the dice, he loses a piece and must stake an additional fine worth 10% of the total value of the pot. Under some [[wikt:rulebook|rule codes]], it is possible to avoid losing a piece by paying a larger fine. The winner of the game takes the [[Pot (poker)|pot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Book of Games | publisher=Sterling Publishing | author=Botermans, Jack | year=2008 | isbn=9781402742217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5061">[[File:Smithson-Rolyat.jpg|thumb|Rolyat with [[Florence Smithson]] in ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' (1909)]]
'''Dan Rolyat''', born '''Herbert Taylor''' (11 November 1872 – 10 December 1927), was an English actor and singer. After an apprenticeship with a touring company he was engaged by the impresarios [[George Edwardes]] and [[Robert Courtneidge]] to play comic roles in [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]]. He also played in [[variety show]]s and, later in his career, in [[farce]].

Rolyat's greatest success was probably in the double role of John Smith and Simplicitas in ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' (1909), first in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of London and then in the British provinces. While playing the role on tour he suffered a severe accident that threatened to end his career. He recovered and worked on until the mid-1920s when ill-health forced him to retire.

==Early life and career==
Rolyat was born in [[Birmingham]] in the English midlands, the son of Thomas Taylor, described in ''Who's Who in the Theatre'' as a "private gentleman".&lt;ref name=who&gt;Parker, p. 790&lt;/ref&gt; Rolyat was educated at [[Queen's College, Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

He adopted the stage name of Dan Rolyat – "Dan" in honour of [[Dan Leno]] and "Rolyat" because he thought "Taylor" more distinctive when spelled backwards than forwards.&lt;ref name=mg&gt;"Mr Dan Rolyat", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 12 December 1927, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; He made his stage debut at Coutts's Theatre, Birmingham, in 1896, and joined a touring company playing in ''From Scotland Yard'' and ''Sentenced for Life''.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; He  joined [[George Edwardes]]'s company, and toured as Sammy Gigg in the [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901). He was a member of [[Fred Karno]]'s company, playing Sergeant Lightning in ''The Dandy Thieves'' (1905) and then appeared in [[variety show|variety]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt; He had established a reputation as a whimsically original comedian when he was cast for his first [[West End theatre|West End]] show in 1906&lt;ref name=mg/&gt; at the [[Apollo Theatre]].&lt;ref name="DDT8"&gt;"Dan Rolyat: Tragedy of a great laughter-maker", ''Derby Daily Telegraph'', 10 December 1927, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; This was ''The Dairymaids'', by [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]] and [[Arthur Wimperis]].  Rolyat played Joe Mivens; ''[[The Times]]'' thought him as funny as the show's star comedian, [[Walter Passmore]], and ''[[The Observer]]'' considered him to be the funnier of the two.&lt;ref&gt;"Apollo", ''The Times'', 16 April 1906, p. 10; and "''The Dairymaids'' at the Apollo", ''The Observer'', 15 April 1906, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Rolyat created the role of Benjamin Partridge in [[Edward German]]'s comic opera ''[[Tom Jones (Edward German)|Tom Jones]]''.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; That Christmas, he played the Baron in a [[pantomime]] version of ''[[Cinderella#Theatre|Cinderella]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

''The Dairymaids'' had been produced by the impresario [[Robert Courtneidge]], who engaged Rolyat to create the double role of John Smith and Simplicitas in the long-running musical ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' in 1909.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; Also for Courtneidge, Rolyat played Suki in ''The Mousmé'' (1911).&lt;ref name=who/&gt; In 1912, while touring in ''The Arcadians,'' he fell from his horse in Act II and suffered such severe injuries to his back that there was some doubt whether he would ever be able to appear on stage again.&lt;ref name=mg/&gt; He recovered after several months and toured as Prince Bogumil in ''[[Princess Caprice]]'' in 1913.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Later years==
Returning to the West End in  October 1914, Rolyat  appeared as Simon Slinks in a revival of another musical, ''[[Miss Hook of Holland]]''. For the rest of his career he performed in variety and musical comedy, and in 1922 he played in a non-musical farce, ''Nuts in May''.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; In the mid-1920s his health gave way, and he had to retire from performing. He underwent surgery for [[oral cancer]], but the operation was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="DDT8"/&gt; An all-star benefit show was organised to raise money to support him.&lt;ref name=mg/&gt;

Rolyat was twice married. His first wife was the singer and actress [[Florence Smithson]]; the marriage was dissolved, and in 1915 he married the actress Constance Worth.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; He died at his home in [[Brixton]], south London, at the age of fifty-five.&lt;ref name=mg/&gt;

'''Digital media''' are any [[media (communication)|media]] that are encoded in [[machine-readable data|machine-readable]] formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Media|url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/tss/pdfs/TBDigMedia.pdf|work=Technology Brief|publisher=University of Guelph|accessdate=28 March 2014|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital media can be created, viewed, distributed, modified and preserved on [[digital electronics]] devices.

==Digital Media ==
Examples of digital media include software, digital images, digital video, video game, web pages and websites, including social media, data and databases, digital audio, such as MP3 and electronic books. Digital media often contrasts with print media, such as printed books, newspapers and magazines, and other traditional or analog media, such as images, movies or audio tapes.
Digital media has a significant broad and complex impact on society and culture. Combined with the Internet and [[personal computing]], digital media has caused [[disruptive innovation]] in publishing, journalism, public relations, entertainment, education, commerce and politics. Digital media has also posed new challenges to [[copyright]] and intellectual property laws, fostering an [[open content]] movement in which content creators voluntarily give up some or all of their legal rights to their work. The ubiquity of digital media and its effects on society suggest that we are at the start of a new era in industrial history, called the [[Information Age]], perhaps leading to a [[paperless society]] in which all media are produced and consumed on computers.&lt;ref name=infoage&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewar|first=James A.|title=The information age and the printing press: looking backward to see ahead|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P8014/index2.html#fn0|publisher=RAND Corporation|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, challenges to a digital transition remain, including outdated copyright laws, [[censorship]], the [[digital divide]], and the spectre of a [[digital dark age]], in which older media becomes inaccessible to new or upgraded information systems.&lt;ref name=darkage&gt;{{cite news|last=Koehl|first=Sean|title=We need to act now to prevent a digital 'dark age'|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/05/we-need-to-act-to-prevent-a-digital-dark-age/|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=Wired|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex impact on society and culture.&lt;ref name=infoage /&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of programming languages|History of computing hardware}}

Codes and information by machines were first conceptualized by [[Charles Babbage]] in the early 1800s. Babbage imagined that these codes would give him instructions for his Motor of Difference and Analytical Engine, machines that Babbage had designed to solve the problem of error in calculations.
Between 1822 and 1823, [[Ada Lovelace]], mathematics, wrote the first instructions for calculating numbers on Babbage engines. Lovelace's instructions are now believed to be the first computer program.
Although the machines were designed to perform analysis tasks, Lovelace anticipated the possible social impact of computers and programming, writing. "For in the distribution and combination of truths and formulas of analysis, which may become easier and more quickly subjected to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relationships and the nature of many subjects in which science necessarily relates in new subjects, and more deeply researched ... there are in all extensions of human power or additions to human knowledge, various collateral influences, in addition to the primary and primary object reached. "Other old machine readable media include instructions for pianolas and [[weaving]] machines.

It is estimated that in the year 1986 less than 1% of the world's media storage capacity was digital and in 2007 it was already 94%.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], especially [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/02/08/science.1200970.DC1/Hilbert-SOM.pdf Supporting online material], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; The year 2002 is assumed to be the year when human kind was able to store more information in digital than in analog media (the "beginning of the [[digital age]]").&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo|title=World_info_capacity_animation|first=|last=Martin Hilbert|date=11 June 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital computers===
[[Image:Wikipedia in binary.gif|thumb|left|Digital codes, like [[binary code|binary]], can be changed without reconfiguring mechanical parts]]
Though they used machine-readable media, Babbage's engines, player pianos, jacquard looms and many other early calculating machines were themselves [[analog computers]], with physical, mechanical parts. The first truly digital media came into existence with the rise of [[digital computer]]s.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite web|last=Copeland|first=B. Jack|title=The modern history of computing|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-history/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=31 March 2014|date=Fall 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Digital computers use [[binary code]] and [[Boolean logic]] to store and process information, allowing one machine in one configuration to perform many different tasks. The first modern, programmable, digital computers, the [[Manchester Mark 1]] and the [[EDSAC]], were independently invented between 1948 and 1949.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sci/tech pioneers recall computer creation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/317437.stm|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=BBC|date=15 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though different in many ways from modern computers, these machines had digital software controlling their [[logical operation]]s. They were encoded in [[binary code|binary]], a system of ones and zeroes that are combined to make hundreds of characters. The 1s and 0s of binary are the "digits" of digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebetterindia.com/27331/12-projects-you-should-know-about-under-the-digital-india-initiative/|title=12 Projects You Should Know About Under the Digital India Initiative|date=2 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="As We May Think"===
While digital media came into common use in the early 1950s, the ''conceptual'' foundation of digital media is traced to the work of scientist and engineer [[Vannevar Bush]] and his celebrated essay "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/ As We May Think]," published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in 1945.&lt;ref name=symposium&gt;{{cite news|last=Simpson|first=Rosemary|title=50 years after "As We May Think": the Brown/MIT Vannevar Bush symposium|url=http://cs.brown.edu/~rms/50YearsAfter.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=Interactions|date=March 1996|author2=Allen Renear|author3=Elli Mylonas|author4=Andries van Dam|pages=47–67|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514102637/http://cs.brown.edu/~rms/50YearsAfter.pdf|archive-date=2014-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush envisioned a system of devices that could be used to help scientists, doctors, historians and others, store, analyze and communicate information.&lt;ref name=symposium /&gt; Calling this then-imaginary device a "[[memex]]", Bush wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.&lt;ref name=AWMT&gt;{{cite news|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|title=As We May Think|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=The Atlantic Monthly|date=1 July 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Impact==

===The digital revolution===
{{See also|Digital Revolution}}
In the years since the invention of the first digital computers, computing power and storage capacity have increased exponentially. [[Personal computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s put the ability to access, modify, store and share digital media in the hands of billions of people. Many electronic devices, from [[digital camera]]s to [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]s have the ability to create, transmit and view digital media. Combined with the [[World Wide Web]] and the [[Internet]], digital media has transformed 21st century society in a way that is frequently compared to the cultural, economic and social impact of the [[printing press]].&lt;ref name=infoage /&gt;&lt;ref name=aclib&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazillion|first=Richard|title=Academic libraries in the digital revolution|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eqm0119.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=Educause Quarterly|date=2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503055833/http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EQM0119.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change has been so rapid and so widespread that it has launched an economic transition from an industrial economy to an information-based economy, creating a new period in human history known as the [[Information Age]]  or the [[digital revolution]].&lt;ref name=infoage /&gt;

The transition has created some uncertainty about definitions. Digital media, [[new media]], [[multimedia]], and similar terms all have a relationship to both the engineering innovations and cultural impact of digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lauer |first=Claire |title=Contending with Terms: "Multimodal" and "Multimedia" in the Academic and Public Spheres |journal=Computers and Composition |date=2009 |volume=26 |pages=225–239 |url=http://dmp.osu.edu/dmac/supmaterials/lauer.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2009.09.001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327001010/http://dmp.osu.edu/dmac/supmaterials/lauer.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The blending of digital media with other media, and with cultural and social factors, is sometimes known as new media or "the new media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ito|first=Mizuko|title=Living and learning with the new media: summary of findings from the digital youth project|date=November 2008|url=http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/files/report/digitalyouth-WhitePaper.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, digital media seems to demand a new set of communications skills, called [[transliteracy]], [[media literacy]], or [[digital literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital literacy definition|url=http://connect.ala.org/node/181197|publisher=ALA Connect|accessdate=30 March 2014|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These skills include not only the ability to read and write—traditional [[literacy]]—but the ability to navigate the Internet, evaluate sources
, and create digital content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is ital literacy?|url=http://digitalliteracy.cornell.edu/welcome/dpl0000.html|work=Cornell University Digital Literacy Resource|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that we are moving toward a fully digital, paperless society is accompanied by the fear that we may soon—or currently—be facing a [[digital dark age]], in which older media are no longer accessible on modern devices or using modern methods of scholarship.&lt;ref name="darkage"/&gt; Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex effect on society and culture.&lt;ref name=infoage /&gt;

The impact of the digital revolution can also be assessed by exploring the amount of worldwide mobile smart device users there are. This can be split into 2 categories smart phone users and smart tablet users. Worldwide there are currently 2.32 billion smartphone users across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/|title=Number of smartphone users worldwide 2014-2020 {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is to exceed 2.87 billion by 2020. Smart tablet users reached a total of 1 billion in 2015, 15% of the world’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Tablet-Users-Surpass-1-Billion-Worldwide-2015/1011806|title=Tablet Users to Surpass 1 Billion Worldwide in 2015 - eMarketer|website=www.emarketer.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mobile phone was released in 1973 by a senior engineer in [[Motorola]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.knowyourmobile.com/nokia/nokia-3310/19848/history-mobile-phones-1973-2008-handsets-made-it-all-happen|title=The History of Mobile Phones From 1973 To 2008: The Handsets That Made It ALL Happen|work=Know Your Mobile|access-date=2017-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was only affordable by the incredibly wealthy. The fact that such a large proportion of the world’s population own smart devices demonstrates the rapid level of growth achieved throughout the digital revolution.

The statistics evidence the impact of digital media communications today. What is also of relevance is the fact that the numbers of smart device users is rising rapidly yet the amount of functional uses increase daily. A smartphone or tablet can be used for hundreds of daily needs. There are currently over 1 million apps on the Apple Appstore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/22/4866302/apple-announces-1-million-apps-in-the-app-store|title=Apple announces 1 million apps in the App Store, more than 1 billion songs played on iTunes radio|date=2013-10-22|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all opportunities for digital marketing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/33qamar/detail/recent-activity/posts|title=DIgital Marketing Articles|date=2016-09-26|website=LinkedIn|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smartphone user is impacted with digital advertising every second they open their Apple or Android device. This further evidences the digital revolution and the impact of revolution.

===Disruption in industry===
Compared with [[print media]], the [[mass media]], and other analog technologies, digital media are easy to copy, store, share and modify. This quality of digital media has led to significant changes in many industries, especially journalism, publishing, education, entertainment, and the music business. The overall effect of these changes is so far-reaching that it is difficult to quantify. For example, in movie-making, the transition from analog [[film]] cameras to digital cameras is nearly complete. The transition has economic benefits to Hollywood, making distribution easier and making it possible to add high-quality digital effects to films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cusumano|first=Catherine|title=Changeover in film technology spells end for age of analog|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/03/18/changeover-in-film-technology-spells-end-for-age-of-analog/|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=Brown Daily Herald|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it has affected the analog special effects, stunt, and animation industries in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=switch&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Beth|title=Side by side takes digital vs. analog debate to the movies|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/04/side-by-side/|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=Wired|date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has imposed painful costs on small movie theaters, some of which did not or will not survive the transition to digital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCracken |first=Erin |title=Last reel: Movie industry's switch to digital hits theaters -- especially small ones -- in the wallet |url=http://www.ydr.com/ci_23139035/last-reel-movie-industrys-switch-digital-hits-theaters |accessdate=29 March 2014 |newspaper=York Daily Record |date=5 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407050448/http://www.ydr.com/ci_23139035/last-reel-movie-industrys-switch-digital-hits-theaters |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of digital media on other media industries is similarly sweeping and complex.&lt;ref name=switch /&gt;

In journalism, digital media and [[citizen journalism]] have led to the loss of thousands of jobs in print media and the bankruptcy of many major newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirchhoff|first=Suzanne M.|title=The U.S. newspaper industry in transition|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40700.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the rise of [[digital journalism]] has also created thousands of new jobs and specializations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zara|first=Christopher|title=Job growth in digital journalism is bigger than anyone knows|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/job-growth-digital-journalism-bigger-anyone-knows-799109|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=International Business Times|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E-book]]s and [[self-publishing]] are changing the book industry, and [[digital textbook]]s and other media-inclusive curricula are changing primary and secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publishing in the digital era|url=http://www.bain.com/Images/BB_Publishing_in_the_digital_era_4_11.pdf|publisher=Bain &amp; Company|accessdate=29 March 2014|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=policy&gt;{{cite news|last=Toppo|first=Greg|title=Obama wants schools to speed digital transition|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-01-31/schools-e-textbooks/52907492/1|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In academia, digital media has led to a new form of scholarship, called [[digital scholarship]], and new fields of study, such as [[digital humanities]] and [[digital history]]. It has changed the way libraries are used and their role in society.&lt;ref name=aclib /&gt; Every major media, communications and academic endeavor is facing a period of transition and uncertainty related to digital media.

===Individual as content creator===
Digital media has also allowed individuals to be much more active in [[content creation]].&lt;ref name="pew-new"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horrigan|first=John|title=A Typology of Information and Communication Technology Users|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2007/A-Typology-of-Information-and-Communication-Technology-Users/Summary-of-Findings.aspx|publisher=Pew Internet and American Life Study|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone with access to computers and the Internet can participate in social media and contribute their own writing, art, videos, photography and commentary to the Internet, as well as conduct business online. The dramatic reduction in the costs required to create and share content have led to a democratization of content creation as well as the creation of new types of content, like [[blog]]s, [[Internet meme|memes]] and [[video essay]]s. Some of these activities have also been labelled [[citizen journalism]]. This spike in user created content is due to the development of the internet as well as the way in which users interact with media today. The release of technologies such mobile devices allow for easier and quicker access to all things media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-934230-3|pages=237–239|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many media production tools that were once only available to a few are now free and easy to use. The cost of devices that can access the internet is dropping steadily, and now personal ownership of multiple digital devices is becoming standard. These elements have significantly affected political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Cathy J.|author2=Joseph Kahne|title=Participatory politics: new media and youth political action|date=2012|url=http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/sites/all/files/publications/YPP_Survey_Report_FULL.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital media is seen by many scholars as having a role in [[Arab Spring]], and crackdowns on the use of digital and social media by embattled governments are increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelley|first=Peter|title=Philip Howard’s new book explores digital media role in Arab Spring|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/06/13/philip-howards-new-book-explores-digital-media-role-in-arab-spring/|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=University of Washington|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments restrict access to digital media in some way, either to prevent [[obscenity]] or in a broader form of political [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rininsland|first=Andrew|title=Internet censorship listed: how does each country compare?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/datablog/2012/apr/16/internet-censorship-country-list|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[User-generated content]] raises issues of privacy, credibility, civility and compensation for cultural, intellectual and artistic contributions. The spread of digital media, and the wide range of [[literacy]] and communications skills necessary to use it effectively, have deepened the [[digital divide]] between those who have access to digital media and those who don't.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Susan P.|title=Internet access and the new digital divide|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/opinion/sunday/internet-access-and-the-new-divide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rising of digital media has made the consumer's audio collection more precise and personalized. It is no longer necessary to purchase an entire album if the consumer is ultimately interested in only a few audio files.

===Web only news===
As the internet becomes more and more prevalent, more companies are beginning to distribute content through internet only means. With the loss of viewers there is a loss of revenue but not as bad as what would be expected. Cisco Inc released its latest forecast and the numbers are all trending to internet news to continue to grow at a rate where it will be quadruple by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/ip-ngn-ip-next-generation-network/white_paper_c11-481360.pdf|title=Cisco Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Methodology, 2013–2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright challenges===

Digital media&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; pose many challenges to current [[copyright]] and [[intellectual property]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright: an overview|url=http://www.jiscdigitalmedia.ac.uk/guide/copyright-an-overview|publisher=Jisc Digital Media|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ease of creating, modifying and sharing digital media makes copyright enforcement a challenge, and copyright laws are widely seen as outdated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnett|first=Emma|title=Outdated copyright laws hinder growth says Government|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8519420/Outdated-copyright-laws-hinder-growth-says-Government.html|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brunet|first=Maël|title=Outdated copyright laws must adapt to the new digital age|url=http://www.policyreview.eu/outdated-copyright-laws-must-adapt-to-the-new-digital-age/|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Policy Review|date=March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140330012004/http://www.policyreview.eu/outdated-copyright-laws-must-adapt-to-the-new-digital-age/|archivedate=30 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, under current copyright law, common [[Internet meme]]s are probably illegal to share in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kloc|first=Joe|title=Outdated copyright law makes memes illegal in Australia|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/australia-copyright-memes-illegal/|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Daily Dot|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal rights are at least unclear for many common Internet activities, such as posting a picture that belongs to someone else to a social media account, covering a popular song on a YouTube video, or writing [[fanfiction]]. Over the last decade the concept of fair use has been applied to many online medias.

To resolve some of these issues, content creators can voluntarily adopt [[Open license|open]] or [[copyleft]] licenses, giving up some of their legal rights, or they can release their work to the [[public domain]]. Among the most common open licenses are [[Creative Commons]] licenses and the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], both of which are in use on [[Wikipedia]]. Open licenses are part of a broader [[open content]] movement that pushes for the reduction or removal of copyright restrictions from software, data and other digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=Andrew|title=The open-content movement|url=http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2008/10/20/02wiki.h02.html|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Digital Directions|date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional software has been developed in order to protect digital media. [[digital rights management]] (DRM) is used to digitally copyright material and allows users to use that media for specific cases. For example, DRM allows a movie producer to rent a movie at a lower price than selling the movie, restricting the movie rental license length, rather than only selling the movie at full price. Additionally, DRM can prevent unauthorized sharing or modification of media.

Digital Media is numerical, networked and interactive system of links and databases that allows us to navigate from one bit of content or webpage to another.

One form of digital media that is becoming a phenomenon is in the form of an [[online magazine]] or digital magazine. What exactly is a digital magazine? Due to the economic importance of digital magazines, the Audit Bureau of Circulations integrated the definition of this medium in its latest report (March 2011): a digital magazine involves the distribution of a magazine content by electronic means; it may be a replica.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Santos Silva|first1=Dora|conference=ELPUB - 16th International Conference on Electronic Publishing|booktitle=Social Shaping of Digital Publishing: Exploring the Interplay Between Culture and Technology|editor-last=Baptista|editor-first=A.A.|date=June 14{{ndash}}15, 2012|location=Guimarães, Portugal|url=http://elpub.scix.net/data/works/att/109_elpub2012.content.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Future of Digital Magazine Publishing|accessdate=21 November 2014|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an outdated definition of what a digital magazine is. A digital magazine should not be, in fact, a replica of the print magazine in PDF, as was common practice in recent years. It should, rather, be a magazine that is, in essence, interactive and created from scratch to a digital platform (Internet, mobile phones, private networks, iPad or other device).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The barriers for digital magazine distribution are thus decreasing. At the same time digitizing platforms are broadening the scope of where digital magazines can be published, such as within websites and on smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Ryan|title=Are Digital Magazines Dead|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/are-digital-magazines-dead/|website=WWW.wired.com|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the improvements of tablets and digital magazines are becoming visually enticing and readable magazines with it graphic arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=Mclntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-934230-3|page=89|edition=fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dragon Models Limited''' ('''Dragon''' or '''DML''' for short) is a [[Hong-Kong]]-based manufacturer of [[plastic model]] kits, [[diecast models]] and [[Action figures|military action figures]]. Founded in 1987, the company shares distribution agreements with [[Revell]]/Monogram, Revell Germany and [[Italeri]] in Europe, and [[Hasegawa (model company)|Hasegawa]] and GSI in Japan.

==History==
Dragon was established in 1987, as a sister company to model retailer [[Universal Models Limited]] (UML), to manufacture plastic model kits according to its own designs, so that UML would be less reliant on imported products. For the next decade Dragon focused only on models of [[model military vehicle|military vehicles]]. It later began to share distribution agreement with model companies of other countries, so that their products could be exported worldwide. Since its founding it has released more than 1,000 items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragon-models.com/html/company%20profile.htm Dragon Models Ltd. – About us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621163200/http://www.dragon-models.com/html/company%20profile.htm |date=21 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Dragon diversified into other model fields. It started manufacturing a line of 1/400 [[airliner]] models called Dragon Wings, which is now one of Dragon's most important series. In 1999, Dragon introduced its [[styrene]], 1:6 scale New Generation Life Action Figure series. The series currently encompasses more than 600 releases.

To capitalize on the success of Dragon Wings, Dragon introduced the Warbirds in 2002. A line of 1/72 scale diecast [[fighter aircraft]], the series included both [[List of aircraft of World War II|World War II]] and modern day planes. In 2003 Dragon began to manufacture 1/72 die-cast [[tank]] models to accompany Warbirds, marketed with the label "Dragon Armor".

As a military model maker, Dragon is distinguishable from other makers in that Dragon often has most number of parts, i.e. catering toward top end experienced modellers, rather than beginners.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}   However, Dragon is also trying to appeal to the more casual audience through its current release of 'Smart Kits' (see below).

==Product Lines==

===Military Miniatures/Plastic Model Kits===
The oldest category in Dragon's export line is the "Military Miniatures" series of scale figures and vehicles available in kit form. Many of these kits are marketed as "3 in 1", which means modellers can create one of three variations of the vehicle from the same kit. The series focuses on mostly [[World War II]]-era military subjects. A kit is usually packaged in a box with a painting of the vehicle alongside photos of the completed model. The number of parts of a kit is always printed on the box.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Dragon also produces 1/72 products. Rare or paper-only vehicles like the German [[Entwicklung series#E-100|E-100]] and [[Panzer VIII Maus|Maus]] are being manufactured in this scale. While smaller, these kits still feature photo-etched parts and decals common in [[1:35 scale|1/35]] kits.

Beginning 2005, Dragon upgraded a number of its kits to include new features, as well as smaller parts for added details. Most of these kits also included [[decal]]s printed by [[Cartograf]], an Italian decal maker.

====Magic Tracks and EZ tracks====
'Magic Tracks' are individual track links that come in a bag, ready to be assembled without the tedious work of removing them from [[Sprue (manufacturing)|sprue]]s. Magic Tracks are designed to snap together through a tight friction fit, so that the track can be more easily assembled than tracks molded with sprues. However, glue is still needed after the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonmodelsltd.com/catalog/dml/new/6252/new-28.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008012027/http://www.dragonmodelsltd.com/catalog/dml/new/6252/new-28.jpg |archivedate=8 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Dragon's claims of completely effortless assembly, cleaning the links up is still required, since each link has knock-out pin marks left behind from the molding process.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Injection molding]] limitations also mean that tracks are not as detailed as traditional link tracks, for example missing the tiny holes in the guide horns of [[Tiger I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missing-lynx.com/reviews/german/dml_1-35_6252_fds.html missing-lynx.com – Reviews – DRAGON MODELS LIMITED (kit no. 6252) Tiger I Initial Version in 1/35th-scale injection-molded styrene plastic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====One-Piece DS Tracks====
A few of Dragon's newer kits, such as its [[Sherman tank|Sherman M4A2 kit]], include one-piece tracks made from 'Dragon Styrene 100' (DS), a plastic developed by Dragon's own [[Research and Development]] team. A cross breed of [[polystyrene]] and [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], DS is an attempt to combine the advantages of the two materials. Delicate details can be reproduced with DS using under-cut molding, reducing the number of small parts. The [[Tiger I]] hollow guide horns, for example, can be replicated on DS using slide-mold technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragon-models.com/catalog/dml/insidestory/6406/6406-01.htm 6406 inside story – Tracking the ultimate Tiger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630212201/http://www.dragon-models.com/catalog/dml/insidestory/6406/6406-01.htm |date=30 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tracks can also be joined with normal plastic cement.

Some recent DS tracks seem to have an issue of being too long or too loose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missing-lynx.com/reviews/german/dmltiger_fdesisto.html missing-lynx.com – Reviews – Dragon's Sd.Kfz. 181, Pz.Kpw. VI Tiger (P), (1/35th) Item number 6210&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks may also come stretched due to packaging limitation, but the issue can be resolved by soaking the tracks in hot water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragon-models.com/html/6062announcement.htm 6062 – M4A2 Tarawa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712195538/http://www.dragon-models.com/html/6062announcement.htm |date=12 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Photo-etched Parts====
Dragon almost always includes a small amount of [[Photolithography|photo-etched]] brass in its kits. Originally Dragon relied heavily on photo-etched parts to model engine deck screens, but it has since expanded its use of photo-etching to include optional parts like chains and fenders. Photo etched brass parts are used in kits to make small or delicate parts that are harder to make in scale from plastic, such as miniature eyeglasses, medals, seat belts, machine gun mounts, intake screens, etc.

In addition to photo-etched parts straight from the kit, Dragon also manufactures a small amount of separate photo-etched detail sets. It also has distribution agreement with Chinese model accessories company [[Lion Roar]] to sell and market Lion Roar's detail sets, which are available for kits from Dragon and other model companies.

====Decals====
Like its competitors, Dragon also includes [[decal]]s in its kits. While Dragon sometimes prints its own decal sheets, it usually uses decals printed by [[Cartograf]], an Italian decal maker.

====Metal Parts====
Turned aluminum barrels, metal tow cables, [[brass]] antenna and brass ammunition shells are common parts included in Dragon kits as an alternative to styrene parts. Small metal parts may also be included to accurately replicate a tank's wheels and lamp wiring. Some kits have as many as 48 metal parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://missing-lynx.com/reviews/german/dml_1-35_6252_fds.html missing-lynx.com – Reviews – DRAGON MODELS LIMITED (kit no. 6252) Tiger I Initial Version in 1/35th-scale injection-molded styrene plastic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slide Molding====
Although it is not a new technique, the use of slide molds allows more accurate reproduction of details than traditional two-piece molds. This is done by using [[Injection molding|injection molds]] with moving parts (known as "slides") that are inserted into the mold to form parts and then removed so the part can be extracted from the mold. It helps increase the authenticity of the model and reduce the number of parts by molding details onto larger parts. Weld patterns between plates, gratings, one-piece hull and turret interior are common features included in Dragon kits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragonmodelsltd.com/html/6264.htm 6264 – Pz. Kpfw. IV Ausf.E&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707180206/http://www.dragonmodelsltd.com/html/6264.htm |date=7 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of slide mold technology has caused Dragon to rely less on photo-etched parts (See Smart Kit, below).

====Smart Kits====
According to Dragon, 'Smart Kits' are designed to be easier to build, without sacrificing the level of detail.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Extra engineering has been invested in these kits, so that the construction of the models is more straightforward. Extensive use of slide molding techniques means crisply detailed parts are reproduced without the need of photo etched parts. Hence the kits can be built out of the box by most modelers using standard construction techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragonmodelsltd.com/html/6268-reviews.htm 6268 – Sd.Kfz.171 Panther G Late Production&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709063924/http://www.dragonmodelsltd.com/html/6268-reviews.htm |date=9 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 'Smart Kit' generally costs less than ordinary Dragon kits, because of the inclusion of fewer metal parts. However, Dragon emphasizes that the model has not in any way become simpler—only the assembly is less tedious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragonmodelsltd.com/html/6268intro.htm 6268 – Sd.Kfz.171 Panther G Late Production&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024082145/http://www.dragonmodelsltd.com/html/6268intro.htm |date=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dragon has so far released thirty one Smart Kits, the first being a [[Panther tank|Panther G]].

===Dragon Wings (1/400 scale)===
In 1997, Dragon started the Dragon Wings line of 1/400 scale aircraft, aiming not only at collectors but also airline companies who need display models. These models are sold fully finished. Over 100 commercial and national airline models have been released since then. Dragon is the officially appointed supplier of aircraft models for [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] for their promotional and souvenir purposes.

The 1/400 line of Dragon Wings also includes a diecast space collection serie. This collection includes models of the [[Space Shuttle]], the [[Saturn V]] rocket of the [[Apollo program]] from [[NASA]] and many other launch vehicle such has the [[Delta II]] rocket. Other models like the [[International Space Station]] and the Russian space station [[Mir]] are supposed to be released in 2011–2012.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===Military Figures (1/6 scale)===
In 1999, Dragon introduced its New Generation Life Action Figure series. The series features fully posable military and licensed 12-inch figures with cloth uniforms, weapons and equipment. The series currently stands at some 400-plus individual releases, with subjects varying from World War II, Modern [[Special Operations]] and Law Enforcement, to licensed character figures from movies, sports, electronic games and comics. The curral equipment ranging up to [[paratrooper]]s with aircraft walls, functioning parachutes and many vehicles. During the early 2000s, Dragon Models produced hundreds of action figures, most of them being World War II German figures. However, after 2010, the number of figures that it produced began to sharply decline. Dragon Models stopped producing 1/6 scale action figures in November 2012.

*Other action figure/model kit series:
::Warrior Series (1/16) – Figures of tank crew and infantry
::World's Elite Force Series (1/35)
::'Nam' Series (1/35)
::54mm Figures

===Die-cast models (1/72 scale)===
Dragon has released 'The Warbirds' line of mainly 1/72 scale die-cast fighter aircraft ranging from World War II classics to the modern day aircraft. In 2003 Dragon introduced another line of die-cast models – Dragon Armor – to complement with its Warbirds series of fighter aircraft. Dragon also markets a line of 1/144 models ('Panzer Korps') of German World War II and modern tanks.

==Facilities==
Dragon has several large regional divisions. The most notable is in [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]], which produces its own exclusive lines of products. Its headquarters is located in [[Tsuen Wan]], Hong Kong.

Its US branch, which is responsible for marketing and distributing products for Dragon and other affiliated model companies in the US, is located in [[Industry, California|Industry]], [[Southern California]].

==John Adam hoax==
In 2005 a militant group calling themselves the "Mujahedeen Brigades" posted a photograph depicting an American soldier named "John Adam" with his hands tied behind his back with a rifle pointed at him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Joel|title='Captured GI' A Real Doll|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/captured-gi-a-real-doll/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolt|first1=Roelf|title=The Encyclopaedia of Liars and Deceivers|date=2014|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|isbn=9781780233123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t95sAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT100&amp;dq=John+Adam+%22Special+Ops+Cody%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAmoVChMI9bWMw-iJyAIVw44NCh1-Ow69#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Adam%20%22Special%20Ops%20Cody%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His purported captors claimed that they would execute Adam if the United States did not comply with their demands, which called for the release of several Iraqi prisoners.&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Doubts cast on claim U.S. soldier kidnapped|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6894934/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/doubts-cast-claim-us-soldier-kidnapped/#.VgEnONJVhBc|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gallagher|first1=Mark|title=Action Figures: Men, Action Films, and Contemporary Adventure Narratives|date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1403970122|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WnIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=John+Adam+%22Special+Ops+Cody%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwA2oVChMI9bWMw-iJyAIVw44NCh1-Ow69#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Adam%20%22Special%20Ops%20Cody%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media sources questioned the photo's legitimacy and a military specialist for [[CNN]] commented that the image had several inaccuracies, one of which was the figure's uniform jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/02/01/iraq.hostage/index.html|title=So-called U.S. hostage appears to be toy|date=2005-02-01 |publisher=CNN|first=|last= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050203001402/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/02/01/iraq.hostage/index.html|archivedate=3 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after a spokesperson for Dragon noted that the man in the photo appeared to be the action figure "Special Ops Cody" and that the gun pointed at his head was an accessory that came with the toy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Geoff|last2=Steuter|first2=Erin|title=Pop Culture Goes to War: Enlisting and Resisting Militarism in the War on Terror|date=2010|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|isbn=9780739146828|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbK-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=John+Adam+%22Special+Ops+Cody%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nVDa_l_v1V&amp;sig=nu1rpkTwcmRPdPkM5hcL5GiWQcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCWoVChMIgaX59eaJyAIVwZANCh2w7gMn#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Adam%20%22Special%20Ops%20Cody%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toy had been manufactured exclusively for sale at [[AAFES]] in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=sas&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanderston|first1=Ward|title=Kidnapped' action figure is latest must-have toy|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/kidnapped-action-figure-is-latest-must-have-toy-1.29103|publisher=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of the figure rose after news of the toy's name spread.&lt;ref name=sas /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2486">'''Faceboyz Folliez''' is a variety show presented the first Sunday of each month at the [[Bowery Poetry Club]]  in New York City's [[Lower East Side]]. The show usually combines a variety of acts including readings by numerous published authors, [[burlesque]] performers, live music, [[Underground film|underground movies]] and an audience participation segment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevillager.com/?p=1929 Just Do Art! | thevillager.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Produced and hosted by actor and performer [[Faceboy]], which the show is named after, it features a core cast consisting of [[Rev. Jen Miller]], Velocity Chyaldd, Stormy Leather, Amanda Whip and Paaje Flash. The event is notable as well for the original short films produced by [[ASS Studios]], a production company Faceboy is directly affiliated with, which are all directed by underground filmmaker Courtney Fathom Sell.&lt;ref name="villager_1147"&gt;[http://www.thevillager.com/?p=1147 Just Do Art! | thevillager.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ASSstudios.tumblr.com ASS Studios&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faceboyzfolliez.com Faceboyz Folliez : Bowery Poetry Club : NYC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the famed [[Folies Bergère]] of Paris, the cast of Faceboyz Folliez present a show that is usually as daring as the Folies Bergère was considered to be in its time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.timeout.com/music-nightlife/nightlife/2652801/scene-spotlight-faceboyz-folliez-nsfw Live photos from Faceboyz Folliez - Nightlife - Time Out New York&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Past guests have included; [[Jonathan Ames]], [[John S.

'''Gerald Brom''' (born March 9, 1965 in [[Albany, Georgia]]), known professionally as '''Brom''', is an American [[Gothic art|gothic]] [[fantasy]] artist and illustrator, known for his work in [[role-playing game]]s, novels, and [[comic books|comics]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Stanley A. III (August 4, 2002). "Gen Con offerings still magical", ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', p. E1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Brom was born March 9, 1965, in [[Albany, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kenson| first = Stephen| authorlink = Steve Kenson| title = Profiles: Brom| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #264| page = 112| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| location = [[Renton, Washington]]|date=October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the son of a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] pilot he spent much of his early years on the move, living in other countries such as [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] (he graduated from [[Frankfurt American High School]]), and U.S. states including [[Alabama]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt; Brought up as a military dependent he was known by his last name only, and now signs his name as simply '''Brom''': "I get that asked more than just about any other question. It's my real name, my last name. I got called Brom all the time as a kid, and it just stuck."&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt;

Brom has been drawing and painting since childhood, although he had never taken any formal art classes.&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt; "I wouldn't exactly call myself self-taught, because I've always looked at the work of other artists and emulated what I liked about it. So you can say they taught me."&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt; Brom cites the work of [[Frank Frazetta]], [[N.C. Wyeth]], and [[Norman Rockwell]] as influences on his style: "Okay... Rockwell isn't the kind of inspiration most people expect from me, but he just painted things so well. To me it's not so much the genre but the way it's done, and you have to admire his technique."&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt;

==Career==
At the age of 20, Brom started working full-time as a commercial illustrator.&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/Bios/default.aspx?doc=brom|title=Brom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224005441/http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/Bios/default.aspx?doc=brom|archivedate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By age twenty-one, he had two national art representatives, and was doing work for such clients as [[Coca-Cola]], [[IBM]], [[CNN]], and [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"/&gt; [[TSR, Inc.]] hired Brom on full-time in 1989 at the age of 24.&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt; Brom contributed to all of TSR's game and book lines, particularly the [[Dark Sun]] setting: "I pretty much designed the look and feel of the Dark Sun campaign. I was doing paintings before they were even writing about the setting. I'd do a painting or a sketch, and the designers wrote those characters and ideas into the story. I was very involved in the development process. I've been fortunate to be involved in the development end of a lot of projects I've worked on, from role-playing games to computer games."&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt; According to Shannon Appelcline, Brom "contributed the unique illustrations for ''Dark Sun'' that helped to set it apart from the other TSR games with their more typical fantasy drawings".&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} His paintings have been published in [[collectible card games]] such as [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' and [[Last Unicorn Games]]' ''[[Heresy: Kingdom Come]]''.&lt;ref name="SendaiBubble-Artists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sendai.best.vwh.net/rich/heresy/Artist.html|title=''Heresy'' Cards by Artist|publisher=''The Sendai Bubble''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031210110205/http://sendai.best.vwh.net/rich/heresy/Artist.html|archivedate=2003-12-10|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brom's paintings, along with [[Frank Frazetta]]'s, were used in the development of the visual look of the game series [[Warlords (game series)|Warlords]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Fawkner|Fawkner, Steve]] (September 2007). "Infinite Interactive's Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords", ''[[Game Developer (magazine)|Game Developer]]'' '''14''' (8): 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, after four years at TSR, Brom returned to the freelance market, still specializing in the darker side of the roleplaying game, card game, and comic book genres.&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt; [[Shane Lacy Hensley]] came up with the idea for the game ''[[Deadlands]]'' after he saw Brom's cover to ''Necropolis: Atlanta'' from [[White Wolf Publishing|White Wolf]], and got Brom to do the cover for the initial release.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|325}} His artwork also appeared on book covers from authors such as [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Anne McCaffrey]], and [[Terry Brooks]].&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt; Brom contributed conceptual work to computer games such as ''[[Heretic II]]'', and several top creature houses for films such as [[Stan Winston]] Studios; he also co-created, art directed, and illustrated the ''Dark Age'' collectible card game.&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt; He has since worked as a [[Film|movie]] concept artist, and created illustrations for [[comic]]s (by [[DC Comics|DC]], [[Chaos Comics|Chaos]], [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]) and [[computer game]]s (for [[id Software]], [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]], [[Sega]] and [[Activision]]).&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"/&gt; Brom has also been active with a line of Brom fetish toys from ''Fewture'' and a series of [[bronze]]s from the [[Franklin Mint]] and paintings for novels (by Michael Moorcock, Terry Brooks, [[R. A. Salvatore|R.A. Salvatore]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]).&lt;ref name="wizardsbio"/&gt;

Brom returned to TSR in 1998, doing paintings for the ''[[Alternity]]'' game, the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|AD&amp;D]]'' [[role-playing game]] and its [[Forgotten Realms]] and [[Planescape]] lines, and covers for ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' and ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name="Dragon #264"/&gt; His work is included in the book ''Masters of Dragonlance Art''.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ammassa, Don (January 2003). "Masters of Dragonlance Art", ''[[DNA Publications|Chronicle]]'' '''25''' (1): 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also returned to painting for book covers for TSR's successor [[Wizards of the Coast]], including the covers for the ''[[War of the Spider Queen]]'' series and reprints of ''[[The Avatar Series]]''.

'''''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed by [[Rockstar North]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It was released on 29 October 2002 for the [[PlayStation 2]], on 12 May 2003 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and on 31 October 2003 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. An enhanced version was released for mobile platforms in 2012, for the game's tenth anniversary. It is the sixth title in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] and the first main entry since 2001's ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''. Set within the fictional Vice City, based on [[Miami]], the game follows [[Tommy Vercetti]] following his release from prison. After he is caught up in an ambushed drug deal, he seeks out those responsible while building a criminal empire and seizing power from other criminal organisations in the city.

The game is played from a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]], and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The [[open world]] design lets the player freely roam Vice City, consisting of two main islands. The game's plot is based on multiple real-world people and events in Miami such as Cuban, Haitian, and [[Biker gangs]], the 1980s [[crack epidemic]], the [[American Mafia|Mafioso]] drug lords of Miami, and the dominance of [[glam metal]]. The game was also influenced by the film and television of the era, including ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[Miami Vice]]''. Much of the development work constituted creating the game world to fit the inspiration and time period; the development team conducted extensive field research in Miami while creating the world.

Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its music, gameplay and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the depiction of violence and racial groups.  The game sparked lawsuits and protests while being labelled as violent and explicit. ''Vice City'' became the best-selling video game of 2002 and has sold over 17.5 million copies. Considered one of the most significant titles of the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]] of video games, and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]], it won numerous year-end accolades including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. Since its release, the game has received numerous ports to many gaming platforms. Its successor, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', was released in October 2004, and a prequel, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories|Vice City Stories]]'', was released in 2006.

== Gameplay ==
''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. The player controls the criminal [[Tommy Vercetti]] and completes missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require the player to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of missions, the player can [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the game's [[open world]] and has the ability to complete optional side missions.&lt;ref name="AllGame Review"/&gt; Composed of two main islands and several smaller areas, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series.{{efn|Art director Aaron Garbut estimated that the area of Vice City is almost twice as large as ''Grand Theft Auto III''{{'}}s Liberty City, at over 4.25 million square meters.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Level Design"/&gt;}} The islands are unlocked for the player as the story progresses.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt;

[[File:Grand Theft Auto Vice City motorcycle gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|The player can drive motorcycles in ''Vice City'', unlike its predecessor.|alt=Gameplay screenshot of the player character driving a motorcycle through a busy city street.]]

The player may run, jump, or drive vehicles to navigate the game's world. The player uses [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the [[Colt Python]], an [[M60 machine gun]] and a [[Minigun]].&lt;ref name="IGN Guns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Inside 3"/&gt; The game's three-dimension environment allows a [[First-person (video games)|first-person view]] while aiming with the [[sniper rifle]] and [[rocket launcher]]. In addition, the game's combat allows the player to commit [[drive-by shooting]]s by facing sideways in a vehicle.&lt;ref name="GameRev Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; The game provides the player a wide variety of weapon options—they can be purchased from local [[firearms dealer]]s, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.{{sfn|Rockstar North|2002|p=14}}

In combat, [[auto-aim]] can be used as assistance against enemies.&lt;ref name="GameSpot PC Review"/&gt; Should the player take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups.{{sfn|Rockstar North|2002|p=9}} [[Body armour]] can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Walkthrough"/&gt; When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and the player [[Spawning (video game)|respawns]] at the nearest hospital while losing all weapons and armour and some of their money.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt; If the player commits crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a "[[Fugitive|wanted]]" meter in the [[HUD (video gaming)|head-up display]] (HUD), which increases as the player commits more crimes. On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level, and the higher the level, the greater the response for law enforcement&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt; (for example, at the maximum six-star level, police helicopters and military swarm to lethally dispatch players).&lt;ref name="GameRev Review"/&gt;

During the story, Tommy meets characters from various gangs. As the player completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend the player, while rival gang members will recognise the player and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, the player may engage in activities such as a [[vigilante]] minigame, a [[fire fighting]] activity, and a [[taxi cab]] service. Completion of these activities grants the player with context-specific rewards.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; As Tommy builds his criminal empire, the player may purchase a number of properties distributed across the city, some of which act as additional hideouts where weapons can be collected and vehicles can be stored.&lt;ref name="Edge Review"/&gt; There are also a variety of businesses which can be purchased, including a [[film studio]], a [[Taxicab|taxi]] company, and several entertainment clubs. Each commercial property has a number of missions attached to it, such as eliminating competition or stealing equipment; once all missions are complete, the property begins to generate an ongoing income available for the player.&lt;ref name="GameRev Review"/&gt;

== Plot ==
In 1986, [[Tommy Vercetti]] ([[Ray Liotta]]), a loyal former member of the Forelli Family, is released from prison after serving a fifteen-year sentence. His former boss, Sonny Forelli ([[Tom Sizemore]]), ostensibly promotes Tommy to a [[caporegime]] and sends him to Vice City to act as the Forelli's buyer in a [[cocaine]] deal and to also do other ground work for the Forellis. When Tommy and his bodyguards arrive in Vice City, crooked lawyer Ken Rosenberg ([[William Fichtner]]) takes them in his car to the docks, the site of the deal. They are ambushed by several masked men, who kill their bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, losing the Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. After Ken returns to his office, Tommy drives back to his hotel and informs Sonny, promising him under the threat of consequences to get back the drugs and money and kill whoever was responsible for the ambush.

Seeking information, Ken points Tommy towards Juan Garcia Cortez ([[Robert Davi]]), who helped set the exchange up. Expressing regret for the matter, Cortez promises to help Tommy find out who masterminded the ambush plot. In the process of finding leads, Tommy meets Kent Paul ([[Danny Dyer]]), who leads Tommy to one of the participants in the ambush. Tommy then works for Ricardo Diaz ([[Luis Guzmán]]), who hires him as protection. Cortez soon voices his suspicion that Diaz might have organised the ambush. With the help of Lance Vance ([[Philip Michael Thomas]]), whose [[Victor Vance|brother]] died in the ambush, Tommy kills Diaz; as a result, Tommy and Lance become Vice City's drug kingpins, allowing Tommy to create his own organisation and distance himself from the Forelli family. Tommy also works with the Cuban gang's leader Umberto Robina ([[Danny Trejo]]) in their fight against the Haitians. After destroying the Haitians' drug factory, Umberto becomes Tommy's partner in the drug trade. Tommy also earns the respect and friendship of Mitch Baker ([[Lee Majors]]), a leader of a biker gang, whose bikers work alongside the Cubans to become protectors of Vercetti family business. Tommy also expands his empire by purchasing assets in nearly bankrupt companies and turning them back into competitive businesses.

Eventually, Sonny discovers that Tommy has gained complete control over Vice City's drug trade without cutting the Forelli family in. Enraged that Tommy has become independent and is hustling him, Sonny sends high-ranking Forelli members to forcefully collect money from Tommy's assets. Tommy quickly disposes of them and decides to sever his ties with the Forelli family. Sonny arrives at his estate with a small army of [[mafiosi]] and demands his mob tribute under the threat of force. As Tommy attempts to give the tribute in counterfeit money, Sonny reveals that he set Tommy up fifteen years prior, resulting in his prison sentence. Lance also reveals his partnership with Sonny, admitting to having informed Sonny about Tommy's activities in Vice City. Angered at this betrayal, Tommy chases and ridicules Lance before killing him for his treachery. Heading through his estate, the gun battle eventually culminates in Tommy killing Sonny and his remaining army once and for all. When Ken arrives, he is shocked and worried by the events, but Tommy reassures him that everything is fine, having finally established himself as the undisputed crime kingpin of Vice City. In the post-credits gameplay, Tommy receives greeting phone calls from Paul and Cortez.

== Development ==
[[Rockstar North]] began to develop ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'' in late 2001, around the time of ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''{{'}}s release.&lt;ref name="Design Museum"/&gt; While initial development only involved creating [[3D model]]s, executive producer [[Sam Houser]] said "it really kicked off at the beginning of 2002" and lasted about nine months.&lt;ref name="Edge 2"/&gt; After the release of the Windows version of ''Grand Theft Auto III'', the development team discussed creating a mission pack for the game that would add new weapons, vehicles, and missions. Upon further discussion, the team decided to make this concept a stand-alone game, which became ''Vice City''.&lt;ref name="Digital Trends"/&gt; The game was announced on 22 May 2002, during the [[E3 2002|Electronic Entertainment Expo]].&lt;ref name="GameSpot Announcement"/&gt; It was Rockstar North's most expensive game at the time, with a budget of US$5 million.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=117}} On 5 September 2002, the company announced that the release date of 22 October had been postponed until 29 October to meet product demand.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Delay"/&gt; By 15 October 2002, development of ''Vice City'' stopped as the game was [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|submitted for manufacturing]].&lt;ref name="GameSpot Gold"/&gt;

=== Setting ===
The game is set in 1986 in fictional Vice City, which is based heavily on the city of [[Miami]].&lt;ref name="GameSpot Graphics"/&gt; Vice City previously appeared in the original ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997); the development team decided to reuse the location and incorporate ideas from within the studio and the fanbase.&lt;ref name="IGN Inside 2"/&gt; They wanted to satirise a location that was not contemporary, unlike ''Grand Theft Auto III''{{'}}s Liberty City.&lt;ref name="Design Museum"/&gt; The team wanted to choose a location that had various similarities and differences to [[New York City]]—the inspiration of Liberty City—eventually leading them to Miami, which producer [[Leslie Benzies]] describes as "a party town, all sun and sea and sex, but with that same dark edge underneath".&lt;ref name="Digital Trends"/&gt; Sam Houser called it "the grooviest era of crime because it didn't even feel like it was crime&amp;nbsp;... it was a totally topsy-turvy back-to-front period of time".&lt;ref name="Edge 1"/&gt; The team intended to make Vice City a "living, breathing city", for the player to feel like "life still goes on" while the character is inside a building.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Interaction"/&gt;

The game's look, particularly the clothing and vehicles, reflect its 1980s setting. Many themes are borrowed from the major films ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (1983) and ''[[Carlito's Way]]'' (1993),&lt;ref name="GameSpot Graphics"/&gt; the latter for its characterisation and portrayal of nuanced criminals. The television series ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1984–89) was also a major influence and was regularly watched by the team throughout development.&lt;ref name="Crave"/&gt; Art director Aaron Garbut used the series as a reference point in creating [[neon lighting]].&lt;ref name="Edge 1"/&gt; In recreating a 1980s setting, the team found it "relatively painless" due to the distinct culture of the time period and the team's familiarity of the era.&lt;ref name="Crave"/&gt; The art team was provided with large volumes of research, as well as reference photographs from other members of the development team. The team organised field research trips to Miami shortly after the development of ''Grand Theft Auto III'', splitting into small teams and observing the streets.&lt;ref name="Crave"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Unplugged"/&gt;

=== Story and characters {{anchor|Characters}}===
{{Main|List of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City characters}}
The team spent time "solving [the] riddle" of a speaking protagonist, a notable departure from ''Grand Theft Auto III''{{'}}s [[silent protagonist]] [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]].&lt;ref name="GameSpot III"/&gt; [[Ray Liotta]] portrayed protagonist Tommy Vercetti. Liotta described the role as challenging: "You're creating a character that's not there before&amp;nbsp;... It's so intensive". When recording the role, the team used [[Chroma key|blue screen]] in order to allow Liotta to visualise "how it's gonna move".&lt;ref name="IGN Voice"/&gt; The team ensured that the player felt "real affinity" for Tommy, making the narrative a key development interest.&lt;ref name="Design Museum"/&gt; Dan Houser described Tommy as "strong and dangerous and prepared to wait for the right opportunity to arrive".&lt;ref name="IGN Unplugged"/&gt; Director [[Navid Khonsari]] recalled Liotta frequently complaining on set and found him difficult to work with as a result.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=118}} "In some sessions he was ... into it, but then sometimes ... he was very dark and couldn't work", said Sam Houser.&lt;ref name="GamesRadar Sam"/&gt; Following the game's success, Liotta reportedly claimed that he was underpaid for the role.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=123}}

The majority of the game's animations were original, with very few borrowed from ''Grand Theft Auto III''. For the characters, the team used [[motion capture]] and [[stop motion]] animation techniques; cutscenes use the former, while gameplay movements use a combination of both techniques. The team encountered difficulty in animating motorcycle animations, due in part to the variety of models.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Animation"/&gt; Pedestrian character models use [[Skin (computing)|skins]] in ''Vice City'', allowing the artists to produce more realistic characters. There are 110 unique pedestrian models throughout the game world alongside roughly 50 story characters; each character is rendered using twice the amount of [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] and [[Texture mapping|textures]] found in ''Grand Theft Auto III''.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Graphics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Unplugged"/&gt; This also impacted the [[Game physics|character physics]], improving gameplay aspects such as weapon-hit accuracy.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Physics"/&gt; Some character models and scenarios were inspired by films such as ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), and the game's presentation was inspired by [[Action film|action]] television shows of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="IGN Inside 1"/&gt; The interplay between Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance was crafted to be similar to the relationship of ''Miami Vice''{{'}}s [[Sonny Crockett]] and [[Ricardo Tubbs]].&lt;ref name="Edge 4"/&gt;

=== Sound design and music production {{anchor|Soundtrack}}===
The game features 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue, four times the amount in ''Grand Theft Auto III''.&lt;ref name="IGN Unplugged"/&gt; It contains over 90 minutes of [[cutscene]]s and nine hours of music,&lt;ref name="IGN Unplugged"/&gt; with more than 113 songs and commercials.&lt;ref name="IGN Inside 4"/&gt; The team was interested in the challenge of creating the game's soundtrack, particularly in contrast to ''Grand Theft Auto III''{{'}}s music, which Sam Houser described as "clearly satirical and its own thing".&lt;ref name="Edge 2"/&gt; In developing the radio stations, the team wanted to reinforce the game's setting by collating a variety of songs from the 1980s and therefore performed extensive research.&lt;ref name="IBTimes Soundtrack"/&gt; The radio stations were published by [[Epic Records]] in seven albums—known collectively as ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Official Soundtrack Box Set''—alongside the game in October 2002.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Soundtrack 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot Soundtrack 2"/&gt; ''Vice City'' contains about "three times as much" [[talk radio]] as ''Grand Theft Auto III''. Producer and talk show host [[Lazlow Jones]] stated that the small percentage of station listeners that actually [[Phone-in|call in]] are "insane"; in ''Vice City'', the team "bumped it up a notch", emphasising the extremity. Dan Houser felt that the talk stations give depth to the game world.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Radio"/&gt;

Reviewers generally considered the missions an improvement over ''Grand Theft Auto III'', although some noted occasional awkwardness and frustration.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpy Review"/&gt; IGN's Perry wrote that the game's missions give the player "a stronger feeling of being inside a story within a world that truly exists".&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Matt Helgeson found the missions to be more complex,&lt;ref name="GameInformer Review"/&gt; and [[AllGame]]'s Scott Alan Marriott felt that the storyline was improved as a result.

[[Image:Grand Theft Auto Vice City open world.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Vice City, the city featured in the game's open world. Reviewers praised its design and detail, noting that it felt more alive than ''Grand Theft Auto III''{{'}}s Liberty City.|alt=An urban city centre, surrounded by trees with a blimp in the sky, at sunset.]]

The game's open world design was praised by reviewers, many of whom felt that it contained more detail and felt more alive than its predecessors.&lt;ref name="AllGame Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt; GameSpy's Padilla made favourable comparisons between Vice City and ''Grand Theft Auto III''{{'}}s Liberty City, noting the former's level of detail.&lt;ref name="GameSpy Review"/&gt; [[Game Revolution]]'s Ben Silverman wrote that the game's depth is "unparalleled", praising the world's realism and detail,&lt;ref name="GameRev Review"/&gt; while AllGame's Marriott commended the "ambitious scope in design".&lt;ref name="AllGame Review"/&gt;

Marriott of AllGame named ''Vice City'' an "unforgettable listening experience",&lt;ref name="AllGame Review"/&gt; and Perry of IGN declared the music as "the most impressive list of songs in a game".&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Many reviewers commended the game's radio stations and talk radio,&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; and many felt that the game's collection of licensed 1980s music fit the tone and time period of the world.&lt;ref name="GameRev Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpy Review"/&gt; The voice acting also received praise;&lt;ref name="GameInformer Review"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s [[Jeff Gerstmann]] named the cast of characters "colorful and memorable",&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; and IGN's Perry found the voice acting "among one of the best of its kind".&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Game Revolution's Silverman felt that the acting "gives the story credence".&lt;ref name="GameRev Review"/&gt;

Many reviewers found that the game offers a better variety of vehicles than ''Grand Theft Auto III'',&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameInformer Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpy Review"/&gt; and found them easier to control;&lt;ref name="GameRev Review"/&gt; GameSpot's Gerstmann named the driving "more exciting and dangerous",&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; and IGN's Perry found the motorcycle's controls pleasing.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; In addition to the vehicle handling, reviewers noted improvements in the targeting and shooting mechanics, although still recognised issues.&lt;ref name="AllGame Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameRev Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Helgeson of ''Game Informer'' wrote that "targeting is improved to the point where combat can actually be fun".&lt;ref name="GameInformer Review"/&gt;

When ''Vice City'' was released to Microsoft Windows in May 2003, it received similar critical acclaim. Metacritic calculated an average score of 94 out of 100, indicating "universal acclaim", based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref name="MC PC"/&gt; It was the highest-rated Windows game on Metacritic in 2003.&lt;ref name="MC Top PC"/&gt; Reviewers liked the visual enhancements,&lt;ref name="GameSpot PC Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpy PC Review"/&gt; and were generally positive towards the control improvements.&lt;ref name="AllGame PC Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer PC Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN PC Review"/&gt;

The port's visuals received a positive response from reviewers.

The control changes of the port were generally well received.

When ''Vice City'' was released on mobile devices in December 2012,&lt;ref name="Mobile Announce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mobile Release"/&gt; it received "generally favorable" reviews.

The port's visuals were well received.

Most reviewers criticised the port's touchscreen controls. [[Pocket Gamer]]'s Mark Brown found them "not ideal", but noted that this was also the case in the original game,&lt;ref name="Pocket Gamer Review"/&gt; while [[Digital Spy]]'s Scott Nichols felt that the game "only complicated [the controls] further".&lt;ref name="Digital Spy Review"/&gt; IGN's Davis was thankful for the addition of customisable controls, and wrote that they "make the experience much more controllable",&lt;ref name="IGN Mobile Review"/&gt; and Touch Arcade's Ford greatly appreciated the developer's efforts to "make the situation bearable".&lt;ref name="Touch Arcade Review"/&gt; Destructoid's Carter spoke favourably of the controls, despite noting awkward character movement,&lt;ref name="Destructoid Mobile Review"/&gt; while ''The Telegraph''{{'}}s Hoggins found the controls "far more accomplished" than ''Grand Theft Auto III''{{'}}s mobile port.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Mobile Review"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
Similar to its predecessors, ''Vice City'' generated several controversies. It has been labelled as [[violent]] and [[Sexually explicit|explicit]] and is considered highly controversial by many [[Advocacy groups|special interest groups]].&lt;ref name="Chicago Theory"/&gt;{{sfn|Chess|2006|pp=80–90}}&lt;ref name="NYTimes Amendment"/&gt;{{sfn|Egenfeldt-Nielsen|Smith|Tosca|2016|p=166}} Peter Hartlaub of ''[[SFGate]]'' noted the game's "mindless violence", but simply attributed it to the developers' attempt to achieve accuracy.&lt;ref name="SFGate"/&gt; Jeremy Pope, who worked on various Rockstar games including ''Vice City'', vowed never to work on violent games again due to their portrayal in mainstream media.&lt;ref name="Gamesindustry Pope"/&gt; In Australia, the game was pre-edited to receive an MA15+ classification;&lt;ref name="Australia 2002"/&gt; an uncensored version was released in the region in 2010, retaining its classification.&lt;ref name="Australia 2010"/&gt;

[[File:GTAVC PC Gang Attack.jpg|thumb|The game allows the player to fight immigrant gangs made up of [[Haitians]] (pictured) and [[Cubans]], and missions involve fighting both gangs. Civil rights organisations accused the game of inviting ethnic violence, and of featuring discriminatory phrases.]]

In November 2003, the Haitian Centers Council and [[Haitian Americans]] for Human Rights staged a protest in New York publicly criticising the game, contending that it invited the player to harm Haitian immigrants and claiming that it depicted Haitians as "thugs, thieves and drug dealers".&lt;ref name="GameSpot Haitian1"/&gt; In response, Rockstar issued a press release apologising and acknowledging the concern, but insisted that the violence should be taken within the context of the game, which also contains violence towards other [[race and video games|ethnic groups]].&lt;ref name="IGN Haitian"/&gt; When New York mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] threatened distributor [[Take-Two Interactive]] with legal action, the company apologised and removed offensive statements from future copies of the game.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Haitian2"/&gt; In January 2004, [[North Miami, Florida|North Miami]]'s majority Haitian-American council filed an ordinance to ban the selling or renting of violent games to anyone under 18 without parental permission. The proposal, apparently sparked by ''Vice City'', was supported by North Miami mayor [[Josaphat Celestin]], who stated "We don't believe the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was written to protect those who want to incite violence".&lt;ref name="GameSpot Haitian3"/&gt; The case was later downgraded from [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court]] to [[State court (United States)|state court]].&lt;ref name="GameSpot Haitian4"/&gt;

On 7 June 2003, 18-year-old [[Devin Moore]] shot and killed two [[Alabama|Alabamian]] police officers and a dispatcher before fleeing in a patrol car; he was later apprehended. In statements to police, Moore reportedly said "Life is like a video game. Everybody's got to die sometime".&lt;ref name="CBS Moore"/&gt; A $600 million [[lawsuit]] was filed against Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], [[GameStop]], and [[Wal-Mart]], claiming that Moore frequently played ''Vice City'' and that his experience with the game led him to commit the crimes. The plaintiffs' attorney, [[Jack Thompson (attorney)|Jack Thompson]], claimed the graphic nature of the game caused Moore to commit the murders.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Moore1"/&gt; Thompson removed himself from the case ''[[Strickland v. Sony]]'' in November 2005&lt;ref name="GameSpot Moore2"/&gt; after being scrutinised by the judge for unprofessional conduct.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Moore3"/&gt; In March 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rejected an appeal by the defendants to dismiss the case.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Moore4"/&gt;

In September 2006, Thompson brought another $600 million lawsuit against Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony Computer Entertainment.&lt;ref name="Engadget Posey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune Posey"/&gt; The lawsuit claimed that 14-year-old Posey played the game obsessively before murdering his father, stepmother, and stepsister on a ranch in [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Hondo, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="GameSpot Posey"/&gt; Posey's defence team argued that he was abused by his father&lt;ref name="GamePolitics Posey"/&gt; and was taking [[Sertraline|Zoloft]] at the time of the killings.&lt;ref name="CourtTV Posey"/&gt; The suit alleged that the murders would not have taken place if Posey had not obsessively played ''Vice City''.&lt;ref name="ABQJournal Posey"/&gt; The case was dismissed in December 2007, as New Mexico held no jurisdiction over Sony or Take-Two.&lt;ref name="GamePolitics Posey2"/&gt;

On 27 July 2017, the Psychic Friends Network sued Rockstar over the character named Auntie Poulet who shares similarities to the late psychic Miss Cleo who was actually voiced by Miss Cleo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-02-rockstar-sued-over-auntie-poulet-from-15-year-old-grand-theft-auto-vice-city|title=Rockstar sued over Auntie Poulet from 15-year-old Grand Theft Auto: Vice City|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|date=2 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Mike Snider of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote that ''Vice City'' "raised the bar for video games", citing its interactivity, violence, and soundtrack.&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt; ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Luke Plunkett and ''[[PC Magazine]]''{{'}}s Jeffrey L. Wilson both named ''Vice City'' the best game in the series, with the former naming it the "perfect ''Grand Theft Auto'' experience".&lt;ref name="Kotaku Best"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCMag Best"/&gt; The readers of ''[[Official UK PlayStation Magazine]]'' named ''Vice City'' the fourth-greatest PlayStation title ever released.&lt;ref name="OPM Best"/&gt; ''Vice City'' also appeared on Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]''{{'}}s readers' list of top 100 games in 2006; it was one of the only [[Western world|Western]] titles on the list.&lt;ref name="Famitsu 100"/&gt; Art director Aaron Garbut felt that, alongside its predecessor ''Grand Theft Auto III'' and successor ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas|San Andreas]]'', ''Vice City'' led the trend of open world games.&lt;ref name="Crave"/&gt;

=== Ports and remakes ===
''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 12 May 2003, supporting higher screen resolutions and draw distance, and featuring more detailed textures.&lt;ref name="PC"/&gt; A [[GameCube]] release was planned, but later cancelled.&lt;ref name="GameCube"/&gt; For its release on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in December 2003, ''Vice City'' was bundled with ''Grand Theft Auto III'' in a compilation titled ''Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack''. The Xbox port features custom soundtrack support as well as improved audio, [[Model (computer games)|polygon models]], and reflections over the previous ports.&lt;ref name="Xbox"/&gt; ''Double Pack'' was later bundled with ''San Andreas'' in a compilation titled ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy]]'', released in October 2005.&lt;ref name="Trilogy"/&gt; ''The Trilogy'' was also released for [[OS X]] on 12 November 2010.&lt;ref name="Mac"/&gt; For the game's tenth anniversary in December 2012, War Drum Studios ported ''Vice City'' to several [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.&lt;ref name="Mobile Release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Android Release"/&gt; The port is almost identical to the Windows version of the game, but with enhanced visuals and a customisable layout.&lt;ref name="Mobile Announce"/&gt; A [[PlayStation 3]] version of ''Vice City'' was released on 30 January 2013 via the [[PlayStation Network]].&lt;ref name="PS3"/&gt; The original PlayStation 2 version of the game was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on 5 December 2015.&lt;ref name="PS4"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4053">The '''ground-bow''' or a '''earth-bow''' is a single-string bow-shaped folk musical instrument, classified as a [[chordophone]]. It is known in cultures of equatorial &lt;ref name=ebgb&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/art/ground-bow "Ground Bow"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and south&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YfCzP-SB8d4C&amp;pg=PA168]&lt;/ref&gt; Africa, and in other cultures with African roots. It consists of a flexible stick planted into the ground (possibly a stripped sapling or a branch&lt;ref name=kru89/&gt;), with a string from its free end to a resonator of some kind based on a pit in the ground.&lt;ref name=adt&gt;[http://www.aatespanol.cl/taa/tesauro/default.asp?a=338&amp;Element_ID=12274 "Arco de tierra"], referring to [[François-René Tranchefort]], ''Los instrumentos musicales en el mundo'', {{ISBN|8420685208}}, 1985, and later editions&lt;/ref&gt; It looks like a game trap or a child toy, therefore its distribution over Africa used to be overlooked. [[Hornbostel (musicologist)|Hornbostel]] (1933) classified is in the category of [[harp]]s, although it has combined characteristics of a harp and a [[musical bow]].&lt;ref name=kru89&gt;Jaco Kruger, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/851766 "Rediscovering the Venda Ground-Bow"], ''Ethnomusicology'',
Vol. 33, No. 3 (Autumn, 1989), pp. 391-404&lt;/ref&gt;

The resonator may be a pit covered by a board, with string attached to it.&lt;ref name=adt/&gt; Kruges describes several other constructions by Venda, e.g., the other end of a string is tied to a stone dropped into the pit, with string passing through the board covering the pit, etc.&lt;ref name=kru89/&gt;

Other names include "ground harp" (Sachs, 1940, ''History of Musical Instruments'') and ground-bass. It is called ''kalinga'' or ''galinga'' by [[Venda people]]. In their language "galinga" means simply a hole in the ground, while the origins of "kalinga" are uncertain.&lt;ref name=kru89/&gt; It is known as ''gayumba'' in [[Haiti]],&lt;ref name=mlac/&gt;  [[Dominican Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;Fradique Lizardo, ''Instrumentos musicales indígenas dominicanos'', 1975,[https://books.google.com/books?id=IPvZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=gayumba&amp;dq=gayumba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rj-KVbSTBMWpogST34CwCw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgK Section "Gayumba", p.64]
&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tumbandera'' in Haitian traditions of [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=mlac&gt;''Music in Latin America and the Caribbean: An Encyclopedic History'' , vol.2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uspTNzJ_NoYC&amp;pg=PA210 p.210]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montunocubano.com/Tumbao/instruments/tumbandera.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka people]] call it ''angbindi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baka.co.uk/baka/instr.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known in Cuba under the [[onomatopoeic]]  name ''tingo-talango'' (''tingotalango'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecubanhistory.com/2015/05/cubanism-what-is-the-tingo-talango-cubanismos-que-es-el-tingo-talango/ "CUBANISM: WHAT IS The “Tíngo Talángo” ?"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritmacuba.com/tingo-talango.html "TINGO TALANGO, son, Auteur : Julio CUEVA]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julio Cueva]]'s  song ''Tingo Talango'' dedicated to this musical instrument describes its construction thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;
: Si quieren que les describa
: cómo es el tingo talango
: tráiganme un gajo de güira
: o si no uno de mango.

: Se abre un hueco en el suelo,
: encima una hoja de lata,
: en el centro un agujero
: donde un alambre se ata.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Tingo Talango'' is also the song by [[Ñico Lora]].

The instrument is reportedly nearly-extinct in the native cultures.&lt;ref name=kru89/&gt;&lt;ref name=mlac/&gt;

==Playing techniques==
''Kalinga'' may be struck by a stick or plucked in various ways. The bow stick may be bent to change the tension of the string, and hence the tone. It can be played in a [[glissando]] manner: the stick is bent, struck, and released, producing a peculiar sound. The produced pitches are not always stable.&lt;ref name=kru89/&gt;

Kalinga is usually is played as a to provide repetitive accompaniment to the choral song.&lt;ref name=kru89/&gt;

"'''Had I but known'''" is a form of prolepsis or [[foreshadowing]] that hints at some looming disaster in which the [[first-person narrator]] laments his or her course of action which precipitates some or other unfortunate series of actions. Classically, the narrator never makes explicit the nature of the mistake until both the narrator and the reader have realized the consequence of the error. If done well, this [[literary device]] can add suspense or [[dramatic irony]]; if overdone, it invites comparison of the story to [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] [[melodrama]] and sub-standard [[popular fiction]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The foreshadowing may be distinguished between, "advance notice":&lt;ref name="Genette"&gt;[[Gérard Genette|Genette, Gérard]] (1980). ''Narrative Discourse'', p.77 and 75. cited in Rzepka (2005), p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, "'Had I but known then what I know now, I would never have set foot on Baron von Rotschnitzel's private yacht.'" or the more subtle, "advance mention":&lt;ref name="Genette"/&gt; "a 'simple marker without anticipation' intended to acquire significance later in the narrative, through [[analepsis|analeptic]] recovery (75).' [in other words:]...clues"&lt;ref name="Rzepka"/&gt;

The phrase is used to refer to a group of Golden Age [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] writers, mostly female, who wrote novels characterized by the use of the "had I but known" plot in which the narrator keeps key pieces of evidence from the police, apparently for the sole purpose of prolonging their work. 

The HIBK school is associated with the works of [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]],&lt;ref name="Rzepka"&gt;Rzepka, Charles J. (2005). ''Detective fiction'', p.20. {{ISBN|0-7456-2942-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically ''[[The Circular Staircase]]'' (1908), in which "a middle-aged spinster is persuaded by her niece and nephew to rent a country house for the summer. The house they choose belonged to a bank defaulter who had hidden stolen securities in the walls. The gentle, peace-loving trio is plunged into a series of crimes solved with the help of the aunt. This novel is credited with being the first in the "Had-I-But-Known" school."&lt;ref name="DET"&gt;Roseman, Mill ''et al.''  ''Detectionary''.

Other members of the HIBK school include [[Ethel Lina White]] and [[Lenore Glen Offord]].

The HIBK school was parodied by [[Ogden Nash]] in his poem "Don't Guess, Let Me Tell You":
{{quote|
Had-I-But-Known narrators are the ones who hear a stealthy creak at midnight in the tower where the body lies, and, instead of locking their door or arousing the drowsy policeman posted outside their room, sneak off by themselves to the tower and suddenly they hear a breath exhaled behind them,

And they have no time to scream, they know nothing else till the men from the D.A.'s office come in next morning and find them.

...

And when the killer is finally trapped into a confession by some elaborate device of the Had I But Known-er some hundred pages later than if they hadn’t held their knowledge aloof,

Why, they say, why Inspector I knew all along it was he but I couldn’t tell you, you would have laughed at me unless I had absolute proof.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;Ogden Nash, Poetry, “Don't guess, let me tell you,” The New Yorker, April 20, 1940, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

"The game features tons of different levels and categories, and online leaderboards to compare your skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/06/iphone-ipad-apps-free-iassociate-2-iced-1000-ultimate-experiences|title=iPhone And iPad Apps Gone Free: iAssociate 2, Iced In, 1000 Ultimate Experiences, And More|author=Tyler Tschida|work=AppAdvice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

===''iAssociate''===
AppSafari gave it 4/5 stars, writing "That said, this is still a really solid [[puzzle]] game, one that can easily occupy hours and hours of your time. A little on the stark side, it’s both fun and easy to play. If you like word puzzles, ''iAssociate'' is an absolute must try."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appsafari.com/games/11066/iassociate/|title=iAssociate iPhone game app review - AppSafari|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TUAW]] said "Developed by Fredrik Wahrman, ''iAssociate'' brings Funny Farm-style interaction to the [[iPhone]]. It's a really fun (and quite challenging) implementation with over a half dozen separate puzzles to work on, promising hours and hours of game play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2009/11/18/iassociate-mind-mapping-fun/|title=iAssociate: Mind mapping fun|work=TUAW: Apple news, reviews and how-tos since 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; TechnologyTell said "All in all, this was a pleasantly entertaining game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologytell.com/apple/48803/iphone-word-game-apps-round-up/|title=iPhone word game round up|work=TechnologyTell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''iAssociate 2''===
SlideToPlay rated the game 4 out of 4, writing, " If you like your word games simple yet brain-tickling, ''iAssociate 2'' is perfect. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slidetoplay.com/review/iassociate-2-review/|title=iAssociate 2 Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AndroidGamesReviews gave it 4 out of 5 stars, commenting, "''iAssociate 2'': Test your knowledge and vocabulary in this fantastic word association game. Rating: 4/5 A fantastic game which is fun to enjoy in a group, in couples, or by yourself. It’s unique, interesting and educational all at once... it could even help someone with out-of-the-box thinking and improve creativity! There's no reason why you shouldn't download this free title and give it a whirl. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidgamesreview.com/2012/04/iassociate-2-ticbits-android-games/|title=iAssociate 2|author=Android Games Review Team|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AppSafari gave it 4/5 stars and said, "It’s clear a lot of love went into smoothing out the humps and bumps from the first version, and the effort has paid off in a big way. Still, aside from the gorgeous new interface and a few additional features, there isn’t a lot about ''iAssociate 2'' to differentiate itself from the original, but it’s definitely a game well-worth trying if you’re a fan of words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appsafari.com/games/12024/iassociate-2/|title=iAssociate 2 iPhone game app review - AppSafari|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TheAppEra said, "The game needs a name change, i-Something isn’t made for everything. Now that’s out of the way, this is a VERY addictive guessing game. There’s a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] version of this game somewhere but this is far better!"&lt;ref&gt;http://theappera.com/2010/06/01/crazy-basketball-doodle-cross-iassociate-2-free-iphone-games-today/&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Parish, senior editor of [[Eurogamer#Subsidiaries|USgamer]] described the game as "Another from the 'wife wanted me to play this one with her' files".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/what-are-the-best-ios-games|title=50 iPhone and iPad Games We Just Can't Delete|work=USgamer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''iAssociate 3''===
''iAssociate 3'' is, unsurprisingly, the sequel to ''iAssociate 2'', which was named favourite new game by Ricki Lake of ABC’s Good Morning America and was downloaded over a million times. iAssociate 3 includes a new and improved input method for entering answers, a new daily challenge, and many more game levels than its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/330439/Preordernbsp_iAssociate_3_nbspand_receive_US10_worth_of_ingame_goods.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latke–Hamantash Debate''' is a deliberately humorous academic [[debate]] about the relative merits and meanings of these two items of [[Jewish cuisine]]. The debate originated at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1946&lt;ref name=UCM&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shticking to Their Puns|journal=University of Chicago Magazine|date=December 2005|volume=98|issue=2|url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0512/features/puns.shtml|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been held annually. Subsequent debates have taken place at several other universities. Participants in the debate, held within the format of a [[symposium]], have included past University of Chicago president [[Hanna Holborn Gray]], [[philosopher]] [[Martha Nussbaum]], former [[Council of Economic Advisers]] Chairman [[Austan Goolsbee]], [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]],  [[Leon M. Lederman]], and [[essayist]] [[Allan Bloom]]. A compendium of the debate, which has never been won, was published in 2005.

==Background and history==

A [[latke]] is a kind of [[potato]] pancake traditionally eaten during the Jewish holiday of [[Hanukkah]]. Fried in oil, latkes commemorate the holiday miracle in which one day’s worth of oil illuminated the temple for eight days. [[Hamantash]]en are triangular baked wheat-flour pastries with a sweet filling which are traditionally eaten on the holiday of [[Purim]]. They represent the ears or the 3-cornered hat of Haman, the villain of the Purim story in the Biblical [[book of Esther]].

A debate on their relative merits was first held in the winter of 1946 at the University of Chicago chapter house of the [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel Foundation]], sponsored by [[Rabbi]] Maurice Pekarsky.&lt;ref name=LHD&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cernea|editor1-first=Ruth Fredman|title=The Great Latke-Hamantash Debate|date=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226100235|page=xix-xi|ref={{sfnRef|Cernea}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants in the debates have included [[Nobel Prize]] winners and [[MacArthur Genius Grant|MacArthur Grant Fellows]].&lt;ref name=Okrent /&gt;  After the debate, both foodstuffs are usually served at a reception afterwards, offering debaters and listeners an opportunity to evaluate [[primary source]]s.&lt;ref name=uc1/&gt;

The debate had been moderated by University of Chicago philosophy professor Ted Cohen for over 25 years until his death in March 2014.&lt;ref name=Cholke&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cholke|first1=Sam|title=Latke or Hamantash?

==Commentary==
The events have attracted commentary from a number of individuals.  [[Aaron David Miller]], who served as a peace negotiator between Israeli and Palestinian authorities, noted that the critical feature of the debate is that it is intractable, but that the event is "simply too important to abandon."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Yair|title=Judaism’s Epic Food Fight|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/124811/judaisms-epic-food-fight|website=Tablet Magazine|accessdate=27 November 2014|date=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the event's original purpose at the University of Chicago, Ruth Fredman Cernea observed that scholarly life discouraged exploration of Jewish traditions and did not facilitate ethnic relationships between students and faculty: "the event provided a rare opportunity for faculty to reveal their hidden Jewish souls and poke fun at the high seriousness of everyday academic life."&lt;ref name=uc1&gt;{{cite web|title=Shticking to Their Puns|url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0512/features/puns.shtml|publisher=[[University of Chicago]] Magazine|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gluck&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gluck|first1=Robert|title=Latke or Hamantash?

==Notable debates and arguments==
The debaters represent a range of academic disciplines. Some of the entries are described below:
*Ted Cohen concluded an analysis of how correct philosophical reasoning would lead one to the latke by explaining, "A world without hamantashen would be a wretched world. A world without hamantashen might be unbearable. But a world without latkes is unthinkable."&lt;ref name=UCP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Ted|title=Excerpts from The Great Latke-Hamantash Debate|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/100235.html|website=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Hanna Gray]] discussed the silence of [[Machiavelli]] on the subject; noting that "The silence of a wise man is always meaningful",&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, Thoughts on Machiavelli (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; she comes to the conclusion that Machiavelli was Jewish, and like all wise people, for the latke.&lt;ref name=UCM /&gt;
*[[Isaac Abella]], professor of physics, asserts that "Which is Better: the Latke or the Hamantash?" is an invalid question, since it does not exhibit the necessary property of universality, is culturally biased, implies gender specificity, exhibits geographical [[chauvinism]], and appeals to special interests.&lt;ref name=UCM /&gt;
*[[Michael Silverstein]], professor in anthropology, linguistics, and psychology, argued that it is not mere coincidence that the English translation of the letters on the [[dreidl]] spells out [[Tums|T-U-M-S]]. He cites this as evidence that "God may play dice with the universe, but not with Mrs. Schmalowitz’s [[Kugel|lukshen kugl]], nor especially with her latkes and homntashen".&lt;ref name=UCM /&gt;
*Professor [[Wendy Doniger]] of the divinity school, in a carefully footnoted paper entitled "The Archetypal Hamentasch: A Feminist Mythology", asserts that hamentaschen are a womb equivalent, and were worshiped in early [[matriarchal]] societies.{{sfn|Cernea|p=189}}
*In the debate at [[MIT]], Robert J. Silbey, dean of its School of Science, cited Google, which returned 380,000 hits on a search for "latke" and only 62,000 for "hamantaschen". Silbey also claimed that latkes, not hamentashen, are the [[dark matter]] thought to make up over 21 percent of the mass of the universe.
*[[Allan Bloom]] noted a possible conspiracy involving the [[Manischewitz]] company and the [[University of Chicago Business School]].&lt;ref name=Okrent&gt;{{cite news|last1=Okrent|first1=Arika|title=8 Great Arguments from the Latke-Hamentash Debate|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31833/8-great-arguments-latke-hamentash-debate|accessdate=26 November 2014|work=[[Mental Floss]]|date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An entry by economist [[Milton Friedman]] discussed "The Latke and the Hamantash at the Fifty-Yard Line".{{sfn|Cernea|p=71}}

MFC is known to be the biggest MMA promotion in Canada and one of the top MMA shows in the World. MFC has notable Canadian fighters, such as [[Ryan Jimmo]], Graham Spencer, [[Tom Watson (fighter)|Tom Watson]] and [[Douglas Lima]], plus MMA veterans, such as [[Jason MacDonald]], [[Thales Leites]], [[Jay Silva]], [[Trevor Prangley]], and [[Paul Daley]].&lt;ref name="mfc_org"&gt;http://www.maximumfighting.com/mfcorg.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Maximum Fighting Championship was founded on March 3, 2001, by Pavelich Sports Inc. Mark Pavelich is the CEO of MFC and runs the business day to day. Dave Pavelich is Vice President and Manon Pavelich is the booker.

MFC currently airs on [[AXS TV Fights]] in the U.S. and [[The Fight Network]] in Canada. MFC’s former home was the ''River Cree Resort and Casino'' in Enoch, Alberta, Canada located just outside Edmonton, Alberta. Their new home is the ''Mayfield Inn Trade and Conference Centre'' Edmonton, Alberta. In July 2011, MFC signed a five-year live TV deal with [[HDnet]] (now [[AXS TV]]) and in October 2011, MFC signed with [[TSN2]].

MFC hosts heavyweight fights but doesn't have a heavyweight championship due to the lack of heavyweights outside of the top promotions.

MFC employs the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. All MFC bouts take place in a [[Boxing ring|ring]], with the exception of MFC 29 which, in accordance with the regulations utilized in Ontario which requires all mixed martial arts fights to be held in a cage structure, took place in a circular cage named "''The Ring''" by the winner of a "''Name the Cage''" fan contest.&lt;ref name="The Ring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumfighting.com/news/mfc-stays-in-the-ring/|title=MFC stays in THE RING|publisher=maximumfighting.com|date=2011-04-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225100900/http://www.maximumfighting.com/news/mfc-stays-in-the-ring/|archivedate=2013-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, MFC announced the re-launched its heavyweight division and the upcoming debut of a featherweight division. In 2013, the Maximum Fighting Championship also announced that the organization would add a bantamweight with the debut bout taking place on May 19, 2013 at MFC 37: True Grit.

MFC has not held an event since MFC 41 'All In" on October 3, 2014.

Mark Pavelich announced that Maximum Fighting Championship was up for sale on February 18, 2016. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/maximum-fighting-championship-is-for-sale|title=Maximum Fighting Championship is For Sale - MMAWeekly.com|author=|date=|website=www.mmaweekly.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
MFC employs the [[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]].

===Rounds===

===Attire===
All competitors must fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Shirts, [[Keikogi|gis]] or long pants (including gi pants) are not allowed. Fighters must use approved light-weight open-fingered gloves, that include at least 1" of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170 g / 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;ounces) that allow fingers to grab. These gloves enable fighters to punch with less risk of an injured or broken hand, while retaining the ability to grab and grapple.

===Match outcome===
Matches usually end via:
*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps on the mat or his opponent or verbally submits.
*'''Technical Submission''': A technical submission is achieved when the referee stops a fight due to an injury resulting from a submission hold or due to a fighter going unconscious from a choke.
*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter falls from a legal blow and is either unconscious or unable to immediately continue.
*'''Technical Knockout''' (TKO): If a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ended as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:
**referee stoppage: (the referee determines a fighter cannot "intelligently defend" himself; if warnings to the fighter to improve his position or defense go unanswered—generally, two warnings are given, about 5 seconds apart)
**doctor stoppage (a ringside doctor due to injury or impending injury, as when blood flows into the eyes and blinds a fighter)
**corner stoppage (a fighter's own corner-man signals defeat for their own fighter)
*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:
**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)
**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)
**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)
**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)
**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)
**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)&lt;ref name="mfc_rules"/&gt;

Note: In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal. However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively).

A fight can also end in a '''technical decision''', '''disqualification''', '''forfeit''', '''technical draw''', or '''no contest'''. The latter two outcomes have no winners.

===Judging criteria===
The [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points, the loser nine points or fewer. If the round is even, both fighters receive ten points.

===Fouls===
The Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:&lt;ref name="mfc_rules"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 - Unarmed Combat]. Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.

===Match conduct===
* After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one).
* If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.
* Grabbing the ring ropes brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the ropes, the referee may charge a foul.

===Title fights===
On September 18, 2012 MFC instituted new regulations regarding title fights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmamania.com/2012/9/18/3354394/maximum-fighting-championship-mfc-weigh-in-drug-testing|title=Maximum Fighting Championship (MFC) institutes new regulations for title fights, weigh-ins and drug testing|publisher=MMAmania.com|date=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Title Fight with a reigning/defending champion'''
*If the champion fails to make weight:
**SCENARIO 1 - The champion vacates the title immediately. The fight remains a five-round contest. If the vacated champion wins the fight, the Maximum Fighting Championship holds the option to automatically consider him the No. 1 contender for the next title fight in that weight class. The Maximum Fighting Championship also holds an option to make an immediate rematch.
**SCENARIO 2 - The champion vacates the title immediately. The fight remains a five-round contest. If the challenger wins the fight, the challenger becomes the MFC champion. The Maximum Fighting Championship holds an option to make an immediate rematch.
*If the challenger fails to make weight:
**The champion automatically retains the belt. A non-title fight takes place and the Maximum Fighting Championship solely determines if the bout is a three- or five-round fight. If the challenger wins the bout, the Maximum Fighting Championship holds an option to make a future rematch.
*If both fighters fail to make weight:
**The champion vacates the title immediately. A non-title fight takes place and the Maximum Fighting Championship solely determines if the bout is a three- or five-round fight. The Maximum Fighting Championship holds the option to consider the winner of the bout as the No. 1 contender for the next title fight in that weight class. The Maximum Fighting Championship also holds an option to make future rematch.
'''Title Fight with a vacant championship'''
*If one fighter fails to make weight:
**The fight remains a five-round contest. If the fighter who made weight wins the bout, he becomes the MFC champion of that weight class. If the fighter who failed to make weight wins the bout, that fighter does not claim the title, and the Maximum Fighting Championship holds the option to make him the No. 1 contender and/or to make an immediate rematch.
*If both fighters fail to make weight:
**A non-title bout takes place and the Maximum Fighting Championship solely determines if the bout is a three- or five-round fight. The Maximum Fighting Championship holds the option to make a future rematch.

The '''Miss Exotic World Pageant''' (officially, the Miss Exotic World Pageant and Striptease Reunion) is an annual [[neo-burlesque]] pageant and convention, and is the annual showcase event (and fundraiser for) the [[Burlesque Hall of Fame]] (formerly the Exotic World burlesque museum).  The pageant, sometimes referred to as the "Miss America of Burlesque",  attracts former [[American burlesque|burlesque]] queens from past decades, as well as current participants of the neo-burlesque scene. The pageant consists of burlesque performances spanning a weekend, culminating with the competition to crown a single performer as Miss Exotic World. Because of the significance of the Exotic World Burlesque Museum to the burlesque community, winning the pageant is considered a top honor for a burlesque performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/miss-exotic-world-dixies-chicks-2136597|title=Miss Exotic World: Dixie's Chicks

== History ==
=== 1990 to 2004 ===
The pageant grew out an annual event held by [[Jennie Lee (dancer)]] and the Exotic Dancers' League (EDL), first held in 1958 and then annually through 1989. Awards were given out starting in 1962 to performers and promoters who furthered burlesque and showed it in a positive light. After Lee's death in 1990, the pageant was created and took place at the Exotic World Museum's grounds in [[Helendale, California]] from 1991 through 2005 before relocating to [[Las Vegas]].
Exotic World Museum curator [[Dixie Evans]] initiated the Miss Exotic World pageant in 1990 as a way to draw people to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/dixie-evans-late-burlesque-pioneer-celebrated-community-helped-shape-article-1.1443566|title=Dixie Evans, late burlesque pioneer, celebrated at Vegas striptease show: ‘She was so fun, heartwarming, inspiring’

While technically true, none of those invitees attended that year. However, the release garnered press attention for the pageant, which was successful enough to become an annual event, held on the first Saturday in June each year, close to the traditional time of year of the EDL's previous annual events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://21stcenturyburlesque.com/history-miss-exotic-world-pageant-jo-weldon-burlesque-hall-of-fame-judging-dixie-evans-jennie-lee/|title=A Brief History of the Miss Exotic World Pageant|first=Jo|last=Weldon|date=8 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018|via=21stcenturyburlesque.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burlesquehall.com/tag/miss-exotic-world/|title=Miss Exotic World tagged posts|accessdate=22 April 2018|via=burlesquehall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2013/10/25/stephanie_diani_dames_the_legends_of_burlesque_focuses_on_the_legendary.html|title=Glamorous Burlesque Dancers of a Certain Age|accessdate=25 Oct 2013|via=slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005 ===
In 2005, the pageant significantly expanded to mark its 15th year, as well as to accelerate [[Exotic World Burlesque Museum|the museum]]'s fundraising efforts. Where originally the pageant had been a one-day event, it grew and was expanded to last a weekend after its first decade. The new format featured an entire evening dedicated to the "legends" – the mostly sexuagenarian and septuagenarian women of burlesque's "golden age" of the 1950s and 1960s. Other new changes to the pageant included the expansion of financial sponsors; a glossy souvenir program; a celebrity master of ceremonies ([[El Vez]]); expanded seating (and shade areas); and a professional entertainment stage with sound and lighting as an improvement upon the aging wooden stage that had been used in previous years. 

Some of the most significant changes by 2005 were changes to the pageant application and judging process; changes that had been initiated in 2001. The pageant had expanded from having only one "Miss Exotic World" category to now include other new categories such as Best Debut. Additionally, the application process was tightened up, with the evaluation method standardized to further ensure professionalism and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peepshowmenagerie.com/nofimagazine/50exoticw1.htm|title=No-Fi Magazine visits Miss Exotic World Pageant 2005|first=Chris|last=Beyond|accessdate=22 April 2018|via=www.peepshowmenagerie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 to present ===
In 2006, the pageant took place in a new location, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], in the wake of certain events that greatly affected the museum's operational ability. (Specifically, the state of disrepair of the property, and the death of property owner Charles Arroyo.) With the museum's impending move to Las Vegas, the pageant was held there, based at the Celebrity Theater in downtown Las Vegas. The pageant, up to that point held on the first Saturday in June, was instead held over Memorial Day weekend in late May, 2006. The pageant consisted of four evenings' worth of events and featured dual hosts [[Margaret Cho]] and [[El Vez]]. Since 2006, the pageant has made Las Vegas its permanent home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/arts/denvers-midnite-martini-wins-burlesques-miss-exotic-world-title-in-las-vegas-5784583|title=Denver's Midnite Martini wins burlesque's Miss Exotic World title in Las Vegas

'''Miss Gay America''' is a national pageant for [[female impersonator]]s. Established in 1972, the pageant is based on the [[Miss America]] contest and follows a similar format.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missgayamerica.com/About/WhatisMGA.htm|author=L&amp;T Entertainment|title=What is Miss Gay America?|accessdate=May 18, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518205309/http://missgayamerica.com/About/WhatisMGA.htm|archivedate=May 18, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, contestants compete at various city, state, and direct regional preliminaries for the opportunity to advance to the official Miss Gay America pageant. Titleholders are often seen as the best in the industry and are frequently hired to entertain in a variety of venues, such as [[Las Vegas]] shows, [[cruise ships]], and [[LGBT]] events.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Miss Gay America pageant system is the longest running pageant system for female impersonators. It is one of the four major pageant systems for the art form, in addition to Continental Pageantry, Gay USofA Pageantry, and Entertainer of the Year. Miss Gay America is unique in that it is the only national pageant that prohibits contestants from using [[female hormones]] or having undergone any feminizing plastic surgery, such as breast implants or liquid-silicone injections below the neck.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Lady Gaga]] on the 10th of September 2017, was crowned as the first Honorary Miss Gay America. 

The current Miss Gay America titleholder is Andora Te’Tee, the 48th titleholder, crowned on October 6, 2018.

==History==
In 1971, Jerry Peek opened the Watch Your Hat &amp; Coat Saloon in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], the city's first gay dance and show bar. Having an understanding of the [[female illusionist]] state pageants occurring in various show bars in other states, Peek decided to establish a national level pageant to further recognize the best entertainers. On June 25, 1972, the first pageant was held at Peek's Nashville saloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Gay America Pageant: Battle for the Crown|author=Margaret Ellis|url=http://www.outandaboutnashville.com/story/miss-gay-america-pageant-battle-crown|publisher=Out and About Nashville}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Jones, performing as Norma Kristie, competed representing Arkansas and was crowned the winner of the 1973 pageant and emeritus titleholder of the Miss Gay America Pageant system. In 1975, Jones assumed ownership of the pageant and later formed Norma Kristie, Inc., operating and directing the Miss Gay America pageant and the Mr. Gay All-America Contest systems. In 2005, Norman Jones retired from the pageant's regular operations and sold the Miss Gay America pageantry system to Larry Tyger and Terry Eason of L&amp;T Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Gay America: Pageant History|author=L&amp;T Entertainment|url=http://www.missgayamerica.com/Pageant%20History/Main%20Page.htm|accessdate=May 16, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519094605/http://missgayamerica.com/Pageant%20History/Main%20Page.htm|archivedate=May 19, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2016 Michael Dutzer and Rob Mansman of Mad Angel Entertainment purchased the Miss Gay America pageant From L &amp; T Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgja.org/outnewswire/2016/02/08/miss-gay-america-pageant-sold-to-mad-angel-entertainment/|title=Miss Gay America Pageant Sold to Mad Angel Entertainment|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2016 pageant in Memphis, Mad Angel Entertainment announced they will be retiring the solo talent category. Starting in 2017 Presentation will be judged for the top 10 contestants in its place.  Also starting in 2017 contestants are able to change their talent numbers on the final night of the competition.

Mad Angel Entertainment announced in January 2017 that they will be bringing back Mr. Gay All-American as Mr. Gay America.  The pageant was held on July 2, 2017 in Dallas, TX with the winner being Judas Elliott. &lt;ref name="missgayamericapageant.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://missgayamericapageant.blogspot.com//2017/01/video-meet-mr-gay-america-2017.html|title=MGAZINE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualification==
Contestants for the national Miss Gay America pageant qualify through franchised state and direct regional preliminaries. The winner and first alternate of the preliminary contests advance to the national pageant. Many states require contestants to first compete in franchised city preliminaries, where the winner and first alternate advance to the state pageant.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Competition==
Historically, pageant competition consisted of interview, evening gown and talent categories. Later a Contemporary Fashion category for sportswear was added. After about a decade it was changed to Creative Fashion, a category that was never fully understood by judges or contestants and was later changed to Creative Costume. It was eventually replaced with Solo Talent.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} While some of the contestants perform live vocal, dance or comedy skits, the vast majority showcase their talent of [[lip syncing]] to prerecorded music. Current categories are Male Interview, Solo Talent, Evening Gown, On-Stage Interview, and Talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missgayamerica.com/About/Categories.htm|author=L&amp;T Productions|title=Miss Gay America Categories|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519002412/http://www.missgayamerica.com/About/Categories.htm|archivedate=2014-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the national pageant consists of 3 nights of preliminary competition, where all contestants compete in male interview, solo talent, evening gown, and production talent. Awards for each night of these categories are presented on the 4th night of the pageant week during the official Miss Gay America Revue Show, where former titleholders return to entertain. The final competition night is held on the fifth night, typically at a larger and more formal venue, and the top 10 finalists are announced. These finalists then compete again in evening gown, stage interview, and production talent. At the end of the final pageant, the top four runners-up are announced and the winner is crowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missgayamerica.com/MGA2015/Schedule.htm|author=L&amp;T Productions|title=Miss Gay America 2015 Schedule|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519002824/http://www.missgayamerica.com/MGA2015/Schedule.htm|archivedate=2014-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable events===

====Shan Covington's title revocation====
In 1976, Shan Covington's title was revoked 7 months into her reign for conduct unbecoming of a Miss Gay America titleholder. The title was offered to the 1976 First Alternate, Michael Andrews, who declined because she wanted to win the title. The title was then passed to the 1976 Second Alternate, Dani Daletto. This incident sparked the development of the current mandatory first alternate succession rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

====Showtime's ''Dream Boy's Revue''====
In 1985, titleholder Naomi Sims was also the crowned winner of the 1985 National Female Impersonator of the Year contest. That contest was organized by Norma Kristie, Inc., owner of the Miss Gay America pageant, but was created, produced and televised by the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] network in a television special called ''Dream Boy's Revue.'' The audience believed the pageant was real, but according to "finalist" Rachel Wells, the pageant was staged and each of the contestants were paid substantially to "compete." Additionally, the televised special faced issues with copyright infringement associated with certain lip syncing performances, which required much of the talent portion of the show to be dubbed when it was aired.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

====Death of titleholder Ramona LeGer'====
In 1995, titleholder Ramona LeGer' died 5 months into her reign due to complications from AIDS. First Alternate Patti Le Plae Safe requested not to be crowned or wear the crown during the pageant year, instead serving as the official Miss Gay America Representative to honor Ramona LeGer's memory. Patti Le Plae Safe was crowned Miss Gay America 1995 in a special ceremony prior to the 1996 pageant in Little Rock, Arkansas. Patti donated large portions of her performance fees to AIDS charities while representing Miss Gay America 1995.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

====Alyssa Edwards' title revocation====
In 2010, winner Alyssa Edwards had her title revoked due to scheduling conflicts with previous engagements and her Miss Gay America duties. The title was passed to the 2010 first alternate, Coco Montrese, who was crowned in a special ceremony at The Grey Fox Nightclub in St. Louis, MO. Alyssa Edwards and Coco Montrese appeared as contestants in season five of [[RuPaul's Drag Race]], where the 2010 Miss Gay America pageant issues and animosity between Alyssa and Coco played a central theme throughout the season. L&amp;T Productions later released a statement about the dramatized events, explaining their reasons for revoking Alyssa's title and their lack of knowledge about how this issue would be portrayed in the television series. They had been approached by the producers to provide copyright clearance for both Alyssa's and Coco's official Miss Gay America photos.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Mr. Gay All-American===
The Mr. Gay All-American Contest was founded by Norma Kristie, Inc. in 1983 by the operators of Miss Gay America, Norman Jones and Carmel Santiago (Lady Baronessa, Miss Gay America 1974). The MGAA Contest was started to provide a venue for gay men to showcase their intellect, community service, and talent. It launched careers in professional entertainment for many young gay men. MGAA was the first contest of its kind, and its winner was considered to be the co-titleholder to Miss Gay America.

In 1995, Jones sold the Mr. Gay All-American Contest to Gib Hauersperger, who had been the contest director since the death of Carmel Santiago. Hauersperger operated the pageant until his retirement in 1999. Paul Lopez (Mr. Gay All-American 2000) operated the contest from 1999 to 2003, when Richard Greer (Mr. Gay All-American 1999) assumed the directorial role. John Beebe (Mr. Gay All-American 1996) succeeded Greer as director. In 2009, Beebe and Hauersperger announced that the Mr. Gay All-American Contest system would cease operations indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carriefairfield.com/community/topic/36718-mr-gay-all-american-1983-2009/|title=Mr. Gay All-American 1983-2009|author=CarrieFairfield.com Forums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Kieve''' (born 1967) is an [[English people|English]] professional [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]] and whose consulting work for both stage and screen has contributed to changing how magical [[special effects]] in productions are approached. He is the only illusionist ever to have won a New York Drama Desk award (for ''[[Ghost the Musical]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]). He created the illusions for the 2014 [[Kate Bush]] concert ''[[Before the Dawn (Kate Bush)|Before the Dawn]]''.

==Early life==
Kieve was born in [[Woodford, London|Woodford]], North-East [[London]]&lt;ref name="M E N"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/music/classical_and_opera/s/154/154273_kieve_reveals_secrets_of_the_spells.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421073823/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/music/classical_and_opera/s/154/154273_kieve_reveals_secrets_of_the_spells.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 April 2013 |title=Kieve reveals secrets of the spells |last=Rooth |first=Ben |date=11 April 2005 |work=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started magic at 10 years of age after receiving a magic set as a [[birthday]] gift.

==Early performing career==
Kieve first performed publicly in 1983. In January 1984 at the age of 16 he performed card tricks in the music video for the [[Sade (band)|Sade]] single [[Your Love Is King]], his arms having been shaved to give the impression that the singer was performing the [[prestidigitation]] herself.&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paul Kieve: The real-life Jonathan Creek|last=Rees|first=Jasper|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 June 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-features/8575717/Paul-Kieve-The-real-life-Jonathan-Creek.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April of that year he made his first television appearance on the BBC TV children's show ''[[Blue Peter]]'', apparently cutting presenter [[Janet Ellis]] into three pieces .

In 1985 he was a finalist in the "Young [[Magician (illusion)|Magician]] of the Year" competition.

Early professional engagements as a performer included a 1985 residency at the Xenon nightclub on [[Piccadilly]], [[London]] and a summer 1986 run at the Inn on The Park, [[Jersey]] where he was resident support to acts including [[Bernard Manning]], [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Ken Dodd]].

In 1986 he and Lawrence Leyton formed The Zodiac Brothers and performed resident seasons in [[Sendai]], [[Japan]], on board the [[Cunard Line]]'s [[QE2]] and at the [[Magic Castle]] in [[Hollywood]]. When the Zodiac Brothers split in 1991 and Kieve made plans to attend university an approach from the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]] to assist with illusions for a production of ''The Invisible Man''&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; marked the beginning of a new career as a magic consultant.

'''''Polyglot''''' was a biweekly [[webzine|online newsletter]] about the game hobby industry that ceased publication in 2012. It contains official [[press releases]] put out by [[roleplaying game]], [[board game]], [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]], [[card game]], [[LARP]], [[comic book]], and [[computer game]] companies. It is published for free as a downloadable [[PDF]]. Polyglot is published by Polymancer Studios, Inc., a Canadian publisher that also prints [[Polymancer magazine]].

It was announced on July 19, 2007, that Polyglot would include [[editorials]] and [[review|product reviews]].&lt;ref&gt;"Polyglot is so successful, we are adding to its features due to readers demands." http://www.thegpa.org/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=163 Game Publisher Association website, accessed November 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The webzine's publisher has not previously endorsed the inclusion of original or editorial content.

In the second anniversary issue (the filename for which indicates it was placed on the company's server on March 8, 2007), the publishers of Polyglot stated that there have been over 600,000 "unique downloads" of Polyglot since March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;''Polyglot'' Volume #3 Issue #1 http://www.polymancerstudios.com/component/option,com_vfm/Itemid,55/do,download/file,PolyGlot|Volume+3|polyglot_volume3_issue1.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt; This was stated in the 53rd issue of the webzine (similar press releases have been made [http://www.thegpa.org/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=126 in other outlets][http://www.enworld.org/showthread.php?t=189044][http://www.gamingreport.com/print.php?sid=23206]) which likely means that the statement was made about the previous 52 issues combined. This equates to roughly 11,538 downloads per issue.

==Format==
''Polyglot'''s issues were numbered in a volume/issue format that is similar to how printed [[magazines]] are numbered; that is, not sequentially. For example, the 27th issue of Polyglot was not "Polyglot issue #27" but "Polyglot Volume #2 Issue #1."

''Polyglot'' was formatted as a US letter size PDF. It is divided into two sections, one for "traditional" games (the term the company uses to describe RPGs, card games, board games, miniatures, etc.) and one for "digital" games. Every page of Polyglot has a banner image of the top containing Polyglot's [[logo]]. There are two different logos, one for the "traditional" gaming section and one for the "digital" gaming section. The front page of each of the two sections has a slightly larger logo. The "traditional" gaming section's logo has the slogan "the language of gaming" and the digital section's logo simply says "digital section." In both sections, the logos have different colors on each page, repeated in sequence (there are 5 different colors for the "traditional" section" and 4 for the "electronic" section).

The first 12 issues of ''Polyglot'' (i.e., Volume #1 Issues #1 to #12) did not have any images in them other than the Polyglot "traditional" section logos. Starting in Volume #1 Issue #13,&lt;ref&gt;''Polyglot'' Volume #1 Issue #13 http://www.polymancerstudios.com/component/option,com_vfm/Itemid,55/do,download/file,PolyGlot|Volume+1|polyglot_volume1_issue13.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt; images of games, game company logos, and convention photographs have appeared in the newsletter.

There was no "digital" section in Polyglot until Polyglot Volume #1 issue #25.&lt;ref&gt;''Polyglot'' Volume #1 Issue #25 http://www.polymancerstudios.com/component/option,com_vfm/Itemid,55/do,download/file,PolyGlot|Volume+1|polyglot_volume1_issue25.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt; The first computer game press release appeared in the previous issue&lt;ref&gt;''Polyglot'' Volume #1 Issue #24 http://www.polymancerstudios.com/component/option,com_vfm/Itemid,55/do,download/file,PolyGlot|Volume+1|polyglot_volume1_issue24.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt; alongside press releases for "traditional" games. A [[table of contents]] first appeared in Volume #1 Issue #25 as well, the first one with clickable [[internal links|internal hyperlinks]] was in Volume #2 Issue #4.&lt;ref&gt;''Polyglot'' Volume #2 Issue #4 http://www.polymancerstudios.com/component/option,com_vfm/Itemid,55/do,download/file,PolyGlot|Volume+2|polyglot_volume2_issue4.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[URL]]s in Polyglot press releases are clickable. Many of the items that appear in the newsletter have contact information for the game company or the [[publicist]] who issued the press release. Often (but not always), the writers are [[Attribution (journalism)|attributed]].

As of November 1, 2007, the largest issue of Polyglot to date was Polyglot Volume #3 Issue #9&lt;ref&gt;''Polyglot'' Volume #2 Issue #19 http://www.polymancerstudios.com/component/option,com_vfm/Itemid,55/do,download/file,PolyGlot|Volume+3|polyglot_volume3_issue9.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt; at 65 pages.

==Impact==
''Polyglot'' has grown over its history from a 3-page PDF of all text to as large as 65 pages with over 50 press releases and as many as 91 images in Volume #3 Issue #9; the PDF's file size ranges was 5.3 megabytes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polymancerstudios.com/component/option,com_vfm/Itemid,55/do,download/file,PolyGlot|Volume+3|polyglot_volume3_issue9.pdf/ Polymancer Studios Inc. - Offline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 companies (see below) have sent material to Polyglot over the course of the webzine's first 55 issues.

[[Stephen V Cole]] of [[Amarillo Design Bureau Inc.|Starfleet Games]] identified Polyglot as one of the "People Who Will Contact You" in his [[online book]] about how to run a game company. He advises game companies to "ask them to tell you the kind of information they want... and give it to them."&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Stephen V. ''Stephen Cole's Running a Game Publishing Company.'' Amarillo, TX: Amarillo Design Bureau. December 16, 2006. http://www.starfleetgames.com/book/2-the_company.pdf Accessed April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (The reference is to "Polymancer" but this is incorrect, that being the name of a separate publication by the same company.) Mr. Cole has also stated in his blog that "If you really want to know what's going on in the adventure game industry, you can't do better than" reading Polyglot.&lt;ref&gt;If you want to know, see ... POLYGLOT! February 22, 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.starfleetgames.com/federation/blog/2007_02_01_archive.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120913143217/http://www.starfleetgames.com/federation/blog/2007_02_01_archive.html |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }} retrieved on November 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Polymancer Studios has encouraged other companies in the game business to adopt professional press release writing techniques such as using the [[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]] in a [[style guide]] on their web site.&lt;ref&gt;Polymancer Studios, Inc. "The ''Polyglot'' Guide to Press Release Writing for Gaming Professionals" Montreal: Polymancer Studios, Inc. http://www.polymancerstudios.com/documents/HOWTO_Press_Release.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed November 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A press release by Polymancer Studios in Polyglot Volume #3 Issue #1 indicated that this has had the effect that the company intended.&lt;ref&gt;''Polyglot'' Volume #3 Issue #1 http://www.polymancerstudios.com/component/option,com_vfm/Itemid,55/do,view/file,PolyGlot|Volume+3|polyglot_volume3_issue1.pdf/ page 37: "Not only are we getting ''more'' material to put into ''Polyglot,'' we are also getting ''better'' material because game companies are '''sending us better press releases with each passing week'''." (Original emphasis.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyglot was distributed freely on other game companies' websites.&lt;ref&gt;Polyglot Volume #1 Issue #14 retrieved from On The Line Games Company website http://www.pizzaboxfootball.com/pressreleases/polyglot_volume1_issue14_2005_09_03%201%20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regular Contributors==
Apart from editorials, Polyglot's only "contributors" are companies in the game industry. Their press releases are often signed by the company's owner or president. However, the computer game companies' press releases are typically signed by third party [[public relations]] and [[marketing]] [[consultants]]. More than 100 companies have sent material to Polyglot since it first went online in March 2005 and as a result a full list of contributors would be long. The companies named below are a partial list.

Roleplaying game companies that have had material posted in Polyglot include [[Wizards of the Coast]], [[White Wolf Publishing|White Wolf]], [[Mongoose Publishing]], [[Columbia Games]], [[Eden Studios]], [[Paizo Publishing]], and a large number of smaller "independent" game companies. Polyglot also regularly has had marketing and publicity material from [[Mayfair Games]] (known for [[Settlers of Catan]]) and other [[German game]] companies. Several miniatures companies also send to Polyglot (usually including color photos of their products) including [[Games Workshop]] and [[Rackham|Rackham Miniatures]]. Traditional wargame companies like [[Amarillo Design Bureau]] and [[Avalanche Press]] also have sent product announcements on a regular basis. Some [[toy]] companies (e.g. Briarpatch), [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] (e.g. [[Gen Con]]), game industry [[professional associations]] (e.g. [[Game Manufacturers Association|GAMA]], and [[film festivals]] (e.g. [[Fantasia Festival|Fantasia]]) have also had marketing material appear in Polyglot's "Traditional" gaming section.

The various computer games that have been featured in Polyglot include [[Activision]], [[id Software]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[MTV]] (who have a game studio), [[Ubisoft]], and numerous smaller companies. Activision is the most frequent contributor, generally having several press releases, product announcements, and pages of screenshots or video stills placed in every issue of Polyglot (see various issues in the Notes below for examples of this).

A '''promo''' (a [[shorthand]] term for '''promotion''') is a form of commercial [[advertising]] used in [[broadcast media]], either [[television]] or [[radio]], which promotes a program airing on a television or radio station/network to the viewing or listening audience.

==Background==
Promos typically run from 15 to 60 seconds, with 30-second spots being the most common, although some occasionally last run as little as five seconds or as long as 90 seconds. Most promos show select video or audio clips of scenes or segments from an upcoming program (such as a television or radio series, [[film]] or [[television special|special]]). Some television promos (particularly for an upcoming television series) utilize a [[monologue]] format in which a star or host of the program breaks the [[fourth wall]], which is often done in a humorous and/or parodical manner. Most radio promos utilize this format as well, with a host of the program discussing the show itself, though some feature audio clips from past editions of the radio broadcast. [[Terrestrial television|Broadcast]] [[television station]]s promote upcoming newscasts by featuring teases of select story packages to be featured in the broadcast, such as an investigative report or a special-interest feature segment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAemy7NwXrQ WLVI The Ten O'Clock News Preview/Promo (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The airdate and time of the program's broadcast as well as the name and/or logo of the station or network that the program will be broadcast on are displayed either at the end of or throughout the promo (in the latter case, the airtime and network/station may be displayed before it is mentioned verbally by the [[continuity announcer|announcer]]). Until the mid-1980s on broadcast television stations, the text showing the date and time, along with the station logo were displayed on the bottom of the screen (unlike with broadcast and cable television, airtime information is not pre-displayed on promos for [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programs]] as syndicated programs are typically aired at different times depending on the [[media market|market]], and are instead inserted by the station itself); however, stations now posterize graphics over the tail end of a syndicated program promos where the program's logo is shown (many stations use this treatment on promos for programs airing on networks that the station maintains an affiliation, such as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[The CW]]) or show the latter portion of the promo within a box surrounded by the graphic.

[[Pay television|Premium cable channels]] and other [[television network]]s that do not accept outside advertising traditionally only air promos during pre-determined breaks that start after a program concludes; the length of these breaks can vary depending on the start time of the succeeding program, it is feasible for multiple program promotions to be shown within the break until the start of the next program.
Types of promotional media:-
1) television
2) radio
3) internet
4) billboards
5) newspapers, magazines
6) pamphlets
7) SMS
8) brochures
9) word of mouth

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4436">'''Silly Billy''' was a type of [[clown]] common at [[fair]]s in England during the 19th century.  They were also common in London as a [[street entertainer]], along with the similar clown [[Billy Barlow (clown)|Billy Barlow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wN_H-__MBpYC&amp;pg=PA892 |title=The London encyclopaedia |chapter=Street Performers |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4050-4924-5 |last1=Hibbert |first1=Christopher |last2=Weinreb |first2=Ben |authorlink1=Christopher Hibbert |authorlink2=Ben Weinreb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The act included playing the part of a fool or idiot, impersonating a child and singing [[comic song]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=British Plays, Players, and Playing Places |first=B |last=Griffith |journal=The Sewanee Review |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role was typically played as a [[Stooge (comedian)|stooge]] to another clown.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal=English Dance and Song |publisher=[[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] |year=1973 |quote=The fairground Silly Billy was a comedian's stooge, underdog to his clowning, played as a juvenile part. |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is popular because of its nice [[rhyme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ReuAGJc32UC |title=Words and Names |first=Ernest |last=Weekley |authorlink=Ernest Weekley |page=19 |year=1932 |publisher=Ayer|isbn=978-0-8369-5918-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used as a generic nickname for foolish people, especially those named [[William (name)|William]] such as
[[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Prince William Frederick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvScOaG7mHYC&amp;pg=PA146 |title=A Concise History of the University of Cambridge |first=E. S. |last=Leedham-Green |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-43978-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[King William IV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_No3oxZfwy4C&amp;pg=PA58 |title=The Houses of Hanover &amp; Saxe-Coburg-Gotha |chapter=William IV |quote=the general opinion was that he was rather a fool – 'Silly Billy' was the inevitable nickname |isbn=978-0-520-22801-6 |last1=Clarke |first1=John |last2=Ridley |first2=Jasper Godwin |last3=Fraser|first3=Antonia |authorlink2=Jasper Ridley|authorlink3=Antonia Fraser|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Republicanism in Nineteenth Century England |first=N.J. |last=Gossman |journal=International Review of Social History| year=2008 |doi=10.1017/S0020859000002005 |volume=7 |pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nickname was popularised in the 1970s by impressionist [[Mike Yarwood]], putting it in the mouth of the chancellor, [[Denis Healey]], who took the catchphrase up and used it as his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A History of Modern Britain |page=346 |first=Andrew |last=Marr |authorlink=Andrew Marr|publisher=Pan Books |isbn=0330511475 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, the costume of a Silly Billy was short, white trousers with a long white [[pinafore]], white shoes with a strap around the ankle, red sleeves, a [[ruff]] around the neck, and a boy's cap.  The hair or wig was arranged to stick out behind the ears.  Red makeup was daubed to emphasise the nose with two smears of black for the eyebrows.  Multiple pairs of white trousers were needed because women liked to tease the clown by smearing [[gingerbread]] or sticking pins into his legs so that they bled.&lt;ref name=LlLp&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIoBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA134 |title=London labour and the London poor |first=Henry |last=Mayhew| authorlink=Henry Mayhew |chapter=Silly Billy |year=1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comic routines included a [[mesmerism]] act in which Silly Billy was hypnotised, a parody of a preacher giving a [[sermon]], and a parody of a [[temperance movement|temperance]] campaign.&lt;ref name=LlLp/&gt;  Comic songs included ''O'ive getten a Soft Pleace i' my Yead'' and ''Dolly and the Swill Tub''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wa_QAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 |journal=Chamber's Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts |first=William and Robert |last=Chambers |title=The Drama Under Canvas |date=May 27, 1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wages of a Silly Billy at the time were about two or three [[Half crown (British coin)|half-crowns]] per day, averaging about a pound a week, over the year.  About a dozen performers made their living in this way in the London area.&lt;ref name=LlLp/&gt;

'''Stand Up Seoul''' is an English-language [[stand up comedy]] group based in Seoul, South Korea (founded by Brian Aylward initially as a comedy night in 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Power|first=John|title=Funny business far from home|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/lifestyle/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110322000850|publisher=[[Korea Herald]]|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aylward was a runner-up at the 2008 Hong Kong International Comedy Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standup comedian, Brian Aylward|url=http://10mag.com/standup-comedian-brian-alyward/|publisher=10 Magazine|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since returned to his home country of Canada to pursue a career in comedy.

Upon Brian's departure, Stand Up Seoul was helmed by Jeff Sinclair, Rudy Tyburczy, Erin Weber and Albert Escobedo. As of the spring of 2012, Erin Weber has gone to pursue her dream of being a comedian back in the USA. Her position was replaced by Adam Palmeter, whom as of March 2013, has left South Korea.  All of the above are stand ups came from a varying degree of performance experience, but held a common goal of developing their craft, and the scene in Korea. In March, 2013 they celebrated their fourth anniversary.&lt;ref name="Tharp"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tharp|first=Chris|title=Feature: Red Hot Comedian Kyle Kinane One Night Only in Busan this Week|url=http://busanhaps.com/article/comedian-kyle-kinane-in-korea|publisher=[[Busan Haps]]|accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group hosts weekly open-mic nights as well as monthly paid events. They have traveled extensively throughout South Korea, such as [[Busan]], [[Gumi, North Gyeongsang|Gumi]], [[Daegu]], [[Pohang]], [[Mokpo]], [[Gwangju]], [[Daejeon]], [[Osan]], [[Gunsan]], [[Cheonan]], and more.  Stand Up Seoul has also brought many professional stand up comics to Seoul, so far, including [[Tom Cotter (comedian)|Tom Cotter]], [[Ted Alexandro]], [[Kyle Kinane]],&lt;ref&gt;

In May 2013, they brought back Kyle Kinane, as well as [[Matt Braunger]] at the Seoul Renaissance Hotel.&lt;ref name="Tharp" /&gt; In November 2013, they had co-headliners Baron Vaughn and Ben Kronberg from the USA.

The '''Thailand Masters''' was a professional [[snooker]] tournament. Previously known as '''Asian Open''' and '''Thailand Open''', it was a [[Snooker world rankings|ranking]] tournament from 1989/90 to 2001/02. An event called the ''Thailand Masters'' also formed part of the ''[[World Series of Snooker|World Series]]'' in 1991/92, with [[Steve Davis]] beating [[Stephen Hendry]] 6–3. The final champion was [[Marco Fu]].

==History==
The '''Thailand Masters''' was first held in the [[Snooker season 1983/1984|1983/1984 season]]. It was organised by [[Matchroom Sport]] as part of their [[World Series of Snooker|World Series]] and sponsored by Camus, but was abandoned after [[Snooker season 1986/1987|1986/1987]].&lt;ref name="Turner Thailand"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Chris|title=Thailand Open, Thailand Classic, Thailand Masters|url=http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Thai.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216155548/http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Thai.html|archivedate=16 February 2012|work=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk|publisher=Chris Turner's Snooker Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event returned to the calendar in 1989 under the '''Asian Open''' name and it became a [[Snooker world rankings|ranking]] tournament. In its first three years under this name the event was sponsored by 555 and than by [[Nescafé]] in 1993. All events took place in Bangkok, Thailand, except in 1990, which was held in China. In the [[Snooker season 1991/1992|1991/1992 season]] two events were held.The Thailand Masters was part of the World Series and the Asian Open was a ranking event.&lt;ref name="Turner Thailand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner Asia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Chris|title=Asian Open, Asian Classic, Hong Kong Open|url=http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Asia.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216155410/http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Asia.html|archivedate=16 February 2012|work=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk|publisher=Chris Turner's Snooker Archive|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 [[Dave Harold]] became the lowest ranked player to win a ranking tournament. He was ranked world number 93, when he beat [[Darren Morgan]] 9–3.&lt;ref name="Turner Asia"/&gt;

The event changed its name to '''Thailand Open''' in [[Snooker season 1993/1994|1993/1994]]. The event was held in Bangkok and remained there until the [[Snooker season 2002/2003|2002/2003 season]].&lt;ref name="Turner Thailand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner Asia"/&gt; It was sponsored by Kloster, before Singha took over for [[Snooker season 1995/1996|1995/1996]].&lt;ref name="Turner Thailand"/&gt; The event was renamed to the '''Thailand Masters''' in the [[Snooker season 1997/1998|1997/1998 season]] and was sponsored by Beer Chang. The only official maximum break in the history of the competition came at the qualifying stages of the [[1999 Thailand Masters|1999]] event. [[Adrian Gunnell]] compiled it in the first round against [[Mario Wehrmann]]. The event didn't have a sponsor again until the [[Snooker season 2000/2001|2000/2001 season]], when it was sponsored by Blue Eagle and [[Thai Airways International|Thai Airways]] and was sponsored by Singha in [[Snooker season 2001/2002|2001/2002]].&lt;ref name="Turner Thailand"/&gt; The event lost its ranking status in 2002/2003, after World Snooker decided not to afford a Far East event. The event returned as a domestic event with several players from the Main Tour still competing. The event was last held in the [[Snooker season 2006/2007|2006/2007 season]] with the sponsorship of Sangsom, but was discontinued after that.&lt;ref name="Turner Thailand"/&gt;

'''The Boardwalk at Hersheypark''' is the newest themed area located at [[Hersheypark]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]], USA. The Boardwalk at Hersheypark opened in 2007 to mark the 100th anniversary of the theme park opened by [[Milton S. Hershey]] in 1907. It originally featured five water‐based attractions and is the single biggest financial investment in the park’s history, at a cost of $21 million [[USD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watertechnologyinc.com/en/projects/the-boardwalk-at-hersheypark/rh=99&amp;pa=10&amp;rt=99&amp;rr=99 The Boardwalk Project Summary]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
There are five original features of The Boardwalk at Hersheypark.
East Coast Waterworks- a seven-story tall water play structure with seven body waterslides, two tipping buckets, and nearly six-hundred different water play-toys.
[[Coastline Plunge]]- a tube waterslide tower featuring four different waterslides: Vortex (Proslide Bowl), Riptide, Surge, and Whirlwind (Proslide Tornado).
Sandcastle Cove- a children's play area with zero-depth entry designed just for young guests.
Bayside Pier- a tidal pool with lapping waves to simulate a bay, featuring zero-depth entry and 48,000 gallons of water.  Maximum depth: 3&amp;nbsp;ft.
Waverider.

==Expansion==
In 2009, an expansion, known as The Boardwalk: The SEAquel, was built at a cost of $17.6 million USD.  This expansion includes two new water attractions:
The Shore, a 378,000 gallon wave pool with zero-depth entry and a maximum depth of 6&amp;nbsp;ft, and 
Intercoastal Waterway, a 1,360&amp;nbsp;ft. long lazy river attraction with a uniform water depth of 2{{frac|1|2}} ft.
This expansion replaced the iconic Canyon River Rapids ride.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lancasteronline.com/news/hersheypark-unveils-m-waterpark-expansion/article_33681384-7d51-5f0b-899e-72d7b42f1c16.html?rh=99&amp;pa=10&amp;rt=99&amp;rr=99 The Boardwalk: The SEAquel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to ice storms and flooding during the 2008–2009 off-season, construction on the expansion was delayed. The new attractions were not open when the park opened at the beginning of the 2009 season on May 1. Instead, they opened on May 23, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hersheypark.com/rides/results.php?rh=99&amp;pa=10&amp;rt=99&amp;rr=99 The Boardwalk at Hershey Park rides page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, The Boardwalk was expanded again. This 2nd expansion includes three new water attractions:
2 new tube slides to the Coastline Plunge: Hydro and Pipeline, and
Shoreline Sprayground- a children's splash area with misters, bubblers, water jets, and fountains designed just for young guests. The Shoreline Sprayground replaced Roller Soaker.

In 2018, there were two new attractions added to The Boardwalk. Breaker's Edge Water Coaster and Whitecap Racer. They are right above the lazy river, with Breaker's Edge using the station of the former Roller Soaker attraction. It is considered their biggest splash in nearly a decade.

'''Universal Studios Beijing''', or '''Universal Beijing Resort''', is an upcoming Universal theme park in  [[Beijing]] that will open around 2020. The park would become the fifth Universal Studios-branded theme park in the world, the 7th Universal-built park overall, and the third in Asia, after [[Universal Studios Japan]] and [[Universal Studios Singapore]]. 

The project was announced on October 13, 2014 with the plan to invest 20 billion [[Renminbi|RMB]] ($3.3 billion in U.S. dollars) into the new theme park and a [[groundbreaking]] ceremony was held on October 31, 2016. It will feature attractions themed primarily to Universal-owned movies, TV shows, animation, and music, as well as licensed properties from other companies (e.g., [[Warner Bros.]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Dr. Seuss|Dr. Seuss Enterprises]], [[Paramount Pictures]], etc.)

== History ==
It was reported back in March 2012 that [[Comcast]]/[[NBCUniversal]] officials were meeting with the city of [[Tianjin]] (China’s sixth largest city) to discuss a possible Universal park in the port city. Previously, there are said to have been many on and off again discussions for building a possible Universal theme park in China over the years going back to when [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] was first announced. On January 7, 2014, Shanghai Securities News reported that an application to begin construction on a Universal Studios park in the [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tongzhou District]] of [[Beijing]] was filed, with work to begin in late 2014 on this $2 billion project. Demolition of existing structures had already begun, with a goal of opening the park in 2018. Comcast CEO [[Brian L. Roberts]] predicted that they expected to take marketshare away from [[Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products]] chains with their plans to invest in their Universal Studios theme parks. “We’re doubling down on theme parks" and said "We think that there is a lot of 'there' there in the theme-park business for many years to come and that we have a low market share — and only one way to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=Jason|title=Comcast takes aim at Disney in theme-park battle|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2014-01-07/business/os-comcast-theme-parks-20140107_1_comcast-ceo-wizarding-world-universal-orlando|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=January 7, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2014, Universal Parks &amp; Resorts CEO Thomas L. Williams announced they signed a deal to build Universal Studios Beijing and is scheduled to open in 2019 instead. The overall investment in the theme park will be more than 20 billion [[Renminbi|RMB]] ($3.3 billion in U.S. dollars). It will be jointly owned by Beijing Shouhuan Cultural Tourism Investment Co., Ltd. (BSH Investment), a consortium of four state-owned companies, and Universal Parks &amp; Resorts. Estimated at about 1,000 acre of Beijing property, it will include an assortment of attractions in the 300 acre theme park from other Universal theme parks as well as new attractions that reflects China’s cultural heritage. Outside the theme park, there will be a [[Universal CityWalk]] retail/dining zone as well as a themed Universal resort hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/news-feed/universal-theme-park-and-resort-planned-for-beijing|title=Universal Theme Park and Resorts Planned for Beijing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 31, 2016, the park broke ground, while also announcing that the opening had been delayed from 2019 until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Studios Breaks Ground on Beijing Park, Opening Postponed Yet Again|url=https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2016/11/01/universal-studios-breaks-ground-beijing-park-opening-postponed-yet-again|website=www.thebeijinger.com|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=1 November 2016|first=Steven|last=Schwankert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storey|first1=Ken|title=Looks like Universal Studios will actually build that new theme park in Beijing|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2016/11/08/looks-ike-universal-studios-will-actually-build-that-new-theme-park-in-beijing|website=Orlando Weekly|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction will create approximately 40,000 new jobs. According to Duan Qiang, Chairman of [[Beijing Tourism Group]], one of the shareholders of Beijing Shouhuan, the first phase of the park will provide between 8,000 and 10,000 jobs. Around 1/3 of the attractions at the $3.3 billion park will be themed on Chinese culture and the first phase will occupy an area of 1.59 square kilometres in Tongzhou, including two hotels offering 1,200 to 1,400 rooms. One hotel will be reportedly be Universal-branded while the other will carry the NUO brand. More Chinese elements, such as fireworks and parades, are planned for phase two and three in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Beijing theme park to add 40,000 jobs|url=http://www.ecns.cn/business/2017/03-14/249204.shtml|website=Ecns.cn|accessdate=31 July 2017|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
No attractions were officially given when the project was first announced, although many speculated that they would include popular attractions from Universal-owned assets such as ''[[Jurassic World]]'', [[King Kong (2005 film)|''King Kong'']], [[Despicable Me (franchise)|''Despicable Me'']], [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'']], [[Madagascar (franchise)|''Madagascar'']], [[The Mummy (franchise)|''The Mummy'']], ''[[Waterworld]]'', and ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'', as well as third party properties such as [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'']], [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'']], [[Men in Black (film series)|''Men in Black'']], ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'', and those based on books from [[Dr. Seuss|Dr. Seuss Enterprises]]. Although [[Marvel Entertainment]] has a theme park agreement with Universal since 1994, it is highly unlikely that Universal would incorporate attractions based on [[Marvel Comics]] characters in Beijing, as Marvel is officially owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] (Universal's major theme park rival) since 2009,&lt;ref name="QUE"/&gt; so no future Universal theme parks after Disney's acquisition could make Marvel attractions (the regional restrictions of Marvel properties by Disney only applies in the U.S. and Japan, as Universal owns the rights to several Marvel properties in its parks within these regions that predates Disney's purchase of Marvel). 

On May 2, 2018, [[Fast &amp; Furious: Supercharged]] became the first ride to be confirmed for this park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Niles|first1=Robert|title=The Fast &amp; Furious family comes home, at Universal Orlando|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201805/6085/|website=Theme Park Insider|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, it was also confirmed that one of the lands would be themed to ''Harry Potter'', while other attractions were confirmed to be themed to ''Transformers'', ''Despicable Me'', and ''[[Kung Fu Panda (franchise)|Kung Fu Panda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ma|first1=Wayne|title=Bigger Than Disney: Budget Doubles for Universal’s Beijing Park|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/bigger-than-disney-universal-beijing-parks-construction-budget-doubles-1525687376|work=Wall Street Journal|date=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uruguay]] and its [[Organización de Telecomunicaciones de Iberoamérica|OTI]] member station [[Teledoce]], was one of the founders and main launchers of the [[OTI Festival]]. The country debuted in the contest in the first show in [[Madrid]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books/about/Festival_Oti_de_la_Canci%C3%B3n.html?id=COyVZwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Festival Oti de la Canción: Festival OTI Por Año, Festival de la OTI Por Países, Participantes Del Festival OTI de la Canción, Camilo Sesto|last=Wikipedia|first=Fuente:|date=May 2011|publisher=General Books|isbn=9781231631553|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Uruguayan broadcaster took part every year until the last show which was held in [[Acapulco]] in 2000.

== History ==
Uruguay debuted in the OTI Festival in 1972 with Ronayr Franco and his song "Busco mi destino" (I look for my destiny) created by the [[Spanis people|Spanish]] composer [[Augusto Algueró]]. Since their debut the Uruguayan trajectory in the OTI Festival was only moderate and only managed to reach the top 10 in five occasions. Although Teledoce was unable to win the contest, it achieved a significant result with Daniel Mantero and his song "Secreto enamorado" (A secret in love) which turned into a hit in the [[South America]]n country. Since then, the Uruguayan TV channel never managed to reach again the top ten.

[[File:Vienna Film Commission Logo.jpg|frameless|right|Vienna Film Commission Logo.jpg]]

The '''Vienna Film Commission''' is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to promoting the local [[film industry]]. As a free of charge service by the City of Vienna it supports national and international film and TV productions that aim to shoot feature films, TV shows, documentaries, commercials or student films in Vienna.

== History ==

The Vienna Film Commission was founded in February 2009 as a non-profit joint venture of the Cultural Department of the City (MA 7), the Vienna Film Fund, the Vienna Tourist Board, the Vienna Business Agency, the Vienna Economic Chamber and the Press and Information Services. 

The Commission consists of five members, led by Managing Director Marijana Stoisits.
Marijana Stoisits is a member of the [[European Film Academy]] and second vice chairwoman in the board of directors of the Association of Film Commissioners International (AFCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afci.org/news/afci-announces-new-officer-appointments-its-2017-board-directors|title=AFCI Announces New Officer Appointments to its 2017 Board of Directors - Association of Film Commissioners International|website=www.afci.org|access-date=2017-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208113358/http://www.afci.org/news/afci-announces-new-officer-appointments-its-2017-board-directors|archive-date=2017-02-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/artisans/news/afci-2017-board-of-directors-1201962168/|title=New Officers Named to AFCI Board of Directors|first=Peter|last=Caranicas|date=18 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Advisory Committee of the Vienna Film Commission, the Vienna Film Board, is made up of representatives of each of the five sponsoring organizations.

Since July 2009, the Vienna Film Commission has been based in the Media Quarter Marx in the third municipal District of Vienna.

== Tasks ==

The Vienna Film Commission has three main tasks:

# to act as an interface between the Vienna City Administration and the film industry, especially for the granting of [[film permits]]
# to support production companies in looking for qualified locations and service partners within the industry in Vienna
# to lobby for the film industry and to promote Vienna worldwide as a film location

'''WB Games Montréal Inc.''' is a Canadian [[video game developer]] based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. It is a subsidiary of [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] and is known for developing ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]''.

==History==
WB Games Montréal was founded in 2010 by Martin Tremblay, Martin Carrier, and Reid Schneider.&lt;ref name="WBGM1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WBGM2"/&gt; The studio is currently owned by [[Warner Bros.]]. One of the studio's titles, ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' was displayed for the public at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013|2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)]], and received two nominations from the [[Game Critics Awards]] for Best Action/Adventure Game and Best Console Game.&lt;ref name="AccoE32013"/&gt; The game was also recognized at the event for: "Best Videogame" by [[Forbes]];&lt;ref name="AccoE3Forbes"/&gt; "Best Action Game" by [[Game Informer]];&lt;ref name="AccoE3GI"/&gt; "Best Comic Book-Related Game" by [[Newsarama]];&lt;ref name="AccoE3NRama"/&gt; and "Best Xbox 360 Game" by [[IGN]].&lt;ref name="AccoE3IGN"/&gt; Upon ''Batman: Arkham Origins'''s release it received positive reviews. However, the company received a significant amount of criticism for failing to conduct proper testing on the game prior to release as well as refusing to address a number of game-breaking bugs that plagued the title, instead preferring to focus on the development and release of paid DLC.&lt;ref name="NewsGameSpot"/&gt; 

During an interview on the Humans of Gaming Podcast in October 2018, WB Games Montréal's Senior Game Designer Osama Dorias confirmed that two DC Comics based videogames are currently in development at the studio.&lt;ref&gt;https://gamingbolt.com/batman-arkham-origins-studios-making-couple-of-open-world-dc-universe-projects&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''XIII'''''  ('''Thirteen''') is a [[Belgian]] [[graphic novel]] [[Book series|series]] about an [[amnesia]]c who seeks to discover his past. It was created by writer [[Jean Van Hamme]] and artist [[William Vance]]. It is currently being written by [[Yves Sente]] and [[Youri Jigounov]]. The storyline of the first five volumes was adapted into a [[video game]] in 2003, also titled ''[[XIII (video game)|XIII]]'', which was released on several platforms. A [[Canada|Canadian]] [[television film]] based on the series, ''[[XIII: The Conspiracy]]'', was released in 2008. It was followed in 2011 by two seasons of a TV series, each 13 episodes, called ''[[XIII: The Series]]''.

==Volumes 1-5==
The series begins with a man awakening to find himself washed ashore in the eastern [[United States]] and suffering from [[amnesia]]. The only links to his past are a tattoo of the [[Roman numerals]] "XIII" on his collarbone and a photo of himself with a woman, who is identified as Kim Rowland, widow of [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] captain Steve Rowland. Volumes 1 through 5 deal with "XIII" searching for his identity and past. He finds himself hunted by a contract killer, the "Mongoose", who works for a mysterious organization known as [[XX (organization)|XX]], which aims to mount a [[coup d'état]] against the [[U.S. government]]. XIII is rescued from XX's assassins by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation's]] Colonel Amos, who confronts XIII with video evidence that shows XIII assassinating the [[President of the United States|President]].

In the second volume, XIII is captured by General Carrington, who confirms that XIII is Steve Rowland. Carrington further explains that Rowland was a member of a [[special ops]] unit called SPADS (Special Assault and Destroying Sections). Carrington had been commander of SPADS when Rowland was supposedly killed in a [[helicopter]] crash two years earlier. Because XIII's amnesia prevents him from identifying who sponsored the President's assassination, Amos lets him go. XIII reunites with his father and his uncle, but they are both murdered by XIII's young, gold-digging stepmother Felicity, who frames XIII after harming herself. XIII escapes the police with Carrington's help and meets Kim, an XX member known as "XVII", who reveals that XIII is not Steve Rowland. XIII is arrested by the police, and Kim disappears. XIII is found guilty for the murder of the Rowlands and sent to a maximum security prison.

The third volume finds XIII in a facility for the criminally insane. Amos, still pursuing his investigation, realizes that XIII was a [[body double]] for the real Steve Rowland. Amos requests Carrington's help to identify people who have been trained as top-level special operators and match XIII's physique; Amos's aim is to discover XIII's true identity. Carrington provides the papers of about twenty people. One named Ross Tanner has been missing for two years. Amos decides to leave XIII in prison to have his amnesia treated. The treatment fails, and the Mongoose tries to have XIII killed in the prison, but he fails, and Carrington helps XIII break out.

Volume four begins with Amos finding that Carrington had invented the Tanner identity and suspecting him of being part of the conspiracy to kill the President. XIII, under the name of Ross Tanner, has been hidden by Carrington in a SPADS training facility in the fictitious country of San Miguel. Amos continues to delve into the files and learns that Steve Rowland was murdered shortly after the assassination. Amos now assumes that Rowland was the real assassin, and is confused about XIII's real role, but he exposes Judge Allenby, the head of the investigation, as one of the conspirators. Amos interrogates Allenby, who is killed by Mongoose's assassin; Amos himself is rescued by Kim Rowland. Meanwhile, a female SPADS Sergeant named Betty Barnowsky reveals to XIII that she saw Steve Rowland in Eastown after his alleged death, in company with SPADS Colonel Seymour McCall. XIII, Barnowsky, and Jones escape an assassination attempt by McCall but end up lost in the San Miguel jungle.

Kim Rowland takes Amos to intelligence chief Carl Heideger and General Carrington, who reveal that, after faking his death in the helicopter crash, Steve Rowland contacted his wife, Kim, and forced her to be a member of the conspiracy. Kim, not sharing the conspiracy's ideology, and herself a former secret agent, secretly alerted her former boss, Heideger. Despite having this information, however, Heideger was unable to prevent the assassination of President Sheridan. Steve Rowland was shot by the Mongoose, but he escaped badly-wounded and died shortly after telling Kim what had happened. Heideger and Carrington then came up with a plan to make the XX organization believe that Steve Rowland had survived, hoping to attract the Mongoose's killers, arrest them, and follow their trail to the conspirators. They sourced a man named Jason Fly who was transformed into a Steve Rowland double, but soon after, Fly disappeared, when he was shot and lost his memory, just before the story began. Kim Rowland is also revealed to be Carrington's daughter.

At the start of volume five, XIII, Jones, and Barnowsky kidnap the Marquis de Préseau, a rich French land owner in San Miguel, to steal his jet to fly back to the US. Meanwhile, Carrington and Heideger have been arrested by the conspirators as they prepare to take over the country during a large-scale military exercise. XIII and the women meet with Colonel Amos, who brings them into contact with Walter Sheridan, brother of the assassinated President William Sheridan and himself a candidate for presidency.

Sheridan helps XIII infiltrate the military center of operations, and, together with President Galbrain, they manage to stop the conspiracy at the last moment. The entire conspiracy group, with the exception of the illustrious Number I, has been either killed or captured. Walter Sheridan is elected President, and Kim Rowland remains missing for reasons unknown. At the end of the story, XIII believes he has found his old identity as Jason Fly and is prepared to continue his life normally, even if his memories have not yet returned.

==Volumes 6-8==
In the following volumes, XIII takes up the investigation about his past. Volumes six and seven bring XIII to Greenfalls, a snowy town in the [[Rocky Mountains]], where the story revolves around the fate of his father in the [[McCarthyism|McCarthian]] 1950s. XIII learns that his father, Jonathan Fly, was murdered by the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapter, after they found out Fly's real identity was Jonathan MacLane, a "red" [[journalist]] who had to flee after suffering under McCarthy's witch hunt. The Mongoose still tracks XIII with the blessing of Jonathan MacLane's assassins, but XIII evades the manhunt, gets justice for the murder of his father and manages to arrest the Mongoose, who reveals that he was on Number I's boat when he shot the bullet that made XIII amnesic, but divulges no further information about Number I. The story ends with XIII finally finding his true identity as Jason MacLane.

In volume eight, XIII is approached by President Sheridan to become a special agent, and he is charged with finding Number I. The Mongoose escapes from custody. XIII tracks down Kim Rowland, guessing that she stayed in hiding because she knows Number I's identity. He discovers that one of the boats close to the spot where he was found amnesic is Walter Sheridan's yacht. Meanwhile, Jones investigates further and discovers that Kim Rowland had a love affair with Sheridan and had a child with him. After passing on this information to XIII, they become convinced that Wally Sheridan was, in fact, Number I and that he used the conspiracy of the XX to have his brother killed and later had the conspiracy exposed so he himself could become President. Walter Sheridan had the child kidnapped to force Kim to marry Steve Rowland, to betray Jason Fly/MacLane when Heideger's plan threatened to expose him as Number I, and have him lured onto his yacht where XIII was shot by the Mongoose. After trying to release Kim Rowland from an island where they believe she is sequestered, XIII and Jones, along with Kim, are caught by the Mongoose, who sinks Sheridan's yacht with an explosive. XIII only manages to rescue Jones, and Kim Rowland is presumed dead.

XIII finally faces Walter Sheridan, who has been exposed as Number I. XIII has no evidence or witness against him, however. Sheridan does not assassinate XIII, to avoid a new investigation that might expose him, and XIII and Jones leave the country.

==Volumes 9-13==

In the following volumes, the action takes place in and around Costa Verde, a small fictional nation in [[Central America]] where XIII is led to believe he once led a [[revolution]] under the identity of "El Cascador", although El Cascador is supposedly dead. XIII gets involved with revolutionary Maria de los Santos, who claims to have been his wife. In the 10th volume, after freeing her from a prison from which she was awaiting execution, she confirms that he is her husband.

During the revolution, XIII meets an [[Irish people|Irish]]-American expat, Sean Mullway, who claims to be XIII's real father and confirms that XIII is Jason MacLane. The history of XIII's Irish descent is revealed, and XIII learns that his mother was the sister of NSA director Giordino, who accidentally murdered her. The Giordinos are revealed to be a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family. At the end of the volume, XIII is offered amnesty by the American [[ambassador]], who explains that XIII's help is needed; Carrington has apparently gone insane.

In volume twelve, the corrupt American President Sheridan is kidnapped by General Carrington, who learns that Sheridan ordered his daughter Kim's death. Carrington and Amos have XIII and Jones capture the Mongoose to get further evidence against Sheridan. In a televised "trial", Sheridan is revealed to the American public as the conspirator, with XIII and the Mongoose testifying. In the aftermath of the event, Sheridan kills the Mongoose, and the NSA director Giordino accidentally kills Sheridan.

Volume thirteen, ''The XIII Mystery: The Investigation'', is a special issue, where two journalists retrace the first twelve issues, clarifying and expanding the storyline.

==Volumes 14-20==
While in exile in Costa Verde, XIII and his father, Mullway, attempt to find a treasure hidden by their ancestors somewhere in [[Mexico]]. Giordino, meanwhile, fabricates evidence claiming that XIII is Seamus O'Neill, an IRA operative who trained under [[Fidel Castro]]. As O'Neill, XIII is wanted by the USA, but he again manages to escape. He also survives an assassination attempt by Irina Svetlanova, who has taken over the Mongoose's operation. After many setbacks, the treasure is found and then lost again. Meanwhile, Giordino is removed from duty by the new President, who has received evidence from XIII and Mullway revealing that Giordino is not only connected to the Mafia but also that he killed Walter Sheridan.

Volumes eighteen and nineteen are the last written by Van Hamme. Volume eighteen, ''The Irish Version'', was drawn by [[Jean Giraud]], otherwise known as [[Mœbius]].&lt;ref name="L'Express"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://livres.lexpress.fr/enbref/default.asp/idR=2 |title=Bienvenue sur L'Express Livres |date=23 December 2003 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223133443/http://livres.lexpress.fr/enbref/default.asp/idR%3D2 |archivedate=2003-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It features as a story within the story, and it is referred to as part of the plot along with ''The XIII Mystery'' in volume nineteen ''The Last Round''. This is the prequel to the initial story arc, and it resolves all mysteries surrounding XIII's identity.

XIII has learned his identity, but his memories still have not returned. He seeks medical treatment to uncover them in volume twenty, but ''Mayflower Day'', a secret organization, schemes to keep XIII from unblocking his memory, because of yet another secret in his past.

==Popularity==
''XIII'' was released in 1984 as a serial in the popular ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine, and it was popular among Spirou readers. The first three episodes were released as a single [[hardcover]] volume by [[Dargaud]] the same year. This continued for later issues, and, by the time of the eighth issue, ''Thirteen to One'', sales of the hardcover had reached 140,000 copies. Promotion for the series included a special draw by the French national lottery in 2000 with 1,500,000 tickets and a €13,000 grand prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.world-lotteries.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=809:french-lottery-launches-new-instant-themed-on-comic-book&amp;Itemid=100311&amp;lang=en|title = French lottery launches new instant themed on comic book|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yoomurjak’s Ring''''' is an FMV ([[Full motion video based game]]) point-and-click [[adventure game]] by Private Moon Studios, designed by Hungarian game designer and musician [[Pierrot (Tamás Z. Marosi)]] in 2005.  The original release of the game was in Hungary in October 2006. The English subtitled version was first released by digital download in April 2009 by Lezard Interactive. The game became available for iPhone and iPad in 2015.

An important objective of the game is to introduce the baroque Hungarian town of Eger through a first-person experience provided by nearly 800 panoramic photographs and film footage fit for an entire movie.&lt;ref&gt;http://gamedev.privatemoon.com/en/fomenu1/jumurdzsak-gyuruje-pc-eredeti&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has a sequel titled MIAZMA or the Devil's Stone (''MIAZMA avagy az ördög köve'', released on DVD in Hungarian in 2015).&lt;ref&gt;http://miazma.privatemoon.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

Yoomurjak's Ring is a [[point-and-click]] adventure game with a simple interface.  It is a mixture of third-person movie scenes and first-person navigation and interaction. The player can pan around in each node in 360 degrees, in any direction.

The game inherited its engine from Private Moon’s [[AGON]] series, with some enhancements.  It features an Inventory for collecting items that will be used later. All dialogs are logged in a separate notebook for reference. This is useful as dialogs are not repeated.

As an adventure game, the player’s first challenge is to figure out what to do next. Most of the clues are given in the dialogs and narrations, some in documents.

The voice is the original Hungarian. The localized version is subtitled (English).

== The plot ==

Jonathan Hunt is a young American journalist.  He decides to visit his mother's birthplace in [[Hungary]] and the picturesque town of [[Eger]] because he has read about it in an old Hungarian novel. But he also has another reason to go there.

This book was one of his favorite childhood readings,  titled ‘[[Eclipse of the Crescent Moon]]’,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magyarulbabelben.net/index.php?page=work&amp;interfaceLang=en&amp;literatureLang=hu&amp;translationLang=all&amp;auth_id=589&amp;work_id=2347&amp;tran_id=3464&amp;tr_id=0&amp;tran_lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; written by a Hungarian author [[Géza Gárdonyi]] who also lived in Eger. This is a real novel about the heroic past of Eger in the middle of the 16th century when the town was one of the ultimate strongholds against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces advancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egrivar.hu/en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828040856/http://egrivar.hu/en/ |archivedate=August 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Jonathan received that book from his great-grandfather he found  two letters in it from a strange Hungarian scientist named Ábray, dated back in 1898. This man claimed to have discoveries about no less than travelling in time.

Upon arriving in Eger, Jonathan wants to find the descendants of this scientist.  Juli, the assistant of the tourist office gives him a number of hints and an old man also seems to have some promising information. Jonathan learns about a family legend and the most peculiar disappearance of an apprentice who once worked for the scientist himself.

The legend is about the same old book.  The old man believes that the author modeled Yoomurjak, the Turkish character in the book, on his grandfather, who was actually the disappeared apprentice. The gentleman claims that in that period Ábray was working on devising a time machine and due to a doomed journey in time his aide remained in the 16th century. Jonathan, a realistic man, almost laughs at the theory, but the sudden death of the old man awakens his curiosity.  In a note left behind the old man entrusts Jonathan with accomplishing his unfinished research.

The game covers the events of five days:

* Day 1 (Eger, the town of legends)
* Day 2 (Proofs of the first time traveler)
* Day 3 (Yoomurjak’s messages)
* Day 4 (On the track of the ring)
* Day 5 (The power of the ring)

== Characters ==

'''Jonathan Hunt:'''
As to his identity in the game, he is the great-grandson of Professor Samuel Hunt, the protagonist of Private Moon’s adventure game series AGON. His mother was born in Hungary and taught Jonathan the culture and the language of her home country. After breaking up with his girlfriend Allison, Jonathan aims to start an entirely new life in the peaceful town of Eger. But it turns out differently.

'''Yoomurjak:'''
Yoomurjak (originally Jumurdzsák) is a (negative) hero of the novel, a fictitious character.  In the novel, he was a soldier of the Ottoman army. Yoomurjak had an amulet: a ring that he wore to protect him from danger. Once, when he was captured he decided to buy his freedom against this ring. Later he tried to get it back but to no avail. The game uses the motive of this very ring, assuming it was found and used for purposes you have to unfold in the game.

== Features ==

'''Over 30 locations:'''
The fort, a number of museums, the town hall, the historic library, the Lyceum, the observatory, a wine cellar, an antique shop, the [[Eger minaret]] from the Turkish period, the immense basilica and many other locations are to be explored.

'''Professional actors:'''
All these roles are played by professional Hungarian actors. The main characters are played by prominent Hungarian celebrities: [[László Görög (actor)|László Görög]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331222/&lt;/ref&gt; [[György Bárdy]] and in the gangster’s role a popular rapper [[Ganxsta Zolee]].

'''Panoramic views:'''
The first-person view control and the large number of panoramic pictures provide a real-life feeling of walking around the streets of Eger and in the interiors. Most of the panoramic pictures are not static; the loop movements of the characters and extras make the exploration of the locations even more realistic.

'''More than 1.5 hours of footage:'''
The film footage is presented to the gamers in many small fragments. The movie scenes and dialogues, starting from half a minute to nearly 10-minute long, blend in seamlessly into the realistic environment created by panoramic pictures.

'''Special sound recordings:'''
The atmospheric background noises were recorded in the original locations, just like most of the dialogues. Besides the mostly electronically scored mood-enhancing tracks, music also has a special role in the riddles of the game.

== Locations ==

A few of the historic locations in the game:

'''[[Eger]]:'''
Eger is a city in northern Hungary, with a population of about 56.000. The town is a major touristic destination of the country.  It is best known for its castle, thermal baths, historic buildings (including the northernmost Turkish minaret), and its red and white wines.

'''Senator Ház:'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senatorhaz.hu/en.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The small hotel Jonathan uses (room No. 15) is one of Eger’s oldest baroque buildings.  It was built from the actual stones of the castle’s outside walls some 300 years ago. One of its owners was a Senator, hence the name Senator Ház (the house of the senator).

'''[[Lyceum]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;http://hungarystartshere.com/Lyceum-Karoly-Eszterhazy-College-foiskola-Eger&lt;/ref&gt;
The Lyceum was built for the purpose of a university. Today, a college operates in the building and it also houses several significant collections. The especially beautiful Archdiocesan Library was opened in 1793 with 20,000 volumes – currently, it houses nearly 150,000 volumes. The observatory and the Camera Obscura (a large periscope) was installed 1776, equipped with the most modern apparatuses of the time, based on the design of astronomer Maximilian (Miksa) Hell.

'''[[Minaret]]:'''
Eger was part of the Ottoman Empire for 91 years (1596–1687). During this time, numerous Turkish buildings were erected in the city, among them a mosque with this minaret. The mosque has not survived the centuries but the minaret, the northernmost one in Europe, is still in perfect condition. Jonathan has to climb 97 steps to reach the balcony.

'''The Gárdonyi House:'''
[[Géza Gárdonyi]] is one of the best known writers in Hungary. Between 1897 and 1922, he lived in this house,and here wrote many of his works, including one of his
most beautiful historical novels, Stars of Eger. Gárdonyi owned nearly ten-thousand books. Every piece of his furniture has remained in its original place, as shown in the game. He often took notes in cryptography which are displayed in the glass cabinets.

'''The Castle of Eger:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egrivar.hu/en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828040856/http://egrivar.hu/en/ |archivedate=August 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This large medieval fortress ranks among the most visited attractions in the country. The castle's defenders are said to have numbered fewer than 2,000, including women and children when they successfully held off a Turkish army of 80,000 soldiers in 1552 (the [[Siege of Eger (1552)|Siege of Eger]]). Since then, the castle has been a symbol of patriotic integrity and resistance.

'''The Turkish Bath:''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egertermal.hu/en/torokfurdo.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119083046/http://www.egertermal.hu/en/torokfurdo.php |archivedate=January 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The predecessor of the Turkish Bath,  professor Cifra’s favorite place, was built in the early 17th century when the town was under Turkish rule. The bath was to serve the purpose of ritual bathing but the water's beneficial effects on health soon became evident. The curative effect of the water is attributed to its radon content.

== The background ==

Private Moon Studios was given the opportunity to create Yoomurjak’s Ring by winning a competition. The municipality of Eger was looking for alternative ideas for promoting their town in an unconventional way, making also use of Gárdonyi’s popular novel (The Eclipse of the Crescent Moon) as both the author and the book are strongly related to the town.

'''Zodiac Entertainment''' was an American entertainment company that specialized in the production and distribution of [[animated cartoons]]. The company was founded in 1989 by [[Central Independent Television]], a British media company that was aiming to establish a television production company in the United States. Two veterans of the animation industry, Brian Lacey and [[Peter Keefe]] helped establish and run the firm. The company's animation studio aimed to produce original television series that could easily be translated and broadcast around the world. To this end, its programs avoided overt Americanisms and references to U.S.-specific culture.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Despite finding ratings success and notoriety with its first two animated series, the [[environmentalism]]-themed ''[[Widget (TV series)|Widget]]'' and the comedic ''[[Mr. Bogus]]'', the company struggled to compete for timeslots and advertising money with larger companies. Its third and final original series was ''[[Twinkle, the Dream Being]]'', a Korean-American Co-production originally created to promote the [[Taejŏn Expo '93|1993 Taejŏn Expo]]. In 1994, after its parent company was bought, Zodiac ceased producing original programming and announced that it would function exclusively as a distributor of television shows.

==History==
The company had its roots in British-based media company Central Independent Television. In 1987, company officials went to the United States with the aim of purchasing a television production company. The company did not find what it was looking for and instead founded its own company, Zodiac Entertainment. Brian Lacey and [[Peter Keefe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/25737|title=In Memoriam: Peter Keefe |accessdate=August 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603233608/http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/25737 |archivedate=June 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; two veterans of the animation industry helped form that company and former Central Independent executive Kevin Morrison was placed as the company's managing director. Keefe served as director of production and creative development, while Lacey headed the company's marketing efforts.&lt;ref name=Apodaca /&gt;

Over the first three years of Zodiac's existence, Central Independent spent $26 million on the company. By 1992, the company had fifteen employees, including five in [[New York City]], where its marketing department was headquartered. Its animation production was done in [[South Korea]] by [[Sei Young Animation]]. Although one report claimed that the company would begin production on an outer space-based teen [[soap opera]],&lt;ref name=LADN&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GGdIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_wYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4307,4711463&amp;dq=zodiac-entertainment&amp;hl=en|title=Soaps for Teen-agers?|date=November 13, 1989|work=Los Angeles Daily News|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company's first television production was ''[[Widget (TV series)|Widget]]'', an [[environmentalism]]-themed animated series starring a shapeshifting purple alien who saves the earth from evil threats to the environment. The show started out being shown in syndication on weekends before being expanded to five days a week, eventually reaching 80% of the U.S. television market. In keeping with the company's aim of creating programs that could easily be translated and broadcast in other countries, the program was also shown in 90 countries around the world.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/07/business/making-a-difference-catching-on-in-cartoons.html|title=MAKING A DIFFERENCE; Catching On In Cartoons|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=June 7, 2012|accessdate=September 14, 2012|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Apodaca&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-17/business/fi-765_1_zodiac-entertainment|title=Drawing a Niche in Cartoons : Television: After pouring $26 million into Zodiac Entertainment, a British broadcasting concern now has two series on the air.|first=Patrice|last=Apodaca|publisher=LA Times|date=November 17, 1992|accessdate=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also recognized as recommended viewing for children by the [[National Education Association]].&lt;ref name=Heller /&gt;

The company's second production, ''[[Mr. Bogus]]'' was based on a [[Belgian]] character. It became the highest-rated weekly syndicated children's show in the U.S. during May 1992's [[sweeps week]]. Despite having early success with its first two series and a projected revenue of $10 million in 1992, Zodiac had yet to turn a profit.&lt;ref name=Apodaca /&gt;

Zodiac then introduced a third series, ''[[Twinkle, the Dream Being]]'', which would turn out to be the last animated series the company would produce. By 1994, Central Independent Television had pumped a total of $35 million into the company. That year, Central Independent was acquired by [[Carlton Communications]] and shortly after, Zodiac announced that it would leave the television production business. Instead, Zodiac would continue as a distributor of its existing properties and other productions that it might acquire. The company cited difficulty competing for timeslots and advertising money with larger studios in the same business, such as [[Disney]] and [[Warner Bros.]] as a reason for exiting the industry. Some industry observers remarked that the studio could have done well by producing series for other firms such as toy companies rather than developing its own properties. However, Zodiac president Kevin Morrison rejected the notion as running contrary to the company's philosophy of developing quality original programming.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;{{cite news|title=Animation Company No Longer in 'Toons It will continue as a distributor|last=Heller|first=Matthew|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-08/business/fi-20593_1_zodiac-entertainment|date=February 8, 1994|accessdate=September 19, 2012|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
