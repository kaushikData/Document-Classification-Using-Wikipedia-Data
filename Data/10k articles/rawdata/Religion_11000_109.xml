The ancient Greek word ''aithôn'' means "burning", "blazing" or "shining." Less strictly, it can denote the colour red-brown, or "tawny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%232363 |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |date=1940 |website=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Clarendon Press |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is an epithet sometimes applied to animals such as horses at Hom. ''Il''. 2.839 ; oxen at ''Od''.18.372; and an eagle at ''Il''. 15.690 (cf. [[Hyginus]]' calling the eagle that tormented [[Prometheus]] an ''aethonem aquilam'' at ''Fabulae'' 31.5.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost02/Hyginus/hyg_fabu.html |title=Hygini genealogiis, volgo fabulae |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Bibliotheca Augustana |publisher= |accessdate=5 July 2013 |language= Latin |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eagle who tormented Prometheus, Aethon, was the child of the [[monster]]s [[Typhon (mythology)|Typhon]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Ethon]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, ''aithôn'' may be written '''Aethon''', '''Aithon''' or '''Ethon'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Harris |first1= John |last2= Todd |first2= mark | date= 2005|title= My Monster Notebook |url= http://shop.getty.edu/products/my-monster-notebook-978-1606060506|location= |publisher= Getty Publications |isbn= 978-1-60606-050-6|accessdate= 12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] there are a number of characters known as '''Aethon'''. Most are horses, variously belonging to:

* [[Helios]] ([[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 2.153)
* [[Ares]] ([[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''Posthomerica'' 8.239)
* [[Hector]] ([[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' 8.184)
* [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]] ([[Vergil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' 11.89)

The name is twice applied to humans. In ''[[Odyssey]]'' 19.183, it is the pseudonym a disguised [[Odysseus]] assumes during his interview with [[Penelope]] upon his return to [[Ithaca]]. According to fr. 43a.5 of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'', [[Erysichthon of Thessaly]] was also known as Aethon due to the "burning" hunger (''aithôn limos'') he was made to endure by [[Demeter]] (cf. [[Callimachus]]' ''Hymn to Demeter'' 6.65ff.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Heros/Erysikhthon.html |title=Erysikhthon |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Theoi Greek Mythology |publisher= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaykh '''Khwaja Sirajuddin''' or '''Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind''' , was a 14th-century [[Bengal]]i [[Sufi]] saint of the [[Chishti]] mystic tradition, disciple of [[Nizamuddin Auliya]]. His shrine in [[Gauḍa (city)|Gaur]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]], attracts hundreds of thousands of devotees every year.&lt;ref name=bharat&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaur|url=http://www.bharatonline.com/west-bengal/travel/kolkata/excursions/gaur.html|publisher=bharatonline.com|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akhi Siraj earned the title of Āainae-Hind, translating to "Mirror of India", from [[Nizāmuddīn Auliyā]](1238 – 3 April 1325), a legendary Sufi saint of the Chishti Order in the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. As one of the first disciples of Nizāmuddīn Auliyā, he spent long years with him.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

His successor [[Alaul Haq Pandavi]] is credited with the rise to prominence of the Chishti order in Bengal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11279">'''Alan F. Segal''' (August 2, 1945 – February 13, 2011) was a scholar of ancient religions, specializing in Judaism's relationship to Christianity. Segal was a distinguished scholar, author, and speaker, self-described as a "believing Jew and twentieth-century humanist."&lt;ref name="PaulConvert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Segal|first=Alan|title=Paul the Convert: The Apostolate and Apostasy of Paul the Convert|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=Hew Haven|year=1990|isbn=9780300045277|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}} Segal was one of the first modern scholars to write extensively on the influences of Judaism (including [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple]] Rabbinic texts, [[Merkabah mysticism]], and [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish apocalypticism]]) on [[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Damascus]].

Segal was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. He attended [[Amherst College]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], 1967), [[Brandeis University]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]], 1969), [[Hebrew Union College|Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]] (Bachelor of Hebrew Letters, 1971), and [[Yale University]] (M.A., 1971; [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil.]], 1973; and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], 1975). At the time of his retirement, Segal was Professor Emeritus of Religion and Ingeborg Rennert Professor Emeritus of Judaic Studies at [[Barnard College]] and held a concurrent appointment as Adjunct Professor of Scripture at Union Theological Seminary. He had also taught at Princeton University and the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Alan Fr. Segal Remembered|url=http://barnard.edu/headlines/professor-alan-f-segal-remembered|website=Barnard College|publisher=Faculty}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Segal was an expert in the field of history and religious traditions of Judaism and Christianity of the Roman period, and on the Semitic languages in use in Israel in that period. His scholarly reputation commenced with his landmark book, ''Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports About Christianity and Gnosticism'' (1977), in which he explored early references in rabbinic texts that he proposed were directed against beliefs of Jewish Christians and gnostics. His 1986 book, ''Rebecca's Children'', was a sensitive study showing that rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity were sibling developments from the parent biblical tradition. His award-winning book, ''Paul the Convert'' (1990) was Editor's Choice and main selection of the History Book Club's summer 1990 list, and a selection of the Book of the Month Club. The 368 page text is a collection of studies that interprets Paul within the context of Jewish mysticism and history, providing unique depth and insight for Biblical exegetes and Jewish historians. His last book, ''Life After Death: A History of the Afterlife in Western Religion'' (2004) was a massive study of beliefs spanning from ancient near-eastern civilizations to the present and across various religious traditions. Life After Death is "considered one of the definitive treatments of that weighty subject — and was weighty in its own right, at 731 pages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levin|first1=Jay|title=Religious scholar Alan F. Segal, 65, of Ho-Ho-Kus|url=http://www.northjersey.com/obituaries/religious-scholar-alan-f-segal-65-of-ho-ho-kus-1.254299|website=northjersey.com/obituaries|publisher=The Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a selection of the History Book Club, the Book of the Month Club, and the Behaviorial Science Book Club. It also featured on the Leonard Lopate Show, Talk of the Nation, and was the cover story of the Globe and Mail Book Review Supplement (Toronto). In addition, he wrote numbers articles and chapters in scholarly books.

Segal gave conference presentations and lectures internationally. He was a founding member of the Society of Biblical Literature program unit on Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism, and the SBL program unit on Divine Mediators in Antiquity. In 1988, he was the first Jewish member of the Society for New Testament Studies to address the society. He was elected a member of the American Society for the Study of Religion and the first American living outside Canada to be elected President of the Canadian Society for Biblical Studies.

Until Segal's book ''Paul the Convert'' was published in 1990, most modern Biblical scholars failed to take into account the Jewishness of Paul and the vast majority of Jewish historians ignored Paul altogether because of his perceived anti-Semitic writing.&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|xi}} Segal argues in ''Paul the Convert'' that despite Paul's polemical rhetoric, the Jewish community must nevertheless consider the historical value of Paul's epistles because of the insights he provides into first century Hellenisic Judaism. 

Segal's exegetical concern is with the Jewish context of Paul's religious struggle following his conversion. He reads Paul's epistles in light of the social sciences, borrowing from modern sociological and psychological studies (especially those pertaining to conversion). He also examines Paul through the lens of Jewish Merkabah mysticism and the Rabbinic tradition – a pioneering method of study of the New Testament. Segal argues that in order to understand Paul thoroughly, one must understand the circumstances of his time and culture. Segal draws similarities between things like Paul's description of his conversion on the road to Damascus (2 Cor. 12:1-9) and Ezekiel and Enoch's heavenly ascent.&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|39–47}} He argues that Paul's emphasis on the Glory of God (Kavod) in these stories is characteristic of the Merkabah mystic tradition. The type of exegesis that Segal engages in provides a rare insight into first century thinking.

Segal understands Paul as part of Jewish history; he interprets Paul's conversion as an apostasy and a break from Judaism because of his insistence on transformation in Christ,&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|117}} although Paul never perceived his actions as outside the Jewish community (Acts 21:24). Paul, Segal argues, never felt that he had left Judaism, "He began as a Pharisee and became a convert from Pharisaism. He spent the rest of his life trying to express what he converted to. He never gave it a single name."&lt;ref name="PaulConvert" /&gt;{{rp|283}} Paul's conversion experience, Segal argues, forced him to re-evaluate his faith and understanding of the Torah; he was made to reconcile his revelation with his Pharasaism.

Segal was a frequent media commentator on St. Paul&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/143/story_14384_1.html Do the Gospels Correct Paul's Letters? By Alan F.

An '''altar server''' is a [[laity|lay]] assistant to a member of the [[clergy]] during a [[Christian liturgy]]. An altar server attends to supporting tasks at the [[altar]] such as fetching and carrying, ringing the [[altar bell]], among other things. A young male altar server is commonly called an '''altar boy''', whereas a young female altar server is commonly called an '''altar girl'''.

[[File:Misdienaar.jpg|thumb|50 altar servers, during a celebration of a 50-year-old church, [[Gennep]], [[Netherlands]], September 2004.]]
The role of altar server can perhaps be traced back to the third century: [[Pope Benedict XVI]] spoke of Saint [[Tarcisius]] as "presumably an acolyte, that is, an altar server".&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20100804.html Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience, 4 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; While the function is commonly associated with children, the function can be and is carried out by people of any age or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leonard of Port Maurice |date=1970 |title=The Hidden Treasure: Holy Mass |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RjsqCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66&amp;dq=%22hidden+treasure%22+%22thomas+more%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2toKs7uvbAhVlOMAKHdx9AugQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hidden%20treasure%22%20%22thomas%20more%22&amp;f=false |publisher=TAN Books |isbn=9781618905314 |author-link=Leonard of Port Maurice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice, reaffirmed by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1775,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Ben14/b14allat.htm Pope Benedict XIV, Encyclical ''Allatae sunt'']&lt;/ref&gt; of excluding women from serving the priest at the celebration of Mass, has now been generally abandoned. In 1994, the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] clarified that, in line with the 1983 revision of the [[Code of Canon Law]], service at the altar is to be considered one of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions (such as those of [[reader (liturgy)|lector]] and [[cantor]]) that, according to canon 230 §2 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PV.HTM Code of Canon Law]&lt;/ref&gt; lay people, male or female, may perform. At the same time the Congregation pointed out that this canon of the Code of Canon Law is only permissive and does not oblige to admit [[female altar servers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdwcomm.htm Vatican Communication on Female Altar Servers]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the only [[United States]] [[diocese]] that excluded women from service at the altar was that of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lincoln|Lincoln, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2006-03-22-altar-girls_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Neb. diocese is lone U.S. holdout on allowing altar girls|work=usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even where the bishop does not limit the permission granted by general canon law, the priest in charge of a church is not obliged to avail of it. [[Traditionalist Catholic]] groups such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter|FSSP]] and the [[Institute of Christ the King]] and some individual priests do not.

The term "[[acolyte]]" is sometimes applied to altar servers, but in a more precise sense it means an "instituted acolyte", someone who has received the [[Minister (Catholic Church)#Instituted ministries|instituted ministry]] of that name, usually reserved for those who are to be promoted to the permanent or transitory [[diaconate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book |last1=Laughlin |first1=Corinna |last2=Riley |first2=Kenneth A. |last3=Turner |first3=Paul |date=2014 |title=Guide for Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIOgBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22altar+server%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo4tz65evbAhXFJcAKHZFLBkM4ChDoAQhKMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22altar%20server%22&amp;f=false |publisher=LiturgyTrainingPublications |page=57 |isbn=9781616711283}}&lt;/ref&gt; These must receive the ministry of acolyte, which formerly was classified as a [[minor order]], at least six months before being ordained as deacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3R.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|work=vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'' the term "acolyte" is treated as distinct from the term "server".&lt;ref&gt;For instance in GIRM 339&lt;/ref&gt;

If a priest celebrates Mass at which a congregation does not assist, he should not do so without a server except out of serious necessity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', 254; cf. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P38.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 906].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duties at Mass ===
[[File:Priest_or_seminarian_with_thurible.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A [[thurifer]]]]
In the absence of instituted [[acolyte]]s, some of their functions at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] may be carried out by altar servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf|format=PDF|title=General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 100|website=liturgyoffice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Servers hold liturgical books for the priest when he is not at the altar and is proclaiming the presidential prayers with outstretched hands. They bring and hold such things as books, thuribles, the [[lavabo]] water and towel, vessels to hold the consecrated bread, and microphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/CTM.pdf|format=PDF|title=Catholic Bishops' Conference of England &amp; Wales, ''Celebrating the Mass: A Pastoral Introduction'' (Catholic Truth Society 2005), p. 19|website=liturgyoffice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:IndonesianAltarBoy.jpg|thumb|left|Boy tasked with ringing bells at Mass in an Indonesian church.]]
* Entrance: The entrance procession is led by a [[thurifer]] with burning incense (if incense is used at the Mass) and a [[crucifer|cross-bearer]] carrying a [[processional cross]], who is flanked on either side by another server bearing a lighted [[candle]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', no. 120&lt;/ref&gt;
* Proclamation of the Gospel: If incense is used, a server presents to the priest at the [[Alleluia]] or other pre-Gospel chant the thurible and the incense that he puts in the thurible and blesses,&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and servers, who may carry the thurible and lighted candles, precede to the [[ambo (liturgy)|ambo]] the deacon or priest who there proclaims the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', nos. 133, 175&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preparation of the Gifts: One or more servers assist in arranging on the altar the corporal, the purificator(s), the chalice(s), the pall(s), and the Missal, leaving it to the deacon to take care of the sacred vessels.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', nos. 139, 178&lt;/ref&gt; (At a concelebrated Mass without participation by a deacon, a concelebrating priest carries out the functions assigned to the deacon.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', no. 208&lt;/ref&gt; If, as is appropriate, the bread and wine for the Mass are presented by the faithful, servers assist the priest or deacon who receives these and perhaps other gifts and carry the bread and wine to the priest, placing other gifts in a place distinct from the altar.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', nos. 73, 140&lt;/ref&gt; They present the [[cruet]]s of wine and water for the priest or deacon to pour some into the chalice.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', no. 142&lt;/ref&gt; If incense is used, a server presents the thurible and incense to the priest, who incenses the offerings, the cross and the altar, after which the deacon or a server incenses the priest and the people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', nos. 144, 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'' makes no reference to a separate incensing of concelebrants (cf. [https://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlitur256.htm Edward McNamara, "Incensing the Congregation"]).&lt;/ref&gt; When the priest then washes his hands standing at the side of the altar, a server pours the water over them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', no. 145&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consecration: An altar server rings a bell shortly before the consecration, generally at the [[epiclesis]] (when the priest extends his hands above the gifts). In accordance with local custom, a server also rings the bell when, after the consecrations of the bread and wine, the priest shows the Host and then the Chalice. If incense is used, a server incenses the consecrated host and the chalice while these are being shown to the people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', no. 150&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sign of Peace: The priest or deacon may give the sign of peace to servers, while remaining within the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', nos. 154, 181&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distribution of Holy Communion: In some places it is customary for servers to assist at the distribution of Holy Communion by holding a [[communion-plate]] for communicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holytrinityparish.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Holy-Trinity-Altar-Boy-Handbook-to-Print-9-8-09.pdf |title=''Altar Boy Handbook'' of Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Gainesville, Virginia (2009), p. 16 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it is to be held by communicants or by a server, a communion-plate is placed on the [[credence table]] before Mass.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', no. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html#_ftnref180 Instruction ''Redemptionis sacramentum'', 93]&lt;/ref&gt; Its use (held by the communicants) is prescribed when Holy Communion is given by [[intinction]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', no. 118&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recessional: The servers lead the priest and any other clergy as at the entrance procession, except that a server who acted as thurifer at the entrance now follows the cross-bearer.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 169&lt;/ref&gt;
* If a bishop celebrates Mass solemnly, two servers, wearing [[vimpa]]s, hold the [[mitre]] and the [[crosier]], and present them at the appropriate times.

===Vestments===
The vestment common to all ordained and instituted ministers of whatever rank is an [[alb]], which is to be tied at the waist with a [[cincture]] unless the alb is made to fit without cincture.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Acolytes, readers and other lay ministers (such as altar servers) may wear either an alb or other appropriate attire as determined by the local [[episcopal conference]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', 339&lt;/ref&gt; All who wear an alb should use a cincture and an [[amice]], unless the form of the alb makes these unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'', 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Servers often wear [[cassock]] and [[surplice]], with black and red being the most common colors for a server's cassock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur303.htm Edward McNamara "Colors of Cassocks and Altar Cloths"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byzantine Rite==
[[File:Me in church with bishop.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] bishop and priests during the [[Divine Liturgy]], with altar servers in front (note the crossed [[orarion|oraria]] the servers are wearing).]]

In the [[Byzantine Rite]], altar servers assist the higher clergy during services. They might carry the cross, candles or [[Flabellum|liturgical fans]] in [[Crucession|processions]] and [[Entrance (Liturgical)|entrances]]; maintain the [[thurible|censer]], ensuring it has enough live charcoal, loading it with [[incense]] and handing it to the priest or deacon when required; preparing the hot water (''[[Zeon (liturgy)|zeon]]'') in time for it to be added to the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] at the [[Divine Liturgy]]; prepare the [[antidoron]] for the people to receive after [[Holy Communion]]; and any other necessary tasks so that the priest need not be distracted during the service. An altar server is vested in the [[sticharion]] only.

In the [[early Church]], before someone could be a server he had to be [[Tonsure#Eastern Christianity|tonsured]]. Nowadays, in many places it is not necessary to be tonsured before one is allowed to serve (since the tonsure must be done by a bishop or higher-ranking priest). The rites of "Setting Aside a Taper-bearer" and "Tonsuring a [[Reader (liturgy)#Orthodoxy|Reader]]" have now been combined into one service. It is the custom in some traditions, such as the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] or [[Melkite]] Catholic, to allow tonsured altar servers to also vest in the [[orarion]], worn crossed over the back like that of a [[subdeacon]] but with the ends hanging parallel in front. Among the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russians]], however, the orarion is not usually worn by servers, but only by duly ordained subdeacons and deacons, with the exception that laymen who are blessed to perform some of the functions of subdeacons may sometimes be blessed to wear the orar.

Before vesting, the server must fold his sticharion and bring it to the priest for him to bless. The priest blesses and lays his hand on the folded sticharion. The server kisses the priest's hand and the Cross on the vestment, and then withdraws to vest. Any server who has not been tonsured must remove the sticharion when he receives [[Holy Communion]], because communicants receive the Mysteries according to their order within the Church (so tonsured clergy vest while laymen remove their vestments). Before divesting at the end of the service, the server must receive the priest's blessing.

The minimum age varies by local circumstance, but boys must be mature enough to carry out their duties without disrupting the sanctity of the altar. Although it is common in North America for boys to act as altar servers, in some places this practice is virtually unknown and these duties are always carried out by adult men. In other places where altar servers are normally boys, adult men will not vest if called upon to serve. In yet other places, boys are not permitted to serve in the Altar on reaching their teens on the grounds that the young man is no longer innocent enough to serve in the altar. &lt;!-- This last sounds like BS to me, but am preserving the information for reasons of AGF on the part of the editor who added it. I'd delete it as OR if this article were at all referenced. --&gt;

Altar servers, regardless of age, are subject to all the normal restrictions for those not of higher clerical position. Anyone who is bleeding, or has an open sore, is not permitted to enter the altar. They may not touch the altar table or anything on it under any circumstances, nor the [[prothesis (liturgy)#Architecture|prothesis]] without a blessing. They may not touch the sacred vessels, the chalice and [[paten|diskos]] (paten) at any time. They may not stand directly in front of the altar table or pass between the front of it and the [[iconostasis]], but must cross between the altar and the [[High Place]] if they need to move to the opposite side.

In general, women do not serve in the altar except in women's [[monastery|monasteries]]. In that case they do not receive the clerical tonsure (though they must be tonsured [[nun]]s), and do not vest in the sticharion, but wear their normal [[religious habit]] for attending services, and serve at a certain distance from the actual altar table. Normally, only older nuns may serve in the altar; but the [[Hegumen]]ia ([[Abbess]]) is permitted to enter even if she is younger. A few parishes have begun to use women as altar servers.

==Other churches==
{{Main|Acolyte}}
In many [[Anglican]] churches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acolyte|url=https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/acolyte|publisher=Episcopal Church|accessdate=28 October 2017|language=en|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lutheran]] churches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acolytes and deacons|url=http://augustanadc.org/acolytes-and-deacons/|website=augustanadc.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; all who serve in the above positions are called [[acolyte]]s.

In [[Anglo-Catholic]] and some [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Churches however, the vast majority of roles associated with an altar server are the same as those in the Catholic Church, and the same titles for each individual role are retained from Catholic tradition – mostly restored during the [[Oxford Movement]] in the 19th century.

The theme of '''education in the [[Bahá'í Faith]]''' is given emphasis. Its [[Bahá'í literature|literature]] gives a principle of universal and [[compulsory education]], which is identified as one of key principles alongside [[monotheism]] and the unity of humanity.

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith wrote:
:"Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom."
::Bahá'u'lláh, ''Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh'', p. 161. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-12.html#pg162]

The Bahá'í teachings focus on promoting a moral and spiritual education, in addition to the arts, trades, sciences and professions. The emphasis on education is a means for social and national improvement. Since all Bahá'ís have the duty to do work that is useful to humanity, Bahá'í education is meant to prepare Bahá'ís to perform such work.

==Purpose==
One purpose of universal compulsory education is implied in the Bahá'í [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|Short Obligatory Prayer]] which states that the God's primary reason for creating humanity is so that each of us would come to know and love Him. Clearly one purpose of education would be to facilitate this process. But religious education, however critical, should not lead to division and conflict. Bahá'u'lláh writes:

:"Schools must first train the children in the principles of religion, so that the Promise and the Threat recorded in the Books of God may prevent them from the things forbidden and adorn them with the mantle of the commandments; but this in such a measure that it may not injure the children by resulting in ignorant fanaticism and bigotry."
::Bahá'u'lláh, ''Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh'', p. 67. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-7.html#gr28]

This principle is most commonly applied by Bahá'ís in the form of social-welfare projects and children's classes. The emphasis on education as a means for social and national improvement is shown in the following quote by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son and appointed successor of Bahá'u'lláh:
:"The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion of education. It is inconceivable that any nation should achieve prosperity and success unless this paramount, this fundamental concern is carried forward. The principal reason for the decline and fall of peoples is ignorance. Today the mass of the people are uninformed even as to ordinary affairs, how much less do they grasp the core of the important problems and complex needs of the time."
::`Abdu'l-Bahá, ''The Secret of Divine Civilization'', p. 109. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SDC/sdc-6.html#gr16]

==Type of education==
The type of education that is written about in the Bahá'í writings does not point to one particular type or method of education.

===Moral and spiritual education===
The Bahá'í teachings focus on promoting a moral and spiritual education, in addition to the arts, trades, sciences and professions.

:"Training in morals and good conduct is far more important than book learning. A child that is cleanly, agreeable, of good character, well-behaved even though he be ignorant is preferable to a child that is rude, unwashed, ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply versed in all the sciences and arts. The reason for this is that the child who conducts himself well, even though he be ignorant, is of benefit to others, while an ill-natured, ill-behaved child is corrupted and harmful to others, even though he be learned. If, however, the child be trained to be both learned and good, the result is light upon light."
::`Abdu'l-Bahá, ''Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá'', Sec. 110, pp. 135-136. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAB/sab-111.html#gr2]

Children, and the requirement to give them a proper education, is particularly emphasized in many of the Bahá'í writings. Children's classes have become common-place in most Bahá'í communities, and were named by the [[Universal House of Justice]] in 2001 as one of the four core activities that Bahá'ís should focus on.

Bahá'í individuals have created the noted book ''The Family Virtues Guide'', which is dedicated to the spiritual education of children. Its multi-religious content has brought it enough popularity to sell over 100,000 copies and to win the authors an interview on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050829210459/http://www.virtuesproject.com/index.php]

===A useful trade or profession===
All Bahá'ís have the duty to do work that is useful to humanity. A major goal of Bahá'í education is therefore to prepare Bahá'ís to perform such work.

This is by no means the only goal (as the categories above and below indicate), or even necessarily the overriding one, but Bahá'ís are warned against courses of study which "begin and end in words":

:"The learned of the day must direct the people to acquire those branches of knowledge which are of use, that both the learned themselves and the generality of mankind may derive benefits therefrom. Such academic pursuits as begin and end in words alone have never been and will never be of any worth. The majority of Persia's learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of a philosophy the ultimate yield of which is nothing but words."
::Bahá'u'lláh, ''Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas'', p. 169. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-12.html#pg169]

===Literacy===
The seventh ''Ishráq'' of Bahá'u'lláh's ''Ishráqat'' stipulates as follows:

:"Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of reading and writing... " [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-9.html#fr24]

While there do exist a number of [[preliterate]] or non-literate cultures, Bahá'ís assume the spread of literacy to be one of the signs of an "ever-advancing civilization." For example, a priesthood is not needed in this era because the ability to read and write is no longer restricted to a professional class, with the masses reduced to auditors of their sacred texts.

===Languages===
{{main|Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language}}
Bahá'ís expect the world's governments to one day cooperate in selecting an international auxiliary language to be used in global communication. After this is done, that language, along with one's mother tongue will be taught in schools all over the world.

:"It is incumbent upon all nations... to convene a gathering and through joint consultation choose one language from among the varied existing languages, or create a new one, to be taught to the children in all the schools of the world."
::Bahá'u'lláh, ''Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh'', p. 165. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-12.html#pg166]

Although Bahá'u'lláh rued the necessity of spending many years learning multiple languages, when only one could be selected, various authoritative writings do assume foreign languages to be included among the "useful subjects" which Bahá'ís will probably study.

===Other subjects===
The Bahá'í Faith has not yet endeavored to describe an ideal school curriculum, though its writings assume the usefulness of a wide variety of subjects.

:"You have asked him [Shoghi Effendi] for detailed information concerning the Bahá'í educational programme: there is as yet no such thing as a Bahá'í curriculum, and there are no Bahá'í publications exclusively devoted to this subject, since the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá do not present a definite and detailed educational system, but simply offer certain basic principles and set forth a number of teaching ideals that should guide future Bahá'í educationalists in their efforts to formulate an adequate teaching curriculum which would be in full harmony with the spirit of the Bahá'í Teachings, and would thus meet the requirements and needs of the modern age.

:"These basic principles are available in the sacred writings of the Cause, and should be carefully studied, and gradually incorporated in various college and university programmes. But the task of formulating a system of education which would be officially recognized by the Cause, and enforced as such throughout the Bahá'í world is one which the present-day generation of believers cannot obviously undertake, and which has to be gradually accomplished by Bahá'í scholars and educationalists of the future."

::From a letter dated 7 June 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/BE/be-122.html#gr1]

Bahá'í writings variously allude to mathematics, science, technology, commerce, industry, the liberal arts, and religion as suitable subjects for inclusion in an educational curriculum.

==Pedagogical issues==
In education theory, in addition to what is taught, it is also important to note how education is taught. In addition to the traditional mode of education, other forms of education exist such as [[alternative education|alternative schools]], [[unschooling]], [[homeschooling]], [[Montessori]], and [[Waldorf education]]. The Bahá'í requirements for education do not necessarily reject any of these possibilities.

===Responsibility===
The father is attributed with the responsibility for every child's education and should he fail to execute his responsibility to educate his children he can be compelled and even lose his rights as father.  Mothers are acknowledged as the "first educators" of humanity, and their responsibility is equally confirmed. Beyond this, responsibility also falls to the community as a whole, as embodied in its Bahá'í institutions:

:"Among the sacred obligations devolving upon the [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]] is the promotion of learning, the establishing of schools and creation of the necessary academic equipment and facilities for every boy and girl."
::From a letter dated 8 June 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/BE/be-106.html#gr1]

In the unfortunate event that parents and/or their communities cannot educate all their children, Bahá'í law stipulates that girls are to be given priority over boys.

===Environmental factors===
`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote about school uniforms, cleanliness and courtesy:

:"As to the organization of the schools: If possible the children should all wear the same kind of clothing, even if the fabric is varied. It is preferable that the fabric as well should be uniform; if, however, this is not possible, there is no harm done. The more cleanly the pupils are, the better; they should be immaculate. The school must be located in a place where the air is delicate and pure. The children must be carefully trained to be most courteous and well-behaved. They must be constantly encouraged and made eager to gain all the summits of human accomplishment, so that from their earliest years they will be taught to have high aims, to conduct themselves well, to be chaste, pure, and undefiled, and will learn to be of powerful resolve and firm of purpose in all things. Let them not jest and trifle, but earnestly advance unto their goals, so that in every situation they will be found resolute and firm."
::`Abdu'l-Bahá, ''Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 135. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAB/sab-111.html#gr1]

==Bahá'í education in practice==
{{main|Bahá'í study circle}}
Among the four core activities that Bahá'ís are currently urged to focus on, supporting children's classes and engaging in a sequence of courses known as [[Bahá'í study circle|study circles]] has become part of the community life of Bahá'ís around the world.

===Ruhi sequence of courses===
The most common sequence is called '''Ruhi''' (meaning: of the spirit), which was originally developed in [[Colombia]] and currently consists of 7 courses, with the themes from the Bahá'í writings of prayer, education, history, and more.

The following sequence of courses is:

* Book 1: Reflections on the Life of the Spirit
* Book 2: Arising to Serve
* Book 3: Children's Classes, Grade 1
* Book 4: The Twin Manifestations
* Book 5: Children's Classes, Grade 2
* Book 6: Teaching the Cause
* Book 7: Walking Together on a Path of Service

Book 8 and 9 are in development and are slated for release into the community gradually, the topics to be covered are the Covenant and the Family, respectively.

===Core curriculum===
The United States has developed a set of curriculum for children's classes known as the '''core curriculum'''. &lt;!--need more detail--&gt;

===Fundamental verities===
Another sequence of courses uses for education of the Bahá'í teachings is called '''Fundamental Verities'''. This sequence was developed in the United States, and is not as common as the more widely used Ruhi sequence.

===Bahá'í House of Worship===
The [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] is an institution alluded to in the writings of the Bahá'í Faith. In its entirety, it represents a temple for worship, hospital, university, hospice, and other humanitarian and educational structures. It will serve as the city center for future Bahá'í societies.

===Social and economic development===
Some of the more mature and able Bahá'í communities around the world have taken on the task of Social and Economic Development (SED) projects. These can vary from place to place depending on the needs of different areas. Some examples include programs for the free education of migrant workers, the employment of the homeless, or the support of displaced refugees. Individuals have also worked to reform educational practices in society, such as Dr. Dwight W. Allen, a Bahá'í, who co-authored ''American Schools: The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge'' with [[William H. Cosby, Jr]] in 2000;&lt;ref name="dwight"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://education.odu.edu/eci/dir/vitae/dw_allen.shtml | title = Dr. Dwight W.

==Praise for teachers==
The Bahá'í writings give a high praise for teachers, and, in the case that no personal will has been written, provide that some of a person's inheritance goes to their teachers.

:"Having attained the stage of fulfilment and reached his maturity, man standeth in need of wealth, and such wealth as he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy in the estimation of men of wisdom, and especially in the eyes of servants who dedicate themselves to the education of the world and to the edification of its peoples. They are, in truth, cup-bearers of the life-giving water of knowledge and guides unto the ideal way. They direct the peoples of the world to the straight path and acquaint them with that which is conducive to human upliftment and exaltation. The straight path is the one which guideth man to the dayspring of perception and to the dawning-place of true understanding and leadeth him to that which will redound to glory, honour and greatness.
::Bahá'u'lláh, ''Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh'', p. 34. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-5.html#pg35]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7024">'''Buddhism''' in '''[[Ukraine]]''' has existed since the 19th and 20th century, after immigration from countries with Buddhist populations, mainly [[North Vietnam]] and [[Korea]] under Communist period. Although sources are not readily available, Buddhists are believed to constitute 0.1% of the total population in Ukraine.

==History==

Despite the fact that on a superficial level Buddhism was known in Ukraine long ago due to the regular contacts of the Ukrainian Cossacks with the [[Kalmyks]], who profess Buddhism, the interest in Buddhism in its philosophical and ethical aspects among the Ukrainian cultural and scientific intelligentsia arose not earlier than in the 19th century. Closer acquaintance with Buddhism was interrupted in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, when any interest in religious teachings different from [[Marxism-Leninism|Soviet ideology]] was persecuted. As a result, such interest could not be fully satisfied and, moreover, grow into certain organizations. Therefore, the first open systematic lectures on Buddhism, sermons and lessons on Buddhist studies, date back to 1989, when the political and ideological pressure of the Soviet system was considerably eased. At that time the first Buddhist teachings took place in Ukraine, and the first secular followers of Buddhism appeared, they took [[Refuge (Buddhism)|Buddhist refuge]] in the Three Jewels: Buddha, the Teaching (Dharma) and the Community (Sangha).

Ukraine’s first officially registered Buddhist community was set up in the village of [[Ol'hynka]], [[Volnovakha Raion]], [[Donetsk Oblast]] in 1991, and in 1993 Buddhist Center Lunh-zhonh-pa (which means “The Wardens of the Commandments” in the Tibetan language) was built there. This school conducts both lay and monastic activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Буддийский монастырь Шейчен-линг в Ольгинке|url = http://donbass.name/3025-buddiyskiy-monastyr.html|website = donbass.name|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Development==

Today Ukraine has nearly 100 Buddhist communities and groups, 38 of them are officially registered and enjoy the status of legal entity. The largest communities and groups belong to the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan tradition in Buddhism]], that is, the tantric tradition of '''[[Vajrayana]]''' (“Diamond Vehicle”). The most widespread among them are [[Karma Kagyu]] communities, the main branch of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Kagyu-pa School]]. They are united into the All-Ukraine Religious Center Ukrainian Association of Karma Kagyu Buddhists. In Ukraine, the religious studies of this center are intended for laypeople. Communities and groups of followers of this tradition are present in almost all regional centers of Ukraine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Diamond Way Buddhism in Ukraine|url = http://buddhism.org.ua/|website = buddhism.org.ua|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Drikung Kagyu]] center which was officially registered in Kyiv on 2006 in order to fulfill a joint aspiration of H.E. [[Garchen Rinpoche]] and his students. The Center is a part of global community of the [[Garchen Rinpoche|Garchen Rinpoche’s]] Centers. During the last ten years, [[Garchen Rinpoche]] visited Kyiv four times. Many [[Drikung Kagyu]] masters and teachers has visited the Center in the past years. Among them [[Garchen Rinpoche|H.E. Garchen Rinpoche]], Khenchen Rinpoche, Nubpa Rinpoche, Drupon Tsering Rinpoche, Drupon Yeshe Rinpoche, Drupon Tsering Rinpoche, Lama Dawa Zang, Drupon Yeshe Zangmo, Khenpo Samdrup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ukrainian Buddhist Center "Drikung Community Ratnashri"|url = http://ratnashri.org.ua/en/about-us/|website = ratnashri.org.ua|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nyingma]] school also has followers in Ukraine, in particular [[Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Дзонгсар Кхьенце Ринпоче посетит Украину и дарует учения в Киеве » Сохраним Тибет! {{!}} Тибет, Далай-лама, буддизм|url = http://savetibet.ru/2013/05/07/dzongsar_khyentse.html|website = savetibet.ru|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and current [[Patrul Rinpoche|Patrul Rinpochе]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Патрул Ринпоче дарует учение в Киеве » Сохраним Тибет! {{!}} Тибет, Далай-лама, буддизм|url = http://savetibet.ru/2013/11/02/patrul_rinpoche.html|website = savetibet.ru|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; visited Kiev.  Under the guidance of Gyetrul Jigme Rinpoche "Ripa" center was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Контакты|url = http://www.buddha.in.ua/index.php/kontakty|website = Buddha.in.ua|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International Dzogchen Community also have number of its followers and communities in Ukraine. It developed as a separate Buddhist School in the West in the late 20th century through the efforts of [[Namkhai Norbu|Chogyal Namkhai Norbu]], the Tibetan Lama in emigration. Like [[Karma Kagyu]], this school is oriented to lay Buddhists in Ukraine.

There is also four Shambala centers, an international organization founded by [[Chögyam Trungpa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Головна - Ukraine|url = http://shambhala.org.ua/|website = Ukraine|accessdate = 2016-01-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kiev there is [[Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling|Rangjung Yeshe]] center with followers all over Ukraine, this center conducts regular practices of [[Chokling Tersar]] Lineage. Lama Sonam Dorje visited Ukraine many times and give many teachings and practices instructions, and in 2012 [[Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche|Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche]] visited Kiev with public talk and empowerment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Визит Чокьи Ньима Ринпоче в Украину!|url = http://kievyogastudio.com/archive/vizit-choki-nima-rinpoche-v-ukrainu/|website = Киевская Йога Студия|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several times Dr. [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] visited Ukraine to give general Buddhist teachings and their application in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = мастера - Алекс Берзин|url = http://nvek.com.ua/events/557|website = nvek.com.ua|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides [[Tibetan Buddhism]] schools there are also [[Zen]] practitioners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Новини {{!}} Zazen International|url = http://www.zen-kaisen.org.ua/zen-news/|website = www.zen-kaisen.org.ua|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vipassana movement|Vipassana]] meditation followers As taught by [[S. N. Goenka|S.N.

'''Chekka''' is coastal town located in the South of North Lebanon. It is located north of Râs ach-Chaq’a’ and Herri beaches, or [[Theoprosopon]] of classical times and south of the ancient Phoenician port of [[Enfeh]] and the city of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. The origin of the word is believed to be Canaanite from the word Chikitta. Chikitta was mentioned Amarna letters in Egypt as a coastal town situated in the geographical area of modern Chekka. Until now there are no Canaanite archeological findings in Chekka backing this hypothesis. Chekka's modern history is clear. The high land in Chekka now known as Chekka Al-Atika was resettled around 300 years ago and the fertile valley of Chekka was cultivated in the intention of making Chekka a Maronite stronghold on the Lebanese coast. Many families moved from Mount Lebanon to Chekka at that time.

Chekka is rich in freshwater submarine springs.&lt;ref name="idrc.ca"&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-83263-201_060011-1-IDRC_ADM_INFO.html Projects in Lebanon: International Development Research Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213082148/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-83263-201_060011-1-IDRC_ADM_INFO.html |date=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American University of Beirut]]'s Faculty of Engineering investigated the potential of sustainable exploitation of the Chekka Bay submarine springs in 2000.&lt;ref name="idrc.ca"/&gt;

Chekka is known for ''Râs ach-Chaq’a’'', a white and green mountain touching the Mediterranean sea and its public and private sand beaches.

==Economy==

{{Haitian Vodou}}

'''Christian-Vodou''' relations have been marked by syncretism and conflicts, especially in [[Haiti]], but less so in [[Louisiana]] and elsewhere. The spiritual differences can be framed within the Old Testament story of Elijah and the prophet of Baal, where the former confronted and repudiated the practices of those who worshiped idols and practiced vodou.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Famine in the Promised Land|last=Smith|first=Paul|publisher=Morgan James Publishing|year=2005|isbn=0975857061|location=Newport News, VA|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian and Vodou conflicts==
The revolutionary [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] presumptively proclaimed himself head of the church in [[Haiti]] after the [[Haitian Revolution]]. He set forward to limit the [[jurisdiction]] of [[priests]] and to appoint men to vacant positions in local church communities. He himself had caused the [[assassination]] of a large number of the [[missionaries]] by failing to stop slaughter of the [[white (race)|white]] colonists. This caused a schism between the Haitian state and [[Holy See|Rome]], resulting in Rome's declining to send priests into the country. There were no priests to provide guidelines for the newly established Haitian state. As a consequence, the principles of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] and [[Catholicism]] were [[syncretism|merged]] and Catholicism (with its Vodou influences) was made the state's [[state religion|official religion]] under the leadership of [[Henri Christophe]].

Another cause of the syncretic connection between Catholicism and Vodou was the state's ordination of Haitian men to the priesthood – a step that the [[Holy See|Vatican]] would not recognize as legitimate. However, mixture of both religions shaped the way of how Haitians practice their ritual. The Haitians were going to church, but they continued to adhere to Vodou, using the rituals of the church to mask the practices of their native traditions.&lt;ref&gt;The Faces of the Gods 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth A, Rara! Vodou, power, and performance in Haiti and its diaspora : Berkeley University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several killings in the past of Christian pastors, and some Christians blame those murders on the influence of Vodou. There have also been several murders of Vodou Priests/Priestesses, most recently after the earthquake. In Haiti, some Christians consider Vodou a form of [[satanism|devil worship]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  In spite of this criticism by some Haitian Christians, many practitioners of Haitian Vodou continue to self-identify as Roman Catholic, even to the point of incorporating the [[Lord's Prayer]] and the [[Hail Mary]] into their services for the [[Lwa]] (also called ''loa''). These people see no contradiction between the two faiths and, in fact, view it as enriching their own faith, such people refer to themselves as good Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itotd.com/articles/455/voodoo/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syncretism==
Haiti has large percentages of Vodou believers.  Many Christians accept Vodou as part of the country's culture, though most Evangelical Christians consider Vodou incompatible with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/october/18.28.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Vodou is taken seriously, and is not considered "black magic" by its adherants (or at least not primarily, see [[bokor]]). Many observances are shared between the religions; for instance it is not abnormal for Vodou funerary ceremonies to be performed, followed by a Roman Catholic ceremony presided by a priest. Many Haitians celebrate Christian holidays alongside traditional Vodou holidays.

One of the essential differences between Christianity and vodou involved the use of violence. Priests practicing voduo is believed capable of summoning spirits (''loas'') in order to inflict pain, curses, sickness, and death. To counter the destruction wrought by the ''loa'', one needs elaborate and costly rituals to avoid hardship and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Christianity in the Global South, Volume 2|last=Lamport|first=Mark|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2018|isbn=9781442271579|location=Lanham|pages=846}}&lt;/ref&gt; People, thus, live in constant fear, which goes against the Christian teaching based on hope and harmonious relationship with others.

==The Church position==

The Church has put pressure upon the government to outlaw and disband Voduo. This is the reason its practice remain illegal since the French colonial regime.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voodoo and Politics in Haiti|last=Laguerre|first=Michel|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=9781349199228|location=New York|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, 1913, and again in 1941 the church led its anti-superstitious campaigns to fight against Voodooism. During the campaigns, hundreds of Ounfos and ritual paraphernalia were destroyed and burned. In spite of the policy in place, the Haitian government pursued different positions throughout the years. For example, during the administration of [[Sténio Vincent|Stenio Vincent]], voduo practitioners were vigorously persecuted while Francois Duvalier merely ignored the issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In addition to the more common French and British the missionaries, Canadian missionaries began to move into Haiti in 1942. A Jesuit seminary was also opened in 1948. Up to this time, the church remains a major political power; this can cause major problems in country and has greatly limited its pastoral work. In the past decade the Catholic Church has taken a much more liberal stand towards Vodou, even including some minor Vodou elements in the Haitian mass.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopedia of Christianity"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fahlbusch | first = Erwin | year = 1999 | title = The Encyclopedia of Christianity: Volume 2 | publisher = Wm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7808">{{Eastern Catholicism}}
The '''Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria''' is the Patriarchal and only Metropolitan see of the head of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern]] ''[[sui iuris]]'' [[Coptic Catholic Church]], a [[particular Church]] in the [[Catholic Church]] in [[full communion]] with the [[Holy See]], which follows the [[Alexandrian Rite]] in its own [[Coptic language]]. He is thus the superior of all Coptic dioceses, mostly in and around [[Egypt]] (where all its sees are), Copt(ic) being corruptions of the Greek word for Egypt(ian).

It has two [[cathedral]] archiepiscopal sees, both in Egypt: one dedicated to [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Egypt|Our Lady of Egypt]], in the national capital [[Cairo]], the other dedicated to the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], in Ancient [[Alexandria]].

== History == 
It had three false starts, each failing to prove enduring.
* In 1741 a precursor Catholic [[Apostolic vicariate]] was established for Alexandria for [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] Christians wanting to unite with the [[Holy See]]. 
* On 15 August 1824 a Patriarchal See of Alexandria / Alexandrin(us) Coptorum (Latin) is established on Egyptian territory, split off from the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Syria, Egypt, Arabia and Cyprus]]. 
* On 26 November 1895 it is restored as Patriarchal See of Alexandria / Alexandrin(us) Coptorum (Latin), again on Egyptian territory, split off from the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt]].

In 1947 it is restored for good as Patriarchal See of Alexandria / Alexandrin(us) Coptorum (Latin).

It lost territories in Egypt repeatedly to establish [[suffragan]] sees of Alexandria as Metropolitan :
* on 17 December 1982 the [[Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Ismayliah]]
* on 21 March 2003 the [[Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Guizeh]].

It enjoyed [[Papal visit]]s from [[Pope John Paul II]] in February 2000 and from [[Pope Francis]] in April 2017.

== Rank ==
The patriarchal see as such ranks third among all Catholic (arch)bishoprics of the world (only after the [[Holy See|Apostolic See of Rome]] and the [[Catholic Patriarch of Constantinople]]), by the virtue of Canon Law ([[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches|CCEO]] 58, 59.2).
 
Nevertheless, the incumbent Patriarch is likely to be outranked by many or even most [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]]s, whose higher rank as Princes of the Church is normally not (formally) linked to a see.

== Proper diocese ==
His proper (arch)eparchy is the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria, which has no other Ordinary then the Patriarch. However, he may appoint an [[Auxiliary bishop]] for the eparchy, distinct from Auxliaries for the Patriarchate, as was the case with:
* Youhanna Kabès (7 June 1958 – died 28 June 1985), [[Titular Bishop]] of [[Cleopatris]] (7 June 1958 – 28 June 1985).

As of 2014, it served 35,865 Eastern Catholics in 31 parishes with 73 priests (41 diocesan, 32 religious), 209 lay religious (65 brothers, 144 sisters) and 5 seminarians.

It enjoyed a Papal visit from [[Pope Francis]] in April 2017.

[[File:Matrona Gaul goddess alt.jpg|thumb|200px|Stone carving of the goddess Matrona]]
In [[Celtic mythology]], '''Dea Matrona''' ("divine mother goddess") was the [[goddess]] who gives her name to the river [[Marne River|Marne]] (ancient ''Matrŏna''&lt;ref&gt;Ancient authors referring to the river Marne as ''Matrona'' include [[Julius Caesar]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], [[Ausonius]] and [[Sidonius Apollinaris]]. {{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DMatrona2|accessdate=1 May 2014|date=1879|author=Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short|title=A Latin Dictionary, 'Matrona'|publisher=Perseus, Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Gaul]].

The [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] [[wikt:theonym|theonym]] ''Mātr-on-ā'' signifies "great mother",&lt;ref name="delamarre"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xavier Delamarre|title=Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise|year=2003|publisher=Errance|ISBN=2-87772-237-6|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the goddess of the Marne has been interpreted to be a mother goddess.&lt;ref name="delamarre"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Jacques Lacroix|year=2007|title=Les noms d'origine gauloise - La Gaule des dieux|publisher=Errance|ISBN=2-87772-349-6|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many Gaulish religious images—including inexpensive [[terracotta]] [[statue]]s [[Mass production|mass-produced]] for use in household [[shrine]]s—depict mother goddesses nursing babies or holding fruits, other foods, or small dogs in their laps. In many areas, such ''Matronae'' were depicted in [[Triple deities#Triple goddesses|groups of three]] (or sometimes two)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda J. Green|year=1989|title=Symbol and Image in Celtic Religious Art|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=0-415-08076-2|pages=188–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Matres and Matronae]] for the triads of mother-goddesses well attested throughout northern Europe).

The name of Welsh mythological figure [[Modron]], mother of [[Mabon ap Modron|Mabon]] is derived from the same etymon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maryjones.us/jce/modron.html|title=Modron|website=Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia|author=Mary Jones|year=2007|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, Dea Matrona may conceivably have been considered the mother of the Gaulish [[Maponos]].{{Cn|date=December 2017}}

'''''Diplopterys cabrerana''''' is a vine native to the [[Amazon Basin]], spanning the countries of [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="Rätsch"/&gt; In the [[Quechua languages]] it is called '''chaliponga''' or '''chagropanga'''; in parts of Ecuador it is known as '''chacruna'''—a name otherwise reserved for ''[[Psychotria viridis]]''.

''D. cabrerana'' and ''P. viridis'' are both common admixtures for [[ayahuasca]]. Both species are rich sources of  [[Dimethyltryptamine|''N,N''-DMT]], a [[tryptamine]] [[endogenous]] in humans and many other species. ''D. cabrerana'' additionally  produces [[5-MeO-DMT]], a less common [[structural analog]].

The plant stores the [[alkaloid]]s ''N,N''-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, and ''N''-methyltetrahydro-[[beta-carboline]] in its leaves and stems.&lt;ref name="Rätsch"/&gt; Leaf samples were found to be 0.17-1.75% ''N,N''-DMT,&lt;ref name="Rätsch"/&gt; but only trace amounts of ''N''-methyltetrahydro-beta-carboline occur in the leaves.&lt;ref name="biopark"/&gt; The leaves also store [[methyltryptamine]] and trace amounts of [[bufotenin]].&lt;ref name="Rätsch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biopark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150227102703/http://biopark.org/peru/oco-yage.html www.biopark.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''double chapel''', sometimes ''double church'', is a [[chapel]] or [[church building]] with two storeys that either have a central aperture enabling their simultaneous use for services or are completely separate, just connected by a staircase, and used for different liturgical functions. In the latter type, there is often a [[crypt]] on the lower level and a celebratory space on the upper floor.

== Architecture ==
This special form of [[church building]] that was used in medieval European architecture up to the 13th century had two churches built on two levels, one above the other, usually with the same floor plan, but there are exceptions such as the [[Imperial Palace of Goslar|Imperial Chapel of St. Ulrich]] in Goslar.
The earlier arrangement of the two chapel floors, which was purported to enable a "separation between the lower and upper classes of the Middle Ages", in which the lower chapel was assigned to the "common people" and the upper chapel to the "feudal lords" and their families is not substantiated by any evidence. Instead, it is more likely that the distinction was either between a public lower chapel, where the ruler celebrated mass with guests before official events or during state visits, and a private upper chapel, where the lord’s family worshipped; or between an upper chapel which was reserved for estate services and a lower chapel used as a crypt and also for [[requiem mass]]es. In these Romanesque chapels the upper and lower levels were usually connected by a secondary aperture in the floor of the upper chapel.
The double chapel had numerous architectural successors, notably the [[charnel house]], a combination of [[cemetery chapel]] and [[ossuary]], but also in numerous two-storey cemetery chapels in southern Germany, Austria and Bohemia. Where they function purely as cemetery chapels,  double chapels are usually dedicated to [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]]. The lower chapel was given the character of an ossuary, as a [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] relic chapel and memorial for the fallen after the failure of the feudal crusades (e.g. Kiedrich or Görlitz).

== Examples ==

'''Galaxy Press''' is a trade name set up to publish and promote the fiction works
of [[L. Ron Hubbard]], and the anthologies of the L. Ron Hubbard [[Writers of the Future]] contest.

The company was separated from [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]] in the early 2000s, and is a business name of [[Author Services Inc.]] which is, in turn, completely owned by the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]]. Bridge now focuses solely on Hubbard's [[Scientology]] and nonfiction works.

They published ''The Kingslayer'' as an audio-book in 2003 as well as ''L. Ron Hubbard Master Story-Teller'', a [[coffee-table book]]  by William J. Widder.

In 2004 they published a new edition of ''[[To the Stars (novel)|To the Stars]]'' as well as in audio-book form.

In 2008, they announced they would be releasing eighty volumes containing the works Hubbard wrote for [[pulp magazine]]s, at the rate of four titles every four or five months. The release is scheduled to be accompanied by a $1.9 million marketing campaign, including commercials on such programs popular with middle school children as ''[[Transformers (fiction)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. John Goodwin, the president of Galaxy Press, stated that the sale and marketing of the books is not intended to recruit people into the [[Church of Scientology]]. The profits from the books will go toward marketing future fiction books and to [[Applied Scholastics]], a nonprofit organization that promotes Hubbard's ideas regarding education.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fass|first=Allison|author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=September 1, 2008|month= |day= |title= |journal=[[Forbes]] |volume=182 |issue=3 |page= |pages=38–40 |publisher= |location= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format= |accessdate= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Religious Science Ministries''', or '''GRSM''', is an organization representing the [[Religious Science]] denomination in the [[New Thought]] movement. Centers and churches in the United States, Canada, Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, India, Australia, and the Philippines are represented by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, L. (2005) ''Encyclopedia of Religion. Volume 10'' Macmillan Reference USA. p 6586.&lt;/ref&gt; It is headquartered in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

== History ==

Dr. Robert Karle founded the Center for Creative Living and seminary in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area in 1977. In 1986 he started Global Religious Science Ministries for the purpose of credentialing Practitioners and Ministers of [[Religious Science]]/[[Science of Mind]] in the eastern United States, and specifically in the Washington, D.C. area. GRSM is a member of the [[International New Thought Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grsm.org/AS-U_Board.htm Board]. Retrieved January 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:USVA headstone emb-25.svg|100px]]

== Teaching and practice ==

RS/SOM teaches that all beings are expressions of and part of Infinite Intelligence, also known as [[Spirit]], [[Christ Consciousness]], or [[God]]. It teaches that, because God is all there is in the universe (not just present in Heaven, or in assigned deities, as believed by traditional teachings), Its power can be used by all humans to the extent that they recognize and align themselves with Its presence.  [[Ernest Holmes]] said "God is not ... a person, but a Universal Presence ... already in our own soul, already operating through our own consciousness.”{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The Introduction to "The Science of Mind" text describes "The Thing Itself" (God or Infinite Intelligence), "The Way It Works," "What It Does," and "How to Use It."  Holmes taught that "Love rules through Law." (i.e. the Law of Mind or Cause and Effect) and "Love points the way and Law makes the way possible."  The "Law of Cause and Effect" simply states that every action has a consequence — creative, destructive, or neutral. It can be described as [[Jesus Christ]] implied and what was also stated in parts of the Old Testament: you reap what you sow, the bread you cast upon the water comes back to you, and other expressions of that concept. The [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|Law of Attraction]] is one aspect of that Law. It differs from the Hindu definition of [[karma]] in that it is not related to [[reincarnation]] and that it happens in this life.  Personal responsibility is a major tenet of RS/SOM.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

RS/SOM teaches that people can achieve more fulfilling lives through the practice called [[Spiritual Mind Treatment]] (Treatment), or [[Affirmative Prayer]]. Spiritual Mind Treatment is a step-by-step process, in which one states the desired outcome as if it has already happened. In that way, it differs from traditional prayer, since it does not ask an entity separate from itself to act. It declares human partnership with Infinite Intelligence to achieve success. Treatment is to be stated as personal (first person), positive, powerful (with feeling), and present (is happening right now). The goal is to gain clarity in thinking that guides action to be consistent with the desired outcome. The Treatment is believed to set off a new chain of causation in Mind that leads one to act according to the good for which one is treating.  Spiritual Mind Treatment, as currently taught in RS/SOM centers, contains five steps: Recognition, Unification, Realization, Thanksgiving, and Release. Some adherents of RS/SOM also use supplemental meditation techniques, including "[[Visioning]]"{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Global religious science ministries professional seminary==

Most GRSM educational programs are part-time evening courses that follow an academic school year. The early courses in the series may be facilitated by practitioners or ministers. Practitioner and ministerial courses are led by ministers. Students enrolled in the doctorate program are assigned a sponsor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

'''Handfasting''' is a rural folkloric and [[modern paganism|neopagan]] custom, initially found in western European countries, in which a couple hold a commitment ceremony. The commitment may be seen as temporary and secular, or of a longer, spiritual variety, depending on the context. 

==Origin of the term==
{{further|History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland}}
''Handfasting'' is a history term for "[[betrothal]]" or "[[wedding]]". In the [[Early Modern history of Scotland]] (16th and 17th centuries), especially in the [[Hebrides]], the term could also refer to a [[history of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland#Probationary or temporary marriage in Scotland|temporary marriage]].

The verb ''to handfast'' in the sense of "to formally promise, to make a contract" is recorded for [[Old English#Late Old English|Late Old English]], especially in the context of a contract of marriage. The derived ''handfasting'' is for a ceremony of engagement or betrothal is recorded in [[Early Modern English]]. The term was presumably loaned into English from [[Old Norse]] '' handfesta'' "to strike a bargain by joining hands"; there are also comparanda from the [[Ingvaeonic languages]]: [[Old Frisian]] ''hondfestinge'' and [[Middle Low German]] ''hantvestinge''. The term is derived from the verb ''to handfast'', used in [[Middle English|Middle]] to Early Modern English for the making of a contract.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"handfasting, n." and "handfast, v." OED Online. November 2010. Oxford University Press. "Old Norse hand-festa to strike a bargain by joining hands, to pledge, betroth" The earliest cited English use in connection with marital status is from a manuscript of c. 1200, when [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] is described as "handfast (to) a good man called [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]". "?c1200 Ormulum (Burchfield transcript) l. 2389 "Ȝho wass hanndfesst an god mann Þatt iosæp wass ȝehatenn."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "handfasting" or "hand-fasting" has been in use in [[Celtic neopaganism]] and [[Wicca]] for wedding ceremonies from at least the late 1960s, apparently first used in print by [[Hans Holzer]].&lt;ref&gt;"My wife and I were married by the handfasting ceremony, and it was most controversial." - Hans Holzer, ''The Truth about Witchcraft'' (1969), p. 172; "Then I learned that the "special meeting" was, in effect, a wedding ceremony called "hand-fasting" in Wicca." Hans Holzer, ''Heather: confessions of a witch'', Mason &amp; Lipscomb, 1975, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Handfasting was mentioned in the 1980 [[Jim Morrison]] biography ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]'' and again in the 1991 film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', where a version of the real 1970 handfasting ceremony of Morrison and [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison]]&lt;ref name="Kennealy-Morrison"&gt;{{cite book | first =Patricia | last =Kennealy | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =1992 | month = | title =Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher =Dutton/Penguin | location =New York| isbn =0-525-93419-7 | url =| page =63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was depicted (with the real Patricia Kennealy-Morrison playing the [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic Pagan]] priestess).&lt;ref name="Kennealy-Morrison"/&gt;

[[Image:HandFastingKnot-1.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a handfasting knot where each wedding guest has tied a ribbon around the clasped hands of the couple.]]

The term has entered the English-speaking mainstream, most likely from neopagan wedding ceremonies during the early 2000s, often erroneously being described as "pre-Christian" by wedding planners.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Neasham, ''Handfasting: A Practical Guide''. Green Magic, 2000, {{ISBN|9780954296315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence that the term "handfasting" had been re-interpreted as describing this ceremony specifically is found in the later 2000s, e.g. 
"handfasting&amp;mdash;the blessed marriage rite in which the hands of you and your beloved are wrapped in ribbon as you 'tie the knot.'"&lt;ref&gt;cover blurb of Kendra Vaughan Hovey, ''Passages Handfasting: A Pagan Guide to Commitment Rituals'', Adams Media, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 2010s, "handfasting ceremonies" were on offer by commercial wedding organizers and had mostly lost their neopagan association (apart from occasional claims that attributes the ceremony to the "ancient Celts").&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Haynes, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100128025757/http://www.wendyhaynes.com/handfasting_ceremonies "Handfasting Ceremonies"] (wendyhaynes.com), January 2010: " It was used to acknowledge the beginning of a trial period of a year and a day during which time a couple were literally bound together - hand fasted."&lt;!--this site presumably just cites the broken Wikipedia article back at us. Another case where Wikipedia has been abused in the creation of [[fakelore]].--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "handfasting ribbon" appears from about 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wormspit.com/blog/2005/06/04/handfasting-ribbon-finished/ Handfasting ribbon, finished] (wormspit.com) 4 July 2005; Jacquelyn Frank, ''Jacob: The Nightwalkers'', Zebra Books, 2006, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Imamate''''' ({{lang-ar|إمامة}} ''imāmah'') is a word derived from ''[[imam]]'' and meaning "leadership". Its use in [[theology]] is confined to [[Shia]]. An imam is the head or leader of an imamate and is similar to a caliph or khalifah with one major difference: While a caliph is more of a political head of a state, the imam (in imamate) is a religious as well as a political head of a group of people. While the caliph cannot change the religious laws and their jurisprudence, an imam also can not change the original religious laws but can derive verdicts based on Quran, Tafseer, Ahadith and Prophet's Sunnah as per new requirements or new problems faced.

==Theological usage==
The term ''caliphate'', a [[romanization]] of the Arabic word ''khalifah'' "succession", is often used interchangeably with the term ''imamate''. Both terms, not always but most often, refer to the position of succeeding and leading the [[Ummah|Muslim community]] after the death of [[Muhammad]].

'''Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits''' (8 February 1921{{spaced ndash}}31 October 1999) was the [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[United Synagogue|United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth]] from 1967 to 1991. Prior to this, he had served as Chief Rabbi of Ireland and as rabbi of the [[Fifth Avenue Synagogue]] in New York City. In addition to his official duties he was regarded as an authority in [[medical ethics]] from a Jewish standpoint. He was knighted in 1981 and became the first Chief Rabbi to enter the [[House of Lords]] in 1988 as '''Baron Jakobovits'''.

==Biography==
Jakobovits was born in [[Königsberg]], [[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]], Germany (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia), where his father Julius (Yoel) was a community rabbi. The family moved to [[Berlin]] in the 1920s, where his father became [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|rabbinical judge]] on the ''[[beth din]]'' of the Grossgemeinde, but fled the country in 1938 in time to escape [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecutions. In the United Kingdom he completed his higher education, including a period at the [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva (London)|Etz Chaim Yeshiva]] in London, studying under and receiving [[semicha]] (rabbi ordination) from the renowned Rabbis [[Elya Lopian]], [[Leib Gurwicz]] and [[Nachman Shlomo Greenspan]].&lt;ref&gt;Shashar, Michael, Lord Jakobovits in Conversation, First Edition, Vallentine Mitchell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-85303-377-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied in [[Jews' College]] and the [[University of London]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[PhD]], [[University College London|University College]]).

He married [[Amélie Jakobovits|Amélie Munk]] of Paris, the daughter of a prominent rabbi, who would support his community work throughout his life.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[http://www.chiefrabbi.org/articles/other/jacobtimes.html Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027033704/http://www.chiefrabbi.org/articles/other/jacobtimes.html |date=27 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had six children. Lady Jakobovits died in May 2010, and was buried alongside her husband, on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives.

His first position was as rabbi of the [[Brondesbury]] synagogue. In 1949, at the relatively young age of 27, he was appointed Chief Rabbi of the declining Jewish community of Ireland. This was to be a stepping stone towards a greater rabbinical career, and in 1958 he assumed the rabbinate of [[Hermann Merkin]]'s [[Fifth Avenue Synagogue]] in New York, a position he held until 1966, when he was called to the Chief Rabbinate of the [[United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth|United Hebrew Congregation]] of the British Commonwealth. He held this position until his retirement in 1991.

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] on 22 July 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=48700 |date=
7 August 1981 |page=10262}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was created a [[life peer]] on 5 February 1988, as '''Baron Jakobovits''', of [[Regent's Park]] in Greater London,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51237 |date=10 February 1988 |page=1537}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first rabbi to receive this honour. In 1987 he was given a [[Lambeth degree|Lambeth]] DD by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the first Jew to receive such a degree. In 1991 he received the [[Templeton Prize]] for Progress in Religion.

In the [[House of Lords]] he became known as a campaigner for traditional morality. Lord Jakobovits aroused considerable controversy&lt;ref name=ellison&gt;Ellison, George T. H. and Goodman, Alan H.  ''The Nature of Difference: Science, Society, and Human Biology''. 2006, page 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  when, after the discovery of a possible genetic explanation for homosexuality, he suggested that he saw no "moral objection for using genetic engineering to limit this particular trend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-gay-gene-is-back-on-the-scene-1536770.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=The 'gay gene' is back on the scene | first=Steve | last=Connor | date=1 November 1995 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he did not advocate abortion, he did describe homosexuality as "a grave departure from the natural norm which we are charged to overcome like any other affliction"; if there were genetic explanations for homosexuality, "the errant gene" should be "removed or repaired" to prevent the "disability".&lt;ref name=ellison /&gt;

Lord Jakobovits died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] on 31 October 1999, and was buried on the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]].

==Other functions==
Rabbi Jakobovits was also the president of the [[Conference of European Rabbis]], in which capacity he worked on standardising and regulating [[Ger tzedek|religious conversion]] to [[Judaism]].

==Ideas and philosophy==
Jakobovits was a firm adherent of the "German-Jewish" ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' philosophy, having a broad knowledge of religious subjects as well as secular culture and philosophy. This made him a unique spokesperson for [[Orthodox Judaism]], as he was able to transmit ideas to a wide audience which would otherwise not have achieved dissemination.

Rabbi Jakobovits was the most prominent figure in 20th century Jewish [[medical ethics]], a field he virtually created on his own.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Brill, [https://www.academia.edu/14996115/Immanuel_Jacobowitz_and_the_birth_of_Jewish_Medical_Ethics_2015_ 'Immanuel Jacobowitz and the birth of Jewish Medical Ethics,']  in Zev Farber, (ed.),''Halakhic Realities: Collected Essays on Brain Death,'' Maggid Books 2015  pp.327-348 p.328.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a pioneer in religious [[bioethics]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} His speciality was the interaction between medical ethics and ''[[halakha]]''. Thanks to his academic training in Ireland, Rabbi Jakobovits approached his comprehensive volume, ''Jewish Medical Ethics'', in light of [[Roman Catholic]] [[medical ethics]], with which he often compares Jewish ethics. Whether developing or disputing his analysis, subsequent Jewish [[Bioethics#List of notable bioethicists|bioethicists]] have utilised his work on abortion, [[euthanasia]], the history of Jewish medical ethics, [[palliative care]], treatment of the sick, and professional duties. Likewise, he is credited with popularizing the viewpoint that Judaism supports the nearly absolute [[sanctity of life]].

His political stance was conservative, and he was particularly close to [[Margaret Thatcher]]. When a [[Church of England]] report titled ''[[Faith in the City]]'' was published in December 1985 criticising Mrs. Thatcher's policies, Jakobovits responded by attacking its underlying philosophy.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; Jakobovits argued that work rather than welfare should be the over-riding aim of government policy: "Cheap labour is better than a free dole".&lt;ref name=Young&gt;(Young, 1991) p.423-4&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, Jakobovits contended that inner-city black people should learn from Jewish experiences in America. There, he argued, Jews had worked themselves out of poverty, educated themselves, integrated into the host culture and nurtured a "trust in and respect for the police, realising that our security as a minority depended on law and order being maintained".&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; Jakobovits also took a conservative view on trade unions, criticised "Faith in the City" for not mentioning the role of trade unions, arguing that "The selfishness of workers in attempting to secure better conditions at the cost of rising unemployment and immense public misery can be just as morally indefensible as the rapaciousness of the wealthy in exploiting the working class".&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;

Within Judaism, he held mildly [[Zionism|Zionistic]] views. He maintained that sooner or later Israel would need to negotiate the territory it conquered during the [[Six-Day War]]; which made him a controversial figure, as he mentioned these views publicly.

'''Johannes Cardinalis von Bergreichenstein''' (Jan Kardinál z Rejnštejna) (circa 1375 — after 1428) was a Czech lawyer and diplomat.

He was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Charles University in Prague]] 1416-1417.

In 1394 he took up the study of law at the Charles University in Prague and received his doctorate at Jan Hus in 1404 to champion the seven liberal arts. 1407 was followed by the examination for Bachelor of laws. Two years later he was already as an envoy of King [[Wenceslas IV]]. together with Christian von Prachatitz and Peter de Mladoniovicz at the Council of Pisa in part. As followers of Jan Hus, they should provide for the repeal of the ban imposed against this church. A year later he defended Hus against the [[Archbishop of Prague]] [[Zbynko Zajíc]] of rabbit castle and accompanied Hus as a representative of the University, together with Peter for Mladoňovic, on his journey to the [[Council of Constance]], where he received neither a prelate, nor the support of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].

After his return to Bohemia, he was appointed in 1417 as rector of the university. Under his leadership, became the symbol of the Hussites - the cup - cemented in the minds of scholars. John spread in his tenure, the laity -Teaching of Hus and protested his innocence and integrity. On 10 March 1417 he issued a proclamation in which the doctrine was confirmed as for all Christians. He sent this input even at the Council of Constance, which it saw the confirmation of the Bohemian heresy. The Pope went so far that he no longer recognized the University of Prague.

During the [[Hussite wars]] he belonged together with Jan of Příbrami to the moderate wing, which sought a compromise with the Catholic Church. Because of his diplomatic skills were chosen cardinalis in 1421 as a member of a delegation that offered the Bohemian throne to the Polish king [[Władysław II Jagiełło]]. At the end of the year he was with John of Seelau, Jakobellus of Mies and Peter Payn to the administrators of the chalice teaching. Later they banished him from Prague. Already in 1425 he represented Prague in negotiations with the [[Taborites]]. The last written reference to him is dated 1428, when he held the office of Archbishop administrator.

'''Ktunaxa Nation v. British Columbia (Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations)''' is a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which concerns whether or not a [[First Nation]] can block the development on sacred sites by virtue of the concepts of [[freedom of religion]] and the [[duty to consult and accommodate]] (the [[honour of the Crown]]).

The majority held that the Ktunaxa Nation's rights were not violated by the decision of the Province of British Columbia to allow the [[Jumbo Glacier, British Columbia|Jumbo Glacier]] ski resort to expand into area within Ktunaxa territory known as ''Qat’muk'' where Grizzly Bear Spirit is believed to live.  This is because the belief in Grizzly Bear Spirit and the ability to act upon it were not impinged, only the location, and so is not within the scope of [[s.2 of the Charter]].  The majority held that the Ktunaxa still do have a [[Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982|S.35]] right to be consulted and accommodated regarding lands where there has been no proven [[Aboriginal title]], but that a religious connection could not be invoked to establish title in the context of overturning an administrative decision.  Ktunaxa title to the area would have to be tried separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16816/index.do|title=Ktunaxa Nation v. British Columbia (Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations) - SCC Cases (Lexum)|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minority held that the duty to consult and accommodated was met, but that freedom of religion was impinged.  However the provincial minister's infringement on freedom of religion was reasonable under s.1, and so the application for an injunction could be denied by the lower courts.

'''Manikut''' (literally "the jewel hut") is an independent room located towards the eastern end of [[Namghar]]. It is the place that represents the worshipful god, or a guru-asana (the guru's seat). It is also called as ''bhajghar'' in western [[Assam]], with its own roof. This is the only place in Namghar that is fully walled, with or without any window. The Manikut is a later addition room attached to the basic Namghar structure. The place does not house any idols as idolaltry was denounced by Shankardev. 

==Guru Asana==

Guru Asana is the place of sacred scripture. The Guru Āsana, literally the Seat of the Guru, is a seven-tiered, triangular, wooden throne adorned by the tortoise-elephant-lion motif and other decorative woodwork.

The '''Milang tribe''' (alternately '''Millang''', '''Malaa''', or '''Holon''') are a sub-group of the [[Adi people]] found in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and nearby [[Rigbi]], [[Jonai]],in [[Assam]], [[India]].

==Etymology==
The term ''Milang'' is an [[exonym]], used by non-members of the group to refer to them.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;
{{cite journal

  |journal=Anthropological Linguistics
  |date=In press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the tribe prefer the name ''Malaa''.

== Language ==
{{main article|Milang language}}
Malaa people use a distinct form of dialect un-intelligible to most of the other subgroups of Adi.  There has been several theories regarding its unique dialect, however most of the Malaa people maintains that they adopted this dialect from a certain group of people called Soi-sotem who inhabited their lands long before Malaa people came and settled there and the latter migrated to other places. Still today the Malaa mention and remember those archaic Soi-sotem people in their ballads as:

: ''Soi belu kettunge, Sotem belu kettunge''.

Soi sotem were believed to come from Kalang Ade(dite), the highest peak in the land of the Milang beyond which is the land of [[Idu Mishmi tribe|Idu Mishmi]] tribe.

==Religion==
The Malaa are adherents of indigenous Donyi-Poloism, the practice of praying to the almighty Sun goddess and The Moon God. The priests, called ''Madar'' in Malaa, are popularly believed to be the intermediaries between the natural human world and Spiritual and supernatural world. Male priests are connected with act of divination while the female priests are related with healing of sickness. The priesthood is hereditary practice as it passed from generation to generation in a family. The ritual of sacrificing an animal as suggested by priest to cure a disease is called ''Lulu''. Whenever an epidemic or disease breaks down in a village, the villagers construct a gate at the entrance of the village and a dog is sacrificed with intestines sagging out and hanged.This ritual is called ''Lukan''.

''Ayid Madar Bemmanu'', a ritualistic dance is performed throughout the night in which priest bargains to appease the spirits to release the soul of diseased person and in exchange for gifts. The priest examines the chicken liver and reads omen and suggest the nature of disease and corresponding sacrifice to be made to heal the disease.

Name of festival Dates
 
 Aran              March 7
Solung Etor May 15
Solung(Lune)       September 1

==Geography==
Geographically the Malaa land lies approximately between 94-95 degree N latitude and 28-29 degree E longitude in [[Upper Siang district]].  The land of the Milangs extends to the ''Chage'' and ''Felo'' hills in the north which is land of the Idu tribe of Dibang valley. To south and the east they are bounded by the land of the [[Padam tribe|Padams]].

Their land is a rich source of the ''[[Aconitum]]'' plant (variously known as monk's hood or wolf's bane), the source of the powerful poison [[aconitine]], which the Milang historically used on their spears and arrows during battle.The ''[[Anglo-Abor wars]]'' between 1835 and 1912 saw massive use of 'EMO'(called AMU in Millang) being supplied from Peki Modi village against the invading British forces.

The principal rivers are Sidip, Yamne, Yammeng, Satamak and Chapel besides many rivulets flowing through their land.

Millang, Dalbing and Peki Modi are the important ancestral villages of the Malaa.  However, as of today they are found residing in the hills and the valleys of [[East Siang district|East Siang]], [[Upper Siang district|Upper Siang]] and  [[Lower Dibang Valley district|Lower Dibang Valley]] Districts of Arunachal Pradesh.

==Surnames==

The [[New York city]]-based '''Morgen Freiheit''' (original title: '''{{lang|yi|מאָרגן־פרײהײט}}'''; English: '''''Morning Freedom''''') was a daily [[Yiddish|Yiddish language]] newspaper affiliated with the [[Communist Party, USA]], founded by  [[Moissaye Olgin]] in 1922. After the end of [[World War II]] the paper's pro-Israel views brought it into disfavor with the Communist Party and its editor [[Paul Novick]] was expelled from the organization. The paper finally folded in 1988.

==Institutional history==

===Establishment===
The ''Freiheit'' was established in 1922 as a self-described "Communistic fighting newspaper" in the Yiddish language.&lt;ref name="Henry02"&gt;Henry Felix Srebrnik, ''Dreams of Nationhood: American Jewish Communists and the Soviet Birobidzhan Project, 1924-1951.'' Brighton, MA: Academic Studies Press, 2010; pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper's chief goals included the promotion of the Jewish labor movement, the defense of the [[Soviet Union]], the advancement of [[proletarian culture]], and the defeat of [[racism]] in America.&lt;ref name="Henry02" /&gt;

===Development===

By 1925, the press run of the ''Freiheit'' grew to 22,000 copies per issue, making it the largest of nine daily newspapers in the United States affiliated with the American Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Henry02" /&gt;

''The Morning Freiheit''/''Morgen Freiheit'' in its time was one of the most prominent Yiddish newspapers published in the United States, and the show case of left socialist artists and writers both Jewish and non-Jewish, Zionist and internationalist. Among the most notable writers to appear in its pages was [[Michael Gold]], the author of the novel ''[[Jews Without Money]]''. The newspaper made significant political contributions related to the formation of the [[International Fur and Leather Workers Union]], as well as many of the needle trades unions in the United States, including the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]] union, and perhaps the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (which later merged with the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] as the [[AFL-CIO]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Following Moissaye Olgin's sudden death in November 1939, the ''Freiheit'' was headed by Paul Novick (1891-1989), a journalist born in [[Brest-Litovsk]] who had first come to America in 1913.&lt;ref name="Henry16"&gt;Srebrnik, ''Dreams of Nationhood,'' pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Novick had been associated with the publication from its foundation in 1922 and was active in the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|ICOR]], the American Committee of Jewish Writers, Artists and Scientists, and other Communist Party-sponsored mass organizations.&lt;ref name="Henry16" /&gt;

== Writers ==
People who wrote for or served on the staff of ''Morgen Freiheit'' included:
*[[Melech Epstein]]
*[[Mike Gold]]
*[[Moissaye Olgin]]

[[File:Naphtali Cohen portrait.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Naphtali Cohen, from 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]]]

'''Naphtali Cohen''' (1649–1718), also known as '''Naphtali HaKohen Katz''', was a Russo-German [[rabbi]] and [[kabalist]] born in Ostrowo in [[Ukraine]]. He belonged to a family of rabbis in Ostrowo, where his father, Isaac Cohen, a great-great-grandson of the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]], had fled during the [[Polish–Cossack–Tatar War (1666–71)|Polish–Cossack–Tatar War]].&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

== Biography ==
In 1663 Cohen fell into the hands of the [[Tatars]], who kept him in servitude for several years. Escaping, he returned to Ostrowo, and was chosen to succeed his father as rabbi. In 1690 he was called to [[Poznań|Posen]], where he officiated as chief rabbi until 1704. There he devoted himself to the Kabbalah, and collected a large library of cabalistic literature.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

In 1704 he was called to [[Frankfurt am Main]]. On the occasion of a fire which, breaking out in his house on Jan. 14, 1711, spread to and consumed the entire [[Frankfurter Judengasse#The Great Ghetto Fire of 1711|Jewish quarter]], it was charged that, relying on the efficacy of his cabalistic charms, he had prevented the extinction of the fire by the ordinary means. He was arrested and thrown into prison, and regained his liberty only upon renouncing his office.

He then went to [[Prague]], where many members of his family lived. There another misfortune, which embittered his life more than the loss of his wealth and position, befell him. The [[Shabbethaian]] cabalist [[Nehemiah Hayyun]] appeared in Prague, declaring himself a preacher or an emissary from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and by his duplicity gained the confidence of the credulous Cohen. Being a believer in practical Cabala, Cohen found no fault with Ḥayyun, even when the latter began to sell [[amulet]]s. It is not astonishing, therefore, that when Ḥayyun asked for an approbation for his mystical work ''Mehemnuta de Kula,'' Cohen, to whom he had prudently submitted only the main text, but not the commentaries which accompanied it, and in which the author openly professed the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], readily granted it, and gave him a glowing recommendation. Provided with this and with other recommendations secured in the same way, Ḥayyun traveled throughout [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]], propagating everywhere his Shabbethaian teachings.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Cohen soon discovered his mistake, and endeavored, but without success, to recover his approbation, although he did not as yet realize the full import of the book. It was in 1713, while Cohen was staying at [[Breslau]] (where he acted as a rabbi until 1716), that Ḥakam [[Ẓebi Ashkenazi]] of [[Amsterdam]] informed him of its tenets. Cohen thereupon acted rigorously. He launched a ban against the author and his book, and became one of the most zealous supporters of Ḥakam Ẓebi in his campaign against Ḥayyun.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

In 1715 Cohen went to see [[August II]], [[King of Poland]], to secure reinstatement in his former rabbinate of Posen, at that time vacant; but failed because of the opposition of the leaders of the community. He then returned to the [[Ukraine]], and in 1718 started for the [[Holy Land]], but died on the way at [[Constantinople]]&lt;ref name=je/&gt; on Dec. 20, 1718.

Cohen was the author of the following works:
* ''Birkat Adonai'' (Blessing of the Lord), a commentary on [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakot]], with an introduction on the correlation of the [[Mishnaic]] tractates, having the subtitle ''Semikut Ḥakamim'' (Connection of the Wise), Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1702 (Cohen was so proud of this work that he ordered it to be buried with him)
* ''Meshek ha-Zera'' (Sowing of the Seed), commentary on the Mishnaic order [[Zeraim]] (not published)
* ''Pi Yesharim'' (Mouth of the Righteous), a [[kabalistic]] introduction to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1702
* ''Sefer Bet Raḥel'' (Book of the House of Rachel), quoted in his will, probably identical with ''Tefillat Bet Raḥel'' (Prayer of the House of Rachel), published at Amsterdam in 1741&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Cohen also edited a number of prayer-books, including ''Seliḥot'' (Penitential Prayers), with a commentary, Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1702; prayers for the Society for Burial, ib., n.d.; a prayer for the staying of the plague, Prague, 1713; and an ode on a [[Sefer Torah]] donated by Baruch Austerlitz. He also wrote an epistle directed against Nehemiah Ḥayyun. Cohen's ethical will, ''Ẓawwa'ah,'' is replete with lofty moral instructions (Berlin, 1729).&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|title=COHEN, NAPHTALI|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4501-cohen-naphtali|accessdate=Mar 24, 2015}}

'''Otgontenger''' ({{lang-mn|Отгонтэнгэр}}, ''lit.'' ''"youngest sky"'') is the highest peak in the [[Khangai Mountains]] in [[Mongolia]]. Its summit is currently calculated to reach an elevation of 4,008 meters above mean sea level (some earlier topographic maps record a maximum elevation of 4,021&amp;nbsp;m). The mountain is located in [[Zavkhan Province]] and is the only peak in the Khangai range that is capped with a permanent glacier. The south face of Mount Otgontenger is the most extensive granite wall in Mongolia. 

Since the introduction of Buddhism, traditional Mongolian beliefs have held that wrathful [[deities]] inhabit many of Mongolia's [[sacred mountains]]. [[Vajrapani|Ochirvaani]] is particularly associated with Otgontenger.
== Accidents ==
In August 1963, an [[Ilyushin Il-14|Ilyushin 14]] aircraft crashed into the side of the mountain while on route.

In October 2017, 27 hikers climbed the mountain and only 10 of them came back. They requested the rescue team a day after the other 17 went missing. The rescue operation took about 4 days with helicopters and 250 men.  Rescuers found all 17 of them dead,&lt;ref&gt;[https://akipress.com/news:598202/ Bodies of all 17 mountaineers found at Mongolia's Mount Otgontenger], AKIPress, 25 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; having received injuries from both fall damage and from frostbite. However, it was still argued that some of the victims survived the fall and tried to send distress signals by using flashlights.

[[File:Hans Memling 017.jpg|thumb|right|130px|''The Blessed at the gate to heaven with St. Peter'' by [[Hans Memling]].]]
'''Pearly gates''' is an informal name for the gateway to [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] according to some [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]]. It is inspired by the description of the [[New Jerusalem]] in {{bibleref|Revelation|21:21|31}}: "The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate being made from a single pearl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=J. Stephen |authorlink= |chapter=59: Imagine the Size of Those Oysters |title=What the Good Book Didn't Say: Popular Myths and Misconceptions About the Bible |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qputB4k78JQC&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q=pearly%20gates&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=Citadel Press |location= |isbn=9780806524603 |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the gates in popular culture is a set of large gold, white or wrought-iron gates in the clouds, guarded by [[Saint Peter]] (the keeper of the "[[Keys of the kingdom|keys to the kingdom]]"). Those not fit to enter heaven are denied entrance at the gates, and descend into [[Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Everett |authorlink=Everett Ferguson |title=The Church of Christ: A Biblical Ecclesiology for Today |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVqRaiPlx88C&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q=%22doorkeeper%20of%20heaven%22&amp;f=false |year=1996 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |location= |isbn=9780802841896 |page=53 |quote=The passage moves from a building, to gates, to keys. A popular image has Peter as the doorkeeper of heaven, deciding admission through the pearly gates to each person at death. This understanding of Peter goes back to an early medieval interpretation that identified Peter with a figure in Germanic mythology who was the porter of heaven.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions of this imagery, Peter looks up the deceased's name in a book, before opening the gate.

[[Image:Peripteros.svg|thumb|200px|A [[peripteros]] with a peristasis between the columns (dots) and the walls]]
The '''peristasis''' ({{lang-grc-gre|περίστασις}}) was a four-sided [[porch]] or [[hallway]] of columns surrounding the [[cella]] in an ancient Greek [[peripteral]] temple.  This allowed priests to pass round the cella (along a [[pteron]]) in cultic processions.  

If such a hall of columns surrounds a patio or garden, it is called a [[peristyle]] rather than a peristasis. 

In [[ecclesial architecture]], it is also used of the area between the [[baluster]] of a Catholic church and the high altar (what is usually called the sanctuary or [[chancel]]).

The '''Progressive Party of Maldives''' ({{lang-dv|ޕްރޮގްރެސިވް ޕާރޓީ އޮފް މޯލްޑިވްސް: ޕީ.ޕީ.އެމް}}), also known as the '''PPM''', is the largest political party in [[Maldives]] with a total membership of 49,416 as of 30th June 2018.&lt;ref name="elections.gov.mv"/&gt; The stated goal of the party is driving Maldives towards an independent and democratic, safe and secure, high income, high human capital, developed nation state with a diversified and robust economy whilst preserving its Islamic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppm.mv/party-constitution/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===2011–2012===
The party was formed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] in 2011 after resigning from his first party, [[Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party]] (DRP), citing corruption of views after new leadership. The political party first emerged from a faction of DRP, named Z-DRP, which was formed by Gayyoom in early 2011. This occurred after in-party disputes between Gayyoom, who was serving as the party's retired "Supreme Leader", and the current leader, [[Ahmed Thasmeen Ali]].

On 4 September 2011, Gayyoom handed in his resignation from the DRP announcing that the Z-DRP faction of the party, would become a new "corruption-intolerant" party independent from the DRP. The very next day, he unveiled the plans for the "Progressive Party of Maldives".

On 8 October 2011, the proposed party was granted license from the Elections Commission to go ahead; giving the party a time frame of 9 months to register itself with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/38054/Gayoom_unveils_Progressive_Party_of_Maldives;_mum_on_2013_presidential_bid |title=Gayoom unveils Progressive Party of Maldives; mum on 2013 presidential bid |publisher=[[Haveeru Daily]] |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107170026/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/38054/Gayoom_unveils_Progressive_Party_of_Maldives;_mum_on_2013_presidential_bid |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/38059/Gayoom_applies_for_license_to_create_new_party |title=Gayoom applies for license to create new party |publisher=Haveeru Daily |date=2011-09-06 |accessdate=2011-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107165851/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/38059/Gayoom_applies_for_license_to_create_new_party |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/politics/gayooms-new-party-to-be-called-progressive-party-of-maldives-25076|title=Gayoom's new party to be called Progressive Party of Maldives &amp;#124; Minivan News|publisher=[[Minivan Daily]]|date=2011-09-05|accessdate=2011-09-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227151541/http://minivannews.com/politics/gayooms-new-party-to-be-called-progressive-party-of-maldives-25076|archivedate=2011-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27948.htm |title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2004, Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life, Ali Shaahir, Hassan Eevaan Naseem, Abdulla Amin, Ali Aslaam etc.|publisher=[[US Department of State]]|date=2004-02-25|accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2012, PPM accused the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] (MDP, the main opposition party) of pressuring the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]], and called the 2012 Maldives report of this UN organ "serious and concerning", condemning the UN calls to allow same-sex rights and religious freedom in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ppm.mv/beta/index.php?language=english&amp;p=25 UN report had been pressured by MDP: PPM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107212409/http://ppm.mv/beta/index.php?language=english&amp;p=25 |date=2014-01-07 }} Ppm.mv (Haveeru Online), 25 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–2015===
On November 17, 2013, PPM became the ruling party of Maldives after its candidate [[Abdulla Yameen]] (Maumoon's half-brother) won the 2013 Maldivian Presidential Election, defeating ''MDP'' Candidate [[Mohamed Nasheed]] in the runoff. It is believed by many that PPM won the election because of the last minute coalition they made with [[Qasim Ibrahim]]'s [[Jumhooree Party]] just days before the final polls.

On 2014, PPM took majority of the [[People's Majlis]] after winning 33 seats in the Parliament election of 2014, while coalition partners JP won 15 seats and Maldives Democratic Alliance (MDA) taking 15 seats.

As of 2015, both ''JP'' and religiously conservative [[Adhaalath Party]] have left the Government coalition.

The majority of the population of [[East Timor]] is [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and the Catholic Church is the dominant religious institution.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90135.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Timor Leste].

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; There are also small [[Protestant]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] communities.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

According to a 2005 [[World Bank]] report, 98 percent of the population is Catholic, 1 percent Protestant, and less than 1 percent Muslim.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Most citizens also retain some vestiges of [[animistic beliefs]] and practices, which they have come to regard as more cultural than religious.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The number of churches has grown from 100 in 1974 to over 800 in 1994,&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;Robinson, G.

The [[Roman Catholic Church in East Timor]] is part of the worldwide [[Roman Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] in Rome. There are over 900,000 Catholics in East Timor, a legacy of its status as a former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony. Since its independence from [[Indonesia]], East Timor became only the second predominantly Catholic country in Asia (after the Philippines) - approximately 96% of the population is Roman Catholic.

The country is divided into three dioceses; [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dili|Dili]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Maliana|Maliana]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Baucau|Baucau]], all of which are immediately subject to the [[Holy See]].

The [[Apostolic Nuncio]] to East Timor is concurrently the nuncio to Malaysia. The current nuncio is the US archbishop [[Joseph Salvador Marino]], and the nunciature is located in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/world-news/detail/articolo/malaysia-pope-marino-nuncio-21403/ | title=Pope appoints American as first Nuncio to Malaysia, opens new Nunciature there | publisher=La Stampa | work=Vatican Insider | date=16 January 2013 | accessdate=23 March 2014 | author=O'Connell, Gerard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
In the early 16th century, Portuguese and Dutch traders made contact with East Timor. Missionaries maintained a sporadic contact until 1642 when Portugal took over and maintained control until 1974, with a brief occupation by Japan during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=|date=September 2005| title= Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs : Asia: East Timor: Nobel-Winning Bishop Steps Down| work= United States Department of State | url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35878.htm| accessdate=18 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]] visited East Timor in October 1989. Pope John Paul II had spoken out against violence in East Timor, and called for both sides to show restraint, imploring the East Timorese to "love and pray for their enemies." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=| date= 11 October 1996| title= A courageous voice calling for help in East Timor.| format= | work= National Catholic Reporter | url=http://www.highbeam.com/library/docFree.asp?DOCID=1G1:18777597| accessdate=18 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retired bishop [[Carlos Ximenes Belo]] is a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize along with [[José Ramos-Horta]] in 1996 for their attempts to free East Timor from Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=| date= 27 November 2002| title= World Briefing:  Asia: East Timor: Nobel-Winning Bishop Steps Down| format= | work= New York Times | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E1D61738F934A15752C1A9649C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fR%2fRoman%20Catholic%20Church%20| accessdate=18 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church remains very involved in politics, with its 2005 confrontations with the government over religious education in school and the forgoing of war crimes trials for atrocities against East Timorese by [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=27 April 2005| title=E Timor may reconsider religious education ban| format=| work=AsiaNews.it| url=http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=3149| accessdate=19 July 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113123843/http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=3149| archivedate=13 November 2005| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also endorsed the new Prime Minister in his efforts to promote national reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=| date= 18 July 2006| title= Bishops encourage new premier in East Timor| format= | work= Fides| url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=45399| accessdate=19 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006 Catholic Relief Services received aid from the United States to help victims of months of unrest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Griffin, Elizabeth| date= 6 June 2006| title= NEW SUPPLIES ARRIVE IN EAST TIMOR, MORE THAN 50,000 GET RELIEF| format= | work= Catholic Relief Services| url=http://www.crs.org/about_us/newsroom/press_releases/releases.cfm?ID=344| accessdate=19 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060717193728/http://www.crs.org/about_us/newsroom/press_releases/releases.cfm?ID=344 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minority religions==
[[File:Hindu Tempel Dili04.jpg|thumb|[[Pura Girinatha]]]]
Islam is a minority religion in [[East Timor]]. The US State Department and the [[CIA World Factbook]] estimate that [[Muslims]] make up 0.2% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tt.html#People CIA World Factbook]. Retrieved on 12 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; East Timor's first prime minister, [[Mari Alkatiri]], is a [[Sunni]] Muslim.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2010, the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] reported that according to the World Christian Database, Muslims made up 3.6 percent of the population. It also reported that 0.4% of the population identified as [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], and that [[Buddhism]] and [[Chinese folk religion]] each made up 0.2% of the population. It also reported that non-negligible populations followed the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Neoreligion|Neoreligions]], with each group comprising under 0.1% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_71_2.asp|title=The Association of Religion Data Archives {{!}} National Profiles|website=www.thearda.com|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous religions===
Prior to Christian and Muslim contact, the Austronesian people of Timor were [[animist]] [[polytheists]] with practises similar to those seen in [[Polynesia]] and [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Haring, Stars and Keys: Folktales and Creolization in the Indian Ocean, Indiana University Press, 19/07/2007&lt;/ref&gt; A few prominent myths remain, such as the island's conception as an aging [[crocodile]],&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Amanda (2006), Exile and Return Among the East Timorese, Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, pp. 211–218, {{ISBN|0-8122-3909-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in modern times practitioners of indigenous religions constitute a very small minority.

The '''''Republic''''' ({{lang-el|Πολιτεία}}) was a work written by [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy at the beginning of the 3rd century BC. Although it has not survived, it was his most famous work, and various quotes and paraphrases were preserved by later writers. The purpose of the work was to outline the ideal society based on Stoic principles, where virtuous men and women would live a life of simple asceticism in an equal society.

==Content==
Written, it would seem, in conscious opposition to [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On Stoic self-contradictions'', 1034F&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno's ''Republic'' (''politeia'') outlined the principles of an ideal [[Sovereign state|state]] written from the point of view of early Stoic philosophy. The work has not survived; but it was widely known in antiquity and more is known about it than any of his other works. [[Plutarch]] provides a summary of its intent:
{{quote|It is true indeed that the so much admired ''Republic'' of Zeno, first author of the Stoic sect, aims singly at this, that neither in cities nor in towns we should live under laws distinct one from  another, but that we should look upon all people in general to be our fellow-countryfolk  and citizens, observing one manner of living and one kind of order, like a flock  feeding together with equal right in one common pasture. This Zeno wrote, fancying to himself, as in a dream, a certain scheme of civil order, and the image of a philosophical commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Fortune of Alexander'', 329A–B&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is not obvious from Plutarch's remarks whether he had read the work himself. One person who had read it was an otherwise unknown figure known as "Cassius the Skeptic", whose polemic written against Zeno's ''Republic'' is paraphrased by [[Diogenes Laërtius]]:
{{quote|Some there are, and among them Cassius the Sceptic and his disciples, who accuse Zeno at length. Their first count is that in the beginning of his ''Republic'' he pronounced the ordinary education useless: the next is that he applies to all men who are not virtuous the opprobrious epithets of foemen, enemies, slaves, and aliens to one another, parents to children, brothers to brothers, friends to friends. Again, in the ''Republic'', making an invidious contrast, he declares the good alone to be true citizens or friends or kindred or free men; and accordingly in the view of the Stoics parents and children are enemies, not being wise. Again, it is objected, in the ''Republic'' he lays down community of wives, and at line 200 prohibits the building of temples, law-courts and [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasia]] in cities; while as regards a currency he writes that we should not think it need be introduced either for purposes of exchange or for travelling abroad. Further, he bids men and women wear the same dress and keep no part of the body entirely covered. {{sfn|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 32–33}} }}

Further on, Laërtius makes some further remarks which also seem to be from the same work by Cassius:
{{quote|Further, they say that the wise man will feel affection for the youths who by their countenance show a natural endowment for virtue. So Zeno in his ''Republic''. ... It is also their doctrine that amongst the wise there should be a community of wives with free choice of partners, as Zeno says in his ''Republic'' and Chrysippus in his treatise ''On the Republic'', ... under such circumstances we shall feel paternal affection for all the children alike, and there will be an end of the jealousies arising from adultery. {{sfn|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 129–131}} }}

These paraphrases by Cassius are not a neutral summary of the ''Republic'', his purpose seems to be to describe all the doctrines in the work which he found shocking. These include Zeno's denouncement of general education; his exhortation that only the virtuous can be regarded as true citizens; his view that men and women should wear the same clothes; and the idea that "there should be a community of wives", which in practice seems to have meant "recognizing no other form of marriage than the union of the man who lives freely with a consenting woman".&lt;ref&gt;A description of a "community of wives" which Diogenes Laërtius uses when discussing the views of [[Diogenes of Sinope]] {{harv|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few other statements from the ''Republic'' are preserved by other writers. We learn from Laërtius that Zeno stated that the wise man will marry and produce children,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 121}} and several writers mention Zeno's view that there is no need to build temples to the gods, "for a temple not worth much is also not sacred, and nothing made by builders or workmen is worth much".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On Stoic self-contradictions'', 1034B; [[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata]]'', v.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athenaeus]] also preserves a quote on the need for a city to be built on the principle of love:
{{quote|And Pontianus said that Zeno of Citium thought that [[Eros|Love]] was the God of Friendship and Liberty and the author of concord among people, but nothing else. Hence, he says in his ''Republic'', that "Love is a God, who cooperates in securing the safety of the city."&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists'', xiii. 561C.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception==
Zeno's ''Republic'' seems to have been viewed with some embarrassment by some of the later Stoics. This was not helped when [[Chrysippus]], Zeno's most illustrious successor as the [[scholarch|head]] of the Stoic school, wrote his own treatise ''On the Republic'' (probably a commentary on Zeno's work), in which (among many other things) he defended both [[incest]] and [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', 3.205, 3.247; Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 188&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely that Chrysippus urged the adoption of such behaviors; Chrysippus was probably responding to criticisms that in a society practicing [[free love]], in which people often did not know who their relatives were, rare instances of incest would unintentionally occur; his discussion of cannibalism is probably connected with the Stoic contempt for dead bodies as an empty shell. Nevertheless, these points provided extra ammunition for those people who wished to attack both Zeno and Stoicism in general. Some blamed the influence which [[Crates of Thebes]], the famous [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher and teacher of Zeno, may have had when he wrote the ''Republic'': it was joked that Zeno "had written it at the tail of the dog."&lt;ref&gt;The word "Cynic" is derived from the word for "dog" {{harv|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BC, there was an attempt among the Stoics to downplay the involvement which Cynic philosophy had played in the development of early Stoicism; it was said that Zeno had been "young and thoughtless" when he wrote his ''Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;A view attributed to some contemporary Stoics by [[Philodemus]], ''On the Stoics'', c. 2. col 9. ed. Dorandi.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also said that "by Zeno things were written which they [the Stoics] do not readily allow disciples to read, without their first giving proof whether or not they are genuine philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', v.9.58&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of these views, it is clear that Zeno was one of the first philosophers in a long tradition begun by Plato of depicting an ideal society in order to understand ethical principles.

'''Rosa Mystica''' or '''Mystic Rose''' is a [[title of Mary]] in Catholic [[Marian devotion]]. It is found in the [[Litany of Loreto]] in reference to the ''[[Rose of Sharon]]'', an allegorical belief that focuses on the Virgin Mary as [[Mediatrix]] intercessor.  A devotional image enshrined at the [[Maria Rosenberg]] church in [[Waldfischbach-Burgalben]], Germany, features an 1138 painting of Mary, featuring three roses, with thirteen roses, allegedly connecting to the 13 July [[feast day]] associated with the Marian title. [[Maria Crocifissa di Rosa]] "Mary crucified of the Rose" was the [[religious name]] of Paolina Francesca di Rosa (1813–55),  founder of the [[Handmaids of Charity]].  A 1947 [[Marian apparition]] to religious nurse [[Pierina Gilli]] in [[Montichiari]], Italy is associated with the Rosa Mystica. Mary is said to have appeared to her seven times that year. The devotion is largely centered in Italy, and it is known for its most common [[religious iconography]], an image of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] bearing three roses in her breast, symbolising [[Prayer in the Catholic Church|prayer]], [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|penance]] and [[expiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholictradition.org/Mary/mystica.htm|title=ROSA MYSTICA AND THE CHURCH|work=catholictradition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2228">In [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian mythology]], the '''Tablet of Destinies'''&lt;ref&gt;Not, as frequently misquoted in general works, the ''Tablets of Destiny''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-sux|{{cuneiform|𒁾𒉆𒋻𒊏}}}} {{transl|sux|''[[𒁾|dub]] namtarak''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.6.3&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc&amp;lineid=c163.B.1#c163.B.1|title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature|website=etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;; {{lang-akk|ṭup šīmātu, ṭuppi šīmāti|script=Latn|italic=yes}}) was envisaged as a [[clay tablet]] inscribed with [[cuneiform]] writing, also impressed with [[cylinder seal]]s, which, as a permanent legal document, conferred upon the god [[Enlil]] his supreme authority as ruler of the universe. 

In the [[Sumerian language | Sumerian]] poem ''[[Ninurta and the Turtle]]'' it is the god [[Enki]], rather than Enlil, who holds the tablet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.6.3# | title = Oxford}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both this poem and the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Anzû poem]] share concern of the theft of the tablet by the bird [[Imdugud]] (Sumerian) or [[Anzû]] (Akkadian).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Black | first2 = A | last2 = Green | title = Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary | place = London | publisher = British Museum Press | year = 1992 | contribution = Tablet of Destinies}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, whoever possessed the tablet ruled the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Antiqillum | url = http://www.antiqillum.com/texts/2_BS/2_BS_Ver_5_Part_One.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Babylonia]]n ''[[Enuma Elish]]'', [[Tiamat]] bestows this tablet on [[Kingu]] and gives him command of her army. [[Marduk]], the chosen champion of the gods, then fights and destroys [[Tiamat]] and her army. Marduk reclaims the Tablet of Destinies for himself, thereby strengthening his rule among the gods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="851">In [[South Africa]]n English, a '''tagati''' is a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]], [[witch]], or a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others or who uses [[poison]]s and [[familiar spirit]]s to carry out harmful deeds. The term is first recorded in 1836; it derives from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word ''umthakathi'', being someone who mixes [[medicine]]. The word ''umthakathi'' (plural ''abathakathi'') itself comes from two Zulu words ''thaka'' (mix) and ''[[muthi]]'' (medicine). 

The term has gradually come to be used to refer only to negative, harmful uses of medicines derived from plants, animals and minerals.

The '''Taran Panth''', also known as '''Taran Svami Panth''', '''Taran Samaj''' or '''Taranapanthi''', is a sect of [[Digambara]] [[Jainism]] founded by [[Taran Svami]] in [[Bundelkhand]] in central India in c. 1505 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Smarika, Sarva Dharma Sammelan, 1974, Taran Taran Samaj, Jabalpur&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taran Svami==
{{main|Taran Svami}}
Taran Svami was a Jain religious teacher and founder of the Taran Panth. He lived in the 15th century central India. The traditional biographies places him within the Digambara mystic tradition. They also consider him as a ritual reformer for rejecting the authority of [[Bhattaraka]]s and his emphasis on [[aniconism]] and inner realization. He is credited with writing fourteen texts.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=264-277}}

==Texts==
{{Jainism}}
The following fourteen texts are credited to Taran Svami. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of ''Thikanesara'' (now at Khurai temple).{{snf|Cort|2006|p=277-278}} Scholars have expressed doubts about his authorship of the ''Chadmastha Vani'' as it cites his death and of the ''Nama Mala'' as it contains names of his disciples. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of ''Thikanesara'' (now at Khurai temple).{{snf|Cort|2006|p=277}}

* ''Vicara mata'' (Reflections)
** ''Malarohana'' ("Garland offering")
** ''Pandita Puja'' ("Wise worship")
** ''Kamala Battisi'' ("Lotus thirty-two [verses]")
* ''Acara mata'' (Conduct)
** ''Shravakacara'' ("Lay conduct")
* ''Sara mata'' (Essential teachings)
** ''Jñana Samuccaya Sara'' ("Collected essence of knowledge")
** ''Tribhangi Sara'' ("Essence in triads")
** ''Upadesha Shuddha Sara'' ("Pure essence of the teachings")
* ''Mamala mata'' (Spiritual purity)
** ''Mamala Pahuda'' ("Handbook on purity")
** ''Caubisa Thana'' ("Twenty-four topics")
* ''Kevala mata'' (Enlightenment)
** ''Chadmastha Vani'' ("Sayings of the unliberated")
** ''Nama Mala'' ("Garland of names")
** ''Khatika Vishesa'' ("Special uprooter")
** ''Siddha Subhava'' ("Nature of the perfected soul")
** ''Sunna Subhava'' ("Nature of emptiness")

The three texts in the ''Vicara mata'' category are thirty-two verse compositions. They are the most popular texts of Taran Svami. ''Malarohana'' was composed for the marriage of Taran Svami's followers, according to the tradition. It is still read during marriage of the followers. Premi had said that during [[Daslakshana]],  the followers gather in the temple and recite ''Pandita Puja'' and ''Mamalapahuda'' in day and ''Malarohana'' and ''Kamala Battisi'' at night. K. Samaiya had equated them with [[Ratnatraya]]. Some members recite some of these texts daily.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=278}}

Other texts are not well-known. ''Sravakacara'' has 462 verses which defines code of conduct for lay followers which draws from earlier Digambara text ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]''. The ''Jñana Samuccaya Sara'' has 908 verses, and the ''Upadesha Shuddha Sara'' has 588 verses. These two texts discuss the Digambara philosophy and metaphysics. The ''Jñana Samuccaya Sara'' discusses ''[[Ratnatraya]]'', scriptures, the stages of lay spirituality, [[Ethics of Jainism|''Anuvrata'' and ''Mahavrata'']], seven types of Jain philosophy, ''[[Dravya]]'', ''Dhyana '' etc. The ''Upadesha Shuddha Sara'' discusses the path of liberation and its hurdles. The ''Tribhangi Sara'' has 71 verses which discusses the topics in triads. These four texts are close to the Digambara tradition of philosophy.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=278-279}}

The ''Mamala Pahuda'' is a collection of songs. It has more than 3,200 verses. The ''Caubisa Thana'' discusses 24 topics of spirituality to gain liberation. It is mix of prose and verse and about 20 pages in total.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=279}}

The ''Chadmastha Vani'' and ''Nama Mala'' are short prose texts about nine pages. It has information on Taran Svami and his followers and other subjects. Premi had said that ''Chadmastha Vani'' is recited by followers for five days after [[Diwali]]. The ''Khatika Vishesa'' discusses about ''Karma'' in context of the cycle of time. It is mix of prose and verse. The ''Siddha Subhava'' and ''Sunna Subhava'' are short prose. The ''Siddha Subhava'' discusses the purification of soul while the ''Sunna Subhav'' discusses ways of destoying ego.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=279}}

Commentaries on six of the main texts composed by Taran Svami were written by Brahmacari Shitala Prasad in the 1930s. Commentaries on other texts have also been done recently. [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh|Osho]] (Rajnish), who was born into a Taranpanthi family, has included ''Sunna Subhava'' and ''Siddhi Subhava'' as among the books that influenced him most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osho.nl/New-Osho-NL/EnglBooks/BooksIHave.htm |title=Books I have Loved |publisher=Osho.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517013255/http://www.osho.nl/New-Osho-NL/EnglBooks/BooksIHave.htm |archivedate=17 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After death of Taran Svami, the history of the sect is unclear. The ''Nam Mala'' contains around 2000 names but its significance is unclear. Based on oral traditions, Taran Svami had disciples from varied classes and castes. His disciples were from Jain as well from non-Jain background. Some of his disciples had Muslim background. No scholarly study has constructed the early history of Taran Panth due to clear lack of literary tradition. The religious profession is also unclear in the sect. There were some associated with ''Nisaiji'' temples. There are no monks in the sect but they had some lay celibates (''Brahmachari'' and ''Brahmacharini''s).{{snf|Cort|2006|p=280-282}}

Today a large number of the followers of Taran Panth come from six merchant castes of [[Bundelkhand]] region of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Three of these – Samaiya, Dosakhe and Gulalare – were converts from [[Murtipujaka]] Jain communities, and the other three – Asethi, Ayodhyavasi and Carnagar – were converts from [[Vaishnava]] Hindu communities as informed to Jain scholar Cort. The total number of the followers of the Taran Panth range from 20,000 to 100,000. R. Samaiya had listed 131 temples and the number of followers just under 20,000 in 1989. Majority of the followers reside in Madhya Pradesh and some in south [[Uttar Pradesh]] and northwest [[Maharashtra]].{{snf|Cort|2006|p=281-282}}

==Pilgrimage sites and temples==
[[File:NisaiJiBina.jpg|thumb|Nisaiji, built by Tarachand Mallusav, 1817.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=285}}]]

The most important site is located in Malhargadh village in [[Guna district]] where Taran Svami spent his final years and where his last rites were performed. The shrine known as Nisaiji ("Honoured Memorial") is on the banks of the Betwa river.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=282}} The three-days annual fair known as Phag Phulna ("Phag Flowering") is orhanised from [[Falgun]] Bright Fifth. In the past, there was an annual fair organised in honour of one of his Muslim disciple Ruiya Raman or Ruiya Jin but it is discontinued. Many followers visit here for [[Chudakarana]] ritual of their children. The shrine has stone windows and high canopies built in "late medieval Rajput" style. The style became standard for other shrines. The history of the site is written by Phulchandra who says that the shrine was initially just a ''chhatri'' (canopy). In 1817,  Taracand Mallusav, a merchant from [[Nagpur]] rebuilt the shrine in its current form, the platform with twelve doors and several canopies. He had sponsored the annual fair and one of his family member, Kesaridau, died here. The shrine is simple and has a central marble altar which houses a pile of printed books. Behind it, there is an older stone altar which is considered as the original one. There are a records of patrons of fair from 1817. Since 1933, the fair is organised by the community. There are no images due to Taran Svami's emphasis on aniconism. There are three stone platforms in the Betwa river associated with events in his life.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283-285}}

Semarkheri located near Sironj in [[Vidisha district]] has a shrine built by [[Banjara]]s. Here he spent some time engaging in spiritual activities. The annual fair is organised on [[Vasant Panchami]]. It is oldest shrine after Nisaiji and has records of the patrons of the fair dating back to 1881.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=282-283}} Sukha near Pathariya village in [[Damoh district]] where Taran Svami preached. The old site was in dilapidated condition before the new constructions started in 1938. The annual fair is organised on Agahan Bright Seventh (November–December). The day of fair known as ''Taran Jayanti'' and is of recent origin. The shrine at Bilhari village near Katni in [[Jabalpur district]] is associated with birth of Taran Svami. The site became focus of community only recently and no annual fair is organised here.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283}}

There is a memorial dedicated to Himau Pande, one of Taran Svami's chief disciple at Chand village in [[Chhindwara district]]. The site only recently became a focus of development by local followers. There was only large platform in the past but now a large temple is built. The annual fair is organised on Jeth Dark Sixth, known as Samadhi Sixth, the death anniversary of Himau Pande.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283}}

There is also a large platform at Garaula (or Garhaula), near Tindua in [[Damoh district]] which is associated with Taran Svami's childhood days at his maternal uncle's house.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283}}

The temples are fairly simple in design with open spaces and least ornamentation. The marble altars in temple has symbols associated with generalized auspiciousness. Due to aniconic emphasis, there are no images placed in the temples. Sometimes the altar has books of Taran Svami and of other writers from Digambara mystic and philosophical traditions.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=286}}

==Rituals and practices==
The order of the services were organised by Jayasagar in the mid-twentieth century.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=288}}

The temple rituals are as follows: The follower enters the temple and bows to the altar as the sign of respect then recites three verses drawn from Taran Svami's texts known as ''Tatva Patha'' or ''Tatva Mangal'' in front of the altar. This is followed by singing ''[[Bhajan]]''s or hymns. If there is a sermon, ''bhaiji'' or ''pande'',  a local intellectual associated with temple or other intellectuals known as ''[[pandit|pundit]]'' will deliver sermons to seated followers. The sermon ends with everyone standing and singing a hymn known as ''Abalabali''. The ritual ends with the ''[[Arati]]''. The ''Arati'' has two parts; the first one is dedicated to ''Dev'' (God), ''Guru'' (teacher) and scriptures while the other part is dedicated to Taran Svami.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=290-291}}

The '''Vaikunda Malai''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:வைகுண்ட மலை) is a hill which is part of the [[Mahendragiri|Mahendragiri Hills]] situated near [[Athala vilai]] of [[Kanyakumari district]] in the [[Western Ghats]] of [[India]]. This hill has religious importance in the [[Ayyavazhi]] religion during the festival of [[Ayya Vaikunda Avataram]], the day of incarnation of [[Ayya Vaikundar]]. 

During the celebration, two processions, one from [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and other from [[Tiruchendur]], reach Athala vilai and circle the hill. A Jyothi (flame) is lit at the top of this hill to symbolise the birth of [[Vaikundar]]. 

Unlike other Ayyavazhi holy places, Vaikunda Malai is not mentioned in the [[Ayyavazhi scriptures]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1840">'''Valash''' ([[Middle Persian]]: Wardākhsh/Walākhsh, {{lang-fa|بلاش}}), was an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] prince from the [[House of Karen]], who later became the ruler of [[Tabaristan]] in 665.

He was the grandson of the nobleman Adhar Valash, and thus a descendant of [[Sukhra]], a prominent Iranian nobleman who controlled much of the affairs of the Sasanian Empire. In 665, Valash murdered [[Farrukhzad]] who was the ruler of Tabaristan, and then conquered him domains, thus becoming the sole ruler of Tabaristan. Farrukhzad's son, [[Surkhab I]], then fled to a Bavand stronghold in [[Mazandaran]] to avoid Valash. In 673, Surkhab avenged his father by killing Valash, and then reconquered Tabaristan from Valash.

'''Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|eɪ|d|oʊ|_|ˈ|m|ʊ|t|w|ə}} (born 21 July 1921) is a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] [[Traditional healers of South Africa|sangoma]] (traditional healer) from [[South Africa]]. He is known as an author of books on stories mixing traditional [[Bantu mythology|Zulu folklore]], [[Reptilian humanoid|extraterrestrial]] encounters and his own personal encounters. His most recent work is a graphic novel called the ''Tree of Life Trilogy'' based on his writings of his most famous book, ''Indaba my Children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tree of life Trilogy|url=http://vusamazulu.com/|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credo calls himself a ''sanusi'' (common spelling ''isanuse'') which is a type of Zulu diviner or sangoma. The term stems from a more historic time and is not widely used today, even in a traditional setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who Southern Africa - Credo Mutwa|url=http://whoswho.co.za/credo-mutwa-3255|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HT:55"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flint|first1=Karen|title=Healing Traditions: African Medicine, Cultural Exchange, and Competition in South Africa, 1820-1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNpVU0fllzgC&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;ots=TbVdk_Smz2&amp;dq=isanuse&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q=isanuse&amp;f=false|publisher=Ohio University Press|accessdate=6 September 2014|year=2008|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credo currently lives with his wife, Virginia, in [[Kuruman]] where they run a [[hospice]] clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/vusamazulu-credo-mutwa|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
His father was a widower with three surviving children when he met his mother. His father was a builder and a [[Christian]] and his mother was a young Zulu girl. Caught between [[Catholic]] missionaries on one hand, and a stubborn old Zulu warrior, Credo Mutwa's maternal grandfather, his parents had no choice but to separate. Credo was born out of wedlock, which caused a great scandal in the village and his mother was thrown out by her father. Later he was taken in by one of his aunts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_credo_mutwa04.htm Credo Mutwa biography.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was subsequently raised by his father's brother and was taken to the South Coast of [[Natal Province|Natal]] (present day [[KwaZulu-Natal]]), near the northern bank of the [[Mkomazi River]]. He did not attend school until he was 14 years old. In 1935 his father found a building job in the old [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] province and the whole family relocated to where he was building.

After falling severely ill, he was taken back to KwaZulu-Natal by his uncle.  Where Christian doctors had failed, his grandfather, a man whom his father despised as a heathen and demon worshipper, helped him back to health. At this point Credo began to question many of the things about his people the missionaries would have them believe. "Were we Africans really a race of primitives who possessed no knowledge at all before the white man came to Africa?" he asked himself. His grandfather instilled in him the belief that his illness was a sacred calling that he was to become a [[sangoma]], a healer. He underwent ''thwasa'' (sangoma training and initiation) with his grandfather and mother's sister, a young [[sangoma]] named Mynah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mutwa|first=Credo|year=1996|title=Zulu Shaman|publisher=Destiny Books|isbn=0-89281-129-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kwa-Khaya Lendaba cultural village==
[[File:Credo_Mutwa_Cultural_Village_Soweto.jpg|thumb|right|[[Traditional healers of South Africa#Thwasa and initiation|Initiation]] area of the Kwa-Khaya Lendaba Cultural village in [[Soweto]]]]In 1974, Credo obtained a piece of land on the [[Harry Frederick Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] gardens in [[Soweto]] in order to create an African cultural village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credo Mutwa Cultural Village and Oppenheimer Tower|url=http://www.heritagecollection.co.za/detail/items/credo-mutwa-cultural-village-and-Oppenheimer-Tower.html|publisher=Moja Heritage Collection|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created many sculptures and populated the village with huts and symbols that he claimed was secret African mythology.  The village was primary designed for tourism to promote African culture and was generally ignored by the Sowetan locals, partly due to the unfamiliarity of the mythology that was being represented.&lt;ref name="RVMP:186"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stier|first1=Oren Baruch|last2=Landres|first2=J. Shawn|title=Religion, Violence, Memory, and Place|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mG3jxSTEHo4C&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Indiana University Press|accessdate=6 September 2014|year=2006|pages=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credo believed that the [[Soweto uprising|great unrest]] in Johannesburg and the popularisation of [[South African Communist Party|communism]] in the black struggle drew Africans away from their traditional roots.  Unlike most political activists, he actually supported a [[Bantustan|separation]] between [[White Africans of European ancestry|white]] and [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|black]] in order to preserve black traditional tribal customs and way of life.&lt;ref name="RVMP:186"/&gt; In 1976, students partially burnt down the cultural village after he was misquoted on [[Afrikaans]] radio, as they saw the village promoting tribalism and separate development.&lt;ref name="RVMP:186"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="CP"&gt;{{cite web|title=The rich heritage of Credo Mutwa|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/lifestyle/the-rich-heritage-of-credo-mutwa-20120720/|date=20 July 2012|publisher=City Press|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parts of the village was burnt again in the mid 80's during a strike against the West Rand city council.&lt;ref Name="CP"/&gt;

[[File:Credo_Mutwa_Sculpture.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of King Khandakhulu discussing his [[sexually transmitted infection]] with his gods]]
Following the murder of his son by black political "activists" and the second burning of his village, Credo moved away from Soweto and developed a cultural tourist village in Lotlamoreng, [[Mahikeng]], (known at that time as [[Bophuthatswana]]). Here he supervised the building of small cultural villages, each representing the traditional cultures of the main [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|South African tribal peoples]].&lt;ref name="RVMP:186"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credo Mutwa|url=http://www.inspirational-black-literature.com/credo-mutwa.html|publisher=Inspirational Black Literature|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahikeng - North West Province|url=http://www.tourismnorthwest.co.za/mafikeng/|publisher=Tourism North West Province|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kwa-Khaya Lendaba cultural village in Soweto is currently being restored and is still open to the public free of charge. Tour guides are available from the caretaker of the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credo Mutwa Cultural Village|url=http://www.southafrica.net/media/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-credo-mutwa-cultural-village|publisher=South African Tourism|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prophetic Sculptures===
Although many of the sculptures at Kwa-Khaya Lendaba were unfamiliar to the Africans they were meant to represent, a number of them have been said to be prophetic in nature.  Most notably, was claims of predicting the coming of [[HIV/AIDS]] to South Africa.  This was seen in his fictional sculptures of King Khandakhulu, who had 200 wives.  He couldn't satisfy them all sexually, and so they went out and satisfied themselves elsewhere, which led to them all contracting incurable [[sexually transmitted infections]].  The sores on King Khandakhulu's penis resemble the [[Red ribbon|AIDS ribbon]].  These sculpture were created in 1979, 3 years before scientists uncovered the human immunodeficiency virus.&lt;ref Name="CP"/&gt;  Claims of his other predictions include the destruction of World Trade Centres in the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Chris Hani|Chris Hani’s]] assassination and the ousting of president [[Thabo Mbeki]], among others.&lt;ref Name="CP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mbeki's Darkest Hour: sangoma predicted his ouster in 1999|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/zuma27.18898.html|date=13 November 2009|publisher=New Zimbabwe.com|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional treatments of HIV/AIDS==
Credo has been an active and vocal advocate in the use of [[traditional African medicine]]s for the treatment of [[HIV/AIDS]], [[cancer]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicinal plant fights Aids|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1683259.stm|date=30 November 2001|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created a trust called the Vulinda Trust in 1999 to preserve traditional knowledge and to promote the use of these traditional medicines.  The primary focus of his research has been on a South African plant called ''unwele'' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]] ([[Sutherlandia frutescens]]).  Unwele is traditionally used as a well being tonic, however has demonstrated anticancer activity through [[in vitro]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=van Wyk|first1=Ben-Erik|last2=van Oudtshoorn|first2=Bosch|last3=Gericke|first3=Nigel|year=1999|title=Medicinal Plants of South Africa|page=280|location=Pretoria|publisher=Briza Publications|isbn=978-1-875093-37-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tai|first1=Joseph|last2=Cheung|first2=Susan|last3=Chan|first3=Edwin|title=In vitro culture studies of Sutherlandia frutescens on human tumor cell lines|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=93|issue=1|pages=9–19|date=8 June 2004|issn=0378-8741|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2004.02.028|pmid=15182898}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research of the efficacy of [[Sutherlandia frutescens]] in the treatment of [[HIV/AIDS]] is ongoing and [[Phases of clinical research|phase IIb trials]] are being conducted at the South African Herbal Science and Medicine Institute (SAHSMI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Quinton |last2= Syce|first2=James|last3= Nell|first3=Haylene|title=A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Lessertia frutescens in Healthy Adults|journal=PLoS Clinical Trials|volume=2|issue=4|pages=16|date=27 April 2007|doi=10.1371/journal.pctr.0020016|pmc=1863514|pmid=17476314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sutherlandia plant begins HIV drug safety trials|url=http://www.scidev.net/global/indigenous/news/-i-sutherlandia-i-plant-begins-hiv-drug-safety-trials.html|date=10 February 2011|publisher=SciDev Net|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Reptilian Agenda'==

Mutwa has allied himself with [[David Icke]]'s theory of a 'reptilian agenda' - i.e. that "a reptilian extraterrestrial race has controlled the world for thousands of years".&lt;ref&gt;[http://credomutwa.com/interviews/david-icke-interview-reptilian-agenda/ David Icke interview – Reptilian Agenda]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/31805036 Credo Mutwa &amp; David Icke - The Reptilian Agenda]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_credo_mutwa03.htm Credo Mutwa on Alien Abduction an Reptiles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24764371?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Credo Mutwa, Zulu Shaman: ''The Invention and Appropriation of Indigenous Authenticity in African Folk Religion'', David Chidester, ''Journal for the Study of Religion''

The '''World Council of Churches''' ('''WCC''') is a worldwide inter-church organization founded in 1948. Its members today include the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], most jurisdictions of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Old Catholic Church]], [[Anglican Communion]], most mainline [[Protestant]] churches (such as the [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran]], [[Mennonite]], [[World Methodist Council|Methodist]], [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] and [[World Communion of Reformed Churches|Reformed]]) and some [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Protestant churches (such as the [[Baptist World Alliance|Baptist]] and [[Pentecostal]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/list |title=Member list — World Council of Churches |first= |last= |work=oikoumene.org |year=2014 |accessdate=2014-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the [[Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] is not a member, although it sends accredited observers to meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Livingstone ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' OUP(1974) art.&lt;/ref&gt; The WCC arose out of the [[ecumenical movement]] and has as its basis the following statement:

{{quote|The World Council of Churches is a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior according to the scriptures, and therefore seek to fulfill together their common calling to the glory of the one God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

It is a community of churches on the way to visible unity in one faith and one eucharistic fellowship, expressed in worship and in common life in Christ. It seeks to advance towards this unity, as Jesus prayed for his followers, "so that the world may believe." (John 17:21)

The WCC describes itself as "a worldwide fellowship of 349 global, regional and sub-regional, national and local churches seeking unity, a common witness and Christian service."&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.oikoumene.org/index.php?2070&amp;backPID=2046&amp;alp=A&amp;aalp=A&amp;tt_products=343 single].

==History==
The [[Christian ecumenism|Ecumenical Movement]] met with initial successes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] of 1910 (chaired by future WCC Honorary President [[John R. Mott]]). In 1920, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Germanus V of Constantinople]], wrote a letter "addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded [[League of Nations]]".&lt;ref name="Ware1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Kallistos|title=The Orthodox Church|date=29 April 1993|publisher=Penguin Adult|isbn=9780140146561|page=322|quote=From the beginning of the twentieth century the Ecumenical Patriarchate has shown a special concern for Christian reconciliation. At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Eastern Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937. The Ecumenical Patriarchate also participated in the first Assembly of the WCC at Amsterdam in 1948, and has been a consistent supporter of the work of the WCC ever since.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church leaders agreed in 1937 to establish a World Council of Churches, based on a merger of the ''[[Faith and Order Movement]]'' (under [[Charles Brent]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] of the United States) and ''[[Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work Movement]]'' (under [[Nathan Söderblom]] of the Lutheran [[Church of Sweden]]) organisations.

Its official establishment was deferred with the outbreak of [[World War II]] until August 23, 1948. Delegates of 147 churches assembled in [[Amsterdam]] to merge the ''Faith and Order Movement'' and ''Life and Work Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/who-are-we/background/history/assemblies.html|title=WCC Assemblies 1948 - today|publisher=World Council of Churches|accessdate=2011-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908154936/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/who-are-we/background/history/assemblies.html|archive-date=2011-09-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was consolidated by a second meeting at [[Lund]] in 1950, for which the British Methodist [[Robert Newton Flew]] edited an influential volume of studies, ''The Nature of the Church''.&lt;ref&gt;Flew's ODNB entry: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39614 Retrieved 18 September 2011. Subscription required.]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent mergers were with the ''International Missionary Council'' in 1961 and the ''World Council of Christian Education'', with its roots in the 18th century [[Sunday School]] movement, in 1971.

WCC member churches include most of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches; the [[Anglican Communion]]; some [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] churches; and numerous [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, including some [[Baptists]], many [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], and [[Presbyterian]] and other [[Reformed churches|Reformed]], a sampling of [[United and uniting churches|united]] and independent churches, and some [[Pentecostal]] churches.

Many churches who refused to join the WCC joined together to form the [[World Evangelical Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldea.org/|title=WEA - World Evangelical Alliance Est 1846|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegates sent from the member churches meet every seven or eight years in an Assembly, which elects a Central Committee that governs between Assemblies. A variety of other committees and commissions answer to the Central Committee and its staff. Assemblies have been held since 1948.

The "human rights abuses in communist countries evoked grave concern among the leaders of the World Council of Churches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 1|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195334027|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian Christopher Andrew claims that, during the Cold War, a number of important WCC representatives of the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe had been working for the KGB, and that they influenced the policy of the WCC.&lt;ref name= andrew&gt;Christopher Andrew, "KGB Foreign Intelligence from Brezhnev to the Coup"', in: Wesley K. Wark (ed), ''Espionage: past, present, future?'', Routledge, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vmXGUkB4ZKQC&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;ots=xqRHJMaERR&amp;dq=wcc%20kgb&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=wcc%20kgb&amp;f=false p. 52]: "One recently declassified document of 1969 describes the work of five KGB agents on the WCC Central Committee and the appointment of another to a 'high WCC post'. A similar report from 1989 claims that, as a result of agent operations to implement 'a plan approved by the KGB leadership', the WCC Executive and Central Committee adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three) which corresponded to the political course of Socialist [Communist] countries'. While it would be naive to take such boasting entirely a face value, there can be little doubt about the reality of Soviet penetration of the WCC."&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 to 1958, [[Robert S. Bilheimer]] co-chaired a WCC international commission to prepare a document addressing the threat of [[nuclear warfare]] during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=194|title=Cold War Christians and the Spectre of Nuclear Deterrence, 1945-1959|author=Jonathan Gorry|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2013|isbn=113733424X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1961 conference, a 32-year-old Russian Orthodox Bishop named Aleksey Ridiger was sent as delegate to the assembly, and then appointed to the WCC's central committee.

==Commissions and teams==
There are two complementary approaches to ecumenism: dialogue and action. The ''Faith and Order Movement'' and ''Life and Work Movement'' represent these approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/faith/whatis-e.html|title=World Council of Churches — World Council of Churches|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are reflected in the work of the WCC in its [http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/who/commissions.html commissions], these being:
*Echos- Commission on Youth (ages 18–30)
*Commission of the Churches on Diakonia and Development
*Commission on Education and Ecumenical Formation
*Commission of the Churches on International Affairs
*Commission on Justice, Peace and Creation
*Commission on World Mission and Evangelism
*Faith and Order Plenary Commission and the Faith and Order Standing Commission
*Joint Consultative Group with Pentecostals
*Joint Working Group WCC – Catholic Church (Vatican)
*Reference Group on the Decade to Overcome Violence
*Reference Group on Inter-Religious Relations
*Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC

===Diakonia and development and international relations commissions===
The WCC acts through both its member churches and other religious and social organizations to coordinate ecumenical, evangelical, and social action.

Current WCC programs include a [[Decade to Overcome Violence]], an international campaign to combat [[AIDS|AIDS/HIV]] in [[Africa]] and the ''Justice, Peace and Creation'' initiative.

===Faith and Order Commission===
{{main|Faith and Order Commission}}
WCC's [[Faith and Order Commission]] has been successful in working toward consensus on [[Baptism]], [[Eucharist]], and [[Christian ministry|Ministry]], on the date of [[Easter]], on the nature and purpose of the [[Christian church|church]] ([[ecclesiology]]), and on ecumenical [[hermeneutics]].

===Justice, Peace and Creation Commission===
Justice, Peace and Creation has drawn many elements together with an [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] focus. Its mandate is:

{{quote|To analyze and reflect on justice, peace and creation ''in their interrelatedness'', to promote values and practices that make for a culture of peace, and to work towards a culture of solidarity with young people, women, Indigenous Peoples and racially and ethnically oppressed people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/jpc/index-e.html|title=World Council of Churches — World Council of Churches|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Focal issues have been [[globalization]] and the emergence of [[new social movements]] (in terms of people ''bonding together'' in the struggle for justice, peace, and the protection of creation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Relations with the Catholic Church===
The largest Christian body, the [[Catholic Church]], is not a member of the WCC, but has worked closely with the Council for more than three decades and sends observers to all major WCC conferences as well as to its Central Committee meetings and the Assemblies (cf. [[Joint Working Group between the Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches|Joint Working Group]]).

The [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] also nominates 12 members to the WCC's ''Faith and Order Commission'' as full members. While not a member of the WCC, the Catholic Church is a member of some other ecumenical bodies at regional and national levels, for example, the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]] and the National Council of Christian Churches in Brazil (CONIC).

Pope Pious XI stated in 1928, that the only means by which the world Christian community was to return to faith, was to return to Roman Catholic Worship. In this regard, there was the idea that the Papacy had rejected, to a great extent; the participation of the Catholic Church within the World Council of Churches. 
Pious stated that the ‘One true Church’ was that of the Roman Catholic denomination, and therefore there was the implication that the Catholic Church was not permitted at this stage to engage with other denominations, which the Papacy considered to be irrelevant. The Catholic Church therefore did not attend the 1948 meeting of the WCC, in addition to the idea that all members of the church were barred from attending WCC conferences. 

Pope John Paul XXIII took a different stance however, and in 1958 he was elected as the head of the Catholic Church. Ecumenism was a new element of catholic ideology which had been permitted, which was signified to a great extent, when John Paul XXIII met with the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher. This was the first meeting between an Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Pope in the Vatican for 600 years. John Paul XXIII later developed the office of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity; which symbolised a dramatic shift in support for the ecumenical movement, from the Catholic Church, led from the Vatican. 1961 saw Catholic members attend the Delhi conference of the WCC, which masked a significant shift in attitude toward the WCC from the Papacy. There was the idea in addition to this, that the Pope invited non-Catholics to attend the Vatican II council. This new approach to inter-denominational relations was marked within the Unitatis Redintegratino. 

This document marked several key reforms within the Catholic approach: 

I.	‘Separated brethren’ was the new term for non-catholics, as opposed to the previously used ‘heretics’ 

II.	Both catholic and non- catholic elements are held responsible for the schism between Catholicism and the Protestant movement

III.	Non-catholics are recognised to the contributions that they make to Christian belief overall 

IV.	The Catholic Church is no longer identified as the one true source of Christian knowledge 

Further reforms have been enacted with regard to the nature of the Catholic Church on the world stage, for instance the 1965 union with the Patriarch of Constantinople, whereby the 1054 schism was undermined. In addition to this, Michael Ramsay, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, received an episcopal ring in 1966; a mark of union which had not been seen since prior to the reformation. Moreover, the Anglican, Roman-Catholic Internaitonal Committee was additionally established as a means of promoting communication and cohesion between the two denominations. This has since marked a new level of participation of the Catholic Faith in the aforementioned ecumenical movement, and therefore is the basis for increased participation from the faith, in the WCC.

===Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC===
A ''Special Commission'' was set up by the eighth Harare Assembly in December 1998 to address Orthodox concerns about WCC membership and the Council's decision-making style, public statements, worship practices, and other issues. It issued its final report in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=World Council of Churches|title=Final report of the Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/assembly/2006-porto-alegre/3-preparatory-and-background-documents/final-report-of-the-special-commission-on-orthodox-participation-in-the-wcc|website=World Council of Churches|publisher=World Council of Churches|accessdate=2014-08-30|date=14 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific issues that it clarified were that the WCC does not formulate doctrine, does not have authority to rule on moral issues, nor does it have any ecclesiastical authority. Such authority is entirely internal to each individual member church. It proposed that the WCC adopt a [[consensus]] method of decision making. It proposed that Orthodox members be brought in parity with non-Orthodox members. It further proposed clarification that inter-confessional prayer at WCC events is not worship, particularly "it should avoid giving the impression of being the worship of a church", and confessional and inter-confessional prayer each be specifically identified as such at WCC events. It also clarified that the so-called "Lima Liturgy" is not an interfaith [[eucharist]]ic service: 'the WCC is not 'hosting' a eucharist'.

==Peace journalism==
The WCC is also a prominent supporter and practitioning body for [[Peace journalism]]: journalism practice that aims to avoid a value bias in favor of violence that often characterizes coverage of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingviolence.org/en/peace-convocation/preparatory-process/living-letters-visits.html|title=Living Letters visits to churches|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs and related organizations==
The [[ACT Alliance]], bringing together over 100 church-backed relief and development organizations worldwide, was born out of the merger of ACT International (Action by Churches Together International) and ACT Development ([[Action by Churches Together for Development]]) in March 2010. Both [[ACT International]], established in 1995, and [[ACT Development]] (2007) were created through the leadership of the World Council of Churches (WCC). The two bodies coordinated the work of agencies related to the member churches of the WCC and the Lutheran World Federation in the areas of humanitarian emergencies and poverty reduction respectively.&lt;ref name="oikoumene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/eng/a/article/1634/churches-launch-major-hum.html|publisher=oikoumene.org|title=WCC press release: Churches launch major humanitarian alliance (24/03/2010)|accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance]] was officially founded in December 2000 at a meeting convened by the WCC. There are currently 73 churches and Christian organizations that are members of the Alliance, from Catholic, Evangelical, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. These members, representing a combined constituency of tens of millions of people around the world, are committed to working together in public witness and action for justice on defined issues of common concern. Current campaigns are on Food and on HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref name="oikoumene2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/eng/a/article/1634/christian-alliance-for-ad.html|publisher=oikoumene.org|title=WCC press release: Christian alliance for advocacy marks successes, future challenges (09/12/2010)|accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ecumenical Church Loan Fund (ECLOF) was founded in 1946 as one of the world's first international micro-credit institutions in the service of the poor. [[Willem Visser 't Hooft]], then general secretary of the "WCC in process of formation" played an important role in founding ECLOF. It was he who sketched the prospects and challenges for the proposed institution and gave specific ideas on potential sources of funds. His inspiration and teamwork marked the beginning of a long and fruitful cooperation between ECLOF and the WCC.&lt;ref name="eclof"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclof.org/archiv/english/newhorizon/nheng20/wccbday.htm|publisher=eclof.org|title=ECLOF press release: Happy Birthday WCC! (Dec. 1998)|accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ecumenical Development Cooperative Society U.A (now known as [[Oikocredit]]) was developed from discussions at the 1968 Uppsala 4th Assembly, regarding church divestment from financial institutions supporting apartheid-era South Africa and the war in Vietnam. After several years of planning, the cooperative society was founded in 1975 in the Netherlands to provide an alternative ethical investment vehicle to church institutions, by providing credit to productive enterprises serving economically disadvantaged populations. Originally organized for large institutional members of the WCC, by 1976 local congregations developed Support Associations to enable congregations as well as individuals to participate. EDCS became independent from the WCC in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikocredit.coop/about-us/history|title=History of Oikocredit|author=Oikocredit|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ecumenical News International]] (ENI) was launched in 1994 as a global news service reporting on ecumenical developments and other news of the churches, and giving religious perspectives on news developments worldwide. The joint sponsors of ENI, which was based at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, are the World Council of Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and the Conference of European Churches, which also have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eni.ch/information/introduction.shtml|title=eni.ch|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shortage of funds led to the suspension of the work of ENI in 2012.&lt;ref name="christianpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ecumenical-news-international-suspends-operations-82587/|publisher=christianpost.com|title=Ecumenical News International Suspends Operations|accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 ENI remains closed.

==Regional/national councils==
The WCC has not sought the organic union of different Christian denominations, but it has, however, facilitated dialogue and supported local, national, and regional dialogue and cooperation.

Membership in a regional or national council does not mean that the particular group is also a member of the WCC.

==Criticism==

===Alleged neglect of suffering church in Eastern Europe===

Many historians, the U.S. State Department and former KGB officers themselves have alleged and provided corroborating evidence that the KGB's influence directly, or through lobbying by means of a front organization, the Christian Peace Conference, resulted in the WCC's failure to recognize or act on calls for help from persecuted East European Christians at the 1983 Vancouver General Assembly.&lt;ref name= "active"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jmw.typepad.com/files/state-department---a-report-on-active-measures-and-propaganda.pdf | title = Soviet Influences: A Report on Active Measures and Propaganda 1986-7 | work= US State Department Report | date= August 1987 | page= 12 |accessdate=2015-02-27| archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20150227052417/http://jmw.typepad.com/files/state-department---a-report-on-active-measures-and-propaganda.pdf | archivedate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "mitrokhin" /&gt;{{rp|647–8}}

It is claimed the [[KGB]] has infiltrated and influenced past WCC councils and policy.&lt;ref name=andrew /&gt; In 1992, Father [[Gleb Yakunin]], a vice Chairman of a Russian parliamentary commission that investigated the activities of the KGB, citing verbatim KGB reports, claimed that its [[KGB#Directorates|Fifth Directorate]] was actively involved in influencing WCC policy from 1967 to 1989.&lt;ref name="active" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gleb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intellit.muskingum.edu/russia_folder/pcw_era/sect_16e.htm |last=Yakunin |first=Gleb |title=Argumenty i Fakty article cited in 'Soviet Active Measures in the "Post-Cold War" Era 1988-1991' - for the United States House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations by the United States Information Agency |publication-date=June 1992 |issue=1,1 |work=[[Argumenty i Fakty]] |date=January 1992 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 1983 WCC General Assembly in Vancouver, one cited document described the presence and activities of 47 KGB agents to secure the election of an "acceptable" candidate as General Secretary.&lt;ref name="gleb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polosin, Vyacheslav (Chair Russian Supreme Soviet's Committee on Denominations and Freedom of Religion), Megapolis Ekspress, January 21, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mitrokhin Archive#Penetration of churches|Mitrokhin Archive]] reveals more about the depth of the penetration and influence wielded by the KGB over the WCC.&lt;ref name="mitrokhin"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Andrew |first=Christopher |last2=Mitrokhin |first2=Vasili |title=The Mitrokhin Archive |publisher=Penguin |location=London |date=1999 |isbn=9780140284874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Nikidim was a KGB agent, codenamed ADAMANT, who served as one of six WCC Presidents from 1975 until his death.&lt;ref name="mitrokhin" /&gt;{{rp|729}}&lt;ref name="besier"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Besier |first1=Gerhard |last2=Boyens |first2=Armin |last3=Lindemann|first3=Gerhard |title=Nationaler Protestantismus und ökumenische Bewegung : kirchliches Handeln im Kalten Krieg (1945-1990) |publisher= Duncker &amp; Humblot |location=Berlin |page=1074 |date=1999 |isbn=9783428100323}}&lt;/ref&gt; His earlier intervention had resulted in the WCC making no comment on the invasion of Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="mitrokhin" /&gt;{{rp|636}} As a result of his influence and that of other agents, it is claimed the USSR was rarely publicly criticised.&lt;ref name="mitrokhin" /&gt;{{rp|637}} In 1989, copies of the KGB documents claim "the WCC executive and central committee adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three)" which corresponded to its own political direction.&lt;ref name="mitrokhin" /&gt;{{rp|637}} Appeals from suffering dissidents both from within the Russian Orthodox Church and Protestants were ignored in 1983.&lt;ref name="mitrokhin" /&gt;{{rp|647–8}} Metropolitan Aleksi Ridiger of Tallinn and Estonia was repeatedly alleged to be a KGB agent codenamed DROZDOV, who in 1988 was awarded an honorary citation for services to the KGB by its chairman.&lt;ref name="mitrokhin" /&gt;{{rp|650}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Felix Corley |title=Patriarch Alexy II: Priest who stayed close to the Kremlin while guiding the Russian Orthodox Church into the post-Soviet era |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/patriarch-alexy-ii-priest-who-stayed-close-to-the-kremlin-while-guiding-the-russian-orthodox-church-into-the-postsoviet-era-1054454.html|work=[[The Independent]] |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-06 |location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207082812/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/patriarch-alexy-ii-priest-who-stayed-close-to-the-kremlin-while-guiding-the-russian-orthodox-church-into-the-postsoviet-era-1054454.html|archivedate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CWNrep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=13868 |title=Confirmed: Russian Patriarch Worked with KGB |publisher=Catholic World News citing Keston Institute |date=2000-09-22 |accessdate=2015-03-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303223306/http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=13868|archivedate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite official disavowals, [[The Guardian]] described the evidence as "compelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/12/1 |title=Russian Patriarch "was KGB spy"] |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1999-02-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303223655/http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/12/1 |archivedate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he became [[Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow|Aleksi II]], the 15th Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.

===Attitude towards Israel===
The World Council of Churches has been described as taking an adversarial position toward the state of Israel.&lt;ref name= merkley&gt;{{Cite book | last = Merkley | first = Paul | title =  Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel | publisher = Mcgill Queens Univ Press | location = Montreal| page = 284 | date = March 1, 2007 | isbn = 9780773532557}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been claimed the council has focused particularly on activities and publications criticizing Israel in comparison with other human rights issues.&lt;ref name=vermaat&gt;{{Citation | last = Vermaat | first = J.A.Emerson  | title = The World Council of Churches, Israel and the PLO | journal = Mid-Stream | pages = 3–9 |date=November 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rottenberg"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rottenberg | first = Isaac| title = The Turbulent Triangle: Christians-Jews-Israel: A Personal-Historical Account | publisher = Red Mountain Associates | location = Hawley, Pa. | pages = 61–2| date = 1989 | isbn =9780899627465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the WCC never opposed or had any official comments on the destruction of Jewish religious sites in the Middle East, but has constantly complained about Israel's alleged crimes towards Christian sites in Israel, Israel has pointedly ignored the WCC for 50 years and often stated that the WCC's opinions on Israel are hypocritical to the point of being bankrupt. It is similarly claimed that it downplayed appeals from Egyptian Copts about human rights abuses under Sadat and Mubarak, in order to focus on its neighbour.&lt;ref name= merkley /&gt; In 2009, the Council called for an international [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|boycott]] on goods produced in Israeli settlements, which it described as 'illegal, unjust' and 'incompatible with peace'.&lt;ref name= "BDS"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/central-committee/2009/report-on-public-issues/statement-on-israeli-settlements-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory | title = Statement on Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory | work= World Council of Churches website | date = 2009-09-02 | accessdate= 2015-08-11| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150811210314/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/central-committee/2009/report-on-public-issues/statement-on-israeli-settlements-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory | archive-date= 2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the General Secretary was reported to claim in Cairo, "We support the Palestinians.

Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (March 13, 1911 – January 24, 1986), better known as [[L. Ron Hubbard]], was an American pulp fiction author. He wrote in a wide variety of genres, including science fiction, fantasy, adventure fiction, aviation, travel, mystery, western and romance. He is perhaps best known for his self-help book, the #1 [[New York Times]] bestseller [[Dianetics]]: The Modern Science of Mental Health (first published in 1950), and as the founder of the Church of Scientology.

L. Ron Hubbard was a prolific writer; according to the church, his written teachings make up approximately 500,000 pages and 3,000 recorded lectures, totaling about 65 million words. He also produced a hundred films and 500 short stories and novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashcraft |first1=W.

Michael |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=9780275987176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early writings==

Although he was best known for his pulp fantasy and science fiction, Hubbard also wrote adventure, aviation, travel, mystery, western and romance. He wrote under his own name and as Kurt von Rachen and René Lafayette, his principal science fiction/fantasy pseudonyms. His other pen names included "Winchester Remington Colt (rather obviously reserved for Westerns), Lt Jonathan Daly, Capt Charles Gordon, Bernard Hubbel, Michael Keith, Legionnaire 148, Legionnaire 14830, Ken Martin, Scott Morgan or Lt Scott Morgan, Barry Randolph and Capt Humbert Reynolds."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubbard, L Ron|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hubbard_l_ron|website=SFE: The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's first short story, "Tah," was published in the Literary Supplement of The Hatchet, George Washington University's campus paper, in February 1932.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In February 1934, the pulp magazine Thrilling Adventure was the first to publish one of Hubbard's short stories. Over the next six years, more than 140 of his short stories appeared in similar magazines devoted to high adventure and mystery.

Hubbard began publishing Science Fiction with the magazine Astounding in 1938, and over the next decade he was a prolific contributor to both Astounding and the fantasy fiction magazine Unknown. However, despite efforts by later supporters to assign to Hubbard a central role in the creation of modern science fiction, he was not a member of the small group of prime movers—L Sprague de Camp, Robert A Heinlein and Isaac Asimov—in the genre.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Dianetics and Scientology==

Hubbard's first major financial success came with the publication of Dianetics in 1950, after which he departed the field of science fiction writing for many years. In 1951, he refashioned the material of Dianetics into Scientology. At this time, he established his first publishing organization, devoted exclusively to his own works, and used it (and its later incarnations) to publish his own so-called "spiritual technology," as well as his ideas about business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Bridge Publications, Inc.|url=http://www.bridgepub.com/about-us/about-bridge-publications-inc.html|website=Bridge Publications|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views on these topics remain a source of controversy, with supporters lauding their effectiveness and critics claiming they are useless, at best, and at worst, dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Touretzky|first1=David S.|title=Medical/Psychological Dangers of Narconon|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Stop-Narconon/St.Louis/narconon-warning.pdf|website=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farley|first1=Robert|title=Scientology makes it in classroom door|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Worldandnation/Scientology_makes_it_.shtml|website=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard returned to the field of Science Fiction writing in 1982 with the publication of Battlefield Earth, followed by the Mission Earth "dekalogy," a ten-volume series, most of which was published posthumously.

==Output and Reception==

Hubbard produced more than 250 published works of fiction in his writing career. At his peak, he wrote “over 100,000 words a month.”  He is remembered for his “prodigious output" and the "amazing speed at which he could produce copy.” He used a special electric IBM typewriter with extra keys for common words like ‘and’, ‘the’, and ‘but.’ &lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. Ed. J. Gordon Melton. Vol. 1. 5th ed. Detroit: Gale Group, 2001. p750-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology's publishing arm has translated his work into seventy-two languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = [[The Culvert Chronicles]] | journal = [[The Culvert Chronicles]] | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | page = 15| id = | accessdate = 2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fiction and non-fiction books have sold millions of copies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Gale Thomson Online | journal = Contemporary Authors Online | year = 2006| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hubbard holds four [[Guinness World Records]] for “Most Published Works by One Author”, “Most Audio Books Published for One Author”, “Most Translated Author in the World”, and "Most Translated Author, Same Book" ([[The Way to Happiness]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-published-works-by-one-author |title=Most published works by one author |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of Hubbard's fiction is mixed. Georges T. Dodds, columnist for WARP, newsletter/fanzine of the Montreal Science Fiction and Fantasy association writes, "much of [Hubbard's]science fiction and fantasy is quite entertaining, and in most cases as good or better than much of the pulp literature of the era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rodger Turner, Webmaster |url=http://www.sfsite.com/03b/ts196.htm |title=The SF Site Featured Review: To the Stars |publisher=Sfsite.com |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' emphasizes "Hubbard's ability to pack an epic into relatively few pages -- this is indeed golden science fiction from the Golden Age.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59212-175-5 |title=Fiction Review: TO THE STARS by L. Ron Hubbard |publisher=Publishersweekly.com |date=2004-08-30 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction maintains that science fiction "was clearly not Hubbard's forte, and most of his work in the genre reads as tendentious or laboured or both. As a writer of fantasy, however, [Hubbard] wrote with an occasionally pixillated fervour that is still pleasing, and sometimes reminiscent of the screwball comedies popular in the 1930s cinema."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Finally, Encyclopedia of Science Fiction has this to say about Hubbard's last foray into the genre of science fiction: "Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 (1982), [is] an enormously long space opera composed in an idiom that seemed embarrassingly archaic. This was followed by the Mission Earth 'dekalogy,' a ten-volume sequence whose farcical over-egging of a seriously thin narrative thread fails to disguise a tale that would have been more at home in the dawn of the Pulp magazines, though its length would not have been tolerated."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Controversy==

While nineteen of Hubbard's books have appeared on the [[New York Times best seller list]], critics have called this apparent feat an illusion. Evidence emerged early on that the best-selling statuses of many of these titles were in fact rigged by Scientology and Scientologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Welkos|first1=Robert W.|last2=Sappell|first2=Joel|title=Costly Strategy Continues to Turn Out Bestsellers|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientology062890-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hollywood connection==

Hubbard is credited with writing the story on which ''[[The Secret of Treasure Island]]'', a 1938 Columbia Pictures movie serial, was based,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030725/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_53|website=IMDB|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the story on which one episode of the TV show ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'' (1957) was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050066/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_52|website=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though both Hubbard and The Church of Scientology have made claims that he worked on a number of other Hollywood projects, there is no independently verifiable evidence to support this.

==Best-known fiction==

This is a partial list of Hubbard’s published works of fiction. Included are Fear, [[To the Stars (novel)|To the Stars]], [[Final Blackout]] and [[Typewriter in the Sky]], which were published in 1940 and reprinted numerous times. To the Stars was published in Astounding Science Fiction magazine in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquetrader.com/article/pulp_fiction_renaissance |title=Pulp Renaissance: Hard-boiled, cliffhanger stories viewed as collectible American fiction |publisher=Antique Trader |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard had a total of 235 works of fiction published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiseoldgoat.com/papers-scientology/hubbard_fiction_of_lrh_chrono-list.html |title=L. Ron Hubbard: Chronological list of works of fiction |publisher=Wiseoldgoat.com |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reprinted titles, reprinted by publisher Galaxy Press, include [[The Iron Duke (novel)|The Iron Duke]], Hostage to Death, Cargo of Coffins, Brass Keys to Murder, and Under the Black Ensign.

War-ravaged Europe is the setting of Final Blackout, which Pau Walker described as "a bleak, harsh novel of hopeless conflict and an idealistic lieutenant who fights it to its ironic end." A similar grim irony pervades Death's Deputy, in which an immortal, voided to punish humans according to the whims of his race, seeks in vain his own death. The short novels [[Typewriter in the Sky]] and [[Fear (Hubbard novella)|''Fear'' (Hubbard novella)]] are horrific fantasies which many critics consider to be classics of the science fiction's golden age. Fear, which relates the existence of a man who alternates between psychosis and sanity, is considered among Hubbard's finest works. Hubbard's last book of this period, Return to Tomorrow, is a "space opera" which anticipates future science fiction themes in its story about intergalactic traders from whom one month equals a century of earth time. Hubbard's stories written under the pseudonym of Rene Lafayette and collected in [[Ole Doc Methuselah]] (1970) relate the tales of a medical doctor who traverses time and space while opposing criminals and enemies for his profession.&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Literary Criticism.

====Battlefield Earth====
[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]] is a 1982 science fiction novel written by [[L. Ron Hubbard|Hubbard]]. He composed a soundtrack to the book called [[Space Jazz]]. Initially titled "Man, the Endangered Species", Battlefield Earth was first published in 1982 by St. Martin's Press, though all subsequent reprintings have been by Church of Scientology publishing companies [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]] and [[Galaxy Press]]. Written in the style of the pulp fiction era (during which Hubbard began his writing career), the novel is a massive work (over 750 pages in hardcover, 1000+ in paperback). It was Hubbard's first openly science fiction novel since his pulp magazine days of the 1940s, and it was promoted as Hubbard's "return" to science fiction after a long hiatus.

The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction described the book as a "rather good, fast-paced, often fascinating SF adventure yarn." The fantasy author [[Neil Gaiman]] wrote, "For value for money I have to recommend L. Ron Hubbard's massive Battlefield Earth - over 1000 pages of thrills, spills, vicious aliens, noble humans. Is mankind an endangered species? Will handsome and heroic Jonny Goodboy Tyler win Earth back from the nine-foot-high Psychlos? A tribute to the days of Pulp, I found it un-put-downable. And all for £2.95". [[Frederik Pohl]] said, "I read 'Battlefield Earth' straight through in one sitting although it's immense... I was fascinated by it." [[Kevin J. Anderson]] says, "Battlefield Earth is like a 12-hour 'Indiana Jones' marathon. Non-stop and fast-paced. Every chapter has a big bang-up adventure." Publishers Weekly said about the novel, "This has everything: suspense, pathos, politics, war, humor, diplomacy and intergalactic finance..." Science fiction author [[A. E. van Vogt]] stated, "Wonderful adventure ... great characters ... a masterpiece." but later admitted that he had not actually read it due to its size.

Battlefield Earth went to the top of the [[New York Times Best Seller list]] and also those of the [[Los Angeles Times]], TIME, United Press International, Associated Press, B. Dalton's and Waldenbooks. According to Hubbard's literary agents, [[Author Services Inc.]], by June 1983 the book had sold 150,000 copies and earned $1.5 million.

The book was [[Battlefield Earth (film)|adapted for film in 2000]], and retains a cult status, despite bombing at the box office and being critically panned. As usual for Hollywood, the film adaptation made a number of deviations from the source material.

====[[To the Stars (novel)|To the Stars]]====
To the Stars was first published in book format in 1954 under the title, Return to Tomorrow, it was first published in hardcover in 1975 under the same title.  The book was generally positively received, and garnered a 2001 nomination for a "Retro" Hugo Award for Best Novella. Publishers Weekly gave the book a positive review, calling it one of Hubbard's "finest works", and Alan Cheuse highlighted the work on National Public Radio's program ''All Things Considered'' as a top literature holiday pick.

[[Galaxy Science Fiction|''Galaxy'']] reviewer [[Groff Conklin]] described the 1954 edition as "a fast-paced and grim adventure . . . just short of absurdity, but interesting nevertheless."&lt;ref&gt;"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', November 1954, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Boucher]] panned the novel, calling it "a surprisingly routine and plotless space opera."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading," ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|F&amp;SF]]'', November 1954, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Buckskin Brigades]]====

The book was published in an audio book format by Bridge Publications and read by actor Bruce Boxleitner, ]who was hired by Church of Spiritual Technology subsidiary Author Services Inc. to read Hubbard's books on tape. The [[New York Times]] stated that, "Mr. Hubbard has reversed a time-honored formula and has given a thriller to which, at the end of every chapter or so, another paleface bites the dust . . . (has) an enthusiasm, even a freshness and sparkle, decidedly rare in this type of romance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Widder | first1 = William J. | title = The Fiction of L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9284">{{Rameau operas}}'''''Zoroastre'''''  (''[[Zoroaster]]'') is an [[opera]] by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], first performed on 5 December 1749 by the [[Paris Opera|Opéra]] in the first [[Salle du Palais-Royal]] in [[Paris]]. The [[libretto]] is by [[Louis de Cahusac]]. ''Zoroastre'' was the fourth of Rameau's ''[[tragédie en musique|tragédies en musique]]'' to be staged and the last to appear during the composer's own lifetime. Audiences gave the original version a lukewarm reception, so Rameau and his librettist thoroughly reworked the opera for a revival which took place at the Opéra on 19 January 1756. This time the work was a great success and this is the version generally heard today.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, p. 842; Sadler, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==
''Zoroastre'''s premiere in 1749 was not a success; despite the magnificence of the staging, it failed to compete with [[Jean-Joseph de Mondonville|Mondonville]]'s new ''[[opéra-ballet]]'' ''Le carnaval du Parnasse''. Rameau and Cahusac decided to rework the opera completely before offering it to the public again in 1756. Acts 2,3 and 5 were heavily rewritten and there were several modifications to the plot. This time audiences took to the opera, although the critic [[Melchior Grimm]] was withering about Cahusac's libretto: "In ''Zoroastre'' it is day and night alternately; but as the poet...cannot count up to five he has got so muddled in his reckoning that he has been compelled to make it be day and night two or three times in each act, so that it might be day at the end of the play". ''Zoroastre'' was chosen to open the new Paris opera house on January 26, 1770, the old one having burned down in 1763. It was also translated into Italian by [[Casanova]] for a performance in [[Dresden]] in 1752, although some of Rameau's music was replaced by that of the ballet master Adam. Its first modern revival was in a concert version at the [[Schola Cantorum]], Paris in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Girdlestone pp.278-279&lt;/ref&gt; The United States premiere of the opera was staged by [[Boston Baroque]] (then known as Banchetto Musicale) at [[Harvard University]]'s Sanders Theater under conductor [[Martin Pearlman]] in 1983 with [[Jean Claude Orliac]] in the title role and [[James Maddalena]] as Abramane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/arts/opera-zoroastre-by-boston-group.html?scp=4&amp;sq=%22James+Maddalena%22&amp;st=nyt|title=Opera: 'Zoroastre,' By Boston Group|author=[[John Rockwell]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 22, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libretto and music===
''Zoroastre'' includes some important innovations: it was the first major French opera to dispense with an allegorical prologue and its subject matter is not drawn from the [[Classical mythology]] of Greece and Rome, as was usual, but from Persian religion. There was good reason for this. As Graham Sadler writes, the opera is "a thinly disguised portrayal of [[Freemasonry]]". Cahusac, the librettist, was a leading French Mason and many of his works celebrate the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], including ''Zoroastre''. The historical Zoroaster was highly regarded in Masonic circles and the parallels are obvious between Rameau's opera and an even more famous Masonic allegory, [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (1791), with its initiation rites conducted under the auspices of the wise "Sarastro".&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, booklet notes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''The synopsis is based on 1756 version''

=== Act 1 ===
The story takes place in the ancient kingdom of [[Bactria]] and concerns the struggle between the forces of Good, led by [[Zoroaster|Zoroastre]], the "founder of the [[Magi]]", and Evil, led by the sorcerer Abramane. When the opera opens, Bactria is in chaos after the death of its king, who has left behind two daughters: Amélite, the presumptive heir, and Erinice. Both are in love with Zoroastre, who is devoted to Amélite. Abramane has taken the opportunity to send Zoroastre into exile. The sorcerer also plots to seize the throne with Erinice, who wants revenge on Zoroastre for rejecting her love. Abramane conjures up demons to capture Amélite.

===Act 2===
Zoroastre is in exile at the palace of the king of the good [[genie]]s, [[Ahura Mazda|Oromasès]]. Oromasès tells Zoroastre to go and rescue Amélite and destroy the forces of evil. He puts Zoroastre through a magic initiation ritual to prepare him for the task. In the dungeons of the fortress of Bactria, Abramane and Erinice are torturing Amélite to force her to renounce the throne, when Zoroastre suddenly appears. He releases Amélite and destroys the fortress with his magic powers. Amélite is presented as queen to her joyful Bactrian subjects.

===Act 3===
Night. Abramane and Erinice quarrel over the disaster that has befallen their plans. Abramane hides Erinice in a cloud. At dawn, Zoroastre, Amélite and the Bactrian people assemble to worship the Supreme Being then celebrate the marriage of Zoroastre and Amélite. As the wedding ceremony takes place, Abramane arrives on a fiery chariot and kidnaps Amélite. Zoroastre prepares his magic spirits for war.

===Act 4===
In the temple of the god [[Angra Mainyu|Arimane]], Abramane receives news that the battle between the spirits of good and evil is going badly for him. He sacrifices to the god and summons up Hate, Vengeance and Despair.

===Act 5===
Erinice, now repentant, warns Zoroastre of Abramane's plan for a new battle. Abramane appears in the fiery chariot once more and reveals Amélite in chains. He calls on Zoroastre to surrender. Instead, Zoroastre calls on the gods, who strike down Abramane and his evil priests with thunderbolts. The opera ends with rejoicing as Zoroastre and Amélite are crowned king and queen of Bactria.

'''Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva''' or '''Akasagarbha Bodhisattva''' ({{CJKV|c=虛空藏菩薩|p=Xūkōngzàng Púsà|k=허공장보살|rr=Heogongjang Bosal|r=Kokūzō Bosatsu}}, [[Standard Tibetan]] ''Namkha'i Nyingpo'', [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''Hư Không Tạng Bồ Tát'') is a [[bodhisattva]] who is associated with the great element (''[[mahābhūta]]'') of space (''ākāśa'').

==Overview==
[[File:Kokuzo Bosatsu (Akasagarbha) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Painting of Ākāśagarbha, [[Japan]], 13th century]]

Ākāśagarbha is regarded{{who|date=January 2013}} as one of the eight great bodhisattvas. His name can be translated as "boundless space treasury" or "void store" as his wisdom is said to be boundless as space itself. He is sometimes known as the twin brother of the "earth store" bodhisattva [[Ksitigarbha|Kṣitigarbha]], and is even briefly mentioned in the ''[[Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra]]''.

[[Kūkai]], the founder of [[Shingon Buddhism]], met a famous monk who is said to have repeatedly chanted a [[mantra]] of Ākāśagarbha as a young Buddhist acolyte. Kūkai took a tutorial with him on Kokuzou-Gumonji (a secret doctorine method, 虚空蔵求聞持法).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fudouin.or.jp/flance/index.html Koya-san Fudoin]  高野山不動院&lt;/ref&gt; As he chanted the mantra, he experienced a vision whereby Ākāśagarbha told him to go to [[Tang_Dynasty|Tang China]] to seek understanding of the ''[[Mahavairocana Tantra|Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Sūtra]]''.{{sfn|Abe|2013|p=74}} Later he would go to China to learn [[Tangmi]] from [[Huiguo]], and then go on to found the Shingon sect of esoteric buddhism in [[Heian_Period|Heian Japan]].

==Sutras==
Two [[Mahayana sutras]] are known to survive in which Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva is a central figure:
*《虛空藏菩薩經》 (''Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva Sūtra'')
*《虛空藏菩薩神咒經》 (''Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva Dhāraṇī Sūtra'')

Additionally, he appears briefly in the final chapter of the ''[[Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra]]'', requesting [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] preach on the benefits of praising that sutra and of Kṣitigarbha.{{sfn|Śikṣānanda|2003|pp=89-93}}

The [[mantra]] of Ākāśagarbha is popularly used by Shingon Buddhists, practitioners of Tangmi, and by artists. It is believed to give rise to wisdom and creativity, and dispel ignorance.
