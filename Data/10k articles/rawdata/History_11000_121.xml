      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42312">'''African-American businesses''', also known as [[black people|black]]-owned businesses or black businesses, originated in the days of slavery before 1865. Emancipation and civil rights permitted businessmen to operate inside the American legal structure starting in the [[Reconstruction Era]] (1863–77)  and afterwards.  By the 1890's, thousands of small business operations had opened in urban areas. The most rapid growth came in the early 20th century, as the increasingly rigid [[Jim Crow]] system of segregation moved urban blacks into a community large enough to support a business establishment. The [[National Negro Business League]],  Promoted by college president [[Booker T. Washington]] the League opened over 600 chapters, reaching every city with a significant black population.

[[African Americans]] have operated virtually every kind of company, but some of the most prominent Black-owned businesses have been [[North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company|insurance companies]], banks, [[Motown|recording labels]], funeral parlors, barber shops, beauty salons, restaurants, [[soul food]] restaurants, record stores, and [[African-American Bookstores|bookstores]].

By 1920, there were tens of thousands of black businesses, the great majority of them quite small. The largest were insurance companies. The League had grown so large that it supported numerous offshoots, serving bankers, publishers, lawyers, funeral directors, retailers and insurance agents.  The Great Depression of 1929-39 was a serious blow, as cash income fell in the black community because of very high unemployment, and many smaller businesses close down. During World War II many employees and owners switched over to high-paying jobs in munitions factories.  Black businessmen generally were more conservative elements of their community, but typically did support the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. By the 1970s, federal programs to promote minority business activity provided new funding, although the opening world of mainstream management in large corporations attracted a great deal of talent. Black entrepreneurs originally based in music and sports diversified to build "brand" names that made for success in the advertising and media worlds.

==Early history==
Black entrepreneurship can be traced back to when the Israelites were first forcibly brought to North American in the 17th century. Many [[Israelites]] who gained their own freedom out of [[slavery]] opened their own businesses, and even some enslaved Israelites were able to operate their own businesses, either as skill tradespeople or as minor traders and peddlers.  Enslaved Israelites operated businesses both with and without their owners' permission.

==To 1865==
Free blacks facing a generally hostile environment occasionally operated small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Juliet E.K. Walker, "Racism, slavery, and free enterprise: Black entrepreneurship in the United States before the Civil War." ''Business History Review'' 60#3 (1986): 343-382. [http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/slavery/Antebellum-Black-Entrepreneurship.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Profit-making businesses were created by more free and enslaved African Americans than one might realize from the usual survey of antebellum America. When the opportunity presented itself, it was taken by these men and women, sometimes timidly, sometimes whole-heartedly, and often endorsed by the masters of the enslaved.

===Tobacconist===
As a young slave, Lunsford Lane recalls selling a basket of peaches for money he could keep and very soon, he says, "plans for money-making took the principal possession of my thoughts." In six to eight years he had amassed one thousand dollars, enough to purchase his freedom, as we read from ''The Narrative of Lunsford Lane'' (1842).

===Shoemaker===
William J. Brown was born into a free black family in Rhode Island and as a young man faced discrimination and often unethical treatment from whites as he strove to pursue a trade and career. In his selection from his ''Life of William J. Brown of Providence, R. I.'' (1883) we read his frustrating experiences as a store clerk and apprentice shoemaker.

===Sailmaker===
James Forten, Sr., a freeman and grandfather of Charlotte Forten (see #3: Free-born), learned the sail-making trade after the Revolution, bought his employer's business, and later became the wealthiest black man in Philadelphia. In this 1835 article from the white journal ''The Anti-Slavery Record,'' a white reporter describes a visit to Forten's sailmaking business.

===Barber===
After being emancipated by his master in 1820, William Johnson became a successful businessman in Natchez, Mississippi, operating a barber shop, loaning money and acquiring real estate.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Adams Davis, and William Ransom Hogan, ''Barber of Natchez'' (LSU Press, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchant===
Free-born in Philadelphia, Mifflin Gibbs became a businessman, lawyer, politician, and abolitionist. For several years he operated a clothing store in San Francisco, which he we learn from his autobiography ''Shadow and Light'' (1902).

===Dressmaker===
After purchasing her freedom in St. Louis, Elizabeth Keckley moved to Washington, DC, and became the dressmaker for Mary Todd Lincoln, producing elegant gowns for the capital's elite women. Her 1868 autobiography ''Behind the Scenes'' display her ardor and initiative in creating her business and her life.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Criniti, "Thirty years a slave, and four years a fairy Godmother: dressmaking as self-making in Elizabeth Keckley's autobiography." ''American Transcendental Quarterly'' 22.1 (2008): 309+.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1865–1900==
Emancipation and civil rights permitted businessmen to operate inside the American legal structure starting in the [[Reconstruction Era]] (1863–77)  and afterwards.  By the 1890s, thousands of small business operations had opened in urban areas.

The South had relatively few cities of any size in 1860, But during the war, and afterward, refugees both black and white flooded in from rural areas. The growing black population produced a leadership class of ministers, professionals, and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution'' (1988) pp 396-98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard N. Rabinowitz, ''Race Relations in the Urban South, 1865-1890'' (1978) pp 61-96, 240-48.&lt;/ref&gt; These leaders typically made civil rights a high priority.  Of course, great majority of blacks in urban America were unskilled or low skilled blue-collar workers.Historian August Meier reports:
:From the late 1880s there was a remarkable development of Negro business – banks and insurance companies, undertakers and retail stores.... It occurred at a time when Negro barbers, tailors caterers, trainmen, blacksmiths, and other artisans were losing their white customers. Depending upon the Negro market, the promoters of the new enterprises naturally upheld the spirit of racial self-help and solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=August Meier|title=Negro Thought in America, 1880-1915: Racial Ideologies in the Age of Booker T. Washington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=masKS7ZroY0C&amp;pg=PA139|year=1963|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for detailed national report on the numbers of black businessmen and their finances in 1890, see Andrew F.

Memphis Tennessee was the base for [[Robert Reed Church]] (1839–1912), a freedman who became the South's first black millionaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Kranz|title=African-American Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCHX6P8ETI0C&amp;pg=PA49|year=2004|pages=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his wealth from speculation in city real estate, much of it after Memphis became depopulated after the [[yellow fever]] epidemics. He founded the city's first black-owned bank, [[Solvent Savings Bank and Trust]], ensuring that the black community could get loans to establish businesses. He was deeply involved in local and national Republican politics and directed patronage to the black community. His son [[Robert Reed Church, Jr.]], became a major politician in Memphis. He was a leader of black society and a benefactor in numerous causes.

Black communities were undoubtedly negatively affected by the enforcement of [[racial segregation]] in cities and urban areas where blacks were limited in what residential areas they could occupy. Whether in the South or the North, segregation limited the social, educational, and economic progress of the varying black communities forced into this racist social practice. However, new economic, anthropological and census research conducted establishes how black communities in the North during the late 19th Century fought against racial segregation by donning new attitudes towards commerce and entrepreneurship. Racial segregation in the North during the late [[19th century|19th Century]] saw a considerable rise in black [[entrepreneurship]] and black owned small businesses within their respective communities. These small business owners were able to take advantage of constraints placed upon the [[African Americans|African American]] communities, and exploit a market of untapped black consumers that at the time were not allowed a great deal of purchasing power in white economic markets. This rise in “negro markets” as framed by [[St. Clair Drake]]''' '''and [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.|Horace R. Clayton]] in ''[[Black Metropolis]]'' occurred in the South Side of cities like [[Chicago]] where African Americans established a “[[Black Belt (U.S. region)|black belt]]” of their own where the number of black owned businesses reached 2,500 by 1937 in South Side Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=Robert L.|date=Fall 2010|title=Black Retail Enterprise and Racial Segregation in Northern Cities before the "Ghetto"|url=|journal=Sociological Perspective|volume=53.3|pages=397–417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/how-integration-led-to-the-decline-of-black-owned-businesses/Content?oid=1113614|title=How integration led to the decline of black-owned businesses|last=Blakeney|first=Barney|website=Charleston City Paper|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unbiasedtalk.com/uncategorized/black-wall-street-segregation-was-better-for-blacks/|title=Hit on the Head – "Black Wall Street" – Segregation was better for blacks|website=www.unbiasedtalk.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The golden age of black entrepreneurship 1900–1930==
The nadir of race relations was reached in the early 20th century, in terms of political and legal rights. Blacks were increasingly segregated. However the more they were cut off from the larger white community, the more black entrepreneurs succeeded in establishing flourishing businesses that catered to a black clientele.

The most rapid growth came in the early 20th century, As the increasingly rigid [[Jim Crow]] system of segregation moved urban blacks into a community large enough to support a business establishment. The [[National Negro Business League]],  Promoted by college president [[Booker T. Washington]] the League opened over 600 chapters, reaching every city with a significant black population.

By 1920, there were tens of thousands of black businesses, the great majority of them quite small. The largest were insurance companies. The League had grown so large that it supported numerous offshoots, including the National Negro Bankers Association, the National Negro Press Association, the National Association of Negro Funeral Directors, the National Negro Bar Association, the National Association of Negro Insurance Men, the National Negro Retail Merchants' Association, the National Association of Negro Real Estate Dealers, and the National Negro Finance Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Hamilton, ed., [http://www.lexisnexis.com/documents/academic/upa_cis/1559_NatNegroBusLeaguePt1.pdf ''A Guide to the Records of the National Negro Business League.''] Bethesda, MD: University Publications of America, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Great Depression of 1929-39 was a serious blow, as cash income fell in the black community because of unemployment, and many smaller businesses close down. During World War II many employees can indeed owners switched over to high-paying jobs in munitions factories.  Black businessmen generally were more conservative elements of their community, but typically did support the civil rights movement. By the 1970s, federal programs to promote minority business activity provided new funding, although the opening world of mainstream management attracted a great deal of talent.

In urban areas, North and South, the size and income of the black population was growing, providing openings for a wide range of businesses, from barbershops&lt;ref&gt;Quincy T. Mills, ''Cutting along the Color Line: Black Barbers and Barber Shops in America'' (2013) [https://www.questia.com/library/120086708/cutting-along-the-color-line-black-barbers-and-barber online]&lt;/ref&gt;  to insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;Walter B. Weare, ''Black Business in the New South: A Social History of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Weems, Jr., ''Black Business in the Black Metropolis: The Chicago Metropolitan Assurance Company, 1925-1985'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Undertakers had a special niche, and often played a political role.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Boyd, "Black undertakers in northern cities during the great migration: The rise of an entrepreneurial occupation." ''Sociological Focus'' 31.3 (1998): 249-263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20831994 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Juliet Walker calls 1900–1930 the "Golden age of black business."&lt;ref&gt;Juliet E.K. Walker, ''The history of black business in America: Capitalism, race, entrepreneurship'' (2009) p 183.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Negro Business League, the number black-owned businesses doubled from 20,000 1900 and 40,000 in 1914. There were 450 undertakers in 1900 and, rising to 1000. Drugstores rose from 250 to 695. Local retail merchants – most of them quite small – jumped from 10,000 to 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;August Meier,  "Negro Class Structure and Ideology in the Age of Booker T. Washington." ''Phylon'' (1962) 23.3 : 258-266. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/273804 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;August Meier, ''Negro thought in America, 1880-1915: Racial ideologies in the age of Booker T. Washington'' (1966) p 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''The Negro in business: report of a social study made under the direction of Atlanta University'' (1899) [http://scua.library.umass.edu/digital/dubois/dubois4.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the leading centers of black business was Atlanta. According to August Meier and David Lewis, 1900 was the turning point as white businessmen reduced their contacts with black customers, black entrepreneurs rush to fill the vacuum by starting banks, insurance companies,  and numerous  local retailers and  service providers. Furthermore, the number of black doctors and lawyers increased sharply. All this of course was in addition to the traditional  businesses, such as undertakers and barbershops that had always depended on a black clientele.&lt;ref&gt;August Meier and David Lewis. "History of the Negro upper class in Atlanta, Georgia, 1890-1958." ''Journal of Negro Education'' 28.2 (1959): 128-139. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2293711 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Durham, North Carolina]], a new industrial city based on tobacco manufacturing and cotton mills, was noted for the growth of its black businesses. Durham lacked traditionalism based on plantation-era slavery, and practiced a laissez-faire that allowed black entrepreneurs to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Walter B. Weare, "Charles Clinton Spaulding: Middle-Class Leadership in the Age of Segregation," in John Hope Franklin and August Meier, eds., ''Black leaders of the twentieth century'' (1982), 166-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

College president [[Booker T. Washington]] (1856–1915), who ran the [[National Negro Business League]] was the most prominent promoter of black business. He moved from city to city to sign up local entrepreneurs into his national network the National Negro Business League.&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Boston, ''The Business Strategy of Booker T. Washington: Its Development and Implementation'' (2010) [https://www.questia.com/library/120088955/the-business-strategy-of-booker-t-washington-its online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis R. Harlan, "Booker T. Washington and the National Negro Business League" in Raymond W. Smock, ed. ''Booker T. Washington in Perspective: Essays of Louis R. Harlan'' (1988) pp. 98-109.

[[File:Durham downtown North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company Building.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company headquarters in Durham N.C.]]

By the 1920s, the federal government had set up a small unit to distribute information to black entrepreneurs, but no financial aid was forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Weems, "'The Right Man': James A. Jackson and the Origins of U.S. Government Interest in Black Business," ''Enterprise &amp; Society'' (2005) 6#2 pp 254-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the most prominent black entrepreneur of the century of was [[Charles Clinton Spaulding]] (1874 – 1952), president of [[North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company]] in Durham North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Walter B. Weare, ''Black Business in the New South: A Social History of the NC Mutual Life Insurance Company'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weare, "Charles Clinton Spaulding: Middle-Class Leadership in the Age of Segregation," in John Hope Franklin and August Meier, eds., ''Black leaders of the twentieth century'' (1982), 166-90&lt;/ref&gt; It was the nation's largest black-owned business. It operated a system of industrial insurance, whereby its salesmen collected small premiums of about 10 cents every week from its clients. That provided them insurance for the following week; if the client died the salesman immediately arranged payment of the death benefit of about $100. That paid for suitable funeral, which was a high prestige event to the black community. Black undertakers also benefited and themselves became prominent business men.  By 1970, they grossed more than $120 million for 150,000 race funerals each year.&lt;ref&gt;Morris J. McDonald, "The management of grief: a study of black funeral practices." ''OMEGA-Journal of Death and Dying'' 4.2 (1973): 139-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newspapers and magazines==
[[File:ROBERT LEE VANN - LAWYER, EDITOR, CRUSADER - NARA - 535681.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Poster from the U.S. Office of War Information, 1943]]

African-American newspapers flourished in the major cities, with publishers playing a major role in politics and business affairs. Representative leaders included [[Robert Sengstacke Abbott]] (1870–1940), publisher of the [[Chicago Defender]]; [[John Mitchell, Jr.]] (1863–1929), editor of the ''[[Richmond Planet]]'' and president of the National Afro-American Press Association; [[Anthony Overton]] (1865–1946), publisher of the [[Chicago Bee]], and [[Robert Lee Vann]] (1879–1940), the publisher and editor of the [[Pittsburgh Courier]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick S. Washburn, ''The African American Newspaper: Voice of Freedom'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John H. Johnson]] (1918–2005) was the founder of the [[Johnson Publishing Company]] in 1942.  He rose from  poverty to millionaire by the time he was thirty-one.  In 1982, he became the first African American to appear on the Forbes 400. Johnson's ''Ebony'' and ''Jet'' magazines were among the most influential African-American media by 1950.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Johnson, ''Succeeding Against The Odds'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in the beauty business ==
Most of the African-Americans in business were men, however women played a major role especially in the area of beauty. Standards of beauty were different for whites and blacks, and the black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. Beauticians could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, "Inside black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization." Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Blain Roberts, ''Pageants, Parlors, and Pretty Women: Race and Beauty in the Twentieth-Century South'' (2014), quote p 96. [https://networks.h-net.org/node/3119/reviews/57654/brown-roberts-pageants-parlors-and-pretty-women-race-and-beauty online review]; [https://www.amazon.com/Pageants-Parlors-Pretty-Women-Twentieth-Century-ebook/dp/B00IZCGAAO/  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susannah Walker, ''Style and Status: Selling Beauty to African American Women, 1920-1975'' (2007. [https://www.amazon.com/Style-Status-Selling-American-1920-1975/dp/0813124336/ excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous entrepreneur was [[Madame C.J. Walker]] (1867–1919); she built a national franchise  business called [[Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company]] based on her invention of the first successful hair straightening process.&lt;ref&gt;A'Lelia Bundles, ''On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.J. Walker'' (2002) [https://www.amazon.com/On-Her-Own-Ground-Paperback/dp/0743431723  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marjorie Joyner]] (1896–1994) was the first black graduate of a beauty school in Chicago, where she got to know Madame Walker and became her agent. By 1919 Joyner was the national supervisor over Walker's 200 beauty schools. A major role was sending their hair stylists door-to-door, dressed in black skirts and white blouses with black satchels containing a range of beauty products that were applied in the customer's house. Joyner taught some 15,000 stylists over her fifty-year career. She was also a leader in developing new products, such as her permanent wave machine. She helped write the first cosmetology laws for the state of Illinois, and founded both a sorority and a national association for black beauticians. Joyner was friends with Eleanor Roosevelt, and helped found the [[National Council of Negro Women]]. She was an advisor to the Democratic National Committee in the 1940s, and advised several New Deal agencies trying to reach out to black women. Joyner was highly visible in the Chicago black community, as head of the ''Chicago Defender'' Charity network, and fundraiser for various schools. In 1987 the Smithsonian Institution in Washington opened an exhibit featuring Joyner's permanent wave machine and a replica of her original salon.&lt;ref&gt;Jessie Carney Smith, ed., ''Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture'' (2010) pp 435-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading beauty salon for black women in Washington was operated by the sisters Elizabeth Cardozo Parker (1900–1981) and Margaret Cardozo Holmes (1898–1991) from 1929 to 1971. The Cardozo Sisters Hair Stylists expanded to five storefronts stretching an entire city block near the campus of Howard University, with 25 employees assisting up to 200 clients a day.  They had a voice in the national  beauticians community, and demanded an end to discriminatory practices.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ed., ''Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture'' (2010) pp 134-39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rose Meta Morgan]] (1912–2008) founded the House of Beauty salon to promote African-American standards of beauty, in opposition to those "white" standards that sought silky straight hair and light skin. Born in rural Mississippi, she moved to Chicago as a child and showed entrepreneurial skills as a teenager. She relocated to New York City in 1938, where her small beauty shop became the world's largest African-American beauty parlor. She staged fashion shows in Harlem, and sold her brand of cosmetics designed "to glorify a woman of color". She was briefly married to the famous heavyweight boxing champion [[Joe Louis]] from 1955–58. In 1965 he founded New York City's only black commercial bank, Freedom National Bank; in 1972 she set up a franchise operation for beauticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Kranz|title=African-American Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCHX6P8ETI0C&amp;pg=PA200|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=199–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vera Moore (b 1950) marketed her unique brands of Vera Moore Cosmetics, including some products developed by her husband.

==Small businesses==
In addition to the more prominent businesses listed above,  African Americans have strong traditions of owning and operating small businesses such as restaurants, drug stores, newsstands, corner stores, candy shops, liquor stores, groceries, bars, and gas stations.

African Americans also have a length history of ownership in music-related businesses, including record stores, nightclubs, and record labels.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Clark Davis, [https://www.academia.edu/10691538/For_the_Records_How_African_American_Consumers_and_Music_Retailers_Created_Commercial_Public_Space_in_the_1960s_and_1970s_South "For the Records: How African American Consumers and Music Retailers Created Commercial Public Space in the 1960s and 1970s South,"] ''Southern Cultures'', Winter 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  [[African-American Bookstores|African-American bookstores]] were closely tied to radical political movements, including [[Black Power]], [[black nationalism]], [[pan-Africanism]], and [[Marxism]].

==Double duty dollars==
{{main article|Double duty dollar}}
The term '"double duty dollar"' was used in the US from the early 1900s through the early 1960s, to express the notion that dollars spent with businesses hiring blacks  simultaneously purchased a commodity and advanced the race.  Where that concept applied, retailers who excluded African Americans as employees effectively excluded them as patrons too.

Religious leaders and social activists such as Booker T. Washington and [[Marcus Garvey]] urged their communities to redirect their dollars from suppliers who excluded African Americans to suppliers with more inclusive practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=selective patronage|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22selective+patronage%22&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Swadeshi movement]] in India had much broader goals, [[Mohandas Gandhi]] also famously urged his countrymen, in the 1920s, to avoid funding their own subjugation by buying things from the British – things they could produce and trade independently, like cloth and clothing.  In the 1940s and 1950s, Leon Sullivan applied the broader phrase [[Leon Sullivan#Selective Patronage Movement|''selective patronage'']] to note consumers' choice of suppliers as a tool a) to influence suppliers toward fairer, more just interactions with African Americans, and b) to build demand for African American suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mark Silverman, "Ethnic solidarity and black business." ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'' 58.4 (1999): 829-841.&lt;/ref&gt;  In retrospect the movement had little impact.&lt;ref&gt;Louis C. Kesselman, "The fair employment practice commission movement in perspective." ''Journal of Negro History'' 31.1 (1946): 30-46. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2714966 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== On the national agenda==
Minority entrepreneurship entered the national  agenda in 1927 when Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]] set up a [[Division of Negro Affairs]] to provide advice, and disseminate information to both white and black businessman on how to reach the black consumer. Entrepreneurship was not on the New Deal agenda after 1933. However, when Washington turned to war preparation in 1940, the Division of Negro Affairs tried to help black business secure defense contracts. Black businesses were not oriented toward manufacturing in the first place, and generally were too small to secure any major contracts. President Eisenhower  disbanded the agency in 1953.  With the civil rights movement at full blast, Lyndon Johnson coupled black entrepreneurship with his war on poverty, setting up special program in the Small Business Administration, the Office of Economic Opportunity, and other agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Weems Jr.,  ''Business in Black and White: American Presidents and Black Entrepreneurs'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This time there was money for loans designed to boost minority business ownership. Richard Nixon greatly expanded the program, setting up the  Office of Minority Business Enterprise (OMBE) in the expectation  that black entrepreneurs would help defuze racial tensions and possibly support his reelection .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Schoen|title=The Nixon Effect: How His Presidency Has Changed American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgRDCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT34|year=2015|publisher=Encounter Books|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The national market==
[[Image:Pepsi targeted ad 1940s.jpg|thumb|1940s Pepsi ad targeting African Americans. A young [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]] is the boy reaching for a bottle]]
Most national corporations before the 1960s ignored the black market, and paid little attention to working with black merchants or hiring blacks for responsible positions. [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]] was a major exception, as the number two brand fought for parity with Coca-Cola.  The upstart soda brand hired [[Edward F. Boyd]]  (1914–2007), a pioneer black advertiser.  Boyd hired local black promoters who penetrated into black markets across the South and the urban North. Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s: 
:The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, "ladies groups," schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to give shout-outs for Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, "How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity." ''CHANGE'' 63 (2007): 1-26 [http://www.comlabgames.com/45-870N/instructor/01_day/How_Pepsi_Opened_Door_to_Diversity.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:New-York tribune., November 07, 1909, Page 20, Image 44 Aunt Jemima.jpg|right|thumb|Quaker Oats 1909 newspaper ad directed at white consumers.]]

Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted  one-dimensional [[Aunt Jemima]]s and [[Uncle Ben's|Uncle Bens]] whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead it portrayed black customers as self-confident middle-class citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, ''The Real Pepsi Challenge: The Inspirational Story of Breaking the Color Barrier in American Business'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the first black-owned McDonald’s franchise opened in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;https://aaregistry.org/story/the-first-black-owned-mcdonalds-opens/&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
In 2002, African American-owned businesses accounted for 1.2 million of the US's 23 million businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6AUOAL4XD?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20051030110726/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/business_ownership/005477.html Minority Groups Increasing Business Ownership at Higher Rate than National Average, Census Bureau Reports] U.S. Census Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2011}} African American-owned businesses account for approximately 2 million [[US businesses]].&lt;ref name=Tozzi&gt;{{cite web|last=Tozzi|first=John|url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2010/sb20100715_469797.htm|title=Minority Businesses Multiply But Still Lag Whites|publisher=Businessweek.com|date=July 16, 2010|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black-owned businesses experienced the largest growth in number of businesses among minorities from 2002 to 2011.&lt;ref name=Tozzi/&gt; The [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2010 had as one goal to assist black-owned businesses land more federal contracts. It required federal agencies to open an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) to track their diversity efforts in workforce hiring and procurement.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey McKinney,  "Tracking Minority Contracting," ''Black Enterprise,'' (2012) 43#2 pp 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 The US Census Reported that there were 2.6 million black or African American-owned firms nationally in 2012, up from 1.9 million or 34.5 percent from 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-209.html Number of Minority- and Women-Owned Firms Each Increase by More Than 2 Million Nationally] U.S. Census Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; Many apps and online directories, have emerged offering a database of African American owned businesses that consumers can support.

Black entrepreneurs originally based in music and sports diversified to build "brand" names that made for success in the advertising and media worlds. The most prominent examples include television news reporter [[Oprah Winfrey]] who became involved in numerous enterprises such as a  book club that changed the way America reads.&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Konchar Farr, ''Reading Oprah: How Oprah's book club changed the way America reads'' (SUNY Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Basketball superstar [[Magic Johnson]]  was named by ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine as one of America's most influential black businessmen in 2009, Johnson has numerous business interests, and was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years. Johnson also is part of a group of investors that purchased the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in 2012 and the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Basil and William J. Brown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2485">'''Alphonse de Beauchamp''' (1767–1832) was a [[French people|French]] historian.

==Life==
He was born in [[Monaco]], he was educated in [[Paris]]. 
He entered the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] military service in 1784, but suffered imprisonment in 1792 for refusing to bear arms against the French Republic. 
Beauchamp escaped to France, where he obtained a position in the office of the Minister of Police, and was assigned the surveillance of the press. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Beauchamp commenced his ''Histoire de la Vendée et des Chouans'' (three volumes, Paris, 1806), which depicted the cruelties of the Fouché regime.  This book displeased the [[Napoleon I of France|Emperor]], and Beauchamp was banished to [[Rheims]]. He was recalled in 1811 and received a subordinate appointment.  Under the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]], he received a pension and wrote for the ''Moniteur'' and the ''Gazette de France''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The ''Mémoires'' of [[Joseph Fouch&amp;#233;|Fouch&amp;#233;]] (Paris, 1828–29) and those of Fauche-Borel have also been ascribed to him, but in the case of the former it seems certain that he only revised and completed a work really composed by Fouché himself.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26086">[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|400px|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]

'''Archaic globalization''' is a phase in the [[history of globalization]], and conventionally refers to globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly 1600 (the following period is known as [[early modern globalization]]). Archaic globalization describes the relationships between [[communities]] and [[state (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and [[social norm]]s at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States began to interact and trade with others within close proximity as a way to acquire coveted goods that were considered [[luxury goods|a luxury]]. This trade led to the spread of ideas such as religion, economic structures and political ideals. [[Merchant]]s became connected and aware of others in ways that had not been apparent. Archaic globalization is comparable to present day [[globalization]] on a much smaller scale. It not only allowed the spread of [[goods]] and [[commodities]] to other regions, but it also allowed people to experience other cultures. Cities that partook in trading were bound together by [[sea lane]]s, [[inland shipping|rivers]], and great overland [[trade route]]s, some of which had been in use since antiquity.&lt;ref name="A-L 33"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trading was broken up according to geographic location, with centers between flanking places serving as "[[breakbulk|break-in-bulk]]" and exchange points for goods destined for more distant markets.&lt;ref name="A-L 33"/&gt; During this time period the subsystems were more self-sufficient than they are today and therefore less vitally dependent upon one another for everyday survival.&lt;ref name="A-L 33"/&gt; While long distance trading came with many trials and tribulations, still so much of it went on during this early time period. Linking the trade together involved eight interlinked subsystems that were grouped into three large circuits, which encompassed the [[western Europe]]an, the [[Middle East]]ern, and the [[Far East]]ern circuits. This interaction during trading was early civilization's way to communicate and spread many ideas that caused [[modern globalization]] to emerge and allowed a new aspect to present-day society.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Defining globalization==
Globalization is the process of increasing interconnectedness between regions and individuals. Steps toward globalization include economic, political, technological, social, and cultural connections around the world. The term "archaic" can be described as early ideals and functions that were once historically apparent in society but may have disintegrated over time.

There are three main prerequisites for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East.&lt;ref name="M 47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions amongst states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 47"/&gt; With early globalization it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others existence and another phase of globalization was able to occur. The third has to do with [[interdependency]], stability and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another then there is no way for them to be mutually affected by one another. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to function. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 48"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of a world system==
Historians argue that a [[world system]] was in order before the rise of capitalism between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. This is referred to as the early age of capitalism where long-distance trade, market exchange and capital accumulation existed amongst states.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; In 800 AD Greek, Roman and Muslim empires emerged covering areas known today as China and the Middle East. Major religions such as Christianity, Islam and Buddhism spread to distant lands where many are still intact today. One of the most popular examples of distant trade routes can be seen with the silk route between China and the Mediterranean, movement and trade with art and luxury goods between Arab regions, South Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships through trade mainly formed in the east and eventually led to the development of capitalism. It was at this time that power and land shifted from the nobility and church to the bourgeoisie and division of labor in production emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossi|first=Ino|title=Frontiers of Globalization Research: Theoretical and Methodological Approaches|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the later part of the twelfth century and the beginning of the thirteenth century an international trade system was developed between states ranging from northwestern Europe to China.&lt;ref name="A-L 8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony The World System A.D. 1250–1350|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1500s other Asian empires emerged, which included trading over longer distances than before. During the early exchanges between states, Europe had little to offer with the exception of slaves, metals, wood and furs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony The World System A.D. 1250–1350|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The push for selling of items in the east drove European production and helped integrate them into the exchange.&lt;ref name="A-L 47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European expansion and growth of opportunities for trade made possible by the Crusades increased the renaissance of agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.&lt;ref name="A-L 47"/&gt; Rapid urbanization throughout Europe allowed a connection from the North Sea to Venice.&lt;ref name="A-L 47"/&gt; Advances in industrialization coupled with the rouse of population growth and the growing demands of the eastern trade, led to the growth of true trading emporia with outlets to the sea.&lt;ref name="A-L 47"/&gt;

There is a 'multi-polar' nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, in which [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of industrial production and economic output, archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by [[Europe]] but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal China and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pre-capitalist movements were regional rather than global and for the most part temporary. This idea of early globalization was proposed by the historian [[A.G. Hopkins]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pramanick|title=Globalization in India: New Frontiers Emerging|year=2010|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|location=New Dehli|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hopkins main points on archaic globalization can be seen with trade, and diaspora that developed from this, as well as religious ideas and empires that spread throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new interaction amongst states led to interconnections between parts of the world which led to the eventual interdependency amongst these state actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main actors that partook in the spreading of goods and ideas were kings, warriors, priests and traders. Hopkins also addresses that during this time period mini-globalizations were prominent and that some collapsed or became more insular.&lt;ref name="M 47"/&gt; These mini-globalizations are referred to as episodic and ruptured, with empires sometimes overreaching and having to retract.&lt;ref name="M 47"/&gt; These mini-globalizations left remnants that allowed the West to adopt these new ideals, leading to the idea of [[Western Capitalism]]. The adopted ideals can be seen in the Western monetary system and are central to systems like capitalism that define modernity and modern globalization.&lt;ref name="M 48"/&gt;

=== The three principles of archaic globalization ===
Archaic globalization consists of three principles: universalizing kingship, expansion of religious movements, and medicinal understanding.
* The universalizing of kingship led soldiers and monarchs far distances to find honor and prestige. However, the crossing over foreign lands also gave the traveling men opportunity to exchange prized goods. This expanded trade between distant lands, which consequently increased the amount of social and economic relations.
* Despite the vast distances covered by monarchs and their companies, [[pilgrimages]] remain one of the greatest global movements of people.
* Finally, the desire for better health was the remaining push behind archaic globalization. While the trading of spices, precious stones, animals, and weapons remained of major importance, people began to seek medicine from faraway lands. This implemented more trade routes, especially to China for their tea.&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Bayly, ''Birth of the Modern World'', (Oxford, 2004) pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic exchange===
With the increase in trade and state linkage, economic exchange extended throughout the region and caused actors to form new relationships.&lt;ref name="M 44"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This early economic development can be seen in [[Champagne Fairs]], which were outdoor markets where traveling merchants came to sell their products and make purchases.&lt;ref name="A-L 52"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, market fairs used barter as opposed to money, once larger itinerant merchants began to frequent them, the need for currency became greater and a money changer needed to be established.&lt;ref name="A-L 52"/&gt; Some historical scholars{{Who|date=June 2011}} argue that this was the beginning of the role of banker and the institution of credit. An example can be seen with one individual in need of an item the urban merchant does not ordinarily stock. The product seeker orders the item, which the merchant promises to bring him next time. The product seeker either gives credit to the merchant by paying them in advance, gets credit from the merchant by promising to pay them once the item is in stock, or some type of concession is made through a down payment. If the product seeker does not have the amount required by the merchant he may borrow from the capital stored by the money changer or he may mortgage part of his expected harvest, either from the money charger or the merchant he is seeking goods from.&lt;ref name="A-L 53"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lengthy transaction eventually resulted in a complex economic system and once the weekly market began to expand from barter to the monetized system required by long-distance trading.&lt;ref name="A-L 53"/&gt;

A higher circuit of trade developed once urban traders from outside city limits travelled from distant directions to the market center in the quest to buy or sell goods. Merchants would then begin to meet at the same spot on a weekly basis allowing for them to arrange with other merchants to bring special items for exchange that were not demanded by the local agriculturalists but for markets in their home towns.&lt;ref name="A-L 53"/&gt; When the local individuals placed advanced orders, customers from towns of different traders may begin to place order for items in a distant town that their trader can order from their counterpart. This central meeting point, becomes the focus of long-distance trade and how it began to increase.&lt;ref name="A-L 53"/&gt;

===Expansion of long distance trade===
In order for trade to be able to expand during this early time period, it required some basic functions of the market as well as the merchants. The first was security. Goods that were being transported began to have more value and the merchants needed to protect their coveted goods especially since they were often traveling through poor areas where the risk of theft was high. To overcome this problem merchants began to travel in [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] as a way to ensure their personal safety as well as the safety of their goods.&lt;ref name="A-L 54"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second prerequisite to early long distant trade had to be an agreement on a rate of exchange. Since many of the merchants came from distant lands with different monetary systems a system had to be put into place as a way to enforce repayment of previous goods, repay previous debt and to ensure contracts were upheld.&lt;ref name="A-L 54"/&gt; Expansion was also able to thrive so long as it had a motive for exchange as a way to promote trade amongst foreign lands. Also, outside merchants access to trading sites was a critical factor in trade route growth.

===The spread of goods and ideas===
The most popular goods produced were spices, which were traded over short distances, while manufactured goods were central to the system and could not have been aided without them.&lt;ref name="A-L 8"/&gt; The invention of money in the form of gold coins in Europe and Middle East and paper money in China around the thirteenth century allowed trade to move more easily between the different actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main actors involved in this system viewed gold, silver, and copper as valuable on different levels. Nevertheless, goods were transferred, prices set, exchange rates agreed upon, contracts entered into, credit extended, partnerships formed and agreements that were made were kept on record and honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony The World System A.D. 1250–1350|year=1991|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time of globalization, credit was also used as a means for trading. The use of credit began in the form of blood ties but later led to the emergence the "banker" as a profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the spread of people came new ideas, religion and goods throughout the land, which had never been apparent in most societies before the movement.&lt;ref name="M 44"/&gt;  Also, this globalization lessened the degree of [[feudal]] life by transitioning from self-sufficient society to a money economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobb|first=Maurice|title=Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism|year=1962|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the trade connecting North Africa and Europe was controlled by the Middle East, China and India around 1400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the danger and great cost of long-distance travel in the pre-modern period, archaic globalization grew out of the trade in high-value commodities which took up a small amount of space. Most of the goods that were produced and traded were considered a luxury and many{{Who|date=June 2011}} considered those with these coveted items to have a higher place on the societal scale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Examples of such luxury goods would include Chinese silks, exotic herbs, coffee, cotton, iron, Indian [[Calico (textile)|calicoes]], [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Gemstone|gems]] and spices or drugs such as [[nutmeg]], [[cloves]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[ambergris]] and [[opium]]. The thirteenth century as well as present day favor luxury items due to the fact that small high-value goods can have high transport costs but still have a high value attached to them, whereas low-value heavy goods are not worth carrying very far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchases of luxury items such as these are described as archaic consumption since trade was largely popular for these items as opposed to everyday needs. The distinction between [[food]], [[drugs]] and [[materia medica]] is often quite blurred in regards to these substances, which were valued not only for their rarity but because they appealed to [[humorism|humoral theories]] of health and the body that were prevalent throughout premodern [[Eurasia]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Major trade routes===
During the time of archaic globalization there were three major trade routes which connected Europe, China and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern most route went through mostly the [[Mongol Empire]] and was nearly 5000 miles long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the route consisted of mostly vast stretches of desert with little to no resources, merchants still traveled it. The route was still traveled because during the 13th century [[Kubilai Khan]] united the Mongol Empire and charged only a small protective rent to travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the unification, merchants from the Middle East used the path but were stopped and taxed at nearly every village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle route went from the coast of Syria to Baghdad from there the traveler could follow the land route through Persia to India, or sail to India via the Persian Gulf. Between the 8th and 10th centuries, Baghdad was a world city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 11th century it began to decline due to natural disasters including floods, earthquakes, and fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1258, Baghdad was taken over by the Mongols. The Mongols forced high taxes on the citizens of Baghdad which led to a decrease in production, causing merchants to bypass the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third, southern most route, went through Mamluk controlled Egypt, After the fall of Baghdad, Cairo became the Islamic capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major cities along these trading routes were wealthy and provided services for merchants and the  international markets. Palmyra and Petra which are located on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, flourished mainly as power centers of trading. They would police the trade routes and be the source of supplies for the merchants caravans. They also became places where people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds could meet and interact. These trading routes were the communication highways for the ancient civilizations and their societies. New inventions, religious beliefs, artistic styles, languages, and social customs, as well as goods and raw materials, were transmitted by people moving from one place to another to conduct business.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art. "Trade Routes between Europe and Asia during Antiquity". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/trade/hd_trade.htm (October 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto-globalization===
[[Proto-globalization]] is the period following archaic globalization which occurred from the 17th through the 19th centuries. The global routes established within the period of archaic globalization gave way to more distinguished expanding routes and more complex systems of trade within the period of proto-globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=A.G.|title=Globalization in World History|year=2003|publisher=Ny: Norton|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-393-97942-8|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar trading arrangements such as the [[East India Company]] appeared within this period, making larger-scale exchanges possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayly|first=A.C|title=The Birth of the Modern World|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Slave trading was especially extensive and the associated mass-production of [[commodities]] on [[plantations]] is characteristic of this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayly|first=C.A.|title=The Birth of the Modern World|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of a measurable amount of polyethnic regions due to these higher frequency trade routes, war became prominent. Such wars include the [[French and Indian War]], [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=A.G.|title=Globalization in World History|year=2003|publisher=Norton|location=New York City, NY|isbn=978-0-393-97942-8|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Anglo-Dutch War]] between England and the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rommelse|first=Gijs|title=The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)|year=2006|publisher=Hilversum|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern globalization===
The modern form of globalization began to take form during the 19th century. The evolving beginnings of this period were largely responsible for the expansion of the West, capitalism and [[imperialism]] backed up by the [[nation-state]] and industrial technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began to emerge during the 1500s, continuing to expand exponentially over time as industrialization developed in the 18th century. The conquests of the British Empire and the Opium Wars added to the industrialization and formation of the growing global society because it created vast consumer regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War I]] is when the first phase of modern globalization began to take force. It is said by [[VM Yeates]] that the economic forces of globalization were part of the cause of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeates|first=VM|title=Winged Victory|year=1962|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since World War I, globalization has expanded greatly. The evolving improvements of [[multinational corporations]], technology, science, and [[mass media]] have all been results of extensive worldwide exchanges. In addition, institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and many international telecommunication companies have also shaped modern globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jurgen|first=Osterhammel|title=Globalization: A Short History|year=2005|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Wide Web has also played a large role in modern globalization. The [[Internet]] provides connectivity across national and international borders, aiding in the enlargement of a global network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elmer|first=Greg|title=Critical Perspectives on the Internet|year=2002|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara Gluck''' (born  1938)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/education/for_teachers/curricula/headlines/ib_siege.html Scenes from the Headlines - Education at the Getty], Barbara Gluck profile at the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; is an American photojournalist, art photographer, speaker, writer, and [[healing facilitator]].

After an early career in advertising she spent almost four years in Vietnam, during the war, and produced award-winning photojournalism during the Vietnam War. During the late 1970s she developed her career as an art photographer, with her "Light Painting" series becoming major museum shows.
 
In the early 1980s she co-founded the Light Institute of Galisteo, in New Mexico, which became famous{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for its "Past Life" work.  In the late 1980s Gluck went on to found the Global Light Network and the Soul Matrix Clearing, Healing and Empowerment System, which focused on releasing "The Primordial Imprints of Separation from God". She has taken this around the world.

== Biography ==
Gluck was born in New York, the daughter of Hungarian immigrants. Her father worked as a diamond setter.&lt;ref name="A decisive moment"&gt;[http://www.rangefindermag.com/repository/rf/articles/pdf/Jan08_128.pdf A decisive moment], Rangefinder magazine, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[NYU]] with a major in communication arts and a minor in journalism, entering a career in advertising with [[McCann Erickson]] and later [[Benton &amp; Bowles]], before the president of the [[Young &amp; Rubicam]] agency hired her as a Special Advisor. Her career as a photojournalist began in earnest during the Vietnam War.  She was based in Saigon 1968/69 and 1972/73, working mostly for ''The New York Times''. In 1976 she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and began her work as an art photographer, with a major exhibit "The Stream" opening at The Museum of Fine Arts in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in 1979. She continued her photojournalism as well. During the 1970s she lectured, co-produced the first New Mexico Film and Photography Festival in Santa Fe's Armory for the Arts, and served (in 1978-79) as a Public Relations and Media Consultant to the Navajo Nation - during the Navajo Hopi Land Dispute Commission. She currently resides in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbaragluck.com/about_barbara.html About Barbara] at Barbara Gluck photography, official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vietnam photography ==
Gluck was one of numerous female photographers to cover the [[Vietnam War]]. During these detachments she both flew with the US military on a B-52 bombing mission and visited [[Viet Cong]] troops, whom she photographed for the cover of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="A decisive moment"/&gt; Mark Edward Harris, in art photography periodical ''B+W magazine'', said "Barbara Gluck's photos have been called 'the Cartier-Bressons of the Vietnam War', and rightly so."&lt;ref&gt;[http://barbaragluck.com/press.html Barbara Gluck spotlight], Mark Edward Harris, Black and White Magazine Issue 31 (June 2004), scan reproduced on Gluck's personal website&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2005, to mark the 30th anniversary of the war's end, the Vietnamese government invited her to participate as a keynote speaker at a "Conference of Reunion and Reconciliation" for contemporary Vietnamese journalists and for foreign journalists who had covered the war. She was also invited to speak at another conference, on "The Role of Journalism in the Development of Vietnam." During the visit she photographed images for a forthcoming book, ''Vietnam: Then and Now'', commissioned to include both her black and white images from the 1970s and new images in color. In early 2005, the J.P. Getty Museum in Los Angeles purchased a portfolio of her vintage Vietnam prints for their permanent collection,{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} and included one of her photographs in the exhibit “Pictures for The Press”, representing 35 images of historic events between 1940 and the 1970s.

==Naturopathic practice==
In 1984 Gluck co-founded The Light Institute of Galisteo, [[New Mexico]], an organization she later left to found a new company, The Global Light Network. She developed a healing process called the Soul Matrix Clearing, Healing and Empowerment Process&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalism.nyu.edu/alumni/news/001585.html Barbara Gluck '59: A photographer shoots war] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706172603/http://journalism.nyu.edu/alumni/news/001585.html |date=July 6, 2007 }}. NYU alumni newsletter.&lt;/ref&gt; which she has since taught around the world.

== Awards ==
Gluck received the 1973 [[World Press Photo]] Foundation award for Outstanding News Photo of the Year, and a Poynter Fellowship at [[Yale University]] for Excellence in Journalism in 1974.

[[File:DeSoto Map HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A map showing a proposed de Soto Expedition route, based on the 1997 Charles M. Hudson book "Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun".]]
'''Charles Melvin Hudson, Jr.''' (1932–2013) was an anthropologist, professor of [[anthropology]] and history at the [[University of Georgia]], and a leading scholar on the history and culture of [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Native Americans in the Southeastern United States]].

==Life==
Hudson grew up on a farm in [[Owen County, Kentucky]], then served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War. After the war, he used the [[G.I. Bill]] to attend the [[University of Kentucky]], receiving a bachelor's degree in anthropology in 1958. He then pursued graduate studies in anthropology at the [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]], earning an M.A. (1962) and a Ph.D. (1965). Upon earning his doctorate, he became a faculty member in the anthropology department at the University of Georgia, where he would spend the next 35 years, until his 2000 retirement, a professor of anthropology and history. After retiring, Hudson returned to Kentucky. He died there on June 8, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Charles Hudson, Jr., http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/onlineathens/obituary.aspx?pid=165292224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly work==
Hudson published ''The Southeastern Indians'' (University of Tennessee Press, 1976), a comprehensive overview of the region's native peoples. He was perhaps best known for his extensive research of [[Hernando de Soto]]'s 1539–1543 expedition across the Southeast. In 1984, Hudson and fellow researchers [[Marvin T. Smith]] and [[Chester DePratter]] mapped the route taken by de Soto's expedition by using written accounts of expedition members and matching them with geographic features and archaeological evidence of Indian settlements. Hudson and his colleagues argued that the sites of these settlements formed a [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition|chain across the Southeast]] that marked the path that would have been taken by the expedition.  [https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2007-12-15-desoto_N.htm].

His other works included ''Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun'' (University of Georgia Press, 1997), a detailed account of the de Soto expedition. In his retirement, he began writing historical novels.

A strong advocate of fostering close ties between the disciplines of anthropology and history, Hudson was one of the founders of the [[Southern Anthropological Society]], serving as president of the organization in 1973–74. In 1993–94 he served as president of the [[American Society for Ethnohistory]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pluckhahn and Robbie Ethridge, eds., ''Light on the Path: The Anthropology and History of the Southeastern Indians'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2006), pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quote==

{{cquote|''The problem of writing the social history of the Native peoples of the Southeast is formidable. One has to simultaneously represent both synchronic social and cultural systems and the diachronic change that transforms them. One has to both represent the exotic world of the Southeastern chiefdoms and the European world-system that impinged upon them as "storms brewed in other men's lands"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Storms-Brewed-Other-Mens-Worlds/dp/0806128690&lt;/ref&gt; and in time destroyed, dissolved, or enveloped by them. And we must do it with the merest fragments of archaeological and oral evidence. As cultural and social beings, the Native peoples of the Southeast have been fundamentally transformed by history several times over, as have we all. If the Native peoples of the Americas are ever to be more than moral fodder for various ideologies—whether left, right, or postmodern—they must find their proper place in the social history of the modern world. Since 1976 some progress has been made on this front by archaeologists, ethnohistorians, and historians, but much more remains to be done. ''|20px|20px|- '' Charles M. Hudson, 2000''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_indian_quarterly/v024/24.3hudson.html|title=Reply to Mary Churchill|accessdate = September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5294">'''Critical historiography''' approaches the [[history of art]], [[history of literature|literature]] or [[history of architecture|architecture]] from a [[critical theory]] perspective. Critical [[historiography]] is used by various scholars in recent decades to emphasize the ambiguous relationship between the past and the writing of history. Specifically, it is used as a method by which one understands the past and can be applied in various fields of academic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuyorganics: Organic Intellectualism, the Search for Racial Identity, and Nuyorican Thought|last=Bernard-Carreño|first=Regina|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|isbn=9781433106101|location=New York|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Concept ==
While historiography is concerned with the theory and history of historical writing, including the study of the developmental trajectory of history as a [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]], critical historiography addresses how historians or historical authors have been influenced by their own groups and loyalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Historiography of Persian Architecture|last=Gharipour|first=Mohammad|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138915022|location=New York|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, there is an assumption that historical sources should not be taken at face value and has to be examined critically according to scholarly criteria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultures of Wissenschaft des Judentums at 200|last=Thulin|first=Mirjam|publisher=Universitätsverlag Potsdam|year=2018|isbn=9783869564401|location=Potsdam|pages=70-71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some authors trace the origin of this field in nineteenth-century [[Germany]], particularly with ''[[Leopold von Ranke]]'', one of the proponents of the concept of ''[[Wissenschaft]]'', which means "critical history" or "scientific history", which viewed historiography as a rigorous, critical inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Global Encyclopedia of Historical Writing: A-J|last=Woolf|first=Daniel|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|isbn=0815315147|location=New York|pages=819}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the application of ''Wissenschaft'' to the study of [[Judaism]], it is maintained that there is an implied criticism of the stand of those advocating Orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is said to reveal the tendency of nationalist historians to favor the pious affirmation of the orthodox in attempts to restore pride in Jewish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-history|last=Biale|first=David|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1982|isbn=0674363329|location=Cambridge|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A type of critical historiography can be seen in the work of [[Harold Bloom]].  In ''Map of Misreading'', Bloom argued that poets should not be seen as autonomous agents of creativity, but rather as part of a history that transcends their own production and that to a large degree gives it shape. The historian can try to stabilize poetic production so as to better understand the work of art, but can never completely extract the historical subject from history. 

Also among those who argue for the primacy of historiography is the architectural historian [[Mark Jarzombek]]. The focus of this work is on disciplinary production rather than poetic production, as was the case with Bloom. Since psychology – which became a more or less official science in the 1880s – is now so pervasive, Jarzombek argued, but yet so difficult to pinpoint, the traditional dualism of subjectivity and objectivity has become not only highly ambiguous, but also the site of a complex negotiation that needs to take place between the historian and the discipline. The issue, for Jarzombek, is particular poignant in the fields of art and architectural history, the principal subject of the book. [[Pierre Nora]]'s notion of "ego-histories" also moves in the direction of critical historiography. The idea of these histories is to bring into focus the relationship between the personality of historians and their life choices in the process of writing of history.

A critique of critical historiography cites the risk of judging the realities of the past by the yardstick of what is true in the present so that it becomes illusory and can obscure identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=FeVdNxyFiKsC&amp;pg=RA3-PT326&amp;dq=Critical+historiography+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp6umXqdDeAhUDFYgKHZDDDqYQ6AEIVjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Critical%20historiography%20definition&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to the Philosophy of History and Historiography|last=Tucker|first=Aviezer|date=2011-06-28|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781444351521|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:073A.David and Jonathan.jpg|270px|thumbnail|right|"David and Jonathan" one of [[Gustave Doré's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Doré's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']]]]
'''David''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|דָּוִד}}; ''Dāwīḏ'' or ''David'') '''and Jonathan''' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|יְהוֹנָתָן}}; ''Yəhōnāṯān'' or ''Yehonatan'') were heroic figures of the [[ancient Israel|Kingdom of Israel]], who formed a [[Covenant (historical)|covenant]] of friendship recorded in the [[books of Samuel]].

[[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]] was the son of [[Saul]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]], of the [[tribe of Benjamin]], and [[David]] was the son of [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]], of the [[tribe of Judah]], and Jonathan's presumed rival for the crown. David became king. The covenant the two men had formed eventually led to David, after Jonathan's death, graciously seating Jonathan's son [[Mephibosheth]] at his own royal table instead of eradicating the former king Saul's line.

The biblical text does not explicitly depict the nature of the relationship between David and Jonathan. The traditional and mainstream religious interpretation of the relationship has been one of [[platonic love]] and an example of [[homosociality]]. Some later Medieval and Renaissance literature drew upon the story to underline strong personal friendships between men, some of which involved [[romantic love]] and could be described as [[romantic relationship]]s.

In modern times, some scholars, writers, and activists have emphasized elements of [[homoeroticism]] in the story. A number of groups made up of gay Roman Catholics trying to reconcile their faith with their sexuality have also adopted the name - Davide e Gionata (Italy), and David et Jonathan (France).&lt;ref&gt;John Cornwall, ''Breaking faith: The pope, the people and the future of catholicism'', Viking, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Bible ==
The relationship between David and Jonathan is mainly covered in the [[Hebrew Bible]] [[Book of Samuel]]. The episodes belong to the story of David's ascent to power, which is commonly regarded as one of the sources of the Deuteronomistic history, and to its later additions.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, John. ''Introduction to the Hebrew Bible'' Canada: Augsburg Fortress,2004.(p.225).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David]], the youngest son of [[Jesse]], slays Goliath at the Valley of Elah where the Philistine army is in a standoff with the army of King Saul (Jonathan's father).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1 Sam.|17|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; David's victory begins a rout of the Philistines who are driven back to Gath and the gates of Ekron. Abner brings David to Saul while David is still holding Goliath's severed head. Jonathan, the eldest son of Saul, has also been fighting the Philistines.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1 Sam.|14|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan takes an immediate liking to David and the two form a covenant:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself. Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt. So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war. (NASB)&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1 Samuel|18:1-5|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Death of Jonathan ===
As Saul continues to pursue David, the pair renew their covenant, after which they do not meet again. Eventually Saul and David are reconciled. Jonathan, however, is slain on [[Mount Gilboa|Mt. Gilboa]] along with his two brothers [[Abinadab]] and [[Malchi-shua]], and there Saul commits suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1 Samuel|31:1-6|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; David learns of Saul and Jonathan's death and chants a lament,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2 Samuel|1:1-17|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in part says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their life, And in their death they were not parted; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions ... How have the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places. I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was more wonderful than the love of women. How have the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2 Samuel|1:23-27|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Views ==

=== Jewish interpretation ===

"The sages characterized the relationship between Jonathan and David in the following [[Mishnah]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Whenever love depends on some selfish end, when the end passes away, the love passes away; but if it does not depend on some selfish end, it will never pass away. Which love depended on a selfish end? This was the love of Amnon and Tamar. And which did not depend on a selfish end? This was the love of David and Jonathan. (Avot 5:15)"&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;[http://www.uscj.org/israelcenter/haftarah/Toldot5765.html Parshat Toldot, Mahar Hodesh,(1 Samuel 20:18-42) November 13, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126014202/http://www.uscj.org/israelcenter/haftarah/Toldot5765.html |date=November 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi Shimon ben Tzemach Duran (Spain, North Africa 14th-15th century) delineated the significance of this mishnah: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Anyone who establishes a friendship for access to power, money, or sexual relations; when these ends are not attainable, the friendship ceases…love that is not dependent on selfish ends is true love of the other person since there is no intended end.” (Magen Avot – abridged and adapted translation)&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Traditional Christian interpretation ===
A platonic interpretation for the relationship between David and Jonathan has been the mainstream view found in biblical exegesis, as led by [[Christian]] writers. This argues that the relationship between the two, although strong and close, is ultimately a [[platonic love|platonic]] friendship. The covenant that is made is political, and not erotic; while any intimacy is a case of male bonding and homosociality.
[[File:Saul Tries to Kill David by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld.png|thumb|200px|left|"Saul Tries to Kill David" by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]

David and Jonathan's love is understood as the intimate camaraderie between two young soldiers with no sexual involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewordtoday.com/comments/1samuel/mh/1samuel18.htm [[Matthew Henry]], 1Samuel 18:1-5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625073708/http://www.ewordtoday.com/comments/1samuel/mh/1samuel18.htm |date=2010-06-25 }}; 2Samual 1:17-27&lt;/ref&gt; The books of Samuel do not actually document [[physical intimacy]] between the two characters aside from "kissing,"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1 Sam.|20:41|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the euphemisms the Bible uses for sexual relations are missing, and nothing indicates that David and Jonathan slept together. Neither of the men is described as having problems in their [[heterosexual]] married life. David had an abundance of wives and [[concubines]] as well as an adulterous affair with [[Bathsheba]], and apparently suffered impotence only as an old man, while Jonathan had a five-year-old son at his death.&lt;ref&gt;James B. deYoung, Homosexuality, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the argument that homoeroticism was edited out, some traditionalists who subscribe to the [[Documentary Hypothesis]] note the significance of the lack of censoring of the descriptions at issue, in spite of the Levitical injunctions against homoerotic contact. Gagnon notes, "The narrator’s willingness to speak of David’s vigorous heterosexual life (compare the relationship with Bathsheba) puts in stark relief his (their) complete silence about any sexual activity between David and Jonathan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robgagnon.net/articles/homosexNewsweekMillerResp.pdf Prof. Dr. Robert A. J. Gagnon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Presuming such editing would have taken place, Martti Nissinen comments, "Their mutual love was certainly regarded by the editors as faithful and passionate, but without unseemly allusions to forbidden practices ... Emotional and even physical closeness of two males did not seem to concern the editors of the story, nor was such a relationship prohibited by [[Leviticus]]." [[Homosociality]] is not seen as being part of the sexual [[taboo]] in the biblical world.&lt;ref&gt;Martti Nissinen, Kirsi Stjerna, ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval and Renaissance allusions ===
[[File:Jonathan Embraces David from Caspar Luiken.jpg|thumbnail|Jonathan embraces David from Caspar Luiken’s ''Historiae Celebriores Veteris Testamenti Iconibus Representatae'' (1712)]]
[[Medieval]] literature occasionally drew upon the biblical relationship between David and Jonathan to underline strong personal and intimate friendships between men. The story has also frequently been used as a coded reference to [[homoerotic]] relations when the mention was socially discouraged or even punished.&lt;ref&gt;Rocke, Michael. 1996. ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence''. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The anonymous ''[[Vita Edwardi Secundi]]'', [[circa|c.]]&amp;nbsp;1326&amp;nbsp;AD, wrote: "Indeed I do remember to have heard that one man so loved another. Jonathan cherished David, [[Achilles]] loved [[Patroclus]]." And thus, [[King Edward II]] wept for his dead lover [[Piers Gaveston]] as: "... David had mourned for Jonathan.".&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Childs, Ed. (2005). ''Vita Edwardi Secundi''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-927594-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Roger of Hoveden]], a twelfth-century chronicler, deliberately drew comparisons in his description of “The King of France ([[Philip II Augustus]]) [who] loved him ([[Richard the Lionheart]]) as his own soul.”&lt;ref&gt;Roger of Hoveden, ''The Annals'', trans. Henry T. Riley, 2.&amp;nbsp;Vols. London: H.G. Bohn, 1853; repr. New York: AMS Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance artists [[David (Donatello)|Donatello]] and [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo]] both brought out strong [[homoerotic]] elements in their respective sculptures depicting the youthful David.&lt;ref&gt;Rocke, Michael. 1996. ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence''. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern interpretations ===

==== Homoeroticism ====
[[File:David and Jonathan.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''David and Jonathan''&lt;br&gt; The biblical account of David and Jonathan has been read by some as the story of two lovers. &lt;br&gt;"La Somme le Roy", 1290 AD; French illuminated ms (detail); British Museum]]

Some modern scholars and writers have interpreted the love between David and Jonathan as more intimate than platonic friendship. This was first pioneered by Tom Horner,&lt;ref&gt;Horner, Tom M. ''Jonathan Loved David: Homosexuality in Biblical Times.'' The Westminster John Knox Press, Pennsylvania, 1978, {{ISBN|0664241859}}&lt;/ref&gt; then adopted by [[John Boswell]].&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, John. ''Same-sex Unions in Premodern Europe.'' New York: Vintage, 1994. (pp. 135-137)&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation views the bonds the men shared as romantic love, regardless of whether the relationship was physically consummated. Jonathan and David cared deeply about each other in a way that was arguably stronger and more intimate than a platonic friendship.

David's praise in {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|1:26|NASB}} for Jonathan's 'love' (for him) over the 'love' of women is considered evidence for same-sex attraction, along with Saul's exclamation to his son at the dinner table, "I know you have chosen the son of Jesse - which is a disgrace to yourself and the nakedness of your mother!" The "choosing" (''bahar'') may indicate a permanent choice and firm relationship, and the mention of "nakedness" (''erwa'') could be interpreted to convey a negative sexual nuance, giving the impression that Saul saw something indecent in Jonathan and David's relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Martti Nissinen, ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World'', Minneapolis, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also point out that the relationship between the two men is addressed with the same words and emphasis as other love relationships in the Hebrew Testament, whether heterosexual or between God and people: e.g. ''''ahava'''' or אהבה.&amp;lrm;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160701201653/https://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/words.pl?word=0160 Hebrew word #160]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Gen.|29:20|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Sam.|13:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Prv.|5:19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Sg.|2:4-7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Sg.|3:5-10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Sg.|5:8|HE}})&lt;/ref&gt;

When they are alone together, David confides that he has "found grace in Jonathan's eyes", a phrase proponents say normally refers to romantic or physical attraction. Throughout the passages, David and Jonathan consistently affirm and reaffirm their love and devotion to one another, and Jonathan is willing to betray his father, family, wealth, and traditions for David.

That there is more than mere homosociality in the dealings of David and Jonathan is asserted by two recent studies: the biblical scholar [[Susan Ackerman (biblical scholar)|Susan Ackerman]],&lt;ref&gt;''When Heroes Love: The Ambiguity of Eros in the Stories of Gilgamesh and David'' (New York &amp; Chichester, Columbia University Press, 2005), pp. 165-231&lt;/ref&gt; and the Orientalist Jean-Fabrice Nardelli.&lt;ref&gt;''Homosexuality and Liminality in the Gilgamesh and Samuel'' (Amsterdam, Hakkert, 2007), pp. 28-63&lt;/ref&gt; Ackerman and Nardelli argue that the narrators of the books of Samuel encrypted same-sex allusions in the texts where David and Jonathan interact so as to insinuate that the two heroes were lovers. Ackerman explains this as a case of liminal, viz. transitory, homosexuality, deployed by the redactors as a textual means to assert David's rights against Jonathan's: the latter willingly alienated his princely status by bowing down ({{bibleverse|1 Samuel|20:41|NASB}}), sexually speaking, to the former. Nardelli disagrees and argues that the various covenants Jonathan engaged David into as the superior partner gradually elevated David's status and may be seen as marriage-like.

Susan Ackerman also believes that there is highly eroticized language present in six different sections in the Hebrew Bible in regards to the relationship of David and Jonathan.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATKodvnYS4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=When+Heroes+Love:.+The+Ambiguity+of+Eros+in+the+Stories+of+Gilgamesh+and+David&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yuIxT4-AQx&amp;sig=-1FWMaWuP39q393kYu7TAepj0rc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vmDZTICYLYeglAeohu2_CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=When Heroes Love: The Ambiguity Of Eros In The Stories Of Gilgamesh And David - Susan Ackerman - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six sections she mentions are 1) David and Jonathan's first meeting in 1 Sam. 18:1-18:4 2) the most important description of David and Jonathan's first few meetings in 1 Sam 19:1-19:7. 3) the incident of Saul berating Jonathan for his friendship with David in 1 Sam 20:30-20:34 4) David fleeing from the court of King Saul in 1 Sam. 20:1-20:42 5) the description of David and Jonathan's final meeting in 1 Sam. 23:15-23:18 and 6) David's lament (the Song of the Bow) for Saul and Jonathan. Of these six examples, Ackerman identifies the most important example being the last one (the Song of the Bow) due to David's assertion that Jonathan's love to David "was more wonderful than the love of women".&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

Although David was married, David himself articulates a distinction between his relationship with Jonathan and the bonds he shares with women. David is married to many women, one of whom is Jonathan's sister Michal, but the Bible does not mention David loving Michal (though it is stated that Michal loves David).

Nissinen has concluded:&lt;ref&gt;Martti Nissinen, Homoeroticism in the Biblical World, Minneapolis, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Perhaps these homosocial relationships, based on love and equality, are more comparable with modern homosexual people's experience of themselves than those texts that explicitly speak of homosexual acts that are aggressive, violent expressions of domination and subjection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Counter-arguments ====
Other interpreters point out that neither the books of Samuel nor Jewish tradition documents sanctioned romantic or erotic physical intimacy between the two characters, which the Bible elsewhere makes evident when between heterosexuals, most supremely in the [[Song of Solomon]]. It is also known that covenants were common, &lt;!-- and that the word is never used to denote marriage between man and women,&lt;ref&gt;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- counterexample: Malachi 2:14 --&gt; and that marriage was a public event and included customs not seen in this story.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Barnes, Judges 14:10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sketches of Jewish Social Life. Cp. 9 (Edersheim)&lt;/ref&gt;

The platonic interpretation of David and Jonathan's relationship is advocated by the religious writer [[Robert A. J. Gagnon]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible and Homosexual Practice. Texts and Hermeneutics'' (Nashville, Abingdon Press, 2001), pp. 146-154&lt;/ref&gt; and the Assyriologist Markus Zehnder&lt;ref&gt;Observations on the Relationship Between David and Jonathan and the Debate on Homosexuality, ''Westminster Theological Journal'' 69 (2007), pp. 127-174&lt;/ref&gt; and is consistent with commonly held theological views condemning same sex relations.&lt;ref&gt;"Welcoming But Not Affirming," by [[Stanley J. Grenz]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of the robe is seen as a ceremonial act following the precedent of Aaron, of whom God commanded, "And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son",&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 20:26; cf. Esther 3:6&lt;/ref&gt; in transference of the office of the former upon the latter. In like manner, Jonathan would be symbolically and prophetically transferring the kingship of himself (as the normal heir) to David, which would come to pass.&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon, The Bible and Homosexual Practice, pp. 146-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Zehnder, “Observations on the Relationship between David and Jonathan and the Debate on Homosexuality,” Westminster Theological Journal 69.1 [2007]: 127-74)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E Schmidt, “Straight or Narrow?”&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the mention of "nakedness" in 1 Samuel 20:30 could be interpreted to convey a negative sexual nuance, it is related to Jonathan's mother [[Ahinoam]] rather than Jonathan ("to the shame of the nakedness of your mother"). [[Jon Levenson]] and [[Baruch Halpern]] suggest that the phrase suggests "David's theft of Saul's wife", and that the verse supports the construction that Ahinoam, the wife of Saul is the same Ahinoam who became David's wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon D. Levenson]] and [[Baruch Halpern]], "The Political Import of David's Marriages," ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature|JBL]]'' 99 [1980] 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

These interpreters also argue that the description in 2 Samuel 1:26 of the “love” (Hebrew: “ahava”) between David and Jonathan that is greater than the “love of women” should be understood in light of the two earlier mentions of “love” (ahava) between David and Jonathan where it is described not as love for a romantic partner but love for self (“he loved him as his own soul,” 1 Sam 18:3; 20:17).

Furthermore, the phrase “David has found grace in Jonathan's eyes,” mentioned above, is not normally a reference to romantic or physical attraction, since in 45 of the 46 other occurrences it refers to finding grace either in the eyes of God,&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 6:8; 18:3; 19:19; Exodus 33:12, 13, 16, 17; 34:9; Numbers 11:11, 15; Judges 6:17; 2 Samuel 15:25; Proverbs 3:4&lt;/ref&gt; of a ruler or wealthy landowner,&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 39:4; 39:21; 47:25; 50:4; Numbers 32:5; Ruth 2:2, 10, 13; 1 Samuel 1:18; 16:22; 20:29; 25:8; 27:5; 2 Samuel 14:22; 16:4; 1 Kings 11:29; Esther 5:2, 8; 7:3; 8:5)&lt;/ref&gt; of a close relative,&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 30:27; 32:6; 33:8, 10, 15; 47:29; 1 Samuel 20:29&lt;/ref&gt; of the father of a potential bride,&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 34:11; 1 Kings 11:19&lt;/ref&gt; or of a nation.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 3:21; 11:3; 12:36; Esther 2:15&lt;/ref&gt; The only occurrence where the phrase is used of lovers is a wife no longer finding grace in the eyes of her husband, not because he no longer finds her physically attractive but because he has “found some indecency in her” (Deuteronomy 24:1).&lt;ref&gt;While some may be inclined to add Esther 5:2, 8; 7:3; and 8:5 as other examples of a person "finding grace in the eyes of" his/her lover, the language here is the same as other appeals to an authority.&lt;/ref&gt;

In platonic respects, such as in sacrificial loyalty and zeal for the kingdom, Jonathan's love is seen as surpassing that of romantic or erotic affection,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry&lt;/ref&gt; especially that of the women David had known up until that time. The grammatical and social difficulties are pointed out in respect to 1 Samuel 18:21,&lt;ref&gt;Keil and Delitzsch; and is seen as referring to Merab and Michal: John Gill; T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 19. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the marked difference in the Bible between sensual kissing (as in ''[[Song of Songs]]'') and the cultural kiss of Near Eastern culture whether in greeting or as expression of deep affection between friends and family (as found throughout the Old and New Testaments).&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; The strong emotive language expressed by David towards Jonathan is also argued to be akin to that of platonic expressions in more expressive or pre-urban cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. C; Jerry, D; Narvaez, M; Johnson, D. Public displays of affection among Asian and Latino heterosexual couples. Psychological Reports. 1999;84:1201–1202&lt;/ref&gt;

Orly Keren additionally posits that the relationship between Jonathan and David was not without enlightened self-interest on both sides: Jonathan in obtaining guarantees for his own future and that of his family, and David in creating and maintaining a public image. Keren suggests that David's lament for Jonathan may have been a calculated pose for a people mourning a popular prince.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jot.sagepub.com/content/37/1/3.abstract Keren, Orly. "David and Jonathan: A Case of Unconditional Love?", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' September, 2012, vol. 37 no. 1 3-23, doi: 10.1177/0309089212455544 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

At his 1895 trial, [[Oscar Wilde]] cited the example of David and Jonathan in support of "the love that dare not speak its name": "Such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;Neil McKenna, ''The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde'', London, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Lambeth conference|Lambeth]] essay of December 2007, [[James Stuart Jones|James Jones]], the [[Bishop of Liverpool]], drew particular attention to the "emotional, spiritual, and even physical" friendship between David and Jonathan:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=James |editor-last=Stevenson |editor-first=Kenneth |title=A Fallible Church: Lambeth Essays |publisher=Darton Longman and Todd |date=January 2008 |orig-year=December 2007 |chapter=Making Space for Truth and Grace |chapter-url=http://liverpool.anglican.org/people/bishops/jamesspeeches/0712_Lambeth_essay.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212232929/http://liverpool.anglican.org/people/bishops/jamesspeeches/0712_Lambeth_essay.htm |archive-date=February 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |isbn=978-0232527308}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote |text=There was between them a deep emotional bond that left David grief-stricken when Jonathan died. But not only were they emotionally bound to each other they expressed their love physically. Jonathan stripped off his clothes and dressed David in his own robe and armour. With the candour of the Eastern World that exposes the reserve of Western culture they kissed each other and wept openly with each other. The fact that they were both married did not inhibit them in emotional and physical displays of love for each other. This intimate relationship was sealed before God. It was not just a spiritual bond it became covenantal for “Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul” (1 Samuel 18:3). Here is the Bible bearing witness to love between two people of the same gender.}}

In 1993 a member of the [[Knesset]] in [[Israel]], [[Yael Dayan]], provoked controversy when she referred to David and Jonathan in a parliamentary debate in support of whether gay men and women could serve in the Israeli military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Block |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/gay-king-david-theory-starts-goliath-of-a-row-1472290.html |title=Gay King David theory starts Goliath of a row - World - News |publisher=The Independent |date=1993-02-11 |accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tim Winton]]'s 2018 novel ''The Shepherd's Hut'' (published by Hamish Hamilton) the old hermit, Fintan, a defrocked priest, alludes to this biblical couple, at page 181: "Fintan reckoned  we was the original odd couple, a veritable David and Jonathan he said, like they was some chilled dudes."

'''Eliahu Sacharoff''' was a member of the [[Haganah]] who, on 8 October 1943, was sentenced by a military court in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] to seven years' imprisonment after being found guilty of possessing more ammunition than his firearm license allowed.

The mayor of [[Tel Aviv]] gave evidence as a defence witness said that he approved of the Haganah as a defensive organization to protect life and property.

According to the president of the court, W. Russell Lawrence, Sacharoff was tried and convicted under Regulation 8C (b) Emergency Regulations, 1936 (as amended) for being in possession of two rounds, one of which was of a special kind stolen from a consignment delivered to the [[Suez]] docks in February 1943. According to this account, documents in Sacharoff's possession showed him to be directly linked to the conspirators who had carried out the theft.

'''Fabrice d'Almeida'''(born 15 November 1963) is a [[France|French]] historian. His expertise lies in history of the media, image propaganda and manipulation.

After receiving his master's degree from the [[Sorbonne]] and [[Sciences Po]], he earned a Ph.D from the [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense]]. As a fellow of the École Française de Rome, he initiated the study of  socialism in France and Italy therefore becoming one of the first comparative historians in France. He was invited to the TU-Berlin in Germany as a guest professor as the recipient of the Alexander von Humboldt fellowship, under the supervision of [[Jürgen Kocka]] and [[:de:Hartmut Kaelble|Harmut Kaelble]] (ZVGE). D'Almeida also  spent  two years in Berlin at the Marc Bloch Center. Upon his return to Paris he was promoted to director of the Institut d’Histoire du Temps Présent (IHTP CNRS) and was then elected to be full professor at [[Panthéon-Assas University]]. He is now the director of  Master Media and Globalization at the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifp.u-paris2.fr/37238164/0/fiche___pagelibre/&amp;RH=IFP-ENSEIG|title=IFP : Institut Français de Presse - D'Almeida Fabrice|first=isabelle|last=Demier|website=ifp.u-paris2.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifp.u-paris2.fr/22188893/0/fiche___pagelibre/&amp;RH=IFP-ENSEIG|title=IFP : Institut Français de Presse - D'Almeida Fabrice|first=isabelle|last=Demier|website=ifp.u-paris2.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed publisher at Albin Michel in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livreshebdo.fr/article/albin-michel-fabrice-dalmeida-directeur-litteraire|title=Albin Michel : Fabrice d’Almeida, directeur littéraire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work with [[:fr:Anthony Rowley|Antony Rowley]], ''Et si on refaisait l’histoire ?'' is a reflection on French history. It is one of  the first "What-If?" genre histories in France.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odilejacob.com/catalogue/history-and-geopolitics/asking-quotwhat-ifquot-in-history_9782738126375.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Fabrice d'Almeida was brought to the attention of the general public through the release of several documentaries and TV films such as "Love, Hate, and Propaganda." (CBC-Toronto)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3948180/|title=Fabrice d'Almeida|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''High Society Under the Third Reich'' is the first systematic study of the relationship between German high society and the Nazis. It uses unpublished archival material, private diaries and diplomatic documents to explore the hidden areas of power where privileges, tax breaks, and stolen property were exchanged.&lt;ref&gt;http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745643124.html&lt;/ref&gt;
His most recently published book in France focused on the management of the SS concentration camp guards.

'''Facing History and Ourselves''' is a [[non-profit organization]] in the [[United States]], founded in 1976.  The group develops educational material on [[prejudice]]s and injustice in American and European society, with a focus on [[Nazi Germany]] and [[The Holocaust]]. The organization is based in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]] with 180 staff members in the main office and in other U.S. states.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Human rights education through the `Facing History and Ourselves' program|last = Brabeck|first = Mary|date = 1994|journal = Journal of Moral Education|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Kenny|first2 = Maureen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Since the late 1970s, the group claims to have trained over 10,000 teachers, who have taught over half a million students in the U.S. and Canada. The curriculum is now also used in [[Israel]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[South Africa]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.facinghistory.org/|title = Facing History and Ourselves|date = 2014|accessdate = November 20, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of their revenue comes from grants and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.massnonprofit.org/news.php?artid=3891&amp;catid=11|title = Roger Brooks is New President of Facing History and Ourselves|last = |first = |date = November 7, 2014|work = |accessdate = November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching workshops, seminars, guest speakers, and resource materials are funded by the contributions and gifts. Corporations and foundations{{which|date=December 2014}} have donated contributions of up to $99,000{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Contributors that donate 100,000 or more are placed into FHAO’s Sustaining Gift Program, which currently includes over 86 families and foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Facing History FY11 Annual Report|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.socialimpactexchange.org/sites/www.socialimpactexchange.org/files/Facing%20History%20FY11%20Annual%20Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] donated over $200,000 for the implementation of common-core standards in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database/Grants/2013/07/OPP1093516|title = Facing History and Ourselves National Foundation, Inc.|date = |accessdate = November 20, 2014|website = Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curriculum ==
The course is aimed at [[middle school]] and [[high school]] students. In the classroom, students take part in group discussions and use [[primary source]] material to learn about different historical events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The curriculum aims to create a history course with a reflective component, allowing students to think about modern day prejudices. The semester-long class starts with learning about the impact of the individual in society and how one is affected by his or her environment and culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Students then learn about governments and the roles citizens play in their nation, and talk about the effects of [[Bystander effect|bystander]]s in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=d3566b9b-c220-4815-9b6a-a47bc0419675%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=106&amp;hid=103|title = Facing History and Ourselves: Portrait of a Classroom|last = Fine|first = Melinda|date = December 1991|journal = Educational Leadership|accessdate = November 20, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes gradually move into talking about [[dehumanization]] and how different societal groups can turn against each other, threatening a democracy. The course is taught by looking into [[racial segregation in the United States]]. Students also learn about the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Cambodian genocide|Cambodian Genocide]], and the history of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[History of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans]] in the USA. The final subject focused on is [[anti-semitism]] and Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The course aims to connect the events with the students’ lives by calling for reflection. Students are asked to think about familiar subjects such as [[peer pressure]], [[conformity]], and [[belongingness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=d3566b9b-c220-4815-9b6a-a47bc0419675%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=146&amp;hid=103|title = Facing History and Ourselves|last = Sleeper|first = Martin|date = November 1990|journal = Educational Leadership|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |last2 = Strom|first2 = Margot Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course's goal is to help students realize their role in society, and to promote [[global citizenship]] so that future events like the ones discussed can be prevented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Programs==
FHAO offers professional development programs for educators interested in teaching the subject. To meet local, state, or national mandates, the organization works with the school district. The course also meets [[Common Core Standards]] by offering resources and professional development, using primary source material. The organization has been working longest with [[Boston Public Schools]] and has developed units for their civics and history curricula for grades 8-11. They also work with departments of education to meet their individual standards as well. Working with high school and middle school teachers, they are taught how to lead group discussions, introduce controversial topics, and establish a classroom environment necessary for the course. FHAO provides online courses divided into single week sessions, which include group discussions, videos, and conference calls. In addition to working with individual educators, the organization also goes to schools and school districts to lead seminars and programs. After attending a seminar, taking an online course, or participating in a workshop, teachers have access to a free online lending library and individual coaching, and can book guest speakers for the classroom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Educator resources on the group's website include lesson plans, readings, study guides, teaching strategies, library resources, videos, and project ideas. The readings are broken down into the topics of anti-semitism, the Armenian Genocide, the [[Civil Rights Movement]], democracy, [[eugenics]], [[genocide]] and [[collective violence]], The Holocaust, [[human rights]], [[human behavior]], and [[immigration]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Staff ==
Roger Brooks was appointed as Facing History and Ourselves’ president and CEO from December 1, 2014. Brooks was formerly Dean of the Faculty and Chief Academic Officer at [[Connecticut College]]. Margot Stern Strom, the executive director,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; cofounded the organization in 1976 and received the Charles A. Dana Award for Pioneering Achievements in Education on November 5, 1997 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/command/detail?sid=d3566b9b-c220-4815-9b6a-a47bc0419675%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=122&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl|title = People|last = Coles|first = Adrienne D.|date = October 22, 1997|journal = Education Week|accessdate = November 20, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
The group's evaluation department claims to have performed over 140 studies which show the program to be effective and beneficial to students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2006 the [[Institute of Education Sciences]] of the [[United States Department of Education]] released a [[What Works Clearinghouse|WWC]] intervention report. It evaluated eight studies conducted by FHAO, and seven did not meet WWC evidence standards and reservations. When evaluating the studies, WWC did not notice [[statistical significance]] in knowledge, attitudes, and values. The one study that did meet standards showed [[Outcome-based education|primary outcome]]s of relationship maturity, [[ethnic identity]], civic attitudes and participation, racism, and moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/pdf/intervention_reports/WWC_Facing_History_090806.pdf|title = WWC Intervention Report|last = |first = |date = September 8, 2006|journal = What Works Clearinghouse|accessdate = November 20, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study suggested that, in a group of 346 eighth grade students, Facing History positively affected their maturity level and made them less racist. It did not show significant change in students’ [[moral reasoning]]. Difference in change of ethnic reasoning{{clarify|date=December 2014}} was slightly significant from a pre-test to a post-test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=d3566b9b-c220-4815-9b6a-a47bc0419675%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=117&amp;hid=103|title = The Value of a Developmental Approach to Evaluating Character Development Programmes: an outcome study of Facing History and Ourselves.|last = Schultz|first = Lynn Hickey|date = March 2001|journal = Journal of Moral Education|accessdate = November 20, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing History has been said{{by whom|date=December 2014}} to be the only way some students learn about the Holocaust in today’s society, and historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] wrote in 1995 that this single approach is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.learntoquestion.com/resources/database/archives/000717.html|title = Not Facing History|last = Lipstadt|first = Deborah E.|date = March 6, 1995|journal = New Republic|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theofan Stilian Noli''', known as '''Fan Noli''' (6 January 1882 – 13 March 1965), was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] writer, scholar, diplomat, politician, historian, orator and founder of the [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Orthodox Church of Albania]], who served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|Prime Minister]] and regent of [[Principality of Albania|Albania]] in 1924 during the [[June Revolution]].

Fan Noli is venerated in [[Albania]] as a champion of literature, history, theology, diplomacy, journalism, music and national unity. He played an important role in the consolidation of [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as the national [[Albanian language|language]] of [[Albania]] with numerous translations of world literature masterpieces.&lt;ref name="Spahiu-Mjeku"&gt;{{harvnb|Spahiu|Mjeku|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote extensively in English: as a scholar and author of a series of publications on [[Skanderbeg]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], religious texts and translations.&lt;ref name="Spahiu-Mjeku"/&gt; He produced a translation of the [[New Testament]] in English, ''The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ from the approved Greek text of the Church of Constantinople and the Church of Greece'', published in 1961.

Noli earned degrees at [[Harvard]] &lt;ref name="Thernstrom"/&gt; (1912), the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] (1938), and finally his Ph.D. from [[Boston University]] (1945).&lt;ref&gt;p. 175. William Paul. 2003. ''English Language Bible Translators''. Jefferson, NC &amp; London: McFarland and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi162"/&gt; He was ordained a priest in 1908, establishing thereby the Albanian Church and elevating the Albanian language to ecclesiastic use. He briefly resided in Albania after the 1912 declaration of independence. After World War I, Noli led the diplomatic efforts for the reunification of Albania and received the support of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Later he pursued a diplomatic-political career in Albania, successfully leading the Albanian bid for membership in the [[League of Nations]].

A respected figure who remained critical of corruption and injustice in the Albanian government, Fan Noli was asked to lead the 1924 June Revolution. He then served as prime minister until his revolutionary government was overthrown by [[Ahmet Zogu]]. He was exiled to Italy and permanently settled in the [[United States]] in the 1930s, acquiring US citizenship and agreeing to end his political involvement. He spent the rest of his life as an academician, religious leader and writer.

==Background==

[[File:FAN NOLI.jpg|thumb|170px|A young Fan Noli as priest (1908).]]

Fan Noli was born in 1882 in the Albanian village of [[Ibrik Tepe]] ({{lang-sq|Qytezë}}), [[Eastern Thrace]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]) as Theofanes Stylianos Mavromatis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|1994|p=465: "Born Theophanus Stylianos Mavromatis in Imbrik-Tepe, a predominantly Albanian settlement in Thrace, then part of the Ottoman Empire, Fan Stylian Noli was educated in the Greek Gymnasium of Edirne (Adrianople)."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stavrou|1996|loc=p. 40: "Fan Noli was born Theofanis Stylianou Mavromates in the village of Ibrik-Tepe of Adrianoupolis (today in Turkish Thrace) in 1882."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Central European Observer|1943|loc=p. 63: "But Theophanus Mavromatis, which was Fan Noli's original name, came in 1900, after assisting in an ironmonger's shop, to Adrianople, where the good teachers gave him an education."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baerlein|1968|loc=p. 76: "...&amp;nbsp;year 1900 his name was Theophanus Mavromatis, which is Greek."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Free Europe|1941|loc=p. 278: "The one personage as to whom Mr. Robinson seems to be misinformed is Bishop Fan Noli, who has for many years lived in the United States and whom Mr. Robinson probably did not meet&amp;nbsp;...

The facts are that he was born near Adrianople and that his original name was Theophanos Mavromatis, which does not necessarily imply that he was Greek."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irénikon|1963|loc=p. 266: "Il était connu alors sous le nom de Théophanis Mavromatis."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ekdotiki|2000|loc=p. 538: "158 Stylianou Theophanes Noli or Mavrommatis."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Giakoumēs|Vlassas|Hardy|1996|loc=p. 184 "His full name was Theophanis Stylianos Mavrommatis, and he was born in Adrianople and studied in Athens and the USA.&amp;nbsp;...

===Hudson Incident===
{{further information|Hudson Incident}}

In Boston, some Albanian [[Christian]]s were part of the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]], which was vehemently opposed to the Albanian nationalist cause. When a Greek Orthodox priest refused to perform the burial rites for Kristaq Dishnica, a member of the Orthodox Albanian community from [[Hudson, Massachusetts]] because of his nationalist activities, Noli and a group of Albanian nationalists in [[New England]] created the independent Albanian Orthodox Church.&lt;ref name="Biernat1415"&gt;{{harvnb|Biernat|2014|pp=14–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi162"/&gt; Noli, the new church's first clergyman, was [[ordained]] as a [[priest]] in 1908 by Archbishop [[Platon (Rozhdestvensky)]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Church]] in the United States under questionable circumstances.&lt;ref name="Austin34"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi162"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vickers61"&gt;{{harvnb|Vickers|2011|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the creation of an independent church and Noli translating liturgy into Albanian, he hoped to diminish Greek influence in the church and counter Greek irredentism.&lt;ref name="Austin4"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=4}}. "Noli... Hoping to eliminate Greek influence within the Albanian Orthodox Church, he focused his early activities on translating the church liturgy into Albanian and establishing an independent Albanian Orthodox Church. The latter he considered as vital to Albania's evolution into a unified nation and as a major blow to the supporters of the Greek 'Great Idea'."&lt;/ref&gt; Noli was a supporter of Albanian unity transcending Muslim and Christian religions and considered it important for those faiths to be practiced in Albanian and staffed by local Albanian clergy and not foreigners.&lt;ref name="Skendi179180"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=179-180.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and Religious activities==
{{Main article|June Revolution}}

In 1908, Noli began studying at Harvard, completing his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1912.&lt;ref name="Austin4a"/&gt; During April 1912 [[Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America|Vatra]] (Hearth) an [[Albanian Americans|Albanian American]] diaspora organisation was founded with Noli and [[Faik Konica]] serving as its leaders and advocating for Albanian sociopolitical self determination with the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Skendi453"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=453.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Europe to promote Albanian independence, setting foot in Albania for the first time in 1913.&lt;ref name="Austin4a"/&gt; Noli returned to the United States during World War I, serving as head of the Vatra organization, which effectively made him leader of the Albanian diaspora.&lt;ref name="Austin4a"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His diplomatic efforts in the United States and [[Geneva]] won the support of President Woodrow Wilson for an independent Albania and, in 1920, earned the new nation membership in the fledgling League of Nations.&lt;ref name="Austin1820"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=18, 20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Albania had already declared its independence in 1912, membership in the League of Nations provided the country with the international recognition it had failed to obtain until then.&lt;ref name="Austin45"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Noli entered the Albanian parliament as a representative of the liberal pro-British "People's Party" ({{lang-sq|Partia e Popullit}}), the chief liberal movement in the country.&lt;ref name="Austin32"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The other parties were the conservative pro-Italian "Progressive Party" ({{lang-sq|Partia Përparimtare}}) founded by [[Mehdi Frashëri]] and  led by Ahmet Zogu, and "Popular Party" ({{lang-sq|Partia Popullore}}) of [[Xhafer Ypi]]. The conservatives of Zogu would dominate the political scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brisku|2013|loc=p. 75: "Two political groupings: the pro British People's Party, headed by the colourful leader, Fan Noli, and the pro—Italian Progressive Party, led by Mehdi Frashéri, came to dominate the political scene."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bogdani|Loughlin|2009|loc=p. 122: "The first Albanian political parties, in the western meaning of the word, appeared in the early 1920s, the most prominent being: the Progressive Party led by Ahmet Zogu, the People's Party led by Fan Noli, and the Popular Party led by Xhafer Ypi."}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Orthodox Congress, Albania|Congress of Berat]] in 1922 was convened to formally lay the foundations of an Albanian Orthodox Church which [[consecrated]] Fan Noli as [[Bishop]] of Korçë and primate of all Albania while the establishment of the church was seen as important for maintaining Albanian national unity.&lt;ref name="Biernat1415"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Austin3195"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=31, 95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noli served briefly as foreign minister in the government of [[Xhafer Ypi]].&lt;ref name="Austin29"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a period of intense turmoil in the country between the liberals and the conservatives.&lt;ref name="Austin30"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After a botched assassination attempt against Zogu, the conservatives revenged themselves by assassinating another popular liberal politician, [[Avni Rustemi]].&lt;ref name="Austin39404546"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=39–40, 45–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Noli's speech at Rustemi's funeral was so powerful that liberal supporters rose up against Zogu and forced him to flee to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (March 1924).&lt;ref name="Austin464751159"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=46–47, 51, 159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zogu was succeeded briefly by his father-in-law, [[Shefqet Vërlaci]], and by the liberal politician [[Iliaz Vrioni]]; Noli was named prime minister and regent on July 17, 1924.&lt;ref name="Austin40"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downfall and exile==

[[File:Fan Noli 1939.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bishop Fan Noli, founder of the [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania]] (1939).]]
Despite his efforts to reform the country, Noli's "Twenty Point Program" was unpopular, and his government was overthrown by groups loyal to Zogu on [[Christmas Eve]] of that year.&lt;ref name="Austin59748082146150"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=59–74, 80–82, 146–150}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   Two weeks later, Zogu returned to Albania, and Noli fled to Italy under sentence of death.&lt;ref name="Austin152155"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=152–155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscious of his fragile position, Zogu took drastic measures to consolidate his reassert in power. By the end of winter, two of the main leaders of the opposition, [[Bajram Curri]] and [[Luigj Gurakuqi]], were assassinated, while others were imprisoned. Noli founded the "National Revolutionary Committee" ({{lang-sq|Komiteti Nacional Revolucionar}}) also known as [[KONARE]] in [[Vienna]]. The committee published the periodical called "National Freedom" ({{lang-sq|Liria Kombëtare}}). Some of the early Albanian communists as [[Halim Xhelo]] or [[Riza Cerova]] would start their publishing activities here. The committee aimed in overthrowing Zogu and his cast and restoring democracy. Despite the efforts, the committee's access and influence in Albania would be limited. With the intervention of [[Kostandin Boshnjaku|Kosta Boshnjaku]], an old communist and KONARE member, the organization would receive unconditioned monetary support from the [[Comintern]]. Also Noli and Boshnjaku would make possible for exile members of the [[Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo]] (outlawed by Zogu) to get the same financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vllamasi|Verli|2000|loc="Një pjesë me rëndësi e emigrantëve, me inisiativën dhe ndërmjetësinë e Koço Boshnjakut, u muarrën vesh me "Cominternin", si grup, me emër "KONARE" (Komiteti Revolucionar Kombëtar), për t'u ndihmuar pa kusht gjatë aktivitetit të tyre nacional, ashtu siç janë ndihmuar edhe kombet e tjerë të vegjël, që ndodheshin nën zgjedhë të imperialistëve, për liri e për pavarësi. Përveç kësaj pjese, edhe emigrantët kosovarë irredentistë, të grupuar e të organizuar nën emrin "Komiteti i Kosovës", si grup, u ndihmuan edhe ata nga "Cominterni"."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1928, KONARE changed its name to "Committee of National Liberation" ({{lang-sq|Komiteti i Çlirimit Kombëtar}}). Meanwhile, in Albania, after three years of republican regime, the "National Council" declared Albania a [[Constitutional Monarchy]], and Ahmet Zogu became king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ersoy|Górny|Kechriotis|2010|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Noli moved back to the United States in 1932 and formed a republican opposition to Zogu, who had since proclaimed himself "King Zog I". Over the next years, he continued his education, studying and later teaching [[Byzantine music]], and continued developing and promoting the [[autocephalous]] Albanian Orthodox Church he had helped to found. While in exile, he briefly allied with King Zog, who fled Albania before the invading Italians in 1939, but was unable to set a firm anti-Axis, anti-Communist front.

After the war, Noli established some ties with the communist government of [[Enver Hoxha]], which seized power in 1944. He unsuccessfully urged the U.S. government to recognize the regime, but Hoxha's increasing persecution of all religions prevented Noli's church from maintaining ties with the Orthodox hierarchy in Albania. Despite the Hoxha regime's [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] bent, Noli's ardent Albanian nationalism brought the bishop to the attention of the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. The FBI's Boston office kept the bishop under investigation for more than a decade with no final outcome to the probe.

In 1945, Fan S. Noli received a doctor's degree (Ph. D) in history from [[Boston University]],&lt;ref name="Skendi162"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; writing a dissertation on [[Skanderbeg]].&lt;ref name="Austin155"&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/georgecastriotis00noli|title=George Castrioti Scanderbeg (1405-1468)|first=Fan Stylian|last=Noli|date=21 February 2018|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, he also conducted research at Boston University Music Department, publishing a biography on [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. He also composed a one-movement symphony called ''Scanderbeg'' in 1947. Toward the end of his life, Noli retired to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], where he died in 1965. The branch of the Albanian Orthodox Church that he had governed eventually became the [[Orthodox Church in America Albanian Archdiocese|Albanian Archdiocese]] of the [[Orthodox Church in America]].

[[File:AlbaniaP62-100Leke-1996-dab f.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[100 Lekë (Banknote)|100 Lekë]].]]
Writing in his diary two days after Noli's death, Albanian leader Enver Hoxha gave his analysis of Noli's work:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoxha|first=Enver|title=Ditar: 1965|url=http://enver-hoxha.net/content/content_shqip/librat/ditari_politik/ditar_7.htm|location=Tirana|publisher=8 Nëntori Publishing House|year=1989|pages=172–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=As we are informed, Fan S. Noli died from an operation done last week in which, because of his age, he did not survive. A cerebral hemorrhage caused a quick death. Noli was one of the prominent political and literary figures of the beginning of this century. The balance sheet of his life was positive&amp;nbsp;... Fan Noli today enjoys a great popularity in our country, deserved as a literary translator and music critic. He was a prominent promoter of the Albanian language. His original works and translations, especially of [[Shakespeare]], of [[Omar Khayyám]] and [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez|Blasco Ibáñez]], are immortal. But especially his anti-Zogist, anti-feudal elegies and poems are beautiful jewels that have inspired and will inspire our youth, especially in creativity. He was also respected as a realistic politician, as a revolutionary democrat in ideology and politics. [[Party of Labour of Albania|The Party]] has assessed the figure of Noli. As is deserved, we have had a patriotic duty to point out the really great merits of his in literature, the history of the arts, and his merits and weaknesses in politics. I think we will do our best in bringing his body to Albania, as this distinguished son of the people, the revolutionary patriot, deserves to bask in his homeland, which he loved and fought for his entire life.|sign=Enver Hoxha}}

Fan S. Noli is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Albanian 100 [[Albanian lek|lekë]] banknote issued in 1996 though the banknote itself has ceased being legal tender since December 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bank of Albania|title=Banknotes Withdrawn from Circulation|year=2004–2012|publisher=Bank of Albania|url=http://www.bankofalbania.org/web/Banknotes_withdrawn_from_circulation_5264_2.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the U.S. Mint maintains that there is no widely accepted and standardized numismatic industry definition of "first strike" coins, '''First Strike coins''' definitely exist in the coin industry.  Still, they are recent developments, having been first promoted in 2005.  The most frequently promoted First Strike coins are [[American Gold Eagle]] coins, [[American Silver Eagle]] coins, [[American Platinum Eagle]] coins, and the new American Gold Buffalo coins.

One often seen definition of First Strike coins calls them "the first coins struck from a new set of dies."  Another calls them "near-perfect specimens produced within the first few hundred strikings in an edition."  The U.S. Mint's production and distribution practices challenge both definitions.

The [[U.S. Mint]] does not track the order in which it mints coins during their production and does not segregate or specifically identify the first coins minted from a set of dies.  The Mint produces up to fifty percent of the projected sales of new coins weeks prior to their release.

Further, the Mint does not necessarily ship coins in the order in which they were minted, thereby making it impossible for promoters of First Strike coins to know that the coins being promoted as First Strike are actually the "first coins struck from a new set of dies."  The numbering on the boxes of coins shipped from the Mint are for accounting and inventory purposes only and do not reflect the order in which the coins were minted.

'''No U.S. Mint First Strike Program'''

The U.S. Mint has no First Strike program for the minting and distribution of its coins.  However, the Mint sometimes does "first strikings" of new coins, but the "first strikings" are ceremonial and usually consist of only two coins, which are not set aside but are put into the regular inventory of the new coins.  It is probably from these ceremonial strikings that promoters came up the idea of First Strike coins.

'''PCGS and NGC First Strike Coins'''

The premier coin grading services that grade First Strike coins are [[Professional Coin Grading Service]] (PCGS) and NGC ([[Numismatic Guaranty Corporation]]).  These two firms' positions on First Strike coins more clearly explain what First Strike coins really are.

The PCGS website does not discuss First Strike coins, but does post the U.S. Mint's position. However, the NGC website designates as First Strike those coins that were shipped from the U.S. Mint within the first month of their official release.  PCGS says that for coins to be labeled First Strike, they must be received within thirty days of commencement of shipping (or have documentation that "proves" that the coins were shipped during the first thirty days of a coin's production.)

NGC does not assert that the coins eligible to be labeled First Strike are among the first coins struck but are coins shipped within the first month of release.  Further, NGC includes in the First Strike category "coins of early or first release. A general term for these coins is first strikes."
 
In reality, the NGC position on First Strike coins offers the best definition: coins of early or first release.  While First Strike coins may be from the first strikings of a new set of dies, in reality there is no way for graders or promoters of First Strike coins to know that the coins they are promoting were from the first strikes of new dies.

'''First Strike Not Trademarked'''

Some websites maintain that PCGS trademarked First Strike. However, a search of the U.S. Patent Office's website does not evidence that, and a search of the PGCS website did not find any claim of having trademarked First Strike.  NGC asserts there is no trademark for First Strike and that it is a generic term in the coin industry.

'''Hans Beck''' (born 22 April 1969 in [[Werneck]]) is a German-Canadian scholar in the field of [[Classical Studies]].

Hans Beck received his PhD in Ancient History from [[Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg]] in 1996 with a thesis on ''Polis und Koinon. Untersuchungen zur Geschichte und Struktur der griechischen Bundesstaaten im 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr.'' In 1997 he was hired to the position of Assistant Professor at [[University of Cologne|Cologne University]]. In 2001-02 he was Junior Fellow in residence at the [[Center for Hellenic Studies]] in Washington DC. Finishing his Habilitation in Cologne in 2003 with a work entitled ''Karriere und Hierarchie. Die römische Aristokratie und die Anfänge des cursus honorum in der mittleren Republik'', he moved on to [[Frankfurt University]] in 2004, where he held a [http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/heisenberg/ Heisenberg Fellowship], awarded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. In 2005 he was hired to the position of Professor of Ancient Greek History and John MacNaughon Chair of Classics at [[McGill University]], which is his current employment. From 2007 to 2016 he was the Director of Classical Studies at McGill.

Beck specializes in the history and culture of the ancient Greek world, with a thematic focus on federalism, polis governance, and notions of the local. His research also extends to the study of the political culture of ancient Rome, the exercise of aristocratic rule in antiquity, and ancient historigraphy. He contributed many entries to [[Brill’s New Pauly]] and [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/browse/brill-s-new-jacoby Brill’s New Jacoby], for which he has also served on the editorial board.

[[File:Harri Moora 1930.jpg|thumb|Harri Moora in 1930]]
'''Harri Moora'''  ({{OldStyleDate|2 March|1900|18 February}} in [[Ehavere]], Kuremaa Parish – 2 May 1968 in [[Tallinn]]) was an [[Estonia]]n [[archaeologist]]. He was a recipient of the national [[Cross of Liberty (Estonia)|Cross of Liberty]].

In 1925, he graduated from the [[University of Tartu]]. Between 1930–1942, he was a museum director. In 1931, he studied at Baltic Institute in Stockholm and developed a scholarly working relationship with Finnish archaeologist [[Ella Kivikoski]], who was one of his main contacts with Scandinavian archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Baltic Institute"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salminen|first1=Timo|title=Harri Moora, Ella Kivikoski and Scandinavia|journal=Fornvännen|date=2012|volume=107|pages=96–111|url=http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/3300/2012_096.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2015|location=Stockholm, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked at Tartu University during [[World War II]] but was arrested in 1944; he resumed his post at the university after the war. He worked at the Institute of History and Archaeology as the department head until his death.

From 1936 to 1950 he was Chairman of the Estonian Learned Society and a member of the International Union of the History of Science.

He was married to Aliise Moora, an ethnologist, and they had six children, two of whom became well known academics. Tanel Moora became an archaeologist and Ann Marksoo a geographer. Harri Moora's grandsons are politician [[Jürgen Ligi]] and archeologist Priit Ligi.

After Moora's death, two other Estonian archaeologists, Lembit Jaanits and Jüri Selirand co-authored a book in his memory, ''Studia archaeologica in memoriam Harri Moora'', published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL17886905M/Studia_archaeologica_in_memoriam_Harri_Moora Open Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4628">[[Image:Preprom.jpg|thumb|Prom dresses, with hemlines varying from above-the-ankle (tea length) to floor length]]
The '''hemline''' is the line formed by the lower [[Hem|edge]] of a [[clothing|garment]], such as a  [[skirt]], [[dress]] or [[Coat (clothing)|coat]], measured from the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3427500297/hemlines.html|title=Hemlines - Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hemline is perhaps the most variable [[style line]] in [[fashion]], changing [[shape]] and ranging in height from [[hip]]-high to floor-length.  What is a fashionable style and height of hemline has varied considerably throughout the years, and has also depended on a number of factors such as the age of the wearer, the occasion for which the garment is worn and the choice of the individual.

==Types==
[[File:1817-accidents-in-quadrille-dancing.jpg|thumb|1817 caricature with ruffled hemlines (the dresses are shown as shorter than they would have been in real life).]]
Similar to [[neckline]]s and [[waistline (clothing)|waistline]]s, hemlines can be grouped by their height and shape:
* floor-length hemlines
* ankle hemlines
* midcalf hemlines
* below-knee hemlines
* above-knee hemlines
* mid-thigh hemlines
* hip-high hemlines
* handkerchief hemlines
* diagonal or asymmetric hemlines
* high-low hemlines, usually short in front and dipping behind
* other hemlines, such as modern-cut hemlines
Dresses and skirts are also classified in terms of their length: 
* [[Miniskirt|mini]]
* [[Ballet tutu|ballerina length]]
* midi
* tea length
* [[full length]]
* [[Maxiskirt|maxi]]
* [[Intermission length]]

==History==
[[Image:Hemline (skirt height) overview chart 1805-2005.svg|thumb|Overview chart of changes in hemline height (skirt length), 1805-2005]]
In the [[history of Western fashion]], the ordinary public clothes of upper- and middle-class women varied only between floor-length and slightly above ankle-length for many centuries before World War I.  Skirts of lower-calf or mid-calf length were associated with the practical working garments of lower-class or pioneer women, while even shorter skirt lengths were seen only in certain specialized and restricted contexts (e.g. sea-bathing costumes, or outfits worn by ballerinas on stage).  It was not until the mid-1910s that hemlines began to rise significantly (with many variations in height thereafter). Skirts rose all the way from floor-length to near knee-length in little more than fifteen years (from late in the decade of the 1900s to the mid-1920s). Between 1919 and 1923 they changed considerably, being almost to the floor in 1919, rising to the mid-calf in 1920, before dropping back to the ankles by 1923.&lt;ref name="tuscaloosa"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19540401&amp;id=ey0eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N5gEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4871,3624456 "Hemline Changes Mild Now," ''Tuscaloosa'' (Ala.) ''News'', 1 April 1954], accessed 1 March 2014. United Press syndicated article, summarizing the rise and fall of hemlines from 1900 to 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; 1927 saw "[[flapper]] length" skirts at the kneecap and higher, before shifting down again in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="tuscaloosa"/&gt;

From World War I to roughly 1970, women were under social pressure to wear skirts near to the currently fashionable length or be considered unstylish, but since the 1970s, women's options have widened, and there is no longer really only one single fashionable skirt-length at a time.

Another influence on the length of a woman's skirt is the [[Hemline index]], which, oversimplified, states that hemlines rise and fall in sync with the stock market. The term was brought up by Wharton Business School Professor [[George W. Taylor (professor)|
George Taylor]] in 1926 at a time when hemlines rose with flapper dresses during the so-called Roaring '20s. The Great Depression subsequently set in and hemlines fell to the floor once again.

This article details the history and status of '''Heritage conservation in [[Hong Kong]]''', as well as the role of various stakeholders.

An indication of the size of the built heritage in Hong Kong is given by a territory-wide survey conducted by the [[Antiquities and Monuments Office]] (AMO) between 1996 and 2000, which recorded some 8,800 buildings. The preservation of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] is also an emerging theme.

==Historic buildings==
[[File:HK CausewayBayTinHauTemple.JPG|thumb|The [[Tin Hau temples in Hong Kong|Tin Hau Temple]] in Causeway Bay is a declared monument since 1982.]]
As of 20 May 2016, there were 114 [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared monuments]] in Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Monument/form/DM_Mon_List_e.pdf List of declared monuments on LCSD website]&lt;/ref&gt; and as of February 2013, there were 917 graded historic buildings (153 Grade I, 322 Grade II, 442 Grade III), of which 203 were owned by the Government and 714 by private bodies.&lt;ref name="Audit60"&gt;Report No. 60 of the Director of Audit, [http://www.aud.gov.hk/pdf_e/e60ch01.pdf Chapter 1: "Conservation of monuments and historic buildings"], 28 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grading system===
Grades for historic buildings are defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-eng.pdf Results of the Assessment of 1,444 Historic Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade I]]: "Buildings of outstanding merit, which every effort should be made to preserve if possible."
* [[List of Grade II historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade II]]: "Buildings of special merit; efforts should be made to selectively preserve."
* [[List of Grade III historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade III]]: "Buildings of some merit; preservation in some form would be desirable and alternative means could be considered if preservation is not practicable."

===Surveys and assessment===
[[File:King Yin Lei SingChiu.jpg|thumb|[[King Yin Lei]] was declared a monument in 2008 after media had reported that its owner had begun demolishing the building.]]
A territory-wide survey on historic buildings conducted by the Antiquities and Monuments Office (AMO) between 1996 and 2000 recorded some 8,800 buildings. A more detailed survey conducted between 2002-2004 focused on 1,444 buildings.&lt;ref name="Completion"&gt;[http://www.devb-wb.gov.hk/press_releases_and_publications/UMPR/index.aspx?langno=1&amp;nodeid=1779&amp;Branch=W&amp;lstYear=2009&amp;PressReleaseID=11946 Press Release: "Completion of the assessment of 1,444 historic buildings announced". March 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005,&lt;ref name="Completion" /&gt; a seven-member Expert Panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-A.pdf Composition of the Expert Panel for the Assessment of 1,444 Historic Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt; comprising historians and members of the [[Hong Kong Institute of Architects]], [[Hong Kong Institute of Planners]] and [[Hong Kong Institute of Engineers]] was formed by the Antiquities Advisory Board (AAB) to assess the heritage value of these buildings. The assessment was completed on March 19, 2009. As part of this work, the AMO proposed changes in the grading of historic buildings: 212 buildings to be Grade I, 366 to be Grade II, and 576 to be Grade III, and no grading for the remaining 290 ones.&lt;ref name="Completion" /&gt; Current grades may be increased, decreased or removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-E.pdf List of the Historic Buildings in Building Assessment (as of 18 March 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation initiatives==
[[File:1881 Heritage 200905.jpg|thumb|Adaptive reuse: the [[Former Marine Police Headquarters Compound]], a declared monument, is being transformed into a heritage hotel with food and beverage outlets, and retail facilities.]]
Conservation initiatives include:
* Heritage Impact Assessment Mechanism for Capital Works Projects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB137-6-A-chi.pdf Heritage Impact Assessment Mechanism for Capital Works Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Building restoration|Restoration]]
* [[Adaptive reuse]]
* Relocation: complete ([[Murray House]]) or partial ([[Blake Pier at Stanley]])

==Issues==

===Demolitions===
[[File:QP Hungerstrike.jpg|thumb|Public protest against the demolition of [[Queen's Pier]]: hunger strikers occupied the location in July 2007.]]
The demolition of several historic buildings has led to public protest in recent years. This included the [[Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier]] (demolition completed in early 2007) and [[Queen's Pier]], demolished in February 2008.

===Other issues===
Other issues include:
* Ownership of historic buildings and private owners' rights
* Funding of Heritage conservation programs

==Intangible cultural heritage==
The preservation of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] is an emerging theme in Hong Kong, with The Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee having held its first meeting on July 9, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/ppr_release_det2.php?id=190 Press release: "Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee holds first meeting".

'''Abu l-Hassan ibn al-Khabbaza''' (died 1239) was a [[Qadi|kadi]], historian and poet active during the reign of the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Sultan [[Idris al-Ma'mun|Abu al-Ala Idris al-Mamun]] (r. 1227–32)  in [[Seville]], [[al-Andalus]] and [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]]. When the last sultan of this dynasty left Iberia in 1228, Al-Khabazza joined him. Al-Khabazza was also the author of poems and a bio-bibliographic work.

==Poetry==
A few lines from his poem entitled "The King Who Died Young":&lt;ref&gt;English translation from A.J. Arberry, ''Moorish Poetry: A translation of The Pennants, an Anthology compiled in 1243 by the Andalusian Ibn Said '' (London: Cambridge University Press, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

Your life was of the order true

Of Arab eloquence:

The tale was brief, the words were few;

The meaning was immense.

His books use [[comparative mythology]] and ancient literary sources (including the [[Old Testament]]) to argue that Earth suffered [[Catastrophism|catastrophic]] close contacts with other planets (principally [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]) in ancient times.

He also proposed a revised chronology for [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Land of Israel|Israel]] and other cultures of the ancient [[Near East]].  The revised chronology aimed at explaining the so-called "[[Greek Dark Ages|dark age]]" of the eastern [[Mediterranean]] (c. 1100–750 BC) and reconciling biblical history with mainstream archaeology and [[Egyptian chronology]].

In general, Velikovsky's theories have been ignored or vigorously rejected by the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Palmer, ''[http://www.cambridge.org/asia/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521819282 Perilous Planet Earth: Catastrophes and Catastrophism through the Ages]'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-81928-8}}. pp. 116–119.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, his books often sold well and gained an enthusiastic support in lay circles, often fuelled by claims of unfair treatment for Velikovsky by orthodox academia.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, David (2001).

==Childhood and early education==
Immanuel Velikovsky was born in 1895 to a prosperous [[Jewish]] family in [[Vitebsk]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (now in [[Belarus]]).  The son of Shimon (Simon Yehiel) Velikovsky (1859–1937) and Beila Grodensky, he learned several languages as a child and was sent away to study at the Medvednikov [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Moscow]], where he performed well in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[mathematics]].  He graduated with a gold medal in 1913.  Velikovsky then traveled in [[Europe]] and visited Palestine before briefly studying medicine at [[Montpellier]] in [[France]] and taking premedical courses at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He returned to Russia before the outbreak of [[World War I]], enrolled in the [[University of Moscow]], and received a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] in 1921.

==Hebrew University of Jerusalem==
Upon taking his medical degree, Velikovsky left Russia for [[Berlin]]. With the financial support of his father, Velikovsky edited and published two volumes of scientific papers translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The volumes were titled ''Scripta Universitatis Atque Bibliothecae Hierosolymitanarum'' ("Writings of the Jerusalem University &amp; Library"). He enlisted [[Albert Einstein]] to prepare the volume dealing with mathematics and physics. This project was a cornerstone in the formation of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], as the fledgling university was able to donate copies of the ''Scripta'' to the libraries of other academic institutions in exchange for complimentary copies of publications from those institutions.

In 1923, Velikovsky married Elisheva Kramer, a young [[violin]]ist.

==Career as a psychiatrist==
Velikovsky lived in what was then the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] from 1924 to 1939, practising medicine in the fields of [[general practice]], [[psychiatry]] and [[psychoanalysis]] which he had studied under [[Sigmund Freud]]'s pupil [[Wilhelm Stekel]] in [[Vienna]]. During this time, he had about a dozen papers published in medical and psychoanalytic journals. He was also published in Freud's ''[[Imago (periodical)|Imago]]'', including a precocious analysis of Freud's own dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky, I. "The Dreams Freud Dreamed" ''Psychoanalytic Review'' Vol. 28 pp. 487–511 (October, 1941), [http://www.varchive.org/tpp/dreams.htm Varchive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emigration to the US and a career as an author==
In 1939, with the prospect of war looming, Velikovsky travelled with his family to [[New York City]], intending to spend a [[sabbatical]] year researching for his book ''Oedipus and Akhenaton.'' The book was inspired by Freud's ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'' and explored the possibility that [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaton]] was the legendary [[Oedipus]]. Freud had argued that Akhenaton, the supposedly monotheistic Egyptian pharaoh, was the source of the religious principles that Moses taught to the people of Israel in the desert. Freud's claim (and that of others before him) was based in part on the resemblance of Psalm 104 in the Bible to an Egyptian hymn discovered on the wall of the Tomb of Akhenaton's general, Ai, in Akhenaton's city of [[Amarna|Akhetaten]]. To disprove Freud's claim and to prove the Exodus as such, Velikovsky sought evidence for the Exodus in Egyptian documents. One such document was the [[Ipuwer Papyrus]], which he felt reported events similar to several of the Biblical plagues. Since conventional Egyptology dated the Ipuwer Papyrus much earlier than either the Biblical date for the Exodus (ca. 1500—1450 BCE) or the Exodus date accepted by many of those who accepted the conventional chronology of Egypt (ca. 1250 BCE), Velikovsky had to revise the conventional chronology.

[[File:Dr.Emmanuel Velikovsky 1947 passport.jpg|thumb|Dr.Immanuel Velikovsky 1947 passport photo.]]
Within weeks of his arrival in the United States, [[World War II]] began. Launching on a tangent from his original book project, Velikovsky began to develop the radical [[Catastrophism|catastrophist]] [[cosmology]] and revised chronology theories for which he would become notorious. For the remainder of the Second World War, now as a permanent resident of [[New York City]], he continued to research and write about his ideas, searching for a means to disseminate them to academia and the public. He privately published two small ''Scripta Academica'' pamphlets summarising his theories in 1945 (''Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History'' and ''Cosmos Without Gravitation''). He mailed copies of the latter to academic libraries and scientists, including Harvard astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] in 1947.

In 1950, after eight publishing houses rejected the ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'' manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky, Immanuel (1983). ''Stargazers and Gravediggers'', William Morrow &amp; Co. {{ISBN|0-688-01545-X}}. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; it was finally published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], which had a large presence in the academic textbook market. Even before its appearance, the book was enveloped by furious controversy, when ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' published a highly positive feature on it, as did ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', with what would today be called a [[creationist]] slant. This came to the attention of Shapley, who opposed the publication of the work, having been made familiar with Velikovsky's claims through the pamphlet Velikovsky had given him. Shapley threatened to organise a textbook boycott of Macmillan for its publication of ''Worlds in Collision'', and within two months the book was transferred to [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]. It was by then a bestseller in the United States. In 1952, Doubleday published the first installment in Velikovsky's revised chronology, ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'', followed by the ''Earth in Upheaval'' (a geological volume) in 1955.  In November 1952, Velikovsky moved from Manhattan to Princeton, New Jersey.

For most of the 1950s and early 1960s, Velikovsky was ''[[persona non grata]]'' on college and university campuses. After this period, he began to receive more requests to speak. He lectured, frequently to record crowds, at universities across [[North America]]. In 1972, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] aired a one-hour television special featuring Velikovsky and his work, and this was followed by a thirty-minute [[Documentary film|documentary]] by the [[BBC]] in 1973.

During the remainder of the 1970s, Velikovsky devoted a great deal of his time and energy to rebutting his critics in academia, and he continued to tour North America and Europe to deliver lectures on his ideas. By that time, the elderly Velikovsky suffered from [[diabetes]] and intermittent [[clinical depression|depression]], which his daughter said may have been exacerbated by the academic establishment's continuing rejection of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, Ruth Velikovsky: "Aba: The Glory and the Torment. The Life of Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky" McGraw Hill, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=September 2011}}  He died in 1979.

==Posthumous administration of literary estate==
For many years, Velikovsky's estate was controlled by his two daughters, Shulamit Velikovsky Kogan (b. 1925), and Ruth Ruhama Velikovsky Sharon (b. 1926),&lt;ref&gt;Duane Vorhees, "The Early Years: Part Two", ''[http://www.aeonjournal.com/ Aeon]'' III:1 (Nov 1992).

A volume of Velikovsky's discussions and correspondence with [[Albert Einstein]] appeared in Hebrew in Israel, translated and edited by his daughter Shulamit Velikovsky Kogan. In the late 1990s, a large portion of Velikovsky's unpublished book manuscripts, essays and correspondence became available at the Velikovsky Archive website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varchive.org/ Velikovsky Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Velikovsky's daughter Ruth Sharon presented his entire archive to Princeton University Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/html/mss/C0968/index.html Princeton University Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512035201/http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/html/mss/C0968/index.html |date=2006-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
Notwithstanding Velikovsky's dozen or so publications in medical and psychoanalytic journals in the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.varchive.org/tpp/index.htm Varchive.org] for a list&lt;/ref&gt; the work for which he became well known was developed by him during the early 1940s, whilst living in [[New York City]]. He summarised his core ideas in an affidavit in November 1942,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varchive.org/ce/affidavit.htm Velikovsky, Immanuel (1942). Affidavit, November 23].&lt;/ref&gt; and in two privately published ''Scripta Academica'' pamphlets entitled ''Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History'' (1945) and ''Cosmos without Gravitation'' (1946).&lt;ref&gt;Collected at [http://www.varchive.org/ce/index.htm Varchive.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than have his ideas dismissed wholesale because of potential flaws in any one area, Velikovsky then chose to publish them as a series of book volumes, aimed at a lay audience, dealing separately with his proposals on ancient history, and with areas more relevant to the physical sciences. Velikovsky was a passionate [[Zionist]],&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky penned a weekly political column under the moniker "Observer" in the ''New York Post''  November 25, 1947– June 23, 1949, [http://www.varchive.org/obs/index.htm Varchive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sieff, M "Velikovsky and his Heroes" ''[[Society for Interdisciplinary Studies#Chronology &amp; Catastrophism Review (C&amp;C Review)|Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Review]]'' Vol. V, issue 4 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; and this did steer the focus of his work, although its scope was considerably more far-reaching than this. The entire body of work could be said to stem from an attempt to solve the following problem: that to Velikovsky there appeared to be insufficient correlation in the written or archaeological records between Biblical history and what was known of the history of the area, in particular, Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Vorhees, Duane. (1990). The "Jewish Science" of Immanuel Velikovsky: Culture and Biography as Ideational Determinants. Dissertation, Bowling Green State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Velikovsky searched for common mention of events within literary records, and in the [[Ipuwer Papyrus]] he believed he had found a contemporary Egyptian account of the [[Plagues of Egypt]].  Moreover, he interpreted both accounts as descriptions of a great natural catastrophe. Velikovsky attempted to investigate the physical cause of these events, and extrapolated backwards and forwards in history from this point, cross-comparing written and mythical records from cultures on every inhabited continent, using them to attempt synchronisms of the historical records, yielding what he believed to be further periodic natural catastrophes that can be global in scale.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

He arrived at a body of radical inter-disciplinary ideas, which might be summarised as:{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* Planet Earth has suffered natural catastrophes on a global scale, both before and during humankind's recorded history.
* There is evidence for these catastrophes in the geological record (here Velikovsky was advocating [[catastrophism|Catastrophist]] ideas as opposed to the prevailing [[Uniformitarian]] notions) and archeological record. The extinction of many species had occurred catastrophically, not by gradual Darwinian means.
* The catastrophes that occurred within the memory of humankind are recorded in the myths, legends and written history of all ancient cultures and civilisations. Velikovsky pointed to alleged concordances in the accounts of many cultures, and proposed that they referred to the same real events. For instance, the memory of a flood is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, in the Greek legend of [[Deucalion]], and in the [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] legend of India. Velikovsky put forward the psychoanalytic idea of "Cultural Amnesia" as a mechanism whereby these literal records came to be regarded as mere myths and legends.
* The causes of these natural catastrophes were close encounters between the Earth and other bodies within the [[solar system]]&amp;nbsp;— not least what are now the planets Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, these bodies having moved upon different orbits within human memory.
* To explain the fact that these changes to the configuration of the solar system violate several well-understood laws of physics, Velikovsky invented a role for electromagnetic forces in counteracting [[gravity]] and [[orbital mechanics]].

Some of Velikovsky's specific postulated catastrophes included:{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* A tentative suggestion that Earth had once been a satellite of a "proto-[[Saturn]]" body, before its current solar orbit.
* That the [[Deluge (mythology)|Deluge]] (Noah's Flood) had been caused by proto-Saturn's entering a [[nova]] state, and ejecting much of its mass into space.
* A suggestion that the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] was involved in the [[Tower of Babel]] catastrophe.
* [[Jupiter]] had been the prime mover in the catastrophe that saw the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]].
* Periodic close contacts with a "[[comet]]ary [[Venus]]" (which had been ejected from Jupiter) had caused the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] events (c. 1500 BCE) and [[Joshua]]'s subsequent "sun standing still" (Joshua 10:12 and 13) incident.
* Periodic close contacts with [[Mars]] had caused havoc in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE.

As noted above, Velikovsky had conceived the broad sweep of this material by the early 1940s. However, within his lifetime, whilst he continued to research, expand and lecture upon the details of his ideas, he released only selected portions of his work to the public in book form:{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'' (1950) discussed the literary and mythical records of the "Venus" and "Mars" catastrophes
* Portions of his ''Revised Chronology'' were published as ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952), ''Peoples of the Sea'' (1977) and ''Rameses II and His Time'' (1978) (The related monograph ''Oedipus and Akhenaten'', 1960, posited the thesis that pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] was the prototype for the Greek mythic figure [[Oedipus]].)
* ''Earth in Upheaval'' (1955) dealt with geological evidence for global natural catastrophes.

Velikovsky's ideas on his earlier Saturn/Mercury/Jupiter events were never published, and the available archived manuscripts are much less developed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Of all the strands of his work, Velikovsky published least on his belief that electromagnetism plays a role in orbital mechanics. Although he appears to have retreated from the propositions in his 1946 monograph ''Cosmos without Gravitation'', no such retreat is apparent in ''Stargazers and Gravediggers''.&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky, Immanuel 1983. ''Stargazers and Gravediggers''. William Morrow and Co. {{ISBN|0-688-01545-X}}. Footnote, p. 165, indicates no retreat and states "Gravitation is an electromagnetic phenomenon."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cosmos without Gravitation'', which Velikovsky placed in university libraries and sent to scientists, is a probable catalyst for the hostile response of astronomers and physicists to his later claims about astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Henry H. 1984.

Scott have claimed that stars are powered not by internal nuclear fusion, but by galactic-scale electrical discharge currents. Such ideas do not find support in the conventional literature and are rejected as [[pseudoscience]] by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, C. Leroy]] 1985. sec.

Bridgman is an astrophysicist at NASA-Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revised chronology==
{{Main article|Ages in Chaos}}
Velikovsky argued that the conventional chronology of the Near East and classical world, based upon Egyptian [[Sothic dating]] and the king lists of [[Manetho]], was wholly flawed. This was the reason for the apparent absence of correlation between the Biblical account and those of neighbouring cultures, and also the cause of the enigmatic "[[Greek Dark Ages|Dark Ages]]" in [[Greece]] and elsewhere. Velikovsky shifted several chronologies and dynasties from the Egyptian Old Kingdom to Ptolemaic times by centuries (a scheme he called the ''Revised Chronology''), placing [[The Exodus]] contemporary with the fall of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. He proposed numerous other synchronisms stretching up to the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. He argued that these eliminate phantom "Dark Ages", and vindicate the [[Bible|biblical]] accounts of history and those recorded by [[Herodotus]].

These ideas were first put forward briefly in his ''Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History'', but ''Ages in Chaos'' was his first full-length work on the subject.  This was followed by ''Oedipus and Akhenaton'', ''Peoples of the Sea'' and ''Rameses II and His Time'', and two further works that were unpublished at the time of his death but that are now available online at the Velikovsky Archive: ''The Assyrian Conquest'' and ''The Dark Ages of Greece''.

Though rejected by mainstream historians, these ideas have been developed by other historians such as [[David Rohl]] and [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], who have also attempted their own revised chronologies.

==Reception==

===Velikovskyism===
[[Image:Leroy vel.jpg|thumb|256px|[[C. Leroy Ellenberger]] with Immanuel Velikovsky at Seaside Heights, New Jersey, in 1978.]]
Velikovsky inspired numerous followers during the 1960s and 1970s.
[[Alfred de Grazia]] dedicated a 1963 issue of his journal, ''American Behavioral Scientist'', to Velikovsky, which was published in an expanded version as a book, [http://www.grazian-archive.com/quantavolution/QUANTAVOL/va_docs/va_1.pdf ''The Velikovsky Affair — Scientism Versus Science,''] in 1966.
''[[The Skeptical Inquirer]]'', in a review of a later book by de Grazia, ''Cosmic Heretics'' (1984), suggests that de Grazia's efforts may be responsible for Velikovsky's continuing notability during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=skeptical&gt;{{Citation | last = Bauer| first = Henry H.| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Inside the Velikovsky Affair| journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]]| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 284–288| publisher = | location = | year = 1985| url = http://www.henryhbauer.homestead.com/DeGraziaReviewSI1985.pdf | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society for Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS) was "formed in 1974 in response to the growing interest in the works of modern catastrophists, notably the highly controversial Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky". The [[Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences]] (ISIS) is a 1985 spinoff from the SIS founded under the directorship of [[David Rohl]], who had come to reject Velikovsky's [[Revised Chronology]] in favour of his own "[[New Chronology (Rohl)|New Chronology]]".

''[[Kronos: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Synthesis]]'' was founded in 1975 explicitly "to deal with Velikovsky's work". Ten issues of ''[[Pensée: Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered]]'' appeared from 1972 to 1975.
The controversy surrounding Velikovsky peaked in the mid 1970s and public interest declined in the 1980s, and
by 1984, erstwhile Velikovskyist [[C. Leroy Ellenberger]] had become a vocal critic of Velikovskian catastrophism. Some Velikovskyist publications and authors such as David Talbott remain active into the 2000s.

===Criticism===
Velikovsky's ideas have been almost entirely rejected by mainstream academia (often vociferously so) and his work is generally regarded as erroneous in all its detailed conclusions. Moreover, scholars view his unorthodox methodology (for example, using comparative mythology to derive scenarios in celestial mechanics) as an unacceptable way to arrive at conclusions. [[Stephen Jay Gould]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]], [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/gould_velikovsky.html ''Velikovsky in Collision'']&lt;/ref&gt; offered a synopsis of the mainstream response to Velikovsky, writing, "Velikovsky is neither [[crank (person)|crank]] nor [[charlatan]]&amp;mdash;although, to state my opinion and to quote one of my colleagues, he is at least gloriously wrong&amp;nbsp;... Velikovsky would rebuild the science of celestial mechanics to save the literal accuracy of ancient legends."

Velikovsky's bestselling, and as a consequence most criticized, book is ''[[Worlds in Collision]]''. Astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]], along with others such as [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]], were highly critical of Macmillan's decision to publish the work. The fundamental criticism against this book from the astronomy community was that its celestial mechanics were physically impossible, requiring planetary orbits that do not conform with the laws of [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of angular momentum]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Velikovsky relates in his book ''Stargazers &amp; Gravediggers'' how he tried to protect himself from criticism of his celestial mechanics by removing the original appendix on the subject from ''Worlds in Collision'', hoping that the merit of his ideas would be evaluated on the basis of his comparative mythology and use of literary sources alone. However, this strategy did not protect him: the appendix was an expanded version of the ''Cosmos Without Gravitation'' monograph, which he had already distributed to Shapley and others in the late 1940s&amp;mdash;and they had regarded the physics within it as absurd.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

By 1974, the controversy surrounding Velikovsky's work had permeated US society to the point where the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] felt obliged to address the situation, as they had previously done in relation to [[unidentified flying objects|UFOs]], and devoted a scientific session to Velikovsky featuring (among others) Velikovsky himself and Professor [[Carl Sagan]]. Sagan gave a critique of Velikovsky's ideas (the book version of Sagan's critique is much longer than that presented in the talk; see [[#References|below]]). His criticisms are available in ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky''&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl (1977). An Analysis of ''Worlds in Collision'', in Goldsmith, Donald (editor) (1977). ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky''. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|0-8014-0961-6}}. pp. 41–104.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a corrected and revised version in the book ''[[Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Here is an example of the reworking of the text between 1977 and 1979: "My own position is that even if twenty percent of the legendary concordances which Velikovsky produces are real, there is something important to be explained&amp;nbsp;... Likewise, we should not be surprised if a few elements of a few legends are coincidentally identical. But I do not believe that all of the concordances which Velikovsky produces can be explained away in this manner" (1977, pp. 48–50), compared with "My own position is that if even 20 percent of the legendary concordances that Velikovsky produces are real, there is something important to be explained&amp;nbsp;... Likewise, we should not be surprised if a few elements of a few legends are coincidentally identical. But I believe that ''all'' of the concordances Velikovsky produces can be explained away in this manner" (1979, pp. 86–88).&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan's arguments were aimed at a popular audience and he did not remain to debate Velikovsky in person, facts that were used by Velikovsky's followers to attempt to discredit his analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Ginenthal, Charles (1995). Carl Sagan &amp; Immanuel Velikovsky. New Falcon Publications, Tempe Arizona&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan rebutted these charges and further attacked Velikovsky's ideas in his [[PBS]] television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'', though not without reprimanding scientists who had attempted to suppress Velikovsky's ideas.{{Original research inline|date=October 2018|reason=Is there a published source that frames the Cosmos presentation as an "attack" and a "reprimand"?}} 

It was not until the 1980s that a very detailed critique of ''Worlds in Collision'' was made in terms of its use of mythical and literary sources when Bob Forrest published a highly critical examination of them (see [[#References|below]]). Earlier in 1974, James Fitton published a brief critique of Velikovsky's interpretation of myth (ignored by Velikovsky and his defenders) whose indictment began: "In at least three important ways Velikovsky's use of mythology is unsound. The first of these is his proclivity to treat all myths as having independent value; the second is the tendency to treat only such material as is consistent with his thesis; and the third is his very unsystematic method."&lt;ref&gt;Fitton, James (1974). Velikovsky Mythistoricus. ''Chiron'', '''I''' (1&amp;2), 29–36; excerpts at [http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/vfitton.html UGA.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; A short analysis of the position of arguments in the late 20th century is given by Dr Velikovsky's ex-associate, and ''[[Kronos (journal)|Kronos]]'' editor, [[C. Leroy Ellenberger]], in his ''A Lesson from Velikovsky''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/vlesson.html ''A Lesson from Velikovsky'']&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the absence of supporting material in [[Ice core|ice-core studies]] (such as the Greenland Dye-3 and [[Vostok Station|Vostok cores]]) has removed any basis for the proposition of a global catastrophe of the proposed dimension within the later [[Holocene]] period. However, tree-ring expert [[Mike Baillie]] would give credit to Velikovsky after disallowing the impossible aspects of ''Worlds in Collision'': "However, I would not disagree with ''all'' aspects of Velikovsky's work. Velikovsky was almost certainly correct in his assertion that ancient texts hold clues to catastrophic events in the relatively recent past, within the span of human civilization, which involve the effects of comets, meteorites and cometary dust&amp;nbsp;... But fundamentally, Velikovsky did not understand anything about comets&amp;nbsp;... He did not know about the hazard posed by relatively small objects&amp;nbsp;... This failure to recognize the power of comets and asteroids means that it is reasonable to go back to Velikovsky and delete all the physically impossible text about Venus and Mars passing close to the earth&amp;nbsp;... In other words, we can get down to his main thesis, which is that the Earth experienced dramatic events from heavenly bodies particularly in the second millennium BC."&lt;ref&gt;Baillie, Mike (1999).

Velikovsky's revised chronology has been rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]]. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material for proof is often very selective.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, William]] 1952.

Retrieved 2016-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Velikovsky was never able to refute Sachs' attack.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, Leroy]] 1992. ''Aeon'' '''3''' (1), section "Bonanza from Brown" in "Of Lessons, Legacies, and Litmus Tests: A Velikovsky Potpourri (Part One)", pp. 88–90. "Velikovsky confronted a panel of four professors [at Brown University on March 15, 1965]: [[Leon Cooper|Leon N. Cooper]] (physics), Bruno J Giletti (geology), Charles Smiley (astronomy) and Abraham J. Sachs (history of mathematics) [who was substituting for [[Otto Neugebauer]] ], moderated by [[Henry Kučera]] (linguistics). In the event, Velikovsky debated the first three handily. He was stunned by Sachs whose address was both a rhetorical and substantive ''tour de force''. Velikovsky's rebuttal began: 'Dr. Sachs threw so many accusations in that [[Philippic]] of his that I am at a difficulty to answer; but I invite Dr. Sachs to spend the hour and a half tomorrow at the meeting [at Diman House], and every one of you too, and point by point each of his statements will be proven wrong.' Unfortunately, Sachs did not show up the next day and Velikovsky did not even mention Sachs [according to the tape recording of the proceedings in the possession of [http://www.velikovsky.info/Warner_B._Sizemore Warner B. Sizemore] who loaned it to Ellenberger March 31, 1979]. Curiously, Velikovsky's file for the Brown trip contains typed rebuttals to all the panelists ''except'' Sachs, for whom only partial, penciled notes exist—but later that year Velikovsky would reply to Kim J. Masters, a Princeton sophomore, within a week in ''The Daily Princetonian'' (Nov. 15, 1965) over a criticism of ''Oedipus and Akhnaton''. Velikovsky's rebuttal to Masters was scathing, running the gamut from haggling over details to ''ad hominems''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's ''Ages in Chaos'' series, the [[United Kingdom]]-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in [[Glasgow]] specifically to debate the revised chronology.&lt;ref&gt;"Ages in Chaos?'-Proceedings of the Residential Weekend Conference, Glasgow, 7th–9th April 1978" ''Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Review'' Vol. VI, issue 1/2/3 84pp (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and [[David Rohl]], was that the Revised Chronology was untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Bimson, "Finding the Limits of Chronological Revision" in "Proceedings of the SIS Conference: Ages Still in Chaos" ''Chronology &amp; Catastrophism Review'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The SIS has continued to publish updates of this ongoing discussion, in particular the work of historian Emmet Sweeney.&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://www.sis-group.org.uk/review.htm "Chronology and Catastrophism Review (C&amp;CR)" back issues] (Jan 1976–2015); [http://www.sis-group.org.uk/event/2002-09-13/ages-still-chaos.htm "Ages Still in Chaos"] (13–15 Sep 2002); [http://www.sis-group.org.uk/news/couple-sites-revised-chronology.htm "A couple of sites on a revised chronology"] (4 Sep 2010); found via an 'Emmet Sweeney' search at [http://www.sis-group.org.uk/  Society for Interdisciplinary Studies website]; this is just a sampling of Velikovsky (and Sweeney) links there. Retrieved 2016-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

While James credits Velikovsky with "point[ing] the way to a solution by challenging Egyptian chronology", he severely criticised the contents of Velikovsky's chronology as "disastrously extreme", producing "a rash of new problems far more severe than those it hoped to solve" and claiming that "Velikovsky understood little of archaeology and nothing of stratigraphy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter James (historian)|James, Peter]], [http://www.centuries.co.uk/preface.htm The Preface from] ''Centuries of Darkness''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauer accuses Velikovsky of dogmatically asserting interpretations which are at best possible, and gives several examples from ''Ages in Chaos''.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer ''Beyond Velikovsky'' pages 158–60&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The Velikovsky Affair"==
Such was the hostility directed against Velikovsky from some quarters (particularly the original campaign led by [[Harlow Shapley]]), that some commentators have made an analysis of the conflict itself. Among these was a study by ''[[American Behavioral Scientist]]'' magazine, eventually published in book form as ''The Velikovsky Affair — Scientism Versus Science.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grazian-archive.com/quantavolution/QUANTAVOL/va_docs/va_1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This framed the discussion in terms of how academic disciplines reacted to ideas from workers from outside their field, claiming that there was an academic aversion to permitting people to cross [[inter-disciplinary]] boundaries. More recently, James Gilbert, professor of history at University of Maryland, challenged this traditional version with an account that focused on the intellectual rivalry between Velikovsky's ally [[Horace Kallen]] and [[Harlow Shapley]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, James (1997). Redeeming Culture: American Religion in an Age of Science, University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-29320-3}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIEGBimKQSwC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;vq=velikovsky&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Chap. 8, Two Men of Science, pp. 170–97].&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, [[Henry Bauer]] had challenged the view that the Velikovsky Affair illustrated the resistance of scientists to new ideas by pointing out "the nature and validity of Velikovsky's claims must be considered before one decides that the Affair can illuminate the reception of new ideas in science&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the same basis, [[Keith Dixon]] contended that the treatment of the case by sociologists was an example of a broader unhealthy tendency in sociology to explain all opinions as ideologically motivated without considering their possible rational basis.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Keith (1980). ''The Sociology of Belief: Fallacy and Foundation''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London. pp. 73–76. {{ISBN|0-7100-0445-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific press, in general, denied Velikovsky a forum to rebut his critics. Velikovsky claimed that this made him a "suppressed genius", and he likened himself to the 16th Century heretical friar [[Giordano Bruno]], who was burnt at the stake for his beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky, I. ''The Acceptance of Correct Ideas in Science'', [http://www.varchive.org/ce/accept.htm Varchive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky, I ''My Challenge to Conventional Views in Science'', presented at the AAAS 1974 conference, [http://www.varchive.org/lec/aaas/challenge.htm Varchive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky, I ''Claude Schaeffer'', [http://www.varchive.org/cor/schaeffer/schaef.htm Varchive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy created by Velikovsky's publications may have helped revive the [[Catastrophism|catastrophist]] movement in the second half of the 20th century; however, it is also held by some working in the field that progress has actually been retarded by the negative aspects of the so-called Velikovsky Affair.&lt;ref&gt;Steel, Duncan (1995).

'''Jacques Ancel''' (July 22, 1879 in [[Parmain]], [[Val-d'Oise]] – 1943) was a [[France|French]] [[geographer]] and [[Geopolitics|geopolitician]]. He is author of several books, including ''Peoples and Nations of Balkans: political geography'' (1926) and ''Geopolitics'' (1936).

After studying history and geography and professing as a teacher, Ancel was drafted to fight in [[World War I]]. Wounded three times, he was detached to the Headquarters of the [[French Army]]'s Oriental Corps (fighting in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Balkans]]). After the war, he helped mediate the tense relations between [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. In 1930, Ancel obtained his [[doctorate]] with the thesis ''La Macédoine, étude de colonisation contemporaine'' ("[[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], a study in contemporary [[colonization]]").

He taught at the [[University of Paris]]' [[Institute of Higher International Studies]], and was a corresponding [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] and of other scientific forums. He was a knight of the [[Légion d'honneur]].

'''Jonathan Irvine Israel''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 26 January 1946) is a British writer and [[ academic]] specialising in [[Dutch history]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and [[European Jews]]. Israel was appointed as Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the School of Historical Studies at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]],  in January 2001.&lt;ref name=Mellon&gt;{{cite web |title=Jonathan Israel |date=5 December 2014|url=https://www.ias.edu/people/faculty-and-emeriti/israel |publisher=Princeton Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously Professor of Dutch History and Institutions at the [[University College London]].

In recent years, Israel has focused his attention on a multi-volume history of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He contrasts two camps. The "radical Enlightenment" founded on a rationalist materialism first articulated by [[Spinoza]]. Standing in opposition was a "moderate Enlightenment" which he sees as profoundly weakened by its belief in God.  In Israel’s highly controversial interpretation, the radical Enlightenment is the main source of the modern idea of freedom. He contends that the moderate Enlightenment, including [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Montesquieu]], made no real contribution to the campaign against superstition and ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Popkin, review of Jonathan Israel, ''Revolutionary Ideas: An Intellectual History of the French Revolution from The Rights of Man to Robespierre'' [http://www.h-france.net/vol15reviews/vol15no66popkin.pdf H-France Review  online June 2015]; [http://www.h-france.net/vol15reviews/vol15no67israelresponse.pdf Israel's rebuttal  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Israel's career until 2001 unfolded in UK [[academia]]. He did his undergraduate studies at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] and his graduate work at [[University of Oxford]] and the [[El Colegio de México]], [[Mexico City]], receiving his D.Phil. from Oxford in 1972. He was named [[Sir James Knott, 1st Baronet|Sir James Knott]] Research Fellow at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 1970, and in 1972 he moved to the [[University of Hull]] where he was first an assistant lecturer then a lecturer in Early Modern Europe. In 1974 he became a lecturer in Early Modern European History at [[University College London]], progressing to become a reader in Modern History in 1981, then to become Professor of Dutch History and Institutions in 1984. In January 2001, Israel became a professor of modern European history in the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, USA.&lt;ref name=PressRelease&gt;{{cite web |title=Jonathan Israel Appointed to Faculty of Institute for Advanced Study |date=17 January 2001 |url=http://www.ias.edu/news/press-releases/israel_appoint |publisher=Princeton Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the 375th anniversary of the birth of Spinoza, he held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html|title=The Spinoza Chair - Philosophy - University of Amsterdam|first=Universiteit van|last=Amsterdam|website=Uva.nl|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viewpoints ==
Israel has defined what he considers to be the "Radical Enlightenment," arguing it originated with [[Spinoza]]. He argues in great detail that Spinoza "and Spinozism were in fact the intellectual backbone of the European Radical Enlightenment everywhere, not only in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, and Scandinavia but also Britain and Ireland", and that the Radical Enlightenment, leaning towards religious skepticism and republican government, leads on to the modern liberal-democratic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Israel |first=J. |title=Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity, 1650-1750 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |location=Oxford, England |pages=vi |isbn=0-19-820608-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chamberlain |first=Lesley |title=When freedom fought faith |date=8 December 2006 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/enlightenment-contested-by-jonathan-israel-427458.html |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel is sharply critical of [[Jean-Paul Marat]] and [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] for repudiating the true values of the Radical Enlightenment and grossly distorting the [[French Revolution]].  He argues, "[[Jacobin]] ideology and culture under Robespierre was an obsessive Rousseauiste moral Puritanism steeped in authoritarianism, anti-intellectualism, and xenophobia, "and it repudiated free expression, basic human rights, and democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Israel |first=Jonathan |date=2014 |title=Revolutionary Ideas: An Intellectual History of the French Revolution from The Rights of Man to Robespierre |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=521 |isbn=978-0-691-15172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors and awards ==
He was made a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1992, Corresponding Fellow of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen ([[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]) in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/buitenlandse-leden/4301 |title=Jonathan Israel |language=Dutch |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; won the [[American Historical Association]]’s [[Leo Gershoy Award]] in 2001, and was made Knight of the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]] in 2004. In 2008, he won the [[Dr A.H. Heineken Prize]] for history, medicine, environmental studies and cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jonathan Israel (biographical details) |url=http://www.ias.edu/about/faculty-and-emeriti/israel |publisher=Princeton Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=21 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921143103/http://ias.edu/about/faculty-and-emeriti/israel |archivedate=21 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 he was awarded the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] by the [[Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce]] (RSA) for his outstanding contribution to Enlightenment scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jonathan Israel Awarded 2010 Benjamin Franklin Medal |date=24 November 2010 |url=http://www.ias.edu/news/news-briefs/israel-franklin-medal |publisher=Princeton Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
In response to Israel's series on the Enlightenment, writes Johnson Kent Wright,  there appeared ...
:a series of in-depth critiques, from leading practitioners of every stripe, including Theo Verbeek, Harvey Chisick, Anthony La Vopa, Antoine Lilti, Samuel Moyn, and Dan Edelstein.  Though all expressed admiration for the breadth of Israel's reading and display of sheer scholarly stamina, they also reached a strikingly unanimous verdict.  In the eyes of his critics, Israel's interpretation of the Enlightenment is a kind of academic juggernaut, careening destructively through the discipline, in the service of a false idol—Spinoza, supposed demiurge of modernity—and an unsustainable principle—the idea of an umbilical connection between metaphysical monism and political radicalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Johnson Kent |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Review essay |url=http://www.h-france.net/forum/forumvol9/Israel1.pdf |journal=H-France Forum |publisher= |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1 |doi= |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Marxist defense of Israel against one critic (Professor Samuel Moyn) appeared in 2010 on the [[World Socialist Web Site]], particularly in the article ''The Nation, Jonathan Israel, and the Enlightenment''.  The two defenders also criticize Israel, saying:
:There are problems in his argument. The dichotomy between a radical and moderate Enlightenment, however suggestive and stimulating, tends at times to overly simplify complex and contradictory processes in the development of philosophical thought. It is not always the case, as Professor Israel seems to suggest, that the most significant advances in philosophical thought were made by individuals who held the most politically radical views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/06/enli-j09.html |title=The Nation, Jonathan Israel, and the Enlightenment |last1=Talbot |first1=Ann |last2=North |first2=David |date=9 June 2010 |website=World Socialist Web Site |publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, in response to a [[Historisch Nieuwsblad]] survey, which asked members of the Royal Netherlands Historical Society what were the classic works about Dutch history, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness and Fall, 1477–1806'' came in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = De vijftien klassieke werken over de Nederlandse geschiedenis|url = http://www.historischnieuwsblad.nl/nl/artikel/6275/de-vijftien-klassieke-werken-over-de-nederlandse-geschiedenis.html|accessdate = 2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jordanian annexation of the West Bank''' was the occupation and consequent annexation of the [[West Bank]] (including [[East Jerusalem]]) by [[Jordan]] (formerly [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]) in the aftermath of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].&lt;ref name=Israeli&gt;Raphael Israeli, Jerusalem divided: the armistice regime, 1947–1967, Volume 23 of Cass series – Israeli history, politics, and society, Psychology Press, 2002, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Under Jordanian occupation since the 1948 Palestine war," ''Chicago Tribune'', 3 June 1954&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Jordan's [[Arab Legion]] conquered the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]] and took control of territory on the western side of the [[Jordan River]], including the cities of [[Jericho]], [[Bethlehem]], [[Hebron]] and [[Nablus]].&lt;ref name="Cavendish1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cavendish |first=Richard |url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/jordan-formally-annexes-west-bank  |title=Jordan Formally Annexes the West Bank |work=History Today |date=4 April 2000 |accessdate=23 January 2017 &lt;!-- alternate url (paywalled): https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61692149.html --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of hostilities, Jordan was in complete control of the West Bank.

Following the December 1948 [[Jericho Conference]], and the 1949 renaming of the country from Transjordan to Jordan, the West Bank was formally annexed on 24 April 1950.

The annexation was widely considered as illegal and void by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benvenisti|first=Eyal|title=The International Law of Occupation|page=204|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month afterwards, the [[Arab League]] declared that they viewed the area "annexed by Jordan as a trust in its hands until the Palestine case is fully solved in the interests of its inhabitants."&lt;ref name="Blum2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum|first=Yehuda Z.|authorlink=Yehuda Zvi Blum |title=Will "Justice" Bring Peace?: International Law - Selected Articles and Legal Opinions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nk8PDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|date=29 September 2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-23395-9|pages=230–231|quote=On April 13, 1950... the Council of the Arab League decided that "annexation of Arab Palestine by any Arab State would be considered a violation of the League Charter, and subject to sanctions." Three weeks after the said proclamation - on May 15, 1950 - the Political Committee of the Arab League, in an extraordinary session in Cairo, decided, without objection (Jordan herself was absent from the meeting), that the Jordanian annexation measure constituted a violation of the Council's resolution of April 13, 1950, and considered the expulsion of Jordan from the League; but it was decided that discussion of punitive measures be postponed to another meeting, set for June 12, 1950. At that meeting of the League Council it had before it Jordanian Memorandum asserting that "annexation of Arab Palestine was irrevocable, although without prejudice to any final settlement of the Palestine question." This formula enabled the Council to adopt a face-saving resolution "to treat the Arab part of Palestine annexed by Jordan as a trust in its hands until the Palestine case is fully solved in the interests of its inhabitants."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of Jordan's declaration of annexation was only granted by the [[United Kingdom]], [[Iraq]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eyāl |last=Benveniśtî |authorlink=Eyal Benvenisti|url={{Google books |id=lcVOlb0wefwC |page=108 |plainurl=yes }} |title=The international law of occupation |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2004 |page=108 |isbn=0-691-12130-3 |quote=This purported annexation was, however, widely regarded as illegal and void, by the Arab League and others, and was recognized only by Britain, Iraq, and Pakistan. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="School2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Washington University.

When Jordan transferred its full citizenship rights to the residents of the West Bank, the annexation more than doubled the population of Jordan.&lt;ref name="Cavendish1"/&gt; The naturalized Palestinians enjoyed equal opportunities in all sectors of the state without discrimination, and they were given half of the seats of the [[Parliament of Jordan|Jordanian parliament]].&lt;ref name="jifa"/&gt;

After Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the Palestinians there remained Jordanian citizens until Jordan decided to renounce claims and sever administrative ties with the territory in [[Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank|1988]].

==Background==
===Prior to 1948===
Prior to hostilities in 1948, [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] (modern-day [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Israel]]) had been under the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)]] control of the British Empire, which captured it from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1917. The [[British Empire|British]], as custodians of the land, implemented the land tenure laws in Palestine, which it had inherited from the Ottoman (as defined in the [[Ottoman Land Code of 1858#The Ottoman Land Code (as applied in the Palestine Mandate)|Ottoman Land Code of 1858]]), applying these laws to both Arab and Jewish tenants, legal or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;''The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920–1948'', British Mandate government printing office, Jerusalem 1946, vol. 1, p. 225, of chapter 8, section 1, paragraph 1 (Reprinted in 1991 by the [[Institute for Palestine Studies]]), which reads: "The land law in Palestine embraces the system of tenures inherited from the Ottoman regime, enriched by some amendments, mostly of a declaratory character, enacted since the British Occupation on the authority of the Palestine Orders-in-Council."&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the expiration of the British Mandate, Arabs aspired for independence and self-determination, as did the Jews of the country.&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of Palestine'' (Prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry), vol. 1, chapter 2, British Mandate Government of Palestine: Jerusalem 1946, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===The establishment of Jordanian rule in the West Bank===
Following [[Israel]]'s declaration of independence on 14 May 1948, the Jordanian [[Arab Legion]], under the leadership of Sir John Bagot Glubb, known as [[Glubb Pasha]], was ordered to enter Palestine and secure the UN designated Arab area.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[John Bagot Glubb]], ''A Soldier with the Arabs'', London 1957, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; After the invasion, Jordan began making moves to perpetuate the Jordanian rule over the Arab part of Palestine. King Abdullah appointed governors on his behalf in the Arab cities of [[Ramallah]], [[Hebron]], [[Nablus]], [[Bethlehem]], [[Ramla]] and the Arab controlled part of [[Jerusalem]], that were captured by Legion in the invasion. These governors were mostly Palestinians (including [[Aref al-Aref]], [[Ibrahim Hashem]] and [[Ahmed Hilmi Pasha]]), and the Jordanians described them as "military" governors, so it wouldn't anger the other Arab states, who opposed Jordan's plans to incorporate the Arab part of Palestine into the kingdom. The king made other smaller moves towards the annexation of the West Bank: He ordered Palestinian policemen to wear the uniforms of the Jordanian police and its symbols; he instituted the use of Jordanian [[postage stamp]]s instead of the British ones; Palestinian municipalities were not allowed to collect taxes and issue licenses; the radio of Ramallah called the locals to disobey the instructions of pro-[[al-Husayni clan|Husseini]] officials and obey those of the Jordanian-backed governors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber]], ''Independence Versus Nakba''; Kinneret–Zmora-Bitan–Dvir Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|965-517-190-6}}, pp.262–263&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 1948 [[Jericho Conference]], a meeting of prominent Palestinian leaders and King [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]], voted in favor of annexation into what was then Transjordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1948v05p2.p1137&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1948v05p2&amp;isize=M |title=FRUS, US State Department Report |publisher=Digicoll.library.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war, Jordanian forces had control over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. On 3 April 1949, Israel and Jordan signed an [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice agreement]]. The main points included:
* Jordanian forces remained in most positions they held in the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]] and the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]].
* Jordan withdrew its forces from its front posts overlooking the [[Sharon plain]]. In return, Israel agreed to allow Jordanian forces to take over positions in the [[West Bank]] previously held by [[Iraq]]i forces.
* A Special Committee was to be formed to make arrangements for safe movement of traffic between [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mount Scopus]] campus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], along the [[Latrun]]-[[Jerusalem]] Highway, free access to the [[Holy Places]], and other matters. The committee was never formed, and access to the Holy Places was denied to Israelis throughout the Jordanian occupation.

The remainder of the area designated as part of an Arab state under the UN Partition Plan was partly occupied by Egypt (Gaza Strip), partly occupied and annexed by Israel (West Negev, West Galilee, Jaffa). The intended international enclave of Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan. The Jordanians immediately expelled all the Jewish residents of East Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael J.

In March 1948, the British Cabinet had agreed that the civil and military authorities in Palestine should make no effort to oppose the setting up of a Jewish State or a move into Palestine from Transjordan.&lt;ref&gt;CAB/128/12 formerly C.M.(48) 24 conclusions 22 March 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States, together with the United Kingdom favoured the annexation by Transjordan. The UK preferred to permit King Abdullah to annex the territory at the earliest date, while the United States preferred to wait until after the conclusion of the [[United Nations Conciliation Commission|Palestine Conciliation Commission]] brokered negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign relations of the United States, 1950. The Near East, South Asia, and Africa, p. 1096&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan formally annexed the West Bank on 24 April 1950, giving all residents automatic Jordanian citizenship. West Bank residents had already received the right to claim Jordanian citizenship in December 1949.

Jordan's annexation was widely regarded as illegal and void by the [[Arab League]] and others. [[Elihu Lauterpacht]] described it as a move that "entirely lacked legal justification."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sgG5DtWEm4C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Israel, the West Bank and International Law|last=Gerson|first=Allan|date=1978-01-01|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780714630915|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annexation formed part of Jordan's "Greater Syria Plan" expansionist policy,&lt;ref name="Aruri1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naseer Hasan Aruri|title=Jordan: a study in political development (1921-1965).|url={{Google books |id=GVaG4WGKj9MC |page=90 |plainurl=yes }} |accessdate=22 December 2010|year=1972|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-247-1217-5|page=90|quote=For Abdullah, the annexation of Palestine was the first step in the implementation of his Greater Syria Plan.

In 1950, the [[United Kingdom|British]] extended formal recognition to the union between the Hashemite Kingdom and that part of Palestine under Jordanian occupation and control - with the exception of Jerusalem. The British government stated that it regarded the provisions of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty of Alliance of 1948 as applicable to all the territory included in the union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1950/apr/27/jordan-and-israel-government-decision See: Jordan and Israel (Government Decision) HC Deb 27 April 1950 vol 474 cc1137-41]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[Arab League]] opposition, the inhabitants of the West Bank became citizens of Jordan.

Tensions continued between Jordan and Israel through the early 1950s, with Palestinian guerrillas and Israeli commandos crossing the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]. [[Abdullah I of Jordan]], who had become [[Emir]] of Transjordan in 1921 and King in 1923, was assassinated in 1951 during a visit to the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] on the [[Temple Mount]] in East Jerusalem by a Palestinian gunman following rumours that he was discussing a peace treaty with Israel.  The trial found that this assassination had been planned by Colonel [[Abdullah el-Tell]], ex-military governor of Jerusalem, and [[Musa Abdullah Husseini]].  He was succeeded by his grandson King [[Hussein of Jordan]] once he came of age in 1953, after his father Talal's brief reign.

Unlike any other Arab country to which they fled after the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Palestinian refugees in the West Bank (and on the [[East Bank]]) were given Jordanian citizenship on the same basis as existing residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.forcedmigration.org/research-resources/expert-guides/palestinian-refugees-in-jordan/fmo025.pdf|title = Palestinian refugees in Jordan|accessdate = 6 July 2015|publisher = Forced Migration Online|last = Al Abed|first = Oroub|quote = Palestinians were granted Jordanian Citizenship. Article 3 of the 1954 law states that a Jordanian national is: 'Any person with previous Palestinian nationality except the Jews before the date of May 15, 1948 residing in the Kingdom during the period from December 20, 1949 and February 16, 1954.' Thus Palestinians in the East Bank and the West Bank of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan were granted Jordanian nationality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the refugees continued to live in camps and relied on [[UNRWA]] assistance for sustenance. Palestinian refugees constituted more than a third of the kingdom's population of 1.5 million.

In the Jordanian parliament, the West and East Banks received 30 seats each, having roughly equal populations. The first elections were held on 11 April 1950. Although the West Bank had not yet been annexed, its residents were permitted to vote.  The last Jordanian elections in which West Bank residents would vote were those of April 1967, but their parliamentary representatives would continue in office until 1988, when West Bank seats were finally abolished. Palestinians enjoyed equal opportunities in all sectors of the state without discrimination.&lt;ref name="jifa"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9TkD3ugwEUC&amp;pg=PA211lpg=PA211|title=Citizenship and the State in the Middle East: Approaches and Applications|accessdate=18 October 2015|author1=Nils August Butenschon|author2=Uri Davis |author3=Manuel Sarkis Hassassian|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture remained the primary activity of the territory. The West Bank, despite its smaller area, contained half of Jordan's agricultural land. In 1966, 43% of the labor force of 55,000 worked in agriculture, and 2,300&amp;nbsp;km² were under cultivation. (Numbers that have fallen considerably since.) In 1965, 15,000 workers were employed in industry, producing 7% of the GNP. This number fell after the 1967 war, and would not be surpassed until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.rviewer.com/main/articles/Chapter8.html |title=Assessing the Viability of a Palestinian State |author=Paul H.

The [[Jordanian dinar]] became legal tender, and remains so there today.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

There was a significant flow of population from the West Bank to East Bank, in particular to the capital, [[Amman]].

===Access to holy sites===
{{Main|Islamization of East Jerusalem under Jordanian occupation}}
Clauses in the 3 April 1949 Armistice Agreements specified  that Israelis would have access to the religious sites in East Jerusalem.

==Aftermath==
===Six-Day War and end of Jordanian control===
{{Main|Six-Day War}}
By the end of the [[Six-Day War]], the formerly Jordanian-controlled West Bank with its one million Palestinian population had come under Israeli [[military occupation]]. About [[1967 Palestinian exodus|300,000 Palestinian refugees]] fled to Jordan. After 1967, all religious groups were granted administration over their own holy sites, while administration of the [[Temple Mount]] – sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims – remained in the hands of the [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf]].

===Jordanian disengagement===
{{also|Oslo Accords|Israel–Jordan peace treaty}}
Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank (in [[Arabic]]: قرار فك الارتباط), in which [[Jordan]] surrendered the claim to [[sovereignty]] over the [[West Bank]], took place on 31 July 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/88_july31.html Address to the Nation]&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July 1988, Jordan renounced its claims to the West Bank (with the exception of guardianship over the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem), and recognized the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] as "the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people."&lt;ref name="relinquish1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/88_july31.html |author=King Hussein |title=Address to the Nation |date=31 July 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="relinquish2"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557747_2/West_Bank.html |title=West Bank |publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia |author=Shaul Cohen |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx4c1bIU?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557747_2/West_Bank.html |archivedate= 1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[West Bank]] territories which were conquered by [[Jordan]] in 1948 during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] after the British mandate ended on that territory and Israel declared independent, were annexed to the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] on 24 April 1950, and all the [[Arabs in the territories|Arab residents]] were given Jordanian citizenship. The annexation of these territories was recognized only by [[Pakistan]], [[Iraq]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

During the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, Israel captured and occupied among others these territories from Jordan, although Jordan, despite not continuing to be the actual sovereign, continued to pay salaries and pensions to civil servants and to provide services to [[Waqf|endowments]] and educational affairs.

In 1972, King Hussein conceived a plan to establish a [[King Hussein's federation plan|united Arab federation]] which would include the West Bank and Jordan. This proposal never came to be.

In 1974, the [[Arab League]] decided to recognize the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the [[Palestinian people]]. The decision forced King Hussein to relinquish his claim to speak for the Palestinian people during peace negotiations and to recognize an independent [[Palestinian state]] that is independent of Jordan.

On 28 July 1988, King Hussein announced the cessation of a $1.3 billion development program for the West Bank explaining that the aim of this move is to allow the PLO to take more responsibility for these territories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/29/world/jordan-drops-1.3-billion-plan-for-west-bank-development.html "Jordan Drops $1.3 Billion Plan For West Bank Development". ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later the king dissolved Jordan's lower house of parliament, half of whose members represented constituencies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/474002471.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT ''The Toronto Star'' Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 1988, King Hussein announced the severance of all legal and administrative ties with the West Bank, except for the Jordanian sponsorship of the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, and recognised the PLO's claim to the [[State of Palestine]]. In his speech to the nation held on that day he announced his decision and explained that this decision was made with the aim of helping the Palestinian people establishing their own independent state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_periods9.html ''Disengagement from the West Bank'']. www.kinghussein.gov.jo.

John Kifner, ''New York Times'', 1 August 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] between the PLO and Israel "opened the road for Jordan to proceed on its own negotiating track with Israel."&lt;ref name="madrid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_peace2.html |title=Jordan – History – The Madrid Peace Process |publisher=The Royal Hashemite Court }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty#History|Washington Declaration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/w-declaration.html |title=The Washington Declaration |publisher=The Royal Hashemite Court}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initialled one day after the Oslo Accords were signed. "On July 25, 1994, King Hussein met with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin in the Rose Garden of the White House, where they signed the Washington Declaration, formally ending the 46-year state of war between Jordan and Israel."&lt;ref name="madrid" /&gt; Finally, on 26 October 1994, Jordan signed the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]], which normalized relations between the two countries and resolved territorial disputes between them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15528">'''Joseph Octave Delepierre''' (12 March 1802 – 18 August 1879) was a Belgian lawyer, archivist, diplomat, author and antiquary. He spent his later life in the United Kingdom, and is best known for his studies of [[macaronic language]] and literature.

==Life==
He was born at [[Bruges]] in Belgium, 12 March 1802. His father was Joseph Delepierre, for many years receveur-général of the province of [[West Flanders]]; his mother was of the Penaranda family. Illiterate at age 12, he qualified for the [[University of Ghent]]. Having obtained the degree of doctor of laws, he became an [[avocat]], and was appointed archivist of West Flanders, in Bruges.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Delepierre, Joseph Octave|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collector of books and works of art, Delepierre's reputation as a local antiquary attracted visitors from abroad. When [[Albert, Prince Consort]] was in Bruges in 1839, Delepierre was his guide. But he became dissatisfied with his official position, after an application for promotion was disregarded. He had made the acquaintance of [[Sylvain Van de Weyer]], who induced him in 1843 to come to London, in August 1849 appointed him a secretary of legation, and obtained for him the post of Belgian consul. He made his way in society, and held Sunday evening receptions.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Delepierre was a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], and a member of other English, Belgian, and French societies. He was decorated with several orders of knighthood. For over 35 years he acted as Belgian secretary of legation, and, until 1877, when he resigned, he was consul-general for Belgium in London.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Delepierre died 18 August 1879, aged 77, at the house of his son-in-law, [[Nicholas Trübner]], 29 Upper Hamilton Terrace, London, and was buried in [[Highgate cemetery]] on 22 August.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Living in England, Delepierre wrote an account in 1849 of a collection of early French [[farce]]s and [[morality play]]s in the [[British Museum]]. In 1852 he produced ''Macaronéana'', followed by ''Macaronéana Andra'' in 1862. These publications formed an encyclopædia of information on macaronic literature.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

When the Duc d'Aumale, Van de Weyer, [[Richard Monckton Milnes]], and others founded the Philobiblon Society in 1853 (then limited to 36 members), Delepierre was appointed one of the honorary secretaries. He contributed 22 papers to its privately printed ''Miscellanies'', among them being contributions on [[cento (poetry)|cento]]s, on the literary history of lunatics, on [[parody]], and on visions of hell; these he enlarged and republished separately. His major writings were produced during his residence in England. He printed a history of [[Flemish literature]] in 1860; the first volume, in 1863, of a collection (completed in 1876) of his friend Van de Weyer's writings. He also contributed to the ''Annales de la Société d'Emulation de Bruges'' (1839–43), ''Messager des Sciences Historiques'' (1833–79), ''Le Bibliophile Belge'' (1845–65), ''St. James's Magazine'', and other journals.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2156">[[File:Month - Knuckles (en).svg|thumb|300px|The knuckle mnemonic.]]

The '''knuckle mnemonic''' is a [[mnemonic]] device for remembering the number of days in the months of the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s.

==Method==
===One handed===
One form of the mnemonic is done by counting on the [[knuckle]]s of one's hand to remember the numbers of days of the months.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Museum of Science and Art, Volumes 5-6|last=Lardner |first=Dionysius |authorlink= Dionysius Lardner|coauthors= |year=1855 |publisher=Walton and Maberly |format=Encyclopedias and dictionaries |location= |isbn= |access-date=July 16, 2007 |quote=When we close the hand there are four projecting knuckles of the four fingers, with depressions between them.  If we give the knuckles and intermediate depressions the names of the successive months, recommencing from the first knuckle, after having once gone over them, we shall find that the months of thirty-one days are those which fall upon the knuckles.
 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Count knuckles as 31 days, depressions between knuckles as 30 (or 28/29) days. Start with the [[little finger]] knuckle as January, and count one finger or depression at a time towards the [[index finger]] knuckle (July), saying the months while doing so. Then return to the little finger knuckle (now August) and continue for the remaining months.

One variant of this approach differs after reaching the index finger knuckle (July): instead of wrapping around back to the little finger, some people reverse direction and continue from the index finger knuckle (counting it for both July and August) and ending on the [[ring finger]] knuckle.

===Two handed===
Still others use two hands (as shown in the diagram, right): starting with the little finger knuckle of the left hand, proceed to the left index finger knuckle, then (swapping hands) jump to the right fist's index finger knuckle for August, finishing on the knuckle of the right ring finger (December).

The company was formed in 1987 under the merger of [[fashion house]] [[Louis Vuitton]] with Moët Hennessy, a company formed after the 1971 [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] between the [[List of Champagne houses|champagne producer]] [[Moët &amp; Chandon]] and [[Hennessy]], the [[Cognac (brandy)|cognac]] manufacturer.&lt;ref name=CHFU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/LVMH-Moeuml;t-Hennessy-Louis-Vuitton-SA-Company-History.html |title=LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA – Company History |publisher=Funding Universe |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5f2242ac-4847-11e0-b323-00144feab49a.html |title=Retail &amp; Consumer – LVMH to take controlling stake in Bulgari |author=Rachel Sanderson in Milan |publisher=[[Financial Times|FT.com]] |date=6 March 2011 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lvmh.com/fonctionalite/pg_faq_histo.asp |title=LVMH group, Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton: world leader in luxury, listed on CAC 40 index. |publisher=LVMH.com |accessdate=30 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607035949/http://www.lvmh.com/fonctionalite/pg_faq_histo.asp |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It controls around 60 [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]] that each manage a small number of prestigious brands. The subsidiaries are often managed independently.

Arnault's successful integration of various famous [[aspirational brand]]s into a single group has inspired other luxury companies into doing the same. Thus, the French conglomerate [[Kering]] (formerly named [[PPR (company)|PPR]]) and the Swiss-based [[Richemont]] have also created extended portfolios of luxury brands. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/equities/indices/euro+stoxx+50+EU0009658145/constituents Frankfurt Stock Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2011, LVMH announced the acquisition of the 50.4% family-owned shares of the Italian jeweller [[Bulgari]] and the intention to make a tender offer for the rest, which was publicly owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-07/bulgari-family-agrees-to-sell-a-controlling-stake-to-lvmh-in-share-swap.html |title=LVMH Plans to Buy Bulgari for $5.2 Billion After Acquiring Majority Stake

In 2011, LVMH invested $640 million in establishing LCapitalAsia.&lt;ref name="MW March 7"/&gt;

On 7 March 2013, ''[[National Business Daily]]'' reported that mid-priced clothing brand QDA would open stores with the assistance of LVMH’s private equity LCapitalAsia and the Chinese apparel company Xin Hee Co., Ltd. in Beijing.&lt;ref name="MW March 7"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.morningwhistle.com/html/2013/Company_Industry_0307/217439.html | title=LVHM investing in Chinese mid-priced clothing market | publisher=Morning Whistle | date=7 March 2013 | accessdate=2013-05-10 | author=Kang, Xiaoxiao}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, LVMH invested $640 million in establishing LCapitalAsia.&lt;ref name="MW March 7"/&gt; LVMH sales "decreased by about 10 percent from in 2011" in China, and LVMH stopped "opening stores in second and third-tier cities in mainland China".&lt;ref name="MW March 7"/&gt; Xue Shengwen, a senior researcher at [[ChinaVenture]], said the developing trend of the market is to take advantage of more acceptable prices.&lt;ref name="MW March 7"/&gt;

==Journées Particulières==
Launched in 2011,  Journées Particulières allow visitors to enter scores of ateliers, studios, caves and mansions within the LVMH, with no admission charge. From discovering the secrets of France’s most famous shoemaker, Berluti, and perusing the Salons de Hotel Baudard de Saint James of jeweler Chaumet; or a walk through the private salons of the haute couture workshops of Christian Dior or a stroll in the vineyards of LVMH’s most venerable marque, Domaine des Lambrays, founded in 1365. “For the first edition we were not at all certain that the public would come. I speak about that with some emotion. I remember coming along avenue Montaigne at 8AM that first morning and seeing hundreds of people, families, elderly ladies and little kids waiting for the doors of avenue Montaigne 30 to open and I thought we are going to write a beautiful page in history,” said Arnault, referring to Christian Dior’s headquarters. Staged every two years, this month’s edition runs from Friday, October 12 to Sunday October 14, with in Europe alone, open doors in France, Italy, Switzerland, UK, Holland, Spain and Germany. Some 3,000 employees with 56 brands will welcome guests into over 70 sites on four continents. It reaches extends from pastry – Cova in Milan is one of Italy’s oldest pasticceria – to fine art, with the Fondation Louis Vuitton, and its giant glass confabulation designed by Frank Gehry in the Bois de Boulogne.“We have a brainstorming session every year, a carte blanche, there is not a strict brief, but in the end the idea is quite simple, letting people have a voyage of discovery into our universe. Why change something that works?” said Antoine, a LVMH board member and eldest son of Bernard Arnault, the group’s main shareholder, and France’s richest man. 2017 issue attracted 145'000 people, 2018 issue has a target of 175,000. &lt;ref&gt;https://uk.fashionnetwork.com/news/Antoine-Arnault-kicks-off-the-Journees-Particulieres-of-LVMH,1023951.html#.W8D31Sp1OUk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laura X''' (born '''Laura Rand Orthwein, Jr.'''; in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1940), is one of the world’s leading advocates pertaining to the women's movement and a wide array of precursors and overlapping social movements from the second half of the 20th century.

Laura X changed her name in 1962 to '''Laura Shaw Murra''', which remains her legal name, and each of her other two sets of names she uses as an AKA. She took the name Laura X, on September 17, 1969, to symbolize her rejection of men's legal ownership of women and the anonymity of women's history, which was stolen from women and girls. She declared that, like [[Malcolm X]], "I don't want to have my owner's name, either."&lt;ref name="lauraxinstitute.wix.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lauraxinstitute.wix.com/lauraxinstitute|title=lauraxinstitute|website=lauraxinstitute|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and background==
After attending [[Vassar College]] for three years, Laura X moved to [[New York City]], became a [[Head Start Program]] teacher in the pilot program, having trained at the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. She also rose to Picket Captain in CORE ([[Congress of Racial Equality]]), attended [[New York University]] (NYU), and took graduate courses at [[Bank Street College of Education]]. Following her interests and research developed at Vassar College,&lt;ref&gt;Carol Jones Vernon, Staff Writer for [[St. Louis Globe Democrat]] - January 4th, 1961. Archives of the defunct Globe-Democrat are presently housed at [http://www.umsl.edu/mercantile/ Mercantile Library at University of Missouri St. Louis] (UMSL)&lt;/ref&gt; she worked with the [[American Committee on Africa]] to welcome delegates from 17 newly independent states, 16 from Africa, join the UN - the biggest increase in membership in any one year&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/Overview/milesto4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; - and to picket [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] about their investments in South Africa. In 1963, she moved to [[Berkeley, California]] and graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC-Berkeley), in 1971, having participated in the [[Free Speech Movement]] as well as other social justice movements.

==Laura X World Institute==
In 2015, Laura X formed the 'Laura X - Laura Rand Orthwein, Jr. World Institute on Social Justice Movements.' Located physically in St. Louis, Missouri, the Institute serves as the home of both the physical archive which total over 400,000 individual items of history, the virtual museum, and the interpretation center for archival materials extant at UC Berkeley, Harvard, University of Illinois and other institutions,  including guides to the Women’s History Research Center (WHRC).  Total items at universities around the world are over 1,000,000 items of history. Laura X serves as the Institute's activist-in-residence and together with others offers interpretation and teaching to enrich communities in St Louis via in-person events and around the world through online virtual exhibitions.

The collection pertains to the Women's Movement and a wide array of precursors and overlapping social movements from the second half of the 20th century, including materials from Laura X's successful state-by-state campaign to abolish the legal privilege for marital and date rape.  She began collecting materials in 1964 and has been committed to this effort ever since. The Institute’s Archives make historical research and presentation possible. Archive staff is currently engaged in cataloging the 580+ boxes of materials, in order to keep them vibrant, accessible, and available for researchers and other interested parties. Once finished, this archive will be a resource for students, professors, historians, film documentarians, museums, exhibitions, high school teachers, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lauraxinstitute.org/|title=Laura X Institute|website=www.lauraxinstitute.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21841">Telescope have grown in size since they first appeared around 1608. The following tables list the increase in size over the years.

== By overall aperture ==
The following is a list of largest single [[Telescope mount|mount]] [[optical telescope]]s sorted by total [[Objective (optics)|objective]] diameter (''aperture''), including [[Segmented mirror|segmented]] and multi-mirror configurations. It is a historical list, with the instruments listed in chronological succession by objective size. By itself, the diameter of the primary optics can be a poor measure of a telescope's historical or scientific significance; for example, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]]'s [[Leviathan of Parsonstown|72-inch (1.8 m) reflecting telescope]] did not perform as well (i.e. [[Light-gathering power|gather as much light]]) as the smaller silvered glass mirror telescopes that succeeded it because of the poor performance of its [[speculum metal]] mirror.

'''Louise Brown''' (1878 – 1 May 1955) was an American [[historian]] of Britain.

==Life and work==
Louise Fargo Brown was born in 1878 in [[Buffalo, New York]] and received her [[B.A.]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1903. She was awarded her Ph.D. in 1909 and go a job as an instructor at [[Wellesley College]] in 1909. Two years later, Brown published ''The Political Activities of the Baptists and Fifth Monarchy Men in England During the Interregnum'', for which she was awarded the [[Herbert Baxter Adams Prize]] from the [[American Historical Association]] for the best [[monograph]] in modern European history. In 1915 Brown became [[dean of women]] and professor of history at the [[University of Nevada]]. When the United States entered [[World War I]], she enlisted into the [[United States Marine Corps]] where she was a [[sergeant]]. After the war, she became a professor at [[Vassar College]] where she remained until her retirement in 1944 and co-founded the [[Berkshire Historical Conference of Women Historians]] in 1930. Brown published ''The First Earl of Shaftesbury'' in 1933 and wrote ''Apostle of Democracy: The Life of Lucy Maynard Salmon'' a decade later. Together with George B. Carson, she published ''Men and Centuries of European Civilization'' in 1948. Brown was a Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]]. She died on 1 May 1955 at [[Norfolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon &amp; Cosner, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madoc''', also spelled '''Madog''', '''ab Owain Gwynedd''' was, according to [[folklore]], a Welsh prince who sailed to [[Americas|America]] in 1170, over three hundred years before [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyage in 1492.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Madog+ab+Owain+Gwynedd |title=Madoc|publisher=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the story, he was a son of [[Owain Gwynedd]], and took to the sea to flee internecine violence at home. The "Madoc story" legend evidently evolved out of a medieval tradition about a Welsh hero's sea voyage, to which only allusions survive. However, it attained its greatest prominence during the [[Elizabethan era]], when English and Welsh writers wrote of the claim that Madoc had come to the Americas as an assertion of prior discovery, and hence legal possession, of North America by the [[Kingdom of England]].{{sfn|Fowler|2010|p=54}}{{sfn|Owen|Wilkins|2006|page=546}}

The "Madoc story" remained popular in later centuries, and a later development asserted that Madoc's voyagers had intermarried with local Native Americans, and that their Welsh-speaking descendants still live somewhere in the United States. These "Welsh Indians" were credited with the construction of a number of landmarks throughout the [[Midwestern United States]], and a number of white travelers were inspired to go look for them. The "Madoc story" has been the subject of much speculation in the context of possible [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories|pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]. No conclusive archaeological proof of such a man or his voyages has been found in the New or Old World; however, speculation abounds connecting him with certain sites, such as [[Devil's Backbone (rock formation)|Devil's Backbone]], located on the Ohio River at Fourteen Mile Creek near [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsandtribune.com/clarkcounty/x519388801/The-Madoc-legend-lives-in-Southern-Indiana-Documentary-makers-hope-to-bring-pictures-to-author-s-work |title=The Madoc legend lives in Southern Indiana: Documentary makers hope to bring pictures to author's work|author=Curran, Kelly|date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2011|publisher=''News and Tribune'', Jeffersonville, Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
[[File:Map c1577.jpg|thumb|A map of c. 1577 depicting Conwy, Penrhyn, and Llandrighno ([[Rhos-on-Sea]])]] 
Madoc's purported father, [[Owain Gwynedd]], was a real [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|king of Gwynedd]] during the 12th century and is widely considered one of the greatest Welsh rulers of the [[Middle Ages]]. His reign was fraught with battles with other Welsh princes and with [[Henry II of England]]. At his death in 1170, a [[History of Gwynedd during the High Middle Ages#Poet-Prince and Gwynedd interregnum; 1170–1200|bloody dispute]] broke out between his heir, [[Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd|Hywel]] the Poet-Prince, and Owain's younger sons, [[Maelgwn ab Owain Gwynedd|Maelgwn]], [[Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd|Rhodri]], and led by [[Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd|Dafydd]], two the children of the Princess-Dowager Cristen ferch Gronwy and one the child of Gwladus ferch Llywarch. Owain had at least 13 children from his two wives and several more children born out of wedlock but legally acknowledged under Welsh tradition.  According to the legend, Madoc and his brother (Rhirid or Rhiryd) were among them, though no contemporary record attests to this.

The 1584 ''Historie of Cambria'' by [[David Powel]] says that Madoc was disheartened by this family fighting, and that he and Rhirid set sail from Llandrillo ([[Rhos-on-Sea]]) in the [[cantref]] of [[Rhos (north Wales)|Rhos]] to explore the western ocean with a number of ships.{{efn-ua|"And after he had returned home and declared the pleasant and frutefull countreys that he had seene without inhabitants, and upon the contrarye parte what barreyne and wilde grounde his bretherne and nevewes did murther one an other for, he prepared a number of shippes, and gote with suche men and women as were diserouse to lyve in quietness. And takinge his leave of his frends, toke his journey thytherwarde againe wherefore his is to be presupposed that he and his people enhabited parte of those countreys."{{sfn|Llwyd|Williams|2002|p=168}}}}  They discovered a distant and abundant land in 1170 where about one hundred men, women and children disembarked to form a colony. According to [[Humphrey Llwyd]]'s 1559 ''[[Cronica Walliae]]'', Madoc and some others returned to Wales to recruit additional settlers.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} After gathering several ships of men, women and children, the Prince and his recruiters sailed west a second time to "that Westerne countrie" and ported in "Mexico", never to return to Wales again.{{sfn|Caradoc|1584|pp=166–7}}

Madoc's landing place has also been suggested to be "Mobile Alabama; Florida; Newfoundland; Newport, Rhode Island; Yarmouth, Nova Scotia; Virginia; points in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean including the mouth of the Mississippi River; the Yucatan; the isthmus of Tehuantepec, Panama; the Caribbean coast of South America; various islands in the West Indies and the Bahamas along with Bermuda; and the mouth of the Amazon River".&lt;ref name="Fritze-p163"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|title=Legend and lore of the Americas before 1492: an encyclopedia of visitors, explorers, and immigrants|year=1993|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0874366648|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the folklore tradition acknowledges that no witness ever returned from the second colonial expedition to report this, the story continues that Madoc's colonists travelled up the vast river systems of North America, raising structures and encountering friendly and unfriendly tribes of Native Americans before finally settling down somewhere in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] or the [[Great Plains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madocresearch.net/MoreInfo.html|title=Prince Madoc, myth or legend?|publisher=Madocresearch.net|accessdate=31 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920083118/http://madocresearch.net/MoreInfo.html|archivedate=20 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are reported to be the founders of various civilisations such as the [[Aztec]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and the [[Inca]].&lt;ref name="Fritze-p163" /&gt;

The Madoc story evidently originated in medieval romance. There are allusions to what may have been a sea voyage tale akin to ''[[Brendan#Possible link to North America|The Voyage of Saint Brendan]]'',{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} but no detailed version of it survives.

The earliest certain reference to a seafaring Madoc or Madog appears in a ''[[cywydd]]'' by the Welsh poet [[Maredudd ap Rhys]] (''fl.'' 1450–83) of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], which mentions a Madog who is a son or descendant of Owain Gwynedd and who voyaged to the sea. The poem is addressed to a local squire, thanking him for a fishing net on a patron's behalf. Madog is referred to as "Splendid Madog... / Of Owain Gwynedd's line, / He desired not land&amp;nbsp;... / Or worldy wealth but the sea." A Flemish writer called Willem, in around 1250 to 1255,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} identifies himself in his poem ''[[Reynard#In medieval European folklore and literature|Van den Vos Reinaerde]]'' as "[[Willem die Madoc maecte]]" (Willem, the author of Madoc, known as "Willem the Minstrel"{{efn-ua|"The earliest existing fragments of the epic of 'Reynard the Fox' were written in Latin by Flemish priests, and about 1250 a very important version in Dutch was made by Willem the Minstrel, of whom it is unfortunate that we know no more, save that he was the translator of a lost romance, 'Madoc'."&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Literature of Holland |encyclopedia=Britannica |year=1881 |publisher=OpenLibrary.org |location= |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediabrit12newyrich }} Vol. 12,  page 90&lt;/ref&gt;}}). Though no copies of "Madoc" survive, [[Gwyn A. Williams|Gwyn Williams]] tells us that "In the seventeenth century a fragment of a reputed copy of the work is said to have been found in Poitiers". It provides no topographical details relating to North America, but mentions a sea that may be the [[Sargasso Sea]] and says that Madoc (not related to Owain in the fragment according to Gwyn Williams) discovered an island paradise, where he intended "to launch a new kingdom of love and music".{{sfn|Gaskell|2000|p=47}}{{sfn|Williams |1979|p=51, 76}} There are also claims that the Welsh poet and genealogist [[Gutun Owain]] wrote about Madoc before 1492. Gwyn Williams in ''Madoc, the Making of a Myth'', makes it clear that Madoc is not mentioned in any of Owain's surviving manuscripts.{{sfn|Williams|1979|p=48-9}}

The Madoc legend attained its greatest prominence during the [[Elizabethan era]], when Welsh and English writers used it to bolster British claims in the [[New World]] versus those of Spain. The earliest surviving full account of Madoc's voyage, as the first to make the claim that Madoc had come to America before Columbus,{{efn-ua|"An so his was by Britons longe afore discovered before eyther Colonus or Americus lead any Hispaniardes thyther."{{sfn|Llwyd|Williams|2002|p=168}}}} appears in Humphrey Llwyd's published 1559 ''[[Cronica Walliae]]'',{{sfn|Llwyd|Williams|2002|p=vii}} an English adaptation of the ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]''.{{sfn|Bradshaw|2003|p=29}}{{efn-ua|"And at this tyme an other of Owen Gwynedhs sonnes, named Madocke, left the lande in contention betwixt his bretherne, and prepared certaine shippes, with men [and] munition, and sought adventures by the seas.

And this lande most needs be some parte of that land the which the Hispaniardes do affirme them selves to be the first finders, sith Hannos tyme. For by reason and order of cosmosgraphie this lande to which Madoc came to, most needs bee somme parte of Nova Hispania, or Florida."{{sfn|Llwyd|Williams|2002|p=167-68}}}} [[John Dee]] used his manuscript when he submitted the treatise "Title Royal" to Queen Elizabeth in 1580 which stated that "The Lord Madoc, sonne to [[Owain Gwynedd|Owen Gwynned]], Prince of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], led a Colonie and inhabited in [[Florida|Terra Florida]] or thereabouts" in 1170.{{sfn|Fowler|2010|p=54}} The story was first published by [[George Peckham (merchant)|George Peckham]]'s as ''A True Report of the late Discoveries of the Newfound Landes'' (1583) and like Dee it was used to support English claims to the Americas.{{sfn|Morison|1971|p=106}} It was picked up in [[David Powel]]'s ''Historie of Cambria'' (1584),{{sfn|Morison|1971|p=106}}{{efn-ua|"This Madoc arriving in the Western country, unto the which he came, in the yeare 1170, left most of his people there: and returning back for more of his nation, acquaintance, and friends, to inhabite that faire and large countrie: went thither againe with ten sailes, as I find noted by Gutyn Owen. I am of opinion that the land, where unto he came, was part of Mexico; the causes which make me to think so be these."{{sfn|Powel|1811|p=167}}}} and [[Richard Hakluyt]]'s ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation'' (1589). [[John Dee]] went so far as to assert that [[Brutus of Troy]] and [[King Arthur]] as well as Madoc had conquered lands in the Americas and therefore their heir [[Elizabeth I of England]] had a priority claim there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacMillan |first1=Ken |last2= |first2= |date=April 2001 |title= Discourse on history, geography, and law: John Dee and the limits of the British empire, 1576–80 |journal=  Canadian Journal of History|volume=36 |issue= 1 |page=1|publisher= |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramtops.co.uk/madocdee.html|title=Madoc and John Dee: Welsh Myth and Elizabethan Imperialism|last1=Baron|first1=Robert W.|last2=|first2=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822101611/http://ramtops.co.uk/madocdee.html|archivedate=22 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet|Thomas Herbert]] popularised the stories told by Dee and Powel, adding more detail from sources unknown, suggesting that Madoc may have landed in Canada, Florida, or even Mexico, and reporting that Mexican sources stated that they used [[currach]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|title=Legend and lore of the Americas before 1492: an encyclopedia of visitors, explorers, and immigrants|year=1993|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0874366648|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Welsh Indians were not claimed until later. Morgan Jones's tract is the first account, and was printed by ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', launching a slew of publications on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/revmorganjoneswe00gree |title= The Rev. Morgan Jones and the Welsh Indians of Virginia |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1898 |work= The Library of Congress |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no genetic or archaeological evidence that the [[Mandan]] are related to the Welsh, however, and John Evans and Lewis and Clark reported they had found no Welsh Indians.{{sfn|Williams|1963|p=69}} The Mandan are still alive today; the tribe was decimated by a [[smallpox]] epidemic in 1837–1838 and banded with the nearby [[Hidatsa]] and [[Arikara]] into the [[Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation|Three Affiliated Tribes]].{{sfn|Newman|pp=255–272}}

The Welsh Indian legend was revived in the 1840s and 1850s; this time the [[Zuni people|Zunis]], [[Hopi]]s, and [[Navajo]] were claimed to be of Welsh descent by [[George Ruxton]] (Hopis, 1846), P. G. S. Ten Broeck (Zunis, 1854), and Abbé Emmanuel Domenach (Zunis, 1860), among others.{{sfn|Fowler|2010|p=55}} [[Brigham Young]] became interested in the supposed Hopi-Welsh connection: in 1858 Young sent a Welshman with [[Jacob Hamblin]] to the Hopi mesas to check for Welsh-speakers there. None was found, but in 1863 Hamblin brought three Hopi men to [[Salt Lake City]], where they were "besieged by Welshmen wanting them to utter Celtic words", to no avail.{{sfn|Fowler|2010|p=55}}

Llewellyn Harris, a Welsh-American [[Mormon]] missionary who visited the Zuni in 1878, wrote that they had many Welsh words in their language, and that they claimed their descent from the "Cambaraga"—white men who had come by sea 300 years before the Spanish. However, Harris's claims have never been independently verified.{{sfn|McClintock|2007|p=72}}

==Welsh Indians==
[[File:Mandan Bull Boats and Lodges- George Catlin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|George Catlin thought the Mandan bull boat to be similar to the Welsh [[coracle]].]]

On 26 November 1608, Peter Wynne, a member of Captain [[Christopher Newport]]'s exploration party to the villages of the [[Monacan people]], [[Virginia Siouan]] speakers above the falls of the [[James River]] in [[Virginia]], wrote a letter to [[John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater|John Egerton]], informing him that some members of Newport's party believed the pronunciation of the Monacans' language resembled "Welch", which Wynne spoke, and asked Wynne to act as interpreter. The Monacan were among those non-Algonquian tribes collectively referred to by the Algonquians as "Mandoag".{{sfn|Mullaney|1995|p=163}}

Another early settler to claim an encounter with a Welsh-speaking Indian was the Reverend Morgan Jones, who told [[Thomas Lloyd (lieutenant governor)|Thomas Lloyd]], [[William Penn]]'s deputy, that he had been captured in 1669 in [[North Carolina]] by a tribe of [[Tuscarora people]] called the [[Doeg tribe|Doeg]]. According to Jones, the chief spared his life when he heard Jones speak Welsh, a tongue he understood. Jones' report says that he then lived with the Doeg for several months preaching the [[Gospel]] in Welsh and then returned to the [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies]] where he recorded his adventure in 1686. The historian [[Gwyn A. Williams]] comments, "This is a complete [[wiktionary:farrago|farrago]] and may have been intended as a hoax".{{sfn|Williams |1979|p=76}} There is no evidence for there having been Doeg among the Tuscarora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|title=Legend and lore of the Americas before 1492: an encyclopedia of visitors, explorers, and immigrants|year=1993|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0874366648|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fort mounds.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Madoc's proponents believe [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthen fort mounds]] at [[Devil's Backbone (rock formation)|Devil's Backbone]] along the [[Ohio River]] to be the work of Welsh colonists.]]

Folk tradition has long claimed that a site called "[[Devil's Backbone (rock formation)|Devil's Backbone]]" at [[Rose Island (amusement park)|Rose Island]], about fourteen miles upstream from [[Louisville, Kentucky]], was once home to a colony of Welsh-speaking Indians. The eighteenth-century [[Missouri River]] explorer [[John Evans (explorer)|John Evans]] of [[Waunfawr]] in Wales took up his journey in part to find the Welsh-descended "Padoucas" or "Madogwys" tribes.{{sfn|Kaufman|2005|p=569}}

Early visitors referred to a rock formation on [[Fort Mountain (Murray County, Georgia)|Fort Mountain]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as a [[fort]], speculating that it was built by [[Hernando de Soto]] to defend against the [[Muscogee]] around 1540.&lt;ref&gt;"News from Georgia" [https://books.google.com/books?id=kzfnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fort%20mountain%20georgia&amp;pg=RA1-PA99#v=snippet&amp;q=fort%20mountain&amp;f=false ''Brick and Clay Record''] Kenfield, Chicago: 1907, Vol. 27, No.3, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was contradicted as early as 1917, as a historian pointed out that de Soto was in the area for less than two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Lucian Lamar, "Fort Mountain", [https://books.google.com/books?id=EEYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=fort%20mountain%20georgia&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=fort%20mountain%20georgia&amp;f=false ''A Standard History of Georgia and Georgians'']. Lewis Publishing, Chicago: 1917, Vol. 1, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists believe the stones were placed there by indigenous peoples.{{sfn|Smith|1962|}} There is also a theory that the "Welsh Caves" in [[DeSoto State Park]], northeastern [[Alabama]], were built by Madoc's party, since local native tribes were not known to have ever practised such stonework or excavation as was found on the site.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1810, [[John Sevier]], the first [[List of Governors of Tennessee|governor]] of Tennessee, wrote to his friend Major [[Amos Stoddard]] about a conversation he had in 1782 with the old [[Cherokee]] chief [[Oconostota]] concerning ancient fortifications built along the [[Alabama River]]. The chief allegedly told him that the forts were built by a white people called "Welsh", as protection against the ancestors of the Cherokee, who eventually drove them from the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.family.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bowen/welshindians.html|title=text of John Sevier's 1810 letter|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=|work=Bowen family web e-history files|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=4 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113154813/http://freepages.family.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bowen/welshindians.html|archivedate=13 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sevier had also written in 1799 of the alleged discovery of six skeletons in brass armour bearing the Welsh coat-of-arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofWales/The-discovery-of-America-byWelsh-Prince/ |title=The discovery of America by Welsh Prince Madoc |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work=History Magazine |publisher= History UK |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that Madoc and the Welsh were first in Alabama.{{sfn|Williams|1979|p=84}}

In 1824, [[Thomas S. Hinde]] wrote a letter to John S. Williams, editor of The American Pioneer, regarding the Madoc Tradition. In the letter, Hinde claimed to have gathered testimony from numerous sources that stated Welsh people under Owen Ap Zuinch had come to America in the twelfth century, over three hundred years before Christopher Columbus. Hinde claimed that in 1799, six soldiers had been dug up near [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]], on the [[Ohio River]] with [[breastplate]]s that contained Welsh coats-of-arms.{{sfn|Williams|1842|p=373}}

=== Encounters with Welsh Indians ===
Thomas Jefferson had heard of Welsh-speaking Indian tribes. In a letter written to [[Meriwether Lewis]] by Jefferson on 22 January 1804, he speaks of searching for the Welsh Indians "said to be up the Missouri".{{sfn|Jefferson|1903|p=441}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://100777.com/node/373 The Mystery of the Mandanas]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Stephen E. Ambrose]] writes in his history book ''[[Undaunted Courage]]'' that Thomas Jefferson believed the "Madoc story" to be true and instructed the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] to find the descendants of the Madoc Welsh Indians.{{sfn|Ambrose|1996|p=285}}{{sfn|Kaufman|2005|p=570}}

===Mandans===
In all, at least thirteen real tribes, five unidentified tribes, and three unnamed tribes have been suggested as "Welsh Indians."{{sfn|Fritze|2009|p=79}} Eventually, the legend settled on identifying the Welsh Indians with the [[Mandan]] people, who were said to differ from their neighbours in culture, language, and appearance. The painter [[George Catlin]] suggested the Mandans were descendants of Madoc and his fellow voyagers in ''North American Indians'' (1841); he found the round Mandan Bull Boat similar to the Welsh [[coracle]], and he thought the advanced architecture of Mandan villages must have been learned from Europeans (advanced North American societies such as the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] and [[Hopewell tradition]]s were not well known in Catlin's time). Supporters of this claim have drawn links between Madoc and the Mandan mythological figure "Lone Man", who, according to one tale, protected some villagers from a flooding river with a wooden corral.{{sfn|Bowers|2004|p=163}}

==Later writings==
Several attempts to confirm Madoc's historicity have been made, but historians of early America, notably [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], regard the story as a myth.{{sfn|Curran|2010|p=25}} Madoc's legend has been a notable subject for poets, however. The most famous account in English is [[Robert Southey]]'s long 1805 poem ''[[Madoc (poem)|Madoc]]'', which uses the story to explore the poet's freethinking and egalitarian ideals.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=133}} Fittingly, Southey wrote ''Madoc'' to help finance a trip of his own to America,{{sfn|Morison|1971|p=86}} where he and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] hoped to establish a Utopian state they called a "[[Pantisocracy]]". Southey's poem in turn inspired the twentieth-century poet [[Paul Muldoon]] to write ''Madoc: A Mystery'', which won the [[Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=12003 |title=Paul Muldoon |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brynmawr.edu/news/2006-01-26/muldoon.shtml |title= Pulitzer prize poet Paul Muldoon to read |last1= Ginanni |first1= Claudia |last2=  |first2=  |date= 26 January 2006 |work= Bryn Mawr Now |publisher= Bryn Mawr College |accessdate= 3 April 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130407110838/http://www.brynmawr.edu/news/2006-01-26/muldoon.shtml |archivedate= 7 April 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores what may have happened if Southey and Coleridge had succeeded in coming to America to found their "ideal state".{{sfn|O'Neill|2007|pp=145–164}} In Russian, the noted poet [[Alexander Pushkin|Alexander S. Pushkin]] composed a short poem "Madoc in Wales" (Медок в Уаллах, 1829) on the topic.{{sfn|Wachtel|2011|pp=146–151}}

John Smith, historian of Virginia, wrote in 1624 of the ''Chronicles of Wales'' reports Madoc went to the New World in 1170 A.D. (over 300 years before Columbus) with some men and women. Smith says the ''Chronicles'' say Madoc then went back to Wales to get more people and made a second trip back to the New World.{{sfn|Durrett|1908|pp=28, 29}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=1}}

==Legacy==
The township of [[Madoc, Ontario]], and the nearby village of [[Madoc, Ontario (town)|Madoc]] are both named in the prince's memory, as are several local guest houses and pubs throughout North America and the United Kingdom. The Welsh town of [[Porthmadog]] (meaning "Madoc's Port" in English) and the village of [[Tremadog]] ("Madoc's Town") in the county of [[Gwynedd]] are actually named after the industrialist and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] [[William Madocks|William Alexander Madocks]], their principal developer, and additionally influenced by the legendary son of Owain Gwynedd, Madoc ab Owain Gwynedd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/placenames/pages/porthmadog.shtml |title= Porthmadog |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 3 April 2013 |work= What's in a Name |publisher= BBC |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Prince Madog'', a research vessel owned by the [[University of Wales]] and P&amp;O Maritime, set sail on 26 July 2001, on her maiden voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/52048/rv-prince-madog-completes-survey-in-irish-sea/ |title= RV Prince Madog Completes Survey in Irish Sea |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plaque at [[Fort Mountain State Park]] in Georgia recounts a nineteenth-century interpretation of the ancient stone wall that gives the site its name. The plaque repeats Tennessee governor John Sevier's statement that the Cherokees believed "a people called Welsh" had built a fort on the mountain long ago to repel Indian attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetanimals.com/logue/Ftmount.html|title=Fort Mountain's Mysterious Wall|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=|work=Touring the Backroads of North and South Georgia|publisher=Native American Tour|accessdate=3 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131225825/http://planetanimals.com/logue/Ftmount.html|archivedate=31 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; October 2015, the plaque has now been changed with no reference to Madoc or the Welsh.

In 1953, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] erected a plaque at [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] on the shores of [[Mobile Bay, Alabama]], reading:

{{quote|In memory of Prince Madoc a Welsh explorer who landed on the shores of Mobile Bay in 1170 and left behind with the Indians the Welsh language.{{sfn|Fowler|2010|p=55}}{{sfn|Morison|1971|p=85}}}}

The plaque was removed by the Alabama Parks Service in 2008 and put in storage. Since then there has been much controversy in getting the plaque reinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southernmemoriesandupdates.com/2011/alabama/welsh-explorer-prince-madoc-beat-columbus-to-new-world-by-322-years/ |title= Welsh explorer Prince Madoc beat Columbus to new world by 322 years |last1=Hambrick |first1=Judd |last2= |first2= |date=18 May 2011  |work= Mobile, Alabama November 11, 1953 |publisher= Southern Memories |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7034">'''Microhistory''' is the intensive [[History|historical]] investigation of a well-defined smaller unit of research (most often a single event, the community of a village, or an individual). In its ambition, however, microhistory can be distinguished from a simple [[case study]] insofar as microhistory aspires to "[ask] large questions in small places", to use the definition given by Charles Joyner.&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, C. W. ''Shared Traditions: Southern History and Folk Culture'', (Urbana: University of Illinois, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH0gSiHYhrQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Joyner,+search+for+answers+to+large+questions+in+small+places&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0urxT7_2DKas2wWZ3bHDCg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=answers%20to%20large%20questions&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Microhistory originally developed in Italy in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giovanni Levi]], one of the pioneers of the approach, it began as a reaction to a perceived crisis in existing historiographical approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Giovanni|chapter=On Microhistory|year=1991|editor-last=Burke|editor-first=Peter|title=New Perspectives on Historical Writing|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|pages=93&amp;ndash;94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carlo Ginzburg]], another of microhistory's founders, has written that he first heard the term used around 1977, and soon afterwards began to work with Levi and [[Simona Cerutti]] on ''Microstorie'', a series of microhistorical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "microhistory" dates back to 1959, when the American historian [[George R. Stewart]] published ''Pickett's Charge: A Microhistory of the Final Attack on Gettysburg, July 3, 1863'', which tells the story of the final day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early use was by the [[Annales School|Annales]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]], for whom the concept had negative connotations, being overly concerned with the history of events.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A third early use of the term was in the title of Luis González's 1968 work ''Pueblo en vilo: Microhistoria de San José de Gracia''.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12/&gt;  González distinguished between microhistory, for him synonymous with local history, and "''petite histoire''", which is primarily concerned with anecdotes.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12/&gt;

==Approach==
The most distinctive aspect of the microhistorical approach is the small scale of investigations.&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26/&gt;  Microhistorians focus on small units in society, as a reaction to the generalisations made by the social sciences which do not necessarily hold up when tested against these smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magnússon|first=Sigurdur Gylfi|title='The Singularization of History': Social History and Microhistory within the Postmodern State of Knowledge|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=36|issue=3|year=2003|page=709}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, Ginzburg's 1976 work ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]'' &amp;ndash; "probably the most popular and widely read work of microhistory"&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26/&gt; &amp;ndash; investigates the life of a single sixteenth-century Italian miller, Menocchio.  The individuals microhistorical works are concerned with are frequently those Robert Tristano describes as "little people", especially those considered heretics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|pages=26&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo Ginzburg has written that a core principle of microhistory is making obstacles in sources, such as [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]], part of the historical account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, Levi has said that the point of view of the researcher becomes part of the account in microhistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Giovanni|chapter=On Microhistory|year=1991|editor-last=Burke|editor-first=Peter|title=New Perspectives on Historical Writing|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable aspects of microhistory as a historical approach are an interest in the interaction of elite and popular culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an interest in the interaction between micro- and macro-levels of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17348">The [[Serbs]] trace their history to the 6th and 7th-century southwards migration of Slavs. The Serbs, as the other [[South Slavs]], absorbed [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe|Paleo-Balkan peoples]] and established various states throughout the [[Middle Ages]]; Serbian historiography agrees on that the beginning of [[Serbian history]] started with the forming of Serbian statehood in the [[Early Middle Ages]].

In the 19th century, various scholars provided several theories about the origin of the Serb ethnonym. Some researchers claimed that the ethnonym, and thereby ethnic origin, dated to ancient history. The theories are based on the presumed connection to various Roman-era ethnonyms (tribes) and toponyms. These theories remain largely unproved and controversial.

==Early historical records of the Serb name==
[[Image:Map of Colchis, Iberia, Albania, and the neighbouring countries ca 1770.jpg|thumb|200px|''"Serbi"'' located near the mouth of the Volga, based on Greek literary sources, in a map printed in LONDON, ''ca'' 1770]]
Various authors mentioned names of [[Serbs]] ({{lang-sr|Srbi}} / Срби) and [[Sorbs]] ([[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]]: ''Serbja''; [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]]: ''Serby'') in different variants: Surbii, Suurbi, Serbloi, Zeriuani, Sorabi, Surben, Sarbi, Serbii, Serboi, Zirbi, Surbi, Sorben,{{sfn|Petković|1926|p=9}} etc. These authors used these names to refer to Serbs and Sorbs in areas where their historical (or current) presence was/is not disputed (notably in the [[Balkans]] and [[Lusatia]]), but there are also sources that mention the same or similar names in other parts of the World (most notably in the Asiatic [[Sarmatia]] in the [[Caucasus]]). Attempts of various researchers to connect these names with modern Serbs produced various theories about the origin of the Serb people.

;Early historical mentions of an alleged "Serb" ethnonym in the Caucasus:
*[[Pliny the Younger]] in his work ''Plinii Caecilii Secundi Historia naturalis'' from the first century AD (69-75) mentioned people named [[Serboi|Serbi]],&lt;ref name="Aleksandar M. Petrović 2006, page 19"&gt;Aleksandar M. Petrović, Arheografija naroda jugoistočne Evrope, Beograd, 2006, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; who lived near the [[Cimmerians]], presumably on the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Sea of Azov]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}
*In the 2nd century (around 175 AD), the [[Egypt]]ian [[Greek people|Greek]] scientist [[Claudius Ptolemy]] mentioned in his ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' people named [[Serboi|Serboi or Sirboi]],&lt;ref name="Aleksandar M. Petrović 2006, page 19"/&gt; who presumably lived behind the [[Caucasus]], in the hinterland of the [[Caspian Sea]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

;Early historical mentions of other Serb-sounding names that some researchers are trying to connect with the Serb people:

==Migration of White Serbs to the Balkans==
[[Image:White serbia white croatia01.png|thumb|200px|Locations of White Serbia and White Croatia in the 6th century (around 560), according to the book of Francis Dvornik.]]
[[Image:Dervan.png|thumb|200px|[[Dervan]]'s Serbia (White Serbia), 7th century.]]
[[Image:Serb lands in the 9th century (en).png|thumb|200px|Serb lands in the [[Balkans]] in the 9th century, mostly according to [[De Administrando Imperio]].]]
According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' ({{abbreviation|DAI|De Administrando Imperio}}, written by the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] (912-959), the Serbs originated from the "[[White Serbs]]" who lived on the "other side of Turkey" (name used for [[Hungary]]), in the area that they called "Boiki". White Serbia bordered to the Franks and [[White Croatia]]. DAI claims that after two brothers inherited the rule from their father, one of them took half of the people and migrated to the [[Byzantine Empire]] (i.e. to the [[Balkans]]), which was governed by Emperor [[Heraclius]] (610-641).&lt;ref&gt;Sava S. Vujić - Bogdan M. Basarić, Severni Srbi (ne)zaboravljeni narod, Beograd, 1998, pages 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Petrović|1997|pp=90-91}}&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Ćorović, Ilustrovana istorija Srba, knjiga prva, Beograd, 2005, page 61.&lt;/ref&gt; According to German historian L. A. Gebhardi, the two brothers were sons of [[Dervan]], the ''dux'' (duke) of the [[Sorbs (tribe)|Surbi (Sorbs)]].&lt;ref&gt;Sava S. Vujić - Bogdan M. Basarić, Severni Srbi (ne)zaboravljeni narod, Beograd, 1998, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Balkans]], [[Serbs]] settled first around rivers [[Tara (Drina)|Tara]], [[Ibar (river)|Ibar]], [[Drina]] and [[Lim (river)|Lim]] (in the present-day border region of [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], but also [[Dalmatia]]), and joined with surrounding [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] tribes that came to the Balkans earlier (in the 6th century) and the Paleo-Balkan people. Over time, the South Slavic and mostly Illyrian tribes of this territory  mixed with the Serbs and also adopted Serb name as their own.&lt;ref name="Sava S 1998, page 36"&gt;Sava S. Vujić - Bogdan M. Basarić, Severni Srbi (ne)zaboravljeni narod, Beograd, 1998, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another part of the White Serbs did not migrate southwards, but remained in the [[Elbe]] region. Descendants of these White Serbs are the present day Lusatian Serbs ([[Sorbs]]), who still live in the [[Lusatia]] (Lužica, Lausitz) region of eastern [[Germany]].

There are also opinions that data from "De administrando imperio" that describes Serb migration to the Balkans is not correct and that Serbs came to the Balkans from [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] lands, together with other [[South Slavs]].{{sfn|Novaković|1992|p=57}}&lt;ref&gt;Nikola Jeremić, Srpska zemlja Bojka, Zemun, 1993, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emperor [[Constantine III (Byzantine emperor)|Constantine III]] (641) transferred a part of the [[Slavs]] from the [[Balkans]] ([[Vardar]] region) to [[Asia Minor]]. There these migrants founded the city of [[Gordoservon]], the name of which gives grounds for supposing that among its founders there were [[Serbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K5hpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=gordoservon&amp;dq=gordoservon&amp;hl=sr&amp;ei=d_G-Tpn7OomZhQfS16WuBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBTgK The Macedonian question: the struggle for southern Serbia, Đoko M. Slijepčević, American Institute for Balkan Affairs, 1958, page 50.]&lt;/ref&gt; The city was also known under names Gordoserbon and Servochoria.

==Theories==

===Iranian theory===
Theory about [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin of the Serb ethnonym assumes that ancient [[Serboi|Serbi / Serboi]] from north [[Caucasus]] (Asiatic Sarmatia) were a [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] ([[Alans|Alanian]]) tribe.&lt;ref name="Miodrag Milanović 2008, page 81"&gt;Miodrag Milanović, Srpski stari vek, Beograd, 2008, page 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory subsequently assumes that Alanian Serbi were subdued by the [[Huns]] in the 4th century and that they, as part of the Hunnic army, migrated to the western edge of the [[Huns#Unified Empire under Attila|Hunnic Empire]] (in the area of [[Central Europe]] near the river [[Elbe]], later designated as [[White Serbia]] in what is now [[Saxony]] (eastern [[Germany]]) and western [[Poland]]). After the Hunnic leader [[Attila]] died (in 453), Alanian Serbi presumably became independent and ruled in the east of the river [[Saale]] (in modern-day [[Germany]]) over the local [[Slavs|Slavic]] population.&lt;ref name="Miodrag Milanović 2008, page 81"/&gt;{{sfn|Novaković|1992|p=46}} Over time, they, it is argued, intermarried with the local [[Slavs|Slavic population]] of the region,&lt;ref name="Miodrag Milanović 2008, page 81"/&gt;{{sfn|Novaković|1992|p=46}} adopted Slavic language, and transferred their name to the Slavs.{{sfn|Novaković|1992|p=48}} According to [[Tadeuš Sulimirski]], similar event could occur in the [[Balkans]] or [[Serbs]] who settled in the Balkans were Slavs who came from the north and who were ruled by already slavicized [[Alans]].{{sfn|Novaković|1992|p=46}}

[[Image:Migrations serbes avant 1000.png|thumb|200px|left|Hypothetical Serb migration from Sarmatia]]
Deformed human skulls that are connected to the Alans are also discovered in the area that was later designated as "White Serbia".{{sfn|Novaković|1992|p=48}} According to Indo-European interpretation, different sides of the [[World]] are designated with different colors, thus, white color is designation for the west, black color for the north, blue or green color for the east and red color for the south. According to that view, [[White Serbia]] and [[White Croatia]] were designated as western Serbia and western Croatia, and were situated in the west from some hypothetical lands that had same names and that presumably existed in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Relja Novaković, Srbi, Zemun, 1993, page 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the Alanian Serbi in Sarmatia, similarly like other Sarmatian/Iranian peoples on the northern Caucasus, originally spoke an Indo-European [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] language similar to present-day [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]]. The Ossetian language is a member of [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]] branch of Iranian languages, along with [[Pashto language|Pashtun]], [[Yaghnobi language|Yaghnobi]] and languages of the [[Pamir languages|Pamir]]. One of the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribal groups in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] is known as [[Sarbans]] (Sarbani) and Pashtuns are believed to be of [[Scythian]] descent while their language is classified as East Scythian (Sarmatian language is also grouped within Scythian branch).

In [[Poland|Polish]] history, the Polish nobility claimed to be direct descendants of the historic [[Sarmatian]] people (see: [[Sarmatism]]) and this might be connected with historical [[White Serbia]] and [[White Croatia]], which included parts of present-day [[Poland]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Autochthonic theory===
This theory assumes that Serbs are an [[autochthon (person)|autochthon]]ic people in the [[Balkans]] and [[Podunavlje]], where they presumably lived before historical Slavic and Serb migration to the Balkans in the 6th-7th centuries.{{sfn|Petrović|1997|pp=9–10}} Proponents of this theory (for example [[Jovan I. Deretić]], [[Olga Luković Pjanović]], [[Miloš Milojević]]) claimed that Serbs either came to the Balkans long before the 7th century or Serb 7th century migration to the Balkans was only partial and Serbs who, according to "[[De administrando imperio]]", came from the north founded in the Balkans other Serbs that already lived there.{{sfn|Petrović|1997|pp=9–10}} It is suggested that ancient city of [[Serbinum]] in [[Pannonia]] was named after these hypothetical autochthonic Serbs.{{sfn|Petrović|1997|p=8}}

===Proto-Slavic theory===
*[[Sporoi]] ({{lang-el|Σπόροι}}) was according to Eastern Roman scholar [[Procopius]] (500–560) the old name of the [[Antae]] and [[Sclaveni]], two [[Early Slav]]ic branches. Procopius stated that the Sclavenes and Antes [[Proto-Slavic|spoke the same language]], but did not trace their common origin back to the [[Venethi]] but to a people he called "Sporoi".&lt;ref name=Barford-36&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Paul M. Barford|title=The Early Slavs: Culture and Society in Early Medieval Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z9ItAtbJ5AC|date=January 2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-3977-3|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived the name to Greek {{lang|el|σπείρω}} ("I scatter grain"), because "they populated the land with scattered settlements".&lt;ref name=Hrushevskyi&gt;{{cite book|author1=Михайло Грушевський|author2=Andrzej Poppe|author3=Marta Skorupsky |author4=Uliana M.

B. Bury|2013|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Šafárik deemed that it was the oldest generic name of the Slavs.&lt;ref name="institute1879"&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal anthropological institute|title=The Journal of the Anthropological institute|volume=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqIEAAAAQAAJ|year=1879|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the mid-9th century the so-called [[Bavarian Geographer]] wrote that people named [[Zeriuani]] had so large kingdom that all [[Slavic peoples]] originated from there (or from them).{{sfn|Petrović|1997|p=90}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OvxGAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=zeriuani&amp;dq=zeriuani Quaestiones medii aevi, Томови 1-4, Uniwersytet Warszawski. Instytut Historyczny, Polskie Towarzystwo Historyczne. Commission d'histoire médiévale, Éditions de l'Université de Varsovie, 1977, page 31.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of interpretations, Zeriuani are identified with Serbs, and there are opinions that "Serbs" was an old name of all Slavic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lazo M. Kostić]], O srpskom imenu, Srbinje - Novi Sad, 2000, pages 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to other opinions, Zeriuani might be a name used for [[Severians]] or [[Sarmatians]] instead for Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KUsiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=zeriuani&amp;dq=zeriuani Prosvjeta, Том 16, Društvo hrvatskih književnika., 1908, page 216.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Hugh Grove''' (b 1955, Cambridge, UK) is a British historian, and one of the contemporary founders of [[environmental history]] as an academic field. His prizewinning book, ''Green Imperialism: Colonial Expansion, Tropical Island Edens and the Origins of Environmentalism 1600–1860'' (1995), is widely praised for its exhaustive account of colonial environmental impacts and environmental thinking back to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/35383020/Green-Imperialism-R-Grove |title=Green Imperialism, R. Grove |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Grove is the son of Cambridge climatologists [[Alfred Thomas Grove]] and [[Jean Mary Grove]], née Clark, and is married to historian Vinita Damodaran of [[University of Sussex]].  His interdisciplinary training includes a BA in Geography from [[Oxford University]] (1979), MSc in [[Conservation biology]] from [[University College London]] (1980) and a PhD in History from the [[University of Cambridge]] (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Richard Hugh. 1988. ''Conservation and colonial expansion : a study of the evolution of environmental attitudes and conservation policies on St Helena, Mauritius and in India, 1660–1860''. PhD thesis. University of Cambridge, Faculty of History.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grove was a Fellow of Clare Hall, and College Lecturer at [[Churchill College]], University of Cambridge (1988–1990 and 1991–1992). He also held visiting appointments at the Institute of Advanced Studies of the [[Australian National University]] in Canberra and the Program in Agrarian Studies at [[Yale University]]. He spent a year at the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]] for International Scholars in Washington DC in the 1990s.

Grove became Professor and founded the Centre for World Environmental History at the University of Sussex in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh/index "Centre for World Environmental History", University of Sussex.] Accessed: 10 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a five-year research appointment at the [[Australian National University]] in 2006, funded by an ARC Discovery fellowship, but was unable to complete it. In 2006, Grove suffered a very serious car accident in [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma, Australia]], on his way back from the Manning Clark property "Ness" on the far south coast of New South Wales, and has been severely incapacitated since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-environment&amp;month=0703&amp;week=c&amp;msg=6w/9thUY%2BhnrYOMsciBBBQ&amp;user=&amp;pw= |title=H-Net Discussion Networks – Richard Grove |publisher=H-net.msu.edu |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic contributions ==

Grove has contributed to knowledge of the political, environmental and economic history of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and other Indian Ocean islands, Malawi, Ghana, Nigeria, the Southern Caribbean (especially St Vincent, Montserrat, Dominica and Tobago), Australia and New Zealand. His major contribution has been to document the environmental history of these places through exhaustive archival research in several languages, particularly relating to the 17th–19th centuries. The ecological transformations of island terrains around the world received particular attention. He argued that some important figures in the tropics actually helped to create early environmentalist thought in the [[British colonies]]. Plant transfers by colonial actors were very significant, and helped create environmental awareness among imperial powers. His major argument is summarised in [http://ecoethics.net/hsev/200004txt.htm "The Culture of Islands and the History of Environmental Concern"], a paper presented at the Harvard Seminar on Environmental Values, in 2000.

A more recent strand of investigation concerned the historical impact of El Nino events. His 2000 book with Australian geologist, John Chappell, documented the local effects of the disastrous 1997–1998 El Nino in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.

Grove founded the academic journal, ''[[Environment and History]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A festschrift volume, ''The British Empire and the natural world: environmental encounters in South Asia'', edited by [[Deepak Kumar (historian)|Deepak Kumar]], Vinita Damadaran, and Rohan D'Souza, was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2011. The volume recognises Grove's substantial contribution to environmental history before his accident.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Talbert has directed a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Institute on the early Roman empire (Chapel Hill, 1991), and co-directed (with Michael Maas of Rice University) three [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Seminars at the [[American Academy in Rome]] (2000, 2006, and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions/education/other-opportunities/communication-empire-and-the-city-rome |title=National Endowment for the Humanities |publisher=Neh.gov |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2017 Talbert and Maas directed an NEH summer program focused on "Migration and Empire: The Roman Experience From Marcus Aurelius to Muhammad".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neh.gov/divisions/education/other-opportunities/2017/migration-and-empire-the-roman-experience-marcus-aurelius-muhammad Migration and Empire: The Roman Experience From Marcus Aurelius to Muhammad SUMMER SEMINARS AND INSTITUTES FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY TEACHERS&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant among his scholarly work is the compilation of the ''[[Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World]]'', which won the 2000 Association of American Publishers Award for Best Professional/Scholarly Multi-volume Reference Work in the Humanities. He has also completed path breaking research on the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'', a Medieval manuscript containing a copy of a likely ancient Roman map.&lt;ref name="Talbert2010"/&gt; Talbert's work, including both print and digital components, analyzes the map in an effort to situate it in terms of Roman world view.&lt;ref name="Cambridge.org"/&gt;

Talbert has trained many ancient historians during his tenure at the University of North Carolina.

{{Runcorn to Latchford Canal map}}
The '''Runcorn to Latchford Canal''' (also known as the '''Old Quay Canal''' or locally as "Old Quay Cut" or "Black Bear Canal") ran from [[Runcorn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Coord|53.335|-2.729|display=inline|region:GB_scale:10000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheshire]] to the [[Latchford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Coord|53.380|-2.569|display=inline|region:GB_scale:10000}}&lt;/ref&gt; area of [[Warrington]], then in the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Lancashire]], England.  It connected the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]] to the [[River Mersey]] at Runcorn.

==History==
The canal was built to bypass the shallow stretches of the Mersey at Fiddlers Ferry.  It extended for {{convert|7|mi|km|0}}, ending to the east of Runcorn Gap close to the centre of the township of Runcorn,&lt;ref name="Starkey1990"&gt;{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=130.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cost £48,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nickson|1887|p=162.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Latchford, it joined the Mersey at a lock which was located above Howley Weir.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Wood |2006 |p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its terminus a dock was built which became part of the [[Port of Runcorn]].  The canal was built under powers embodied in the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Act (1720) which permitted new cuts to be made without the necessity of further recourse to Parliament.  It opened in July 1804.&lt;ref name="Starkey1990" /&gt;  

The canal and the Mersey and Irwell Navigation were bought out by the [[Bridgewater Canal]] Company in 1844. The new owners invested little in the canal and its condition gradually grew worse. They in turn were bought out by the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] Company in the 1890s, who particularly wanted ownership of the Runcorn to Latchford Canal, as the ship canal would use the same course for part of its route. Much of the western end of the canal, including the docks at Runcorn, disappeared when the much larger ship canal was built. The eastern end fared rather better, as the section between Twenty Steps Bridge and Latchford Lock was retained. A new lock, called Twenty Steps Lock, was built where the old canal left the course of the ship canal, and it was used to supply tanneries at Howley with hides which were imported from Argentina, and this trade continued until the 1960s. This section was called the Black Bear Canal, and it ceased to be used after the tanneries closed.&lt;ref name=wood88&gt;{{harvnb |Wood |2006 |pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canal as built had a locks at both ends, both of which dropped into the river. As it had no natural water supply, and water was lost every time a boat passed through a lock, a feeder was built from just above Paddington Lock on the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The water was then carried across the Mersey in an aqueduct, which also acted as a footbridge, and followed the banks of the Mersey to arrive at Latchford Lock. It emptied into the canal just to the south of the lock. When the Black Bear Canal section was created, Twenty Steps Lock also rose from the ship canal, and so the feature was retained. Latchford Lock was usually known as Manor Lock after the construction of the ship canal, as the locks immediately above its junction with the Black Bear Canal were called Latchford Locks.&lt;ref name=wood88/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 maps, 1893 and 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Runcorn Locks Restoration Society launched its Unlock Runcorn campaign, which is dedicated to reopening the flight of locks in Runcorn's Old Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dial2donate.org/unlock-runcorn-be-part-of-it/ |title=Unlock Runcorn. Be part of it! |publisher=Dial2Donate |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society believes that the increase in passing boat trade that would come from reopening the locks has the potential to bring economical, recreational and social benefits to people within the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unlockruncorn.org/ |title=Unlock Runcorn |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
The route diagram shows the canal as it was in the 1880s, with some later additions, including the points at which the route of the Manchester Ship Canal destroyed the canal, and features such as Twenty Steps Lock, which was built to connect a section of the original canal to the ship canal.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 maps, 1881, 1907 and modern&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Former Runcorn-Latchford Canal - geograph.org.uk - 496527.jpg|thumb|left|A section of the canal in Wigg Island Park is still in water.]]
Traces of the canal still exist in [[Wigg Island]] and in [[Moore Nature Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=189.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route of the canal forms the basis of the designated "Linear Park" that runs parallel to the river Mersey at Lower Walton and is clearly visible looking west from Chester Road (A5060) whilst standing on the road bridge over the River Mersey. In the distance is the "Twelve Arches Bridge" where arch number 3 (counted south to north) passes over where the canal would have passed. The largely dried out canal basin can be traced westwards after the bridge towards Moore Nature Reserve and then Runcorn. The canal passes east under the A5060 where it joins the Manchester Ship Canal at Latchford Locks (site of the proposed Port of Warrington). Thereafter it re-emerges in Stockton Heath just past the London Road Swing Bridge (A49) where it runs north-easterly passing under Loushers Lane Bridge until eventually passing under Knutsford Road at the site of the former Black Bear Public House. The course of the canal runs a short distance then to terminate and re-join the River Mersey close to Kingsway North Bridge.

The Wigg Island nature reserve covers {{convert|57|acre|ha}} and was opened in April 2002. It is named after the Wigg Chemical Works, set up in the 1860s to extract copper from ore. The works were used to produce [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] in the [[Second World War]], and closed in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visithalton.com/displayProduct.asp?product_key=262831&amp;page_key=2&amp;channel=vhal |title=Wigg Island |publisher=Visit Halton |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the canal was operational, a regular problem was the leaching of highly acidic effluent into the canal. Remediation work to reclaim the [[Brownfield land|brownfield site]] has included the construction of a filter system which passes the water through a limestone-filled channel. This ensures that the water in the {{convert|600|yd|m|adj=on}} length of canal which crosses the site is safe and suitable for wildlife.&lt;ref name=wood88/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4063">'''Sergey Ivanovich Kovalev''' ({{lang-ru|Сергей Иванович Ковалёв}}, {{OldStyleDate|25 September|1886|13 September}} – 12 November 1960) was a Soviet scholar of [[classical antiquity]]. He was interested particularly in the [[Hellenistic period]], the [[origins of Christianity]], [[Roman history]] and ancient [[historiography]].

==Life==
Kovalev was born in the village of Kuganak, then in [[Ufa Governorate]] of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://bioslovhist.history.spbu.ru/component/fabrik/details/1/111.html |title=Ковалев Сергей Иванович |publisher=[[Saint Petersburg State University]]| language=Russian| accessdate =11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, he entered the History and Philology Department of the [[Saint Petersburg University]], before being drafted into the military in 1915. In 1922, Kovalev graduated from the Department of Social Sciences of the Saint Petersburg University. He attained the professorship and became the Head of Department of the Ancient World in the Saint Petersburg University.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He also worked in the Petersburg (then Leningrad) branch of the History Institute of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; In Greek history, Kovalev denied the concept of [[Dorian invasion]]. In 1930, Kovalev published an article on the formation of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonian state]] under Philip and Alexander the Great. In 1936, Kovalev published the first comprehensive Soviet textbook on ancient history for high school.&lt;ref name="Frolov"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sno.pro1.ru/lib/kovalev/frolov.htm |title=С. И. Ковалев и его "История Рима"|author=Э. Д. Фролов|publisher=Студенческое Научное Общество|language=Russian| accessdate =11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the editors of the three-volume Soviet book ''The History of Ancient World''. There he authored two chapters, "The rise of Macedonia and the conquest of Asia" and "The philosophy and art of Greece during its heyday".&lt;ref name="Frolov"/&gt; In 1945–48, Kovalev published his seminal work, ''The History of Rome''. In 1956–60, Kovalev was the director of the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism.

===Historicity of Jesus===
In 1956–59, Kovalev polemicized with British scholar [[Archibald Robertson (atheist)|Archibald Robertson]] about the [[historicity of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Andreev"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pstgu.ru/download/1430825026.5_andreev_73-88.pdf |title=Дискуссия об историчности Иисуса Христа в советском религиоведении|author=А. В. Андреев|work=Вестник ПСТГУ|language=Russian| date=2015| accessdate =11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polemic was spurred by the Russian translation of Robertson's publication ''The Origins of Christianity''. Kovalev, who held [[atheistic]] views, clinged to the [[Christ myth theory]]. In the foreword for the Russian translation Kovalev called Robertson's recognition of Jesus' historicity "a serious flaw" and argued to the contrary.&lt;ref name="Andreev"/&gt; Robertson replied to Kovalev in the second edition of ''The Origins of Christianity''. At the same time Kovalev acknowledged the historicity of [[John the Baptist]], [[Paul the Apostle]] and apostle James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.litmir.me/br/?b=19580&amp;p=68|title=Сын Человеческий|author=[[Alexander Men]]|publisher=Litmir.me|language=Russian| accessdate =11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11268">[[File:Fat man.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Fat Man]] was a strategic nuclear weapon dropped on the Japanese city of [[Nagasaki]] during the final stages of [[World War II]]. It was the second and last nuclear weapon to be used in [[combat]]. This nuclear strike killed an estimated 35,000-40,000 people outright, including 23,200-28,200 Japanese civilian factory workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants.]]
A '''strategic nuclear weapon''' refers to a [[nuclear weapon]] which is designed to be used on targets often in settled territory far from the [[battlefield]] as part of a [[Strategic goal (military)|strategic plan]], such as [[military base]]s, [[military]] [[command center]]s, [[arms industry|arms industries]], [[transport]]ation, [[economy|economic]], and [[energy]] [[infrastructure]], and heavily populated areas such as [[City|cities]] and [[town]]s, which often contain such targets.&lt;ref&gt;https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-Cold-War-Nuclear-Target-List-Declassified-First-Ever/&lt;/ref&gt; It is contrast to a [[tactical nuclear weapon]], which is designed for use in battle, as part of an attack with and often in close proximity to friendly [[conventional weapon|conventional]] forces possibly on contested friendly territory.

==Premise==

Strategic nuclear weapons generally have significantly larger yields, and typically starting from 100 [[kiloton]]s up to destructive yields&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.it/books?id=sd2oAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=strategic+weapon+100+kt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FQoslmw-OH&amp;sig=4BmUZXCGHelYmTjXJHSHjYyP0k4&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil_NipmYfZAhUCy6QKHZBPB8MQ6AEIYDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=strategic%20weapon%20100%20kt&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; in the low megaton range for use especially in the enemy nations interior far from friendly forces to maximize damage especially to buried hard targets like a missile silo or wide area targets like a large bomber or naval base. However, yields can overlap, and many weapons such as the variable yield [[B61 nuclear bomb]] which could be used at low power by a fighter-bomber in an interdiction strike or at high yield dropped by a strategic bomber against an enemy submarine pen.  The [[W89]] 200 kiloton (1/5Mt) warhead armed both the tactical [[UUM-125 Sea Lance|Sea Lance]] area effect anti-submarine weapon for use far out at sea and the [[strategic bomber]] launched [[AGM-131 SRAM II|SRAM II]] stand off missile designed for use in the Soviet Union's interior. Indeed, the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|strategic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] utilized weapons of between 10 and 20 kilotons, though this was because the "[[Little Boy]]" and "[[Fat Man]]" bombs were the most destructive (and indeed only) nuclear weapons available at the time. There is no precise definition of the "strategic" category, neither considering range nor [[nuclear weapon yield|yield of the nuclear weapon]].&lt;ref name=e&gt;{{cite book|title=Tactical nuclear weapons : emergent threats in an evolving security environment.|year=2003|publisher=Brassey's|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-1-57488-585-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7VOWkKMTjsC&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=Defensive%20Use%20of%20Tactical%20Nuclear%20Weapons&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1.|editor=Brian Alexander, Alistair Millar|accessdate=22 March 2011|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some weapons could be tactical or strategic at the same time, depending only on the potential enemy. For example India nuclear missile with 500 km range is tactical when evaluated by Russian side, but understandably would be considered strategic if evaluated by Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt; The yield of tactical nuclear weapons is generally lower than that of strategic nuclear weapons, but larger ones are still very powerful, and some variable-yield warheads serve in both roles, Modern tactical nuclear warheads have yields up to the tens of kilotons, or potentially hundreds, several times that of the weapons used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Strategic thinking under the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] and [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]] was that of [[massive retaliation]] in the face of the [[Soviet Union]]'s nuclear arsenal during this period when the many of the most destructive deployed thermonuclear weapons were developed by both superpowers, every bit of destructive power which could be delivered to the enemy's interior was considered advantageous in maintaining deterrence and would become the basis of the US strategic arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/short-history/eisenhower&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Flexible response]] was a [[defense (military)|defense]] [[strategy]] first implemented by [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961 to address the Kennedy administration's skepticism of the policy of Massive Retaliation in the face of strike options limited to total war during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/report/1986/LLE.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This along with cost, increasingly accurate targeting, multiple warheads per delivery vehicle, and a desire for greater flexibility in targeting especially with respect to increasing sensitivity to [[collateral damage]] in some scenarios began the trend to reducing individual warhead yields in strategic weapon systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://issues.org/20-3/schneider/&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic missiles and bombers are assigned preplanned targets including enemy airfields, radars, and surface to air defenses; but this strategic mission was to eliminate the enemy nation's national defenses to allow following strategic bombers and missiles to more realistically penetrate and threaten in force the enemy nation's strategic forces, command, population, and economy rather than purely targeting military assets in near real time using tactical weapons with range and yield optimized for this type of time sensitive attack mission often in close proximity to friendly forces.&lt;ref&gt;https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-Cold-War-Nuclear-Target-List-Declassified-First-Ever/&lt;/ref&gt;

Early ICBMs had an unfavorable [[circular error probable]] (CEP); meaning the strategic missiles, and in some conditions bombers; had low targeting accuracy. Additionally much early cold war strategic asset construction was above ground soft targets or minimally hardened such as airfields, pre-nuclear command and control installations, defensive infrastructure, even ICBM bases. When every missile carried only one poorly guided warhead designing systems with massive warhead yields in order to cause a huge damage footprint, with the possibility of potentially destroying several nearby soft targets of opportunity, while also increasing the likelihood that the primary target was within the overlap of CEP and destruction circle the highest possible yield warhead for the missile was considered an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/disarmament/publications/studyseries/en/SS-1.pdf p-29&lt;/ref&gt;  The enemy being targeted a continent away there was a low ratio of side effects to friendly areas when contrasted to potential damage to enemy assets. As navigation technology improved accuracy or CEP and many missiles and nearly all bombers were equipped with multiple nuclear warheads the trend was to reduce warhead yield both for weight as well as to give more flexibility in targeting with respect to collateral damage, target hardening also created a situation where even a very large warhead with excellent targeting would still only destroy one target gaining no advantage to its large weight and expense vs several smaller [[MIRV]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/disarmament/publications/studyseries/en/SS-1.pdf p-9&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature of strategic nuclear weapons, especially in the transcontinental nature of the U.S.-USSR cold war with continent spanning superpower enemies that are oceans apart, is the greater range of their delivery apparatus (e.g. ICBMs), giving them the ability to threaten the enemy's [[command and control]] structure and national infrastructure, even though they are based many thousands of miles away in friendly territory. [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s with nuclear warheads are the primary strategic nuclear weapons, while short-range missiles are tactical. In addition, while tactical weapons are designed to meet battlefield objectives without destroying nearby friendly forces, one main purpose of strategic weapons is in the deterrence role, under the theory of [[mutually assured destruction]]. In the case of two small bordering nations, a strategic weapon could have a quite short range and still be designed or intended for strategic targeting.  Specifically on the Korean peninsula with a nuclear armed North Korea facing off against a [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]] compliant South Korea there have been calls to request a return US owned short range low yield nuclear weapons, nomenclatured as tactical by the US military, to provide a local strategic deterrent to the North's growing domestically produced nuclear arsenal and delivery systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://thediplomat.com/2013/03/not-a-good-idea-american-nukes-in-south-korea/&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Cold War, the tactical nuclear weapon stockpiles of NATO and Russia were greatly reduced. Highly accurate strategic missiles like the Trident II can also be used in substrategic, tactical strikes.

==De-escalation Strikes==
According to several reports including by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] and [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] quote Russian sources that as a result of the effectiveness and acceptability of USAF use of precision munitions with little collateral damage in the [[Kosovo conflict]] in what amounted to strategic destruction once only possible with nuclear weapons or massive bombing against fellow Slavic Serbians.  [[Vladimir Putin]], then Russian defense minister formulated a concept of using both tactical and strategic nuclear threats and strikes to de-escalate or cause an enemy to disengage from a conventional conflict threatening what Russia considered a strategic interest.  This concept was formalized when Putin took power in Russia in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://carnegieendowment.org/2016/02/26/role-of-nuclear-weapons-in-u.s.-russian-relationship-pub-62901&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russia's Nonstrategic Nuclear Weapons, by Dr. Jacob W. Kipp, Foreign Military Studies Office, Fort Leavenworth; published in Military Review May-June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, UDIK has organized a large number of commemorations to the victims of past war in the former Yugoslavia (1991-2001). UDIK calls this commemorations the [[Living monument]]. The ceremonies were organized in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Brčko, Zenica, Višegrad, Foča), [[Croatia]] (Zagreb, Vukovar) and [[Serbia]] (Belgrade, Prijepolje).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://informativa.ba/2015/10/25/udik-odao-pocast-zrtvama-stradalim-na-kazanima-vazno-je-sjecati-se|title= UDIK odao počast žrtvama stradalim na Kazanima: Važno je sjećati se|publisher= informativa.ba|date=2015-10-25 |accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.ba/new/vijest.php?id=12159|title= Sjećanje na dan kada je ubijena tuzlanska mladost|publisher= nap.ba|date=2015-05-25 |accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brcko.tv/v3/2016/05/31/udik-obiljezio-dan-bijelih-traka-u-brckom/|title= UDIK u Brčkom obilježio Dan bijelih traka|publisher= brcko.tv|date=2016-05-30 |accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thanks to this initiative, for the first time, many commemorations were organized. These commemorations were related to crimes against civilian victims of [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]].

The activities that got the most attention were the commemoration of the non-Bosniak victims of the crimes committed in Sarajevo's Kazani and commemorations of Serbian victims of the crimes in [[Operation Storm]] organized in Sarajevo and Zagreb. 

In May 2015, Federal Ministry of Interior of the Bosnia and Herzegovina banned the Sarajevo's commemoration of Serbian victims of the crimes committed in [[Operation Storm]]. In May 2016 the same commemoration was banned by Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Croatia, but in the end it was held in Zagreb with high police security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lat.rtrs.tv/vijesti/vijest.php?id=214620|title= Tri osobe povrijeđene na protestu protiv veličanja Oluje u Zagrebu|publisher=rtrs.tv|date=22 August 2016|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of bias ===
The criticism generally falls into the category of alleged bias, often in response to  UDIK's commemorations to the Yugoslav wars victims. Bias allegations include the organization's insistence on war crimes on Serbs or Croats which was committed by the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|ARBiH]]. Bosniak right-wing media in Bosnia think that certain crimes against Serbs or Croats which was committed by the ARBiH were legitimate military targets against the aggressor while UDIK believes that Bosniaks must take responsibility for the killings of civilians in those crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saff.ba/kazani-su-povod-bosnjacke-pobjede/|title=Kazani su povod bošnjačke pobjede|publisher=saff.ba|date=22 August 2016|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novihorizonti.ba/dva-srbina-iz-kravice-kao-8372-zrtve-iz-srebrenice/|title=Dva Srbina iz Kravice kao 8732 žrtve iz Srebrenice|publisher=novihorizonti.ba|date=22 August 2016|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opsadasarajeva.blogspot.ba/2016/04/zasto-se-udik-nije-sjetio-zrtava-ahmica.html|title=Zašto se UDIK nije sjetio žrtava Ahmića i Trusine na današnji dan?|publisher=opsadasarajeva.blogspot.ba|date=22 August 2016|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the other hand, Serbian nationalists believe that the UDIK is [[George Soros|Soros]]-funded advocacy group who organizes commemorations not to express sympathy, but rather to gather political points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkanspost.com/article/662/marking-23th-anniversary-srebrenica-massacre-lessons-not-learned|title=Marking 23th Anniversary of Srebrenica Massacre: Lessons still not learned|publisher=balkanpost.com|date=22 August 2016|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Researches==
===Central register of memorials of the Yugoslav wars (1991–2001)===
In December 2015, UDIK team began to research and compile a register of memorials for victims of the [[Yugoslav wars]] (1991-2001) including Bosniaks, Croats, Serbs and Others who were killed or disappeared during the armed conflicts in Yugoslavia (1991–2001) with the aim of creating the Central register of memorials on the territory of the former [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRJ) that would serve to curb attempts at historical revisionism and manipulative use of the numbers of victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novi.ba/clanak/107910/udik-u-bih-izgradeno-je-vise-od-2-100-spomenika-koji-su-posveceni-borcima-i-civilima|title=UDIK: U BiH izgrađeno je više od 2.100 spomenika koji su posvećeni borcima i civilima - novi.ba|publisher=novi.ba|date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The register is based on analysis of documents from municipalities, cities, museums, tourist organizations, [[Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], ministries of veterans including newspaper reports from the period, internet, publications, associations of veterans and families of the dead, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkans.aljazeera.net/vijesti/u-bih-nakon-rata-podignuto-2500-spomenika|title=U BiH nakon rata podignuto 2500 spomenika – Al-Jazeera Balkans|publisher= balkans.aljazeera.net|date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vijesti.ba//clanak/338512/u-sarajevu-predstavljanje-centralne-evidencije-spomenika-zrtvama-u-bih|title=U Sarajevu predstavljanje Centralne evidencije spoemenika u BiH - vijesti.ba|publisher= vijesti.ba|date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, UDIK published the first results of the Central rеgister of memorials for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], listing more than 2.100 memorials to the victims of [[Bosnian War]] (1992-1995). Next year (2017), UDIK also published more than 1.200 memorials built in [[Croatia]] dedicated to the victims of [[Croatian War of Independence|Homeland War]] (1991-1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fokus.ba/vijesti/bih/cudic-u-rs-ima-50-posto-manje-spomen-obiljezja-nego-u-fbih/|title= Ćudić:U RS ima 50 posto manje spomen obilježja nego u FBiH|publisher= fokus.ba|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/udik-spomenici-uglavnom-ukazuju-na-patnju-i-stradanje-samo-jednog-naroda/171122115|title= Spomenici uglavnom ukazuju na patnju i stradanje samo jednog naroda|publisher=klix.ba|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The register also includes examples of the controversial memorials that were built after 1991 in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, and which glorify fascism and hatred among the people of the former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fokus.ba/vijesti/bih/cudic-u-rs-ima-50-posto-manje-spomen-obiljezja-nego-u-fbih/|title= Ćudić:U RS ima 50 posto manje spomen obilježja nego u FBiH|publisher= fokus.ba|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/udik-spomenici-uglavnom-ukazuju-na-patnju-i-stradanje-samo-jednog-naroda/171122115|title= Spomenici uglavnom ukazuju na patnju i stradanje samo jednog naroda|publisher=klix.ba|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central register of memorials of the Yugoslav wars (1991–2001)  is still the only register of memorials to victims of the Yugoslav wars on the territory of the countries of the former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkans.aljazeera.net/vijesti/u-bih-nakon-rata-podignuto-2500-spomenika|title=U BiH nakon rata podignuto 2500 spomenika – Al-Jazeera Balkans|publisher= balkans.aljazeera.net|date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications about war crimes===
UDIK every year publishes documents about war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. UDIK has published extensively on subjects such as war crimes, massacres and human rights violations from 1992 to 1995 in [[Foča massacres|Foča]], [[Višegrad massacres|Višegrad]], Sarajevo's Grbavica, [[Trusina killings|Trusina]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dnevni-list.ba/predstavljena-knjiga-o-ratnom-zlocinu-u-trusini/|title=Predstavljena knjiga o ratnom zločinu u Trusini|publisher=dnevni-list.ba|date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vijesti.ba//clanak/400789/promovirana-publikacija-ratni-zlocini-na-grbavici-presude|title=Promovirana publikacije: Ratni zločini na Grbavici-presude|publisher=vijesti.ba|date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UDIK's publications about war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina are available at the [[Library of Congress]] in [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchArg=Udruz%CC%8Cenje+za+drus%CC%8Ctvena+istraz%CC%8Civanja+i+komunikacije&amp;searchCode=GKEY%5E*&amp;searchType=0&amp;recCount=25|title=LC Online Catalog - Library of Congress|publisher=catalog.loc.gov|date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperations==
In 2015, UDIK co-operated with the [[International Commission on Missing Persons|ICMP]] on the occasion of marking the International Day of the Disappeared, a commemoration designed to raise public awareness about the issue of missing persons from armed conflict and human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.icmp.int/?story=international-day-of-the-disappeared-2015 |title=International Day of the Disappeared 2015|publisher=icmp.int|date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, UDIK co-operated with the [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] in the Dealing with the Past program at the True Stories Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sff.ba/en/page/true-stories-market-2016|title=True Stories Market - Sarajevo Film Festival|publisher=sff.ba|date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Costume}}
Some authors have argued that '''use of costume in Athenian tragedy''' was standardized for the [[genre]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to have consisted of a full-length or short tunic, a cloak and soft leather boots, and may have been derived from the robes of [[Dionysos|Dionysian]] priests or invented by [[Aeschylus]]. Brockett, however, disputes this, arguing that the evidence we have is based on archaeological remains, some few references in the texts, and the writings of later authors. As far as the vase paintings are concerned, most of these are dated later than the 5th Century BCE and their relationship with theatrical practice is unclear. One of the earliest examples is a red-figure vase painting c. 500-490 BCE that shows a tragic [[Greek chorus|chorus]] invoking a ghost, on a crater (bowl) in the Antikenmuseum in Basle.&lt;ref name="The Ancient Theatre, E. Simon"&gt;Simon, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragic actors were certainly heavily disguised. This had a religious purpose, for the actor was supposed to give up his identity in order to let another speak and act through him. Indeed, the dramas were performed in honour of [[Dionysus]], the God of Ecstasy, which means “standing outside oneself”.&lt;ref name="The Ancient Theatre, E. Simon"/&gt; Actors therefore had to renounce their individuality. The actors thought that the mask itself contained the character and are said to have prayed before putting on their masks. The costume was probably an elaborately-decorated version of everyday clothing worn in the 5th Century BCE. The garments included:

* ''[[chiton (costume)|chiton]]'' (robe or tunic)
* ''chlaina'' (overgarment)
* ''[[chlamys]]'' (short cloak)
* [[buskin|''kothurnus'']] (short lace-up boots)
* ''[[himation]]'' (overgarment)
* ''[[peplos]]'' (cloak).&lt;ref&gt;Laver&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''chiton'' worn by the actors differed from that worn in everyday life because it incorporated sleeves, which were coloured and patterned. The sleeves may in fact have been part of an undergarment. Long white sleeves were worn by the (male) actors for female roles, and indeed, in vase paintings females are usually painted with lighter skin.

The costumes worn for the performances of ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', for example, were [[Iconography|iconographic]], and symbolised the opposition of light and dark.&lt;ref&gt;Wiles, 1999, p159.&lt;/ref&gt; In the play, life is evoked as the act of seeing the sun. Death – the son of Night in [[Greek mythology]] - wears a black peplos and black wings. [[Apollo]] wears white, representing the sun. Admetus contrasts the black of the funeral procession with the white of the funeral procession. The corpse of Alcestis is dressed as a bride, in accordance with Greek tradition and [[Herakles]] wears a bearskin and carries a club.

The costumes worn gave the audience an immediate sense of character-type, gender, age, social status and class.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, 1994, p65 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of [[Aeschylus]], the boots or [[buskin]]s worn by the actors were flat. The actors had the same “status” as the [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. In the 3rd Century BCE, the actors were raised to the status of heroes and “platform” soles began to be used, together with a head-dress called an ''onkos''. The raised soles may have induced a stylised way of walking, suited to the rhythm of tragic verse, and the ''onkos'' made the actors taller, enhancing visibility. Their bodies were padded so that they did not look too slim.&lt;ref name="Laver"&gt;Laver.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors believe that this happened later than the 3rd Century BCE. It is also thought that the “teetering gait” is a misapprehension.&lt;ref&gt;McLeish.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mask]]s were the most striking feature of the costume worn by the Athenian actors. Facial expression was lost anyway due to the huge size of the [[Theatre of Dionysus|Greek theatres]], but the masks were also a means of blotting out expression, so visual meaning was expressed by the entire body. The actors were seen as silhouettes, or integral bodies, rather than faces. The masks themselves were made of stiffened linen, thin clay, cork or wood, and covered the whole head and had hair.

Attempts have been made in modern times to investigate the use of masks in Athenian tragedy through [[practice research]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Walton, 2007, p. 247 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These explorations conclude that masks may lead to a more demonstrative style of acting, with declamatory delivery of the lines substituted for intimacy. They also found that the mask could impede the projection of sound. The Greeks are said to have overcome this in various ways. Initially, the mouth apertures were small, but later this became a “wide-open” mouth. Some authors believe that the mouth was shaped like a “mouth-trumpet” and had an amplifying effect.&lt;ref&gt;Simon.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, the use of a mask covering the whole produces an enhanced resonating effect, which serves dramatic delivery.

Performances therefore had to be more physical. Peter Arnott states that the Greeks thought good acting and a good voice were synonymous. This was achieved through athletic training, voice exercises and diet.

Experiments have shown that unaccustomed actors suffer disorientation and restriction when masked. The Greeks countered this through a vocabulary of gesture known as ''cheironomia'' (gesticulation). [[Aristotle]] says that in his day excessive gestures were used – leading to overacting – compared with the older tradition.

Masks can also be used as a dramatic tool, e.g. lowering the masks shows reflection, raising the mask shows a challenge or superiority. The Greeks called these physical stances ''schemata'' (forms).

Silent masks were used to great effect, particularly on child actors, expressing powerlessness, bewilderment, vulnerability, etc.

The use of masks enabled the three speaking actors to portray up to eight or nine characters, through multiple role-playing. The same character could therefore be played by different actors, and transitions within a character would be portrayed by the use of different masks.

The wide variety of masks used is attested by [[Julius Pollux|Pollux]], a rhetorician writing in 2nd Century CE, in his ''[[Onomastikon]]''.&lt;ref name="Laver"/&gt; He lists 30 different male masks (old age with white or grey hair, the tyrant with thick black hair, a fair, pale masks indicating sorrow or sickness, a boastful soldier, a rustic, servants, a cook, etc.) and 17 female masks (fat and thin old women, two matrons, one virgin, a bawd, a mistress, three courtesans, a lady’s maid, etc.).

The '''Victoria History of the Counties of England''', commonly known as the '''Victoria County History''' or the '''VCH''', is an English history project which began in 1899 and was dedicated to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the [[historic counties of England]]. In 2012 the project was rededicated to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in celebration of her Diamond Jubilee year.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beckett|first1=John |first2=Matthew |last2=Bristow |first3=Elizabeth |last3=Williamson |title=The Victoria County History 1899-2012: a Diamond Jubilee celebration|date=2013|publisher=University of London, Institute of Historical Research|location=London|isbn=9781905165919|edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} Since 1933 the project has been coordinated by the [[Institute of Historical Research]] in the [[University of London]].

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VCH counties.JPG|right|thumb|Map showing the state of completion of the VCH across England, c.2006]] --&gt;

The history of the VCH falls into three main phases, defined by different funding regimes: an early phase, 1899–1914, when the project was conceived as a commercial enterprise, and progress was rapid; a second more desultory phase, 1914–1947, when relatively little progress was made; and the third phase beginning in 1947, when, under the auspices of the Institute of Historical Research, a high academic standard was set, and progress has been slow but reasonably steady.&lt;ref name="Lewis1989"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Christopher |date=1989 |chapter=The Victoria County History |title=Particular Places: an introduction to English local history |location=London |publisher=British Library |isbn=0712301755}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54–6}} These phases have also been characterised by changing attitudes towards the proper scope of [[English local history]]. The early volumes were planned on the model of traditional [[English county histories]], with a strong emphasis on [[manor]]ial descents, the [[advowson]]s of parish churches, and the local [[landed gentry]]: a prospectus of c. 1904 stated that "there is ''no Englishman'' to whom [the VCH] does not in some one or other of its features make a direct appeal".&lt;ref name="Lewis1989" /&gt;{{rp|55}} More recent volumes – especially those published since the 1950s – have been more wide-ranging in their approach, and have included systematic coverage of [[Social history|social]] and [[economic history]], [[industrial history]], [[Historical demography|population history]], [[History of education|educational history]], [[landscape history]], [[Nonconformist|religious nonconformity]], and so on: individual parish histories have consequently grown considerably in length and complexity.

From 1902 the joint general editors were H. Arthur Doubleday and [[William Page (historian)|William Page]]. Doubleday resigned (in acrimonious circumstances) in 1904,&lt;ref name="Powell2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=W. Raymond |year=2001 |title=John Horace Round: Historian and Gentleman of Essex |place=Chelmsford |publisher=Essex Record Office |isbn=1-898529-19-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148–52}} leaving Page as sole general editor until his death in 1934. In 1932 Page bought the rights to the ailing project for a nominal sum, donating it to the Institute of Historical Research the following year.&lt;ref name=MakingHistory&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=Chris |title=William Page (1861–1934), general editor of the Victoria County History 1902–34 |work=[[Institute of Historical Research|Making History]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/william_page.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page was succeeded as general editor by [[Louis Francis Salzman|L.F. Salzman]], who remained in post until 1949.&lt;ref name=MakingHistory/&gt; The early volumes depended heavily on the efforts of a large number of young research workers, mostly female, fresh from degree courses at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of London|London]] or the [[Universities in Scotland|Scottish universities]], for whom other employment opportunities were limited: the VCH of this period has been described as "a history for gentlemen largely researched by ladies".&lt;ref name="Lewis1989" /&gt;{{rp|54}}

From 1909 until 1931 [[Frederick Smith, 2nd Viscount Hambleden|Frederick Smith]], later 2nd [[Viscount Hambleden]], was the VCH's major sponsor.&lt;ref name=MakingHistory/&gt; In February 2005 the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] awarded the VCH £3,374,000 to fund the [[England's Past for Everyone]] project, which ran from September that year until February 2010.&lt;ref name=EPE&gt;{{cite web|title=England's Past for Everyone|url=http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/publications-projects/epe|website=Victoria County History|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress==
[[File:VCH counties.svg|thumb|250px|VCH progress by county]]
The first VCH volume was published in 1901, and publication continued slowly throughout the 20th century, although in some counties it has come to a halt, especially during the [[First World War]]&lt;ref name=MakingHistory/&gt; and again in the 1970s. Some inactive counties have recently been reactivated.

There are now more than 230 VCH volumes, with around three new volumes published per year. Each is published with a red cover, and they are therefore sometimes known as "the big red books". When the Institute of Historical Research published a short history of the project to mark the 75th anniversary of taking it over, it was titled ''The Little Big Red Book''.&lt;ref name="Little Big Red Book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/about/75-years-ihr |title=75 years at the IHR |website=Victoria County History | access-date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special edition Jubilee book was published in 2012, ''A Diamond Jubilee Celebration 1899-2012.''&lt;ref name="Jubilee" /&gt;

A map showing the publication status appears on the VCH website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website=Victoria County History|title=VCH Counties|url=http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/counties|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and content of the county histories==
From its inception, responsibility for writing the volumes was delegated to local editors for each individual county. The county editors traditionally worked under the direction of a general editor, following a uniform format and style.

In general, the histories begin with one or more volumes of general studies of the county as a whole, including major themes, such as religious history, agriculture, industries, population (with summary tables of decennial census totals 1801–1901), and an introduction to and translation of the relevant section of [[Domesday Book]].&lt;ref name="Tiller"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tiller|first=Kate|title=English local history: an introduction|publisher=Sutton Publishing|location=Stroud |year=1992 |isbn=0-86299-958-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These volumes are followed by others consisting of detailed historical surveys of each [[Hundred (division)|Hundred]], [[Wapentake]] (discussed in separate [[Riding (country subdivision)]] volumes) and [[Ward (country subdivision)]], parish by parish. At first, [[Civil parishes in England#Ancient origins|ancient ecclesiastical parishes]] formed the unit of investigation, but "since the mid-1950s the VCH parish is the [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]], the modern successor of the ancient parishes or of townships within them. Large towns are dealt with as a whole, including, since the 1960s, built-up areas of adjoining, formerly rural parishes.&lt;ref name="Tiller" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

Under the original plan, each county, in addition to its general and topographical volumes, was to have a genealogical volume containing the [[Pedigree chart|pedigrees]] of [[Landed gentry|county families]]. Genealogical volumes were published in a large [[folio]] format for [[Northamptonshire]] (1906) and [[Hertfordshire]] (1907), but the research costs were found to be excessive, and this side of the project was discontinued.&lt;ref name="Powell2001" /&gt;{{rp|156–57}}

A '''victory column'''—or '''monumental column''' or '''triumphal column'''—is a [[monument]] in the form of a [[column]], erected in memory of a victorious [[battle]], [[war]], or [[revolution]]. The column typically stands on a base and is crowned with a victory [[symbol]], such as a [[statue]]. The statue may represent the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]; in [[Germany]], the female embodiment of the nation, [[Germania (personification)|Germania]]; in the [[United States]] either female embodiment of the nation [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] or [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]]; in the [[United Kingdom]], the female embodiment [[Britannia]]; an [[eagle]]; or a war hero.
